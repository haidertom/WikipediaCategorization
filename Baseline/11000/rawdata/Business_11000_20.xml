      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16516">'''Ag-gag''' is a term used to describe a class of anti-[[whistleblower]] laws that apply within the [[agriculture]] industry. Popularized by [[Mark Bittman]] in an April 2011 ''[[New York Times]]'' column (but used long before then by advocates), the term "ag-gag" typically refers to state laws that forbid the act of undercover filming or photography of activity on [[farm]]s without the consent of their owner—particularly targeting whistleblowers of [[animal rights]] abuses at these facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bittman, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/who-protects-the-animals/ Who Protects the Animals?], ''New York Times'', April 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These laws originated in the [[United States]], but have also begun to appear elsewhere, such as in [[Australia]]. Some of these laws, such as the failed proposal in [[#Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], have a wider scope and could be used to criminalize actions by activists in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Chamberlain, [http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/05/09-10 Fracking Activists Could Face Felony Charges as "Ag-Gag" Laws Spread], ''Common Dreams'', May 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of ag-gag laws have argued that they serve to protect the agriculture industry from the negative repercussions of exposés by whistleblowers. The proliferation of ag-gag laws has been criticized by various groups, arguing that the laws are intended primarily to censor animal rights abuses by the agriculture industry from the public, create a [[chilling effect]] in reporting these violations, and violate the right to [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt McGrath, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22098224 US animal activist laws 'may impact globally'], ''BBC News'', 12 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ag-gag laws emerged in the early 1990s in response to underground activists with the [[Animal Liberation Front]] movement. In Kansas, Montana and North Dakota, state legislators made it a crime to take pictures or shoot video in an animal facility without the consent of the facility's owner.&lt;ref name=Ag-gag-laws&gt;{{cite web|title="Ag-Gag" Laws: Evolution, Resurgence, and Public Health Implications|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1048291118808788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the conservative organization [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) drafted the "Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act", a model law for distribution to lobbyists and state lawmakers. The model law proposed to prohibit "entering an animal or research facility to take pictures by photograph, video camera, or other means with the intent to commit criminal activities or defame the facility or its owner". It also created a "terrorist registry" for those convicted under the law.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Leighton Akio (July 31, 2013). [http://www.thenation.com/article/175506/charged-crime-filming-slaughterhouse#ixzz2agibYZ00 "Charged With the Crime of Filming a Slaughterhouse"]. ''[[The Nation]]''. Retrieved August 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The whistleblower advocacy project [[Food Integrity Campaign]] (FIC), a [[Advocacy|campaign]] of the non-profit organization the [[Government Accountability Project]] calls undercover video of livestock facilities by whistleblowers essential:

{{quote|When it comes to bringing horrific truths to the public eye, undercover footage and images are often an effective outlet for whistleblowers who otherwise risk retaliation when speaking up. Going through "proper channels" to report abuse often results in supervisors intimidating those employees who have made complaints to keep quiet. Statements by Ag Gag bill sponsors imply that "real" whistleblowers have a safe and effectual means for speaking up, when history shows that's often not the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodwhistleblower.org/the-lifecycle-of-food/life-on-the-farm/ag-gag "Ag Gag: Safeguarding Industry Secrets by Punishing the Messenger"], Food Integrity Campaign, Retrieved June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ag-gag laws have also drawn criticism on constitutional grounds by eminent legal scholars such as [[Erwin Chemerinsky]], as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] for restricting unpopular forms of speech.&lt;ref name="AP Ag-Gag Lawsuit"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/utah-ag-gag_n_3636036.html Animal Welfare Activists File Lawsuit To Overturn Utah 'Ag Gag' Law], ''Associated Press'', July 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, a U.S. district court ruled such a law passed by the state of Idaho to be unconstitutional as a violation of the First Amendment; Judge [[B. Lynn Winmill]] stated that "Although the State may not agree with the message certain groups seek to convey about Idaho's agricultural production facilities, such as releasing secretly recorded videos of animal abuse to the Internet and calling for boycotts, it cannot deny such groups equal protection of the laws in their exercise of their right to free speech."&lt;ref name=npr-unconstitutional/&gt;

==Laws==

===United States===

====Idaho====
In February 2014, Idaho Governor [[Butch Otter]] signed Idaho's "ag-gag" bill, the "Agricultural Security Act", into law, which imposed fines and jail time on activists who secretly film abuse on Idaho's commercial farms. It came about as the result of the animal rights organization [[Mercy for Animals]] releasing a video of animal abuse by workers on Bettencourt Dairy farms.&lt;ref name=npr-unconstitutional/&gt;

On August 3, 2015, the Agricultural Security Act was struck down as unconstitutional by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho]] as a violation of the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=npr-unconstitutional&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Strikes Down Idaho 'Ag-Gag' Law, Raising Questions For Other States|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/04/429345939/idaho-strikes-down-ag-gag-law-raising-questions-for-other-states|accessdate=4 August 2015|work=NPR|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=acluidaho-aggag&gt;{{cite web|title=Idaho "Ag-Gag" Law Ruled Unconstitutional in Federal Court|url=https://acluidaho.org/idaho-ag-gag-law-ruled-unconstitutional-in-federal-court/|website=ACLU Idaho|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was appealed, and parts of Idaho’s law were struck down by the Ninth Circuit Court on First Amendment grounds in early 2018.&lt;ref name=Ag-gag-laws&gt;{{cite web|title="Ag-Gag" Laws: Evolution, Resurgence, and Public Health Implications|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1048291118808788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In February 2015, Western Australia Senator [[Chris Back]] introduced [http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/s994_first-senate/toc_pdf/1500520.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22legislation/bills/s994_first-senate/0000%22 Criminal Code Amendment (Animal Protection) Bill 2015] to the [[Australian Senate]] which would add a new section creating an offense if a person created a "record" of animal abuse and then failed to hand it in within 5 days to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/senator-backs-activist-filming-crackdown/story-fn3dxiwe-1227224658703|title=Senator backs activist filming crackdown|date=18 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/australias-new-bill-to-protect-animals-will-do-anything-but-38103|title=Australia's new bill to protect animals will do anything but|first=Jed|last=Goodfellow|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Proponents of the laws note that public documentation of [[Intensive animal farming|factory farming]] practices will result in negative consequences for the industry. "State Sen. David Hinkins (R), who sponsored Utah's law, said it was aimed at the 'vegetarian people who are trying to kill the animal industry.'" &lt;ref name="DN price"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bollard|first=Lewis|title=The terrible price of ag-gag laws|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/terrible-price-ag-gag-laws-article-1.1346292|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When investigators publicize documentation of [[factory farms]], the company generally loses business.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn T. Tonsor and Nicole J. Olynk, 
[http://www.agmanager.info/livestock/marketing/animalwelfare/MF2951.pdf U.S. Meat Demand: The Influence of Animal Welfare Media Coverage], Kansas State University, September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 2007, an undercover investigator from [[The Humane Society of the United States]] visited the Hallmark/Westland slaughterhouse in Chino, California and filmed downed cows, too sick to stand up, being "dragged by chains and pushed by forklifts to the kill floor". A large amount of the meat from this slaughterhouse had been consumed through the [[National School Lunch Program]], and the footage compelled "the U.S. Department of Agriculture to announce what was at the time the largest meat recall in U.S. history".&lt;ref name="DN price" /&gt; Similarly, a [[Mercy for Animals]] investigation at Sparboe Farms resulted in McDonald's, Target, Sam's Club, and Supervalu all dropping Sparboe as an egg supplier. The investigation revealed cages full of dead hens rotting alongside living hens who were still laying eggs for human consumption. The investigator documented standard practices such as painful debeaking without painkillers and tossing live birds into plastic bags to suffocate, along with other behaviour deemed "sadistic" and "malicious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undercover Investigations: Exposing Animal Abuse|url=http://www.mercyforanimals.org/investigations.aspx|publisher=Mercy for Animals|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC Sparboe"&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's, Target Dump Egg Supplier After Investigation|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/mcdonalds-dumps-mcmuffin-egg-factory-health-concerns/story?id=14976054#.UbTjNvbTUjV|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=ABC News|author=Galli, Cynthia|author2=Hill, Angela|author3=Momtaz, Rym}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
Fifty-nine groups, including a wide variety of welfare, civil liberties, environmental, food safety and First Amendment organizations have publicly stated opposition to ag-gag laws. Some of these groups include the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] (ALDF), [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), [[Amnesty International USA]], [[Farm Sanctuary]], [[Food and Water Watch]], [[Food Chain Workers Alliance]], [[Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association]], [[International Labor Rights Forum]], [[National Consumers League]], and [[United Farm Workers]], among many others. The statement of opposition explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt; These bills represent a wholesale assault on many fundamental values shared by all people across the United States. Not only would these bills perpetuate animal abuse on industrial farms, they would also threaten workers' rights, consumer health and safety, law enforcement investigations and the freedom of journalists, employees and the public at large to share information about something as fundamental as our food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Opposition to Proposed "Ag-Gag" Laws from Broad Spectrum of Interest Groups|url=http://www.aspca.org/Fight-Animal-Cruelty/Advocacy-Center/ag-gag/ag-gag-statement-of-opposition|accessdate=
June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Individuals and groups such as the ones listed above are concerned that the bills are written to hide welfare and safety violations in the animal agriculture industry from the public view. While laws aimed at restricting documentation or employee applications directly restrict documentation, the third type of law (e.g. [[Missouri]]'s) is said to be intended to promote the rapid prosecution of any business displaying such practices. However, critics of the bills contend that when all material must be turned over to authorities in such a short amount of time (generally within twenty-four hours), establishments can easily cover up or change their practices or fire the employee before further documentation can occur, making a thorough investigation of any farm virtually impossible.

==Legal challenges==
On July 22, 2013, the ALDF, PETA ([[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]) and others filed a lawsuit challenging Utah's ag-gag law on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref name="SLCT Ag-Gag"&gt;Brooke Adams, [http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56626204-78/law-animal-utah-lawsuit.html.csp Animals rights activists say Utah ag gag law unconstitutional], ''Salt Lake City Tribune'', July 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the ALDF and PETA filed a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of "ag gag" laws under the [[First Amendment]]. Utah's law makes it illegal to obtain access to an agricultural operation under false pretenses, such as providing inaccurate information on a job application, which is one of the ways that investigative reporters document violations and abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/cases-campaigns/features/taking-ag-gag-to-court/|title=Taking Ag-Gag to Court - Animal Legal Defense Fund|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, a coalition of organizations dedicated to civil liberties, animal protection, food safety, labor rights, and the environment, along with journalists, filed a federal lawsuit to overturn Idaho's newly passed "ag gag" statute, signed into law by Idaho governor C.L. "Butch" Otter on February 28. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of Idaho's ag gag law (Idaho Code sec. 18-7042), and was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho by national nonprofits [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] (ALDF), [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho (ACLU), and the Center for Food Safety (CFS). Idaho is the seventh state to pass an ag gag law, and the first to do so since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/press-room/press-releases/coalition-of-civil-liberties-animal-consumer-groups-head-to-court-over-controversial-idaho-ag-gag-law/Coalition|title=Coalition Calls for a Moratorium on Federal Loans for Chicken CAFOs in Arkansas Pending Careful Environmental Review - Animal Legal Defense Fund|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, 2015, Idaho's law was declared unconstitutional by a Federal Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-idahos-anti-dairy-spying-law-unconstitutional-32861512|title=U.S. News - National News|first=ABC|last=News|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Utah's law was declared unconstitutional in July, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/08/536186914/judge-overturns-utahs-ag-gag-ban-on-undercover-filming-at-farms Judge Overturns Utah's 'Ag-Gag' Ban On Undercover Filming At Farms]&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Andreas Maria Maximilian Freiherr von Mauchenheim genannt Bechtolsheim''' (born 30 September 1955&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diereichsten.de/index.php/alle-vorhandenen-beitraege/8-artikel-die-reichsten/13-andreas-maria-maximilian-freiherr-von-mauchenheim-vermoegen-und-biografie List of richest Germans] diereichsten.de; accessed 30 June 2017.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a German electrical engineer, entrepreneur, investor, and self-made billionaire. He co-founded [[Sun Microsystems]] in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. He later became an investor, most notable for providing Sergey Brin and Larry Page with their first round of funding, a $100,000 investment in 1998 before the two had even incorporated their company, [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google#/entity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404135608/https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His net worth reached $7 billion in September 2018.&lt;ref name=Forbes2013/&gt;

==Early life==
Bechtolsheim was born at [[Ammersee|Hängeberg am Ammersee, Bavaria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhnTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=H%C3%A4ngeberg+am+Ammersee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qok9k7hDxT&amp;sig=Buku8z2O6Prz6f2tF3MCu7tNqKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihiJKlvvHYAhXRvVMKHc9ED0QQ6AEIaDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=H%C3%A4ngeberg+am+Ammersee&amp;f=false|title=Deutschland digital: Unsere Antwort auf das Silicon Valley|first1=Marc|last1=Beise|first2=Ulrich|last2=Schäfer|date=11 August 2016|publisher=Campus Verlag|accessdate=24 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of four children. The isolated house had no television or close neighbors, so he experimented with electronics as a child. His family moved to [[Rome]] in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, the family relocated again, to [[Nonnenhorn]] on [[Lake Constance]] in Germany. Aged 16, he designed an industrial controller for a nearby company based on the [[Intel 8080]] which he then programmed in [[binary code]] as he had no access to [[Assembly language|assemblers]]. Royalties from the product supported much of his education.&lt;ref name="oral"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andreas Bechtolsheim &amp; William Joy Oral History|work=Computerworld International Archives|author=Daniel S. Morrow|date=18 March 1999|url=http://www.cwheroes.org/archives/histories/BechtolsheimandJoy.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722143921/http://www.cwheroes.org/archives/histories/BechtolsheimandJoy.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an engineering student at [[Technical University of Munich]] Bechtolsheim entered the [[Jugend forscht]] contest for young researchers, and after entering for three years, won the physics prize in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Milliarden-Karriere: Andreas von Bechtolsheim - Bundessieger Physik 1974|year=2006|url=http://www.jugend-forscht.de/index.php/article/detail/723|accessdate=12 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719224302/https://www.jugend-forscht.de/index.php/article/detail/723|archivedate=19 July 2011}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a [[Fulbright Award]] and moved to the USA in 1975 to attend [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where he received his master's degree in computer engineering in 1976. In 1977, he transferred to [[Stanford University]] and became a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student in electrical engineering.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Sun100U Cardcage.jpg|thumb|alt=printed circuit boards|Early Sun workstation hardware]]
At Stanford, Bechtolsheim designed  a powerful computer (called a [[workstation]]) with built-in networking called the [[SUN workstation]], a name derived from the initials for the [[Stanford University Network]]. It was inspired by the [[Xerox Alto]] computer developed at the [[PARC (company)|Xerox Palo Alto Research Center]]. Bechtolsheim was a "no fee consultant" at Xerox, meaning he was not remunerated directly but had free access to the research being done there. At the time, [[Lynn Conway]] was using workstations to design [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) circuits.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;

Bechtolsheim's advisor was Forest Baskett. In 1980, [[Vaughan Pratt]] also provided leadership to the SUN project. Support was provided by the Computer Science Department and [[DARPA]]. The modular computer was used for research projects such as developing the [[V (operating system)|V-System]], and for early [[Internet]] [[router (computing)|router]]s. Bechtolsheim tried to interest other companies in manufacturing the workstations, but only got lukewarm responses.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;

===Founding Sun===
One of the companies building computers for VLSI design was [[Daisy Systems]], where [[Vinod Khosla]] worked at the time. Khosla had graduated a couple of years earlier from the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] with [[Scott McNealy]], who managed manufacturing at [[Onyx Systems]]. The three wrote a short business plan and quickly received funding from [[venture capital]]ists in 1982.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;
[[File:SPARCstation 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=small desktop computer|[[SPARCstation 1]], designed circa 1988]]
Bechtolsheim left Stanford to found the company, [[Sun Microsystems]], as employee number one. [[Bill Joy]], who was part of the team developing the [[BSD]] series of [[Unix]] operating systems, was the fourth member of the founding team. For a while Bechtolsheim and Joy shared an apartment in [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;

The first product, the [[Sun-1]], included the Stanford [[CPU]] board design with improved memory expansion, and a sheet-metal case. By the end of the year, the experimental [[Ethernet]] interface designed by Bechtolsheim was replaced by a commercial board from [[3Com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun Workstation product overview|year=1982|url=http://thenetworkisthecomputer.com/files/Sun1Overview001.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun Microsystems had its [[Initial Public Offering]] in 1986 and reached $1 billion in sales by 1988. Bechtolsheim formed a project code-named UniSun around this time to design a small, inexpensive desktop computer for the educational market. The result was the [[SPARCstation 1]] (known as "campus"), the start of another line of Sun products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=High noon: the inside story of Scott McNealy and the rise of Sun Microsystems|page=88|author=Karen Southwick|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQl4169IA4kC&amp;pg=PA88|isbn=978-0-471-29713-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other companies===
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}
In 1995, Bechtolsheim left Sun to found Granite Systems, a Gigabit Ethernet startup focused on developing high-speed [[network switches]]. In 1996, [[Cisco Systems]] acquired the firm for $220 million, with Bechtolsheim owning 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Journal of Business Strategy|author=Peter Cohan|title=Lessons from High-Tech Companies|date=November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Vice President and general manager of Cisco's Gigabit Systems Business Unit, until leaving the company in December 2003 to head Kealia, Inc.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Bechtolsheim founded Kealia in early 2001 with Stanford Professor [[David Cheriton]], a partner in Granite Systems, to work on advanced server technologies using the [[Opteron]] processor from [[Advanced Micro Devices]]. In February 2004, Sun Microsystems announced it was acquiring Kealia in a stock swap. Due to the acquisition, Bechtolsheim returned to Sun again as senior vice president and chief architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sun to buy Opteron server maker, reclaim co-founder|work= ZDNet|date=11 February 2004|author=Stephen Shankland|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/sun-to-buy-opteron-server-maker-reclaim-co-founder/134275|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sun Acquires Server Technology Startup|work=eWeek|date=10 February 2004|author=Peter Galli|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/IT-Infrastructure/Sun-Acquires-Server-Technology-Startup|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kealia hardware technology was used in the [[Sun Fire X4500]] storage product.&lt;ref name="cloud"/&gt;

Along with Cheriton, in 2005 Bechtolsheim launched another high-speed networking company, Arastra. Arastra later changed its name to [[Arista Networks]]. Bechtolsheim left Sun Microsystems to become the Chairman and Chief Development Officer of Arista in October, 2008, but stated he still was associated with Sun in an advisory role.&lt;ref name="cloud"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sun Co-founder Bechtolsheim Joins Cloud Computing Startup|work=eWeek|date=23 October 2008|author=Chris Preimesberger|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Sun-CoFounder-Bechtolsheim-Leaves-to-Join-Cloud-Computing-Startup|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investments===
Bechtolsheim co-founded HighBAR Ventures, an early-stage venture capital investment firm, along with two Sun colleagues: [[Bill Joy]] and Roy Sardiña. HighBAR's investments include [[Brocade]], [[Tasmania Network Systems]], [[Brightmail]], and Regroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|work=HighBAR Ventures website|year=2009|url=http://www.highbarventures.com/about_us.asp|accessdate=13 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525122006/http://www.highbarventures.com/about_us.asp|archivedate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were two of the first investors in [[Google]], investing [[US Dollar|US$]]100,000 each in September 1998. Bechtolsheim wrote the check to "Google Inc" prior to the company even being founded. Claims that Bechtolsheim coined the name "Google" is untrue. However, he did motivate the founders to officially organize the company under that name. When he gave the check to [[Lawrence E. Page|Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], Google's founders, they had not actually yet even been legally incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If the Check Says 'Google Inc.', We're 'Google Inc.'|work=Wired|date=7 September 1998|author=Tony Long|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/09/dayintech_0907|accessdate=11 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501135600/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/09/dayintech_0907|archivedate=1 May 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google history|work= About Google Company|url=https://www.google.com/corporate/history.html|accessdate=11 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401002313/https://www.google.com/corporate/history.html|archivedate=1 April 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of investments like these, Bechtolsheim was seen as one of the most successful "[[angel investor]]s",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/99/0JRL.html|work=Forbes|year=2006|title=Andreas von Bechtolsheim|accessdate=13 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522170847/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/99/0JRL.html|archivedate=22 May 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in areas such as [[electronic design automation]] (EDA), which refers to the software used by people designing computer chips. He has made a number of successful investments in EDA. In one such EDA company, [[Magma Design Automation]], his stake was valued around $60 million.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Bechtolsheim invested in [[Tapulous]], the maker of music games for the [[Apple iPhone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Music Games for iPhone Give Artists New Spotlight |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/technology/start-ups/22tap.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author= Jenna Wortham|date=21 December 2008|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tapulous was acquired by [[the Walt Disney Company]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Buys Tapulous, Maker of Video Games for IPads|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-01/disney-buys-tapulous-maker-of-video-games-for-ipads-update1-.html|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|author=Andy Fixmer and Adam Satariano|date=1 July 2010|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined George T. Haber, a former colleague at Sun, to invest in wireless chip company CrestaTech in 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Programmable Broadband Company:About Us|work=CrestaTech website|url=http://www.crestatech.com/about/index.html|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bechtolsheim invested in all of Haber's previous startups:{{citation needed|date= April 2011}} CompCore purchased by [[Zoran corporation|Zoran]], GigaPixel purchased by [[3Dfx]] and Mobilygen purchased by [[Maxim Integrated Products]] in 2008, as well as  [[Moovweb]], a cloud-based interface for mobile and computer websites in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bechtolsheim-Backed Moovweb Develops Mobile Sites And Smartphone Apps|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/04/bechtolsheim-backed-moovweb-develops-mobile-sites-and-smartphone-apps|date=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was reportedly an early investor in [[Claria Corporation]], which ceased operating in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Barbarians at the Digital Gate|newspaper=The New York Times|author= Timothy L. O'Brien and Saul Hansell|date=20 September 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20040920monday.html|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Bechtolsheim invested in a [[Stanford University|Stanford]] incubated [[Semantic Web|semantic web]] startup [[Diffbot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andy-bechtolsheim|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2013-09-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902134528/http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andy-bechtolsheim|archivedate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, he was voted by IT Pros in 2012 as the person who contributed most to server innovation in the last 20 years. Two prominent Open Compute innovation leaders will receive awards at Open Server/Open Storage Summit 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracie Barnes|url=http://www.conferenceconcepts.com/English/Conferences_Summits/Innovation_Leader_Awards.html|title=IT Brand Pulse Networking Innovation Leader Awards|website=Conferenceconcepts.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2015-17, Bechtolsheim was an investor in the Seed, Series A, and Series B rounds of PerimeterX, an automated attack mitigation SaaS awarded by [[Gartner]] as one of its 2017 Cool Vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniel|first1=Robert|title=PerimeterX, providing defense against automated attacks, launches anti-bot service|url=https://www.pehub.com/2016/04/3325333/|website=The PE Hub Network|publisher=PE Hub|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
Bechtolsheim received a Smithsonian Leadership Award for Innovation in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Leadership Award Recipients: 1990–2008|publisher=Computerworld Information Technology Awards Foundation|year=2008|url=http://www.cwheroes.org/leadership/indexpast.html|accessdate=13 April  2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722143938/http://www.cwheroes.org/leadership/indexpast.html|archivedate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Stanford Entrepreneur Company of the year award, and is a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]]. Bechtolsheim gave the opening keynote speech at the [[International Supercomputing Conference]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Interview with ISC'09 Keynote Speaker Andy von Bechtolsheim|work=HPCwire|date=21 June 2009|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/specialfeatures/isc09/features/An-Interview-with-ISC09-Keynote-Speaker-Andy-von-Bechtolsheim-48746467.html|accessdate=13 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727134208/http://www.hpcwire.com/specialfeatures/isc09/features/An-Interview-with-ISC09-Keynote-Speaker-Andy-von-Bechtolsheim-48746467.html|archive-date=2009-07-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Never married, Bechtolsheim has not taken out United States citizenship. "I continue to be a German citizen, so I am not an American national. My legal name is the same it always was. The problem with the von is that in America they combine the von title with the last name and my last name is really so long that it actually didn't fit in most computers anymore. So my middle initial is now v. for von and the last name is of course as it always was. That's the peculiarity of the American way of looking at German names."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/von-bechtolsheim-i-invested-in-google-to-solve-my-own-problem/a-4557608|title=Von Bechtolsheim: I invested in Google to solve my own problem|website=Dw.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angela Ndambuki''' (born in 1979), is a [[Kenya]]n [[lawyer]] and [[corporate executive]], who served briefly, on probation, as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [https://www.kenyachamber.or.ke/ Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry]. Immediately before she was appointed to her last position, she was the CEO of the ''Performers Rights Society of Kenya'' (PRISK).&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/news/Chamber-of-commerce-picks-new-CEO/539546-4107982-fkoq7lz/index.html |title=Chamber of commerce picks new CEO |accessdate=28 November 2017 |date=23 September 2017 |first=Bonface | last=Otieno | newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] | location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also an accomplished [[performing artist|performing]] and [[recording artist]], and was a member of the all-girl group called '''Tattu'''.&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=28 November 2017 |url=https://softkenya.com/kenya/angela-ndambuki/| date=30 June 2017 | title=Angela Ndambuki Biography, Songs, Family | publisher=Softkenya.com (Soft Kenya) |location=Nairobi | author=Soft Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angela was born in [[Mombasa]], Kenya circa 1980,&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=[[Nation Media Group]] | url=http://host.nationmedia.com/Top40Under40-2017.pdf |format=PDF | title=Top 40 Women Under 40 In Kenya 2017 |author=[[Business Daily Africa]]| accessdate=28 November 2017 | date=26 October 2017 |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seven"/&gt; and attended local schools for her primary and secondary education. She obtained  [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB) degree from the [[University of Nairobi]]. She also holds a [[Law|Postgraduate Diploma in Law]] (Dip.Law), awarded by the [[Kenya School of Law]]. She is a member of the Kenya Bar. Her [[Master of Laws]] (LLM) degree specializing in [[intellectual property rights]], was obtained from the [[University of Edinburgh]], in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-ndambuki-04594367/ | title=Angela Ndambuki: CEO at Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) |author=Angela Ndambuki |accessdate=28 November 2017 |date=28 November 2017 |publisher=[[Linkedin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1998 Angela Ndambuki met '''Debbie Asila''' for the first time. The following year, she met '''Angela Mwandanda'''. They all had a passion to perform. The three became friends and started performing plays together, including at the ''French Cultural Centre'' and at the [[British Council]] in [[Nairobi]], Kenya's [[capital city]].&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2000111894/angela-ndambuki-super-woman | title=Angela Ndambuki Super Woman!|date=November 2013 |location=Nairobi | accessdate=28 November 2017 |publisher=SDE.co.ke (SDE Kenya) |last=SDE Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Ndambuki was juggling law school, acting and dancing for a Nairobi-based singer [[David Mathenge]], who went by his stage name '''Nameless'''. Mathenge asked the young women to [[twirk]] during his performances, a feat the ladies could not or refused to perform, so he fired them. That was when the trio formed Tattu. They released a hit single called [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Ry0AHg3as Teso], which gained local acclaim. However the group dissolved after about five years.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web|title=Music and the Law: Catching up with Angela Ndambuki | url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/article/2000178410/music-and-the-law-catching-up-with-angela-ndambuki | accessdate=28 November 2017 | date=3 October 2015 |first=Gardy | last=Chacha | location=Nairobi | newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing the bar examinations, she and others founded the [http://www.prisk.or.ke/index.php/en/ Performers Rights Society of Kenya] (PRISK). In an interview with [[The Standard (Kenya)]] newspaper in October 2015, Angela says that she worked for two years without a salary while cobbling the society together. She rose to the position of General Manager by January 2009, serving in that capacity until October 2012. In November 2012, she was promoted to the position of CEO at PRISK, working in that capacity until September 2017.&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Six"/&gt;

==Family==
Angela Ndambuki is married to Roy Mutungi, and together are the parents of two daughters, Tili and Keli.&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;{{cite web|date=24 March 2018 |access-date=24 March 2018 | url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/magazine/Angela-Ndambuki-profile/434746-4355124-xkhwpp/index.html |location=Nairobi | title=A rising star: From stage to executive suite |first=Victor |last=Kiprop |newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Six"/&gt;

'''''Cash Flow''''' (formerly '''''CNBC's Cash Flow '''''and '''''Cash Flow From Australia''''') was a television business news program on [[CNBC Asia]]. It is produced by CNBC Asia from Singapore by a team of journalists and aired each weekday at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am Singapore/Hong Kong/[[Taiwan]] time.  It was broadcast live from [[CNBC Asia]]'s studio in Sydney and presented by Oriel Morrison and at Hong Kong's studio presented by [[Bernard Lo]] for the first hour.  It was originally presented by Maura Fogarty for the first hour and Amanda Drury for the second hour and was broadcast live from Singapore.  ''Cash Flow'' was seen in the United States on the [[CNBC World]] channel every Sunday through Thursday at 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] (9:00&amp;nbsp;pm ET without [[Daylight Saving Time]]) and on [[CNBC Europe]] at 3:00 [[UTC]]

==Program Facts==
*''Cash Flow'', which debuted on 26 March 2007 as ''CNBC's Cash Flow'', replaced ''[[Asia Market Watch]]'' (also anchored by Amanda Drury), a mid-morning Asian market program that followed ongoing stock market trading in Asia. The show was given a clear mandate—to provide actionable strategies on investments and help viewers make sense of the morning's news flow.

This was part of CNBC Asia's significant programming revamp that resulted in the cancellation of ''Asia Market Watch'', and the debut of ''[[Squawk Australia]]'', which moved ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'' (which Drury co-anchored with Martin Soong) down an hour.
*The second hour of ''Cash Flow'' is also seen in the Philippines over [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]].  ANC, however has the option of pre-empting the simulcast in case of breaking news or live events such as Senate/House hearings and Christmas/Year End programs of ANC's shows.
* It features stock reports from CNBC reporters around the Asia Pacific region including [[Emily Chan]] (Hong Kong), [[Kaori Enjoji]] (Tokyo), [[Cheng Lei]] (Shanghai) and [[Tanvir Gill]] of [[CNBC-TV18]] ([[Mumbai]]). Plus [[Sri Jegarajah]] and [[Adam Bakhtiar]] at [[CNBC Asia]]'s Singapore studios.
*''Cash Flow'' started broadcasting from the news room set in July 2009. The move out of the virtual set means that all CNBC Asia programs now originate from a hard set.  This program moved to Sydney in 2010, after Maura Fogarty departed from the network.
*''Trading Matters'', once a standalone programme on the network wrapping-up the trading day in Australia was folded to become a segment on ''Cash Flow'' at around 11.40 HK/SIN time.  It now features live reports from the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] and analysis of stories from down under.
*On 14 June 2010, ''CNBC's Cash Flow'' was renamed ''Cash Flow From Australia'' to reflect the program's change of location.  [[Oriel Morrison]] became the sole anchor of the program, replacing original anchors Amanda Drury and Maura Fogarty.
* On 2 January 2013, ''Cash Flow From Australia ''was shortened to ''Cash Flow, ''dropping the second half of the program's name (''From Australia'') from the title.

'''Daniël George van Beuningen''' (4 March 1877, [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], – 29 May 1955, [[Arlesheim]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] businessman who became iconic for the city of [[Rotterdam]].

DG (as he was generally known&lt;ref name="Lichtenauer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lichtenauer|first1=W.F.|title=BEUNINGEN, Daniel George van (1877-1955)|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn2/beuningen|website=resources.huygens.knaw.nl|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=Dutch|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was born in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. He was the son of [[Hendrik Adriaan van Beuningen]], and an English woman, Anna Lavenia Brain of [[Kelmscott]].&lt;ref name="GO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oyen|first1=J.A.Q.M. Smits van|title=Anna Lavenia BRAIN (1847-1943) » Stamboom Smits van Oyen » Genealogie Online|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/stamboom-smits-van-oyen/I10430.php|website=Genealogie Online|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he made his reputation in Rotterdam where he focused on the economic transformation of the port of that city, which became one of the largest port in the world in those days. He was a well known celebrity not only in the city itself, but also across the Netherlands and further afield..

His father was co-founder of the [[SHV Holdings|Steenkolen Handels Vereniging]], which became big during the [[World War I]] supplying both the English and German armies with [[coal]]. Daniël was involved as a prominent member of the [[Dutch Coal Trade Union]], an organisation which represented the [[Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate]] in the Netherlands. He started shipping German coal to Rotterdam to compete with coal imported from [[England]]. This involved the choice of barges rather than railway wagons to ship coal and led to major advances in the mechanical handling of coal.&lt;ref name="LBD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loyen|first1=Reginald|last2=Buyst|first2=Erik|last3=Devos|first3=Greta|title=Struggling for Leadership: Antwerp-Rotterdam Port Competition between 1870 –2000|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642574856|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XqHwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22Dutch+Coal+Trade+Union%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jVy_kSGf-P&amp;sig=y2pIAujoWfpHQvf1WL1E4yR4Jyc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjImL-7uafYAhXMDcAKHSnwCSkQ6AEIPTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dutch%20Coal%20Trade%20Union%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Beuningen went on to lead a large number of companies in the [[port of Rotterdam]] and after the war he owned most of these companies and he became also active in the society. In 1937 he was one of the co-financial partners of the newly built [[Stadion Feijenoord]], buying the ground where the stadium was built and was one of the founders for the Harbour Hospital in the city. During the [[World War II]] in 1941 he resigned. In 1954, several months before his death in [[Arlesheim]], [[Switzerland]] the Van Beuningen family was forced to withdraw completely out of the SHV Holdings as there was no replaceable family member to become director.

[[File:RotterdamDGvanBeuningen.jpg|thumb|Bust of Van Beuningen in Rotterdam]]
Van Beuningen was a collector of art from the 15th and 16th century out of the northern and southern parts of the Netherlands. During his life he gave several of his collections away to the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]]. During his life he married a total of three times. His first marriage was with Mies Schout Velthuys, but due to his hard work they hardly saw each other. She died in 1926 aged 43. A short second marriage to Odette Paule Fernande Ragoulleau ended up in a divorce. In 1938 he married for the third time, this time to Bep Charlouis.

His great nephew Baron [[Willem van Dedem]] (1929-2015) was also a noted art collector.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apollo-magazine.com/willem-baron-van-dedem-1929-2015/|title=Willem Baron van Dedem (1929–2015)|last=Hall|first=Michael|date=30 November 2015|work=[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo Magazine]]|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir David Henry''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (24 November 1888 – 20 August 1963) was a Scottish-born New Zealand industrialist, company director, and philanthropist.

Henry was born at [[Juniper Green]], Midlothian, Scotland. His father, Robert Henry, was a sawmiller and on leaving school, David worked as a clerk in the Mossy Paper Mill at Colinton while attending night classes in [[Edinburgh]], possibly at Heriot-Watt College.

Indifferent health prompted him to emigrate to New Zealand in 1907. He worked for the Government Printer in [[Wellington]] for a brief time before moving to [[Christchurch]], where he founded an engineering business. When the business failed he shifted to [[Auckland]] to start afresh.

He married Mary Castleton Osborne on 28 April 1915 and began working for another engineering and patents company owned by S. Oldfield and D. B. Hutton. By August of the same year, he had bought into the firm, and it was renamed Oldfield &amp; Henry. Within four years he owned the organisation outright and it became known as D. Henry &amp; Co. Henry expanded the business into a profitable small-scale plumbing manufacturer and supplier.

Henry's New Zealand cousins (see [[Henry family]]) had been involved in the fledgingly timbermilling industry since their arrival in New Zealand in the 1870s and in 1936 he was to play a pivotal role in the consolidation of the New Zealand timber industry through his involvement in the merger of his extended family's milling business with the afforestation company, New Zealand Perpetual Forests (a large bond selling company that had established {{convert|150000|acre|ha}} of timber plantations, but had gone bankrupt). Henry struck a hard bargain in purchasing the New Zealand Perpetual Forests assets and was made the chairman and managing director of the new company for his efforts. This new company was [[New Zealand Forest Products]], which remained New Zealand's largest industrial concern and largest company until the privatisation of [[Telecom New Zealand]] in the 1990s.

In assuming the role of New Zealand's pre-eminent industrialist, Henry was concerned with developing the future utilisation of the company's forests. Sawmill technology for handling [[Pinus radiata]], and the commercial manufacture of pulp and paper from this species, was reasonably undeveloped worldwide. He travelled extensively throughout the United States and Europe to find the newest processing technology and fought a protracted battle with the New Zealand Government to overcome bureaucracy.

He was successful in convincing the government of the benefits of the company's industrialisation and in 1941 opened the first large-scale sawmill and insulating board plant at Penrose, Auckland.

Henry also clashed with the government over its plans to nationalise the New Zealand timber industry to create an integrated state sector forest and timber manufacturing company. This battle continued until the election of a National Government in 1949.

In 1943 Sir David chose a mill site near [[Tokoroa]], near the company's forest plantations. He built [[Kinleith Mill]] (after a paper mill in Scotland), which was to become famous as New Zealand's largest industrial processing complex. Kinleith manufactured the first commercially produced kraft pulp in New Zealand in 1953. It was the culmination of 17 years of effort by Henry.

In 1954 he was made a [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] for his services to the New Zealand exotic timber industry.

Henry was very involved in the community. He used his business success in Auckland to become increasingly involved with a wide range of organisations, including the Rotary Club of Auckland, the Boy Scouts' Association, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the Auckland Manufacturers' Association (eventually becoming national president), and he sat as an elected councillor on the [[Auckland City Council]] (from [[Auckland City mayoral election, 1931|1931]]–33). He was also well known for his philanthropy, endowing a forestry scholarship bearing his name in 1956 to provide overseas training for employees of New Zealand Forest Products. He also established a substantial trust for the Auckland Presbyterian Orphanages and Social Service Association (now known as Presbyterian Support). 
His wife died in 1954, but the next year, Sir David (aged 67) married Dorothy May Osborne, the younger sister of his first wife.

Even at the age of 67, Sir David showed no interest in retiring as Chairman of New Zealand Forest Products. He continued to battle the government over industry licensing, but alarmingly also began to display increasingly erratic behaviour. This is evidenced by his conduct in 1958 when he encouraged the British pulp and paper giant Bowater Paper Corporation to make an unsuccessful takeover for New Zealand Forest Products, and he began to make uncharacteristically rash statements to the national press. Despite being ill with a heart condition, Henry continued to be active at the company, holding many meetings at his Remuera residence, during which he was known to lash out verbally.

In his history of New Zealand Forest Products, titled "A Hundred Million Trees", Brian Healy said "Sir David Henry lacked warmth and humour in his working relations and tended to be abrupt and demanding with his subordinates. Yet he was a fluent and persuasive speaker whose self-assurance, business acumen and tenacity were vital in enabling New Zealand Forest Products to overcome enormous barriers and to develop into one of the country's largest industrial enterprises."

'''Downtown''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is fairly compact compared with other city centers on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the United States because of its geographical situation. It is hemmed in on the north and east by [[hill]]s, on the west by [[Elliott Bay]], and on the south by [[reclaimed land]] that was once [[tidal flats]]. It is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which are [[Lower Queen Anne, Seattle, Washington|Lower Queen Anne]] (sometimes known as "Uptown"), [[Seattle Center]], and [[South Lake Union, Seattle, Washington|South Lake Union]]; on the east by Interstate 5, beyond which is [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] to the northeast and [[Central District, Seattle, Washington|the Central District]] to the east; on the south by S Dearborn Street, beyond which is [[Sodo, Seattle, Washington|Sodo]]; and on the west by [[Elliott Bay]], which is part of [[Puget Sound]] (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean).

==Neighborhoods==

[[Belltown, Seattle, Washington|Belltown]], [[Denny Regrade, Seattle, Washington|Denny Triangle]], the retail district, the West Edge, the financial district, the government district, [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]], [[Seattle Chinatown-International District|Chinatown]], Japantown, Little Saigon, and the western flank of [[First Hill, Seattle|First Hill]] west of Broadway make up downtown Seattle's chief neighborhoods. Near the center of downtown is the [[Metropolitan Tract (Seattle)|Metropolitan Tract]] which is owned by the [[University of Washington]]; prior to 1895 it served as the location of the university's campus. Downtown is Seattle's finance and commercial maritime hub as well as its center of nightlife and shopping. The downtown shopping mall Westlake Center is connected to Seattle Center by way of a [[Seattle Center Monorail|monorail]].

==Landmarks==
{{see also|List of tallest buildings in Seattle}}

Downtown Seattle's [[Columbia Center]] has 76 floors, a greater number than any other building west of the [[Mississippi River]]; however there are taller buildings in [[Texas]] and [[California]] by height. ([[Smith Tower]], in the older section of downtown called Pioneer Square, once held the title of tallest American building west of the Mississippi.) Other notable buildings are the [[Washington Mutual Tower]], [[Two Union Square]], [[Nordstrom]]’s flagship store, [[Benaroya Hall]], the [[Seattle Central Library]] designed by [[Rem Koolhaas]], and the main building of the [[Seattle Art Museum]] (built 1991, expanded 2007), the main facade of which was designed by [[Robert Venturi]]. Downtown parks include [[Westlake Park (Seattle)|Westlake Park]], [[Freeway Park (Seattle)|Freeway Park]], and [[Victor Steinbrueck Park]]. The [[Olympic Sculpture Park]] was completed on the Belltown waterfront in January 2007.

Downtown is also home to the landmark [[Pike Place Market]], the oldest continually operating farmer's market in the United States and the core of activity in the area.

==History==
=== Founding of present-day Downtown ===
After abandoning [[Alki Point|'New York Alki']], the [[Denny Party]] moved across the then named [[Elliott Bay|Duwamish Bay]] in April 1852 to a low level marsh situated with a safe deep water harbor roughly located in the city's [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]] district where they named their new frontier 'Duwamps'.&lt;ref name=founding&gt;{{cite web

=== Early Downtown ===
In the late 1850s, present day Downtown Seattle became the main residential outskirts of the city.{{sfn|Seattle Architecture: A Walking Guide To Downtown|2007|p=61}} 
=== Great Fire of Seattle ===
But after the [[Great Seattle Fire]], the business district was moved here.&lt;ref name=fire&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate= June 20, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
=== Post Great Fire Downtown ===
Because of the fire the city had to be built at a much higher elevation to avoid past drainage problems and regraded some of the [[Seven hills of Seattle|city's hills]] starting somewhere around 1876.{{sfn|Seattle Architecture: A Walking Guide To Downtown Seattle|2007|p=115}} Since that time the area had been filled with newly established jobs. 
=== Klondike Gold Rush ===
Seattle became an industrial hub in 1897 when the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] made the city a gateway for discovering gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/seattle-facts/brief-history-of-seattle |title=Brief History of Seattle - CityArchives |publisher=City of Seattle |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
=== Skyline Boom ===
Starting in the late 1960s, Downtown has been being filled with dozens of skyscrapers and most famously for changing the Seattle skyline, the [[Columbia Center]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/67223384 |title=The Mark _ in Seattle on Vimeo |publisher=Daniels Real Estate |via=Vimeo |date=May 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
With about 65,000 now living in Seattle's core neighborhoods (in 2015), Downtown Seattle's population is growing. Downtown saw a 10 percent increase in the number of occupied housing units and an 8 percent increase in population between 2010 and 2014, outpacing growth in the city as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownseattle.com/resources/economicprofile/ |title=State of Downtown Economic Profile |publisher=Downtown Seattle Association |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of 2014, there were 32 apartment and 2 condominium projects under construction, representing over 5,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownseattle.com/resources/development-and-construction-projects/ |title=Development and Construction Projects in Downtown Seattle |publisher=Downtown Seattle Association |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, building heights in Downtown and adjoining Seattle suburbs were tightly restricted following a voter initiative.  These restrictions were dramatically loosened in 2006, leading to the increase in Downtown high-rise construction.  This policy change has divided commentators between those who support the increased density and those who criticize it as "Manhattanization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berger |first=Knute |authorlink=Knute Berger |date=October 9, 2006 |title=The Manhattan Project |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2005-05-18/news/the-manhattan-project/ |newspaper=[[Seattle Weekly]] |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

Downtown Seattle is the largest employment center in the [[Puget Sound region]], with an estimated employee population of 243,995 in 2013, accounting for half of the city's jobs and 21 percent of King County jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2015 State of Downtown Economic Report |url=https://www.downtownseattle.com/assets/2015/02/DSA-State-of-Downtown-Report-and-Dev-Guide-Final.pdf |publisher=Downtown Seattle Association |accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Fortune 500]] companies headquartered in Downtown Seattle include [[Amazon.com]], [[Starbucks]], [[Nordstrom]], and [[Expeditors International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=King County Economy |url=http://www.edc-seaking.org/service/economic-data/economic-basics |publisher=Economic Development Council of Seattle &amp; King County |accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franklin Parsons''' "'''Frank'''" '''Perdue''' (May 9, 1920 &amp;ndash; March 31, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.wboc.com/story/3153624/poultry-magnate-frank-perdue-dies-at-84 |title=Poultry Magnate Frank Perdue Dies at 84 |date=2005-04-01 |access-date=2018-03-29 |publisher=[[WBOC-TV]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |language=en |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;), born in [[Salisbury, Maryland]], was for many years the president and [[CEO]] of [[Perdue Farms]], now one of the largest [[chicken]]-producing companies in the United States.

==Career==
Perdue Farms was founded in 1920 by [[Arthur Perdue]]&lt;ref name=Schmetterer/&gt; with his wife, Pearl Perdue who had been keeping a small flock of chickens.&lt;ref name=tl1920&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Now recognized as a visionary,&lt;ref name=Schmetterer/&gt; Frank Perdue's promotion of the Perdue brand through high-profile [[advertising]] resulted in its being the first well-known brand of chicken in the U.S.&lt;ref name="hawker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/25perdue.html?ex=1293166800&amp;en=46defcb28cec5d04&amp;ei=5090|title=Chicken Hawker|date=December 25, 2005|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2007-09-25 | first=Joseph | last=Nocera}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He turned over leadership of Perdue Farms to his son, [[Jim Perdue]], in 1991.

Perdue Farms developed a specialized chicken-feed that included [[Tagetes|marigold]] blossoms, which imparted a characteristic golden yellow hue to the skins of his chickens.&lt;ref name="hawker"/&gt;

In the 1980s the visionary Perdue twice sought assistance from then-Mafia boss Paul Castellano Sr. to fend off a union's effort to represent workers at his company, according to a federal commission on labor corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ronald J.

==Advertising==
In 1971, Perdue Farm embarked on its first major advertising campaign and had contracted the firm of [[Scali, McCabe, Sloves]].&lt;ref name=Schmetterer&gt;{{cite book

Much of the commercials were known for Perdue actually encouraging people to voice any complaints or dissatisfaction with Perdue products, usually ending with Perdue stating "Say whatever you have to say; I can take it".&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/01/news/newsmakers/perdue/index.htm?cnn=yes|title=Frank Perdue dead at 84|date=2005-04-01|publisher=CNN/Money|accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this advertising, Perdue is credited with creating the first brand for chicken.&lt;ref name=Schmetterer/&gt;

==Death==
According to Perdue company officials, Perdue died on March 31, 2005, after a brief illness. He was 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wboc.com/story/3153624/poultry-magnate-frank-perdue-dies-at-84|title=Poultry Magnate Frank Perdue Dies at 84|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Salisbury_University#Perdue_School_of_Business|Franklin P. Perdue School of Business]] was established at [[Salisbury University]] in 1986 and named for Frank Perdue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisbury.edu/perdue/about.html Salisbury University] Franklin P. Perdue School of Business&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Harris Harbison''' (December 18, 1912 – April 5, 1976) was an American labor economist and Professor of Labor Economics at [[Princeton University]]. He was known for his 1959 study ''Management in the industrial world'' and other works on labor and  management.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geert Hofstede|Hofstede, Geert]]. "Culture and organizations."

'''Hobart City Centre''' (referred to as '''Town''' or '''Hobart CBD''') is a suburb surrounded by metropolitan [[Hobart]], which comprises the original settlement, the central business district, and other built-up areas. It is the oldest part of Hobart and includes many of the city's important institutions and landmarks, such as [[Parliament House, Hobart|Parliament]], the [[Supreme Court of Tasmania|Supreme Court]], [[Franklin Square (Hobart)|Franklin Square]], the [[Elizabeth Street Mall]], the [[Royal Hobart Hospital]], the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]], [[State Library of Tasmania|State Library]], the [[NAB Building]], the [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery|Museum]], and the [[Hobart Cenotaph|Cenotaph]]. The city centre is located in the local government areas of the [[City of Hobart]].

Although the city centre is one of the oldest and most developed areas of Hobart, demographically it is one of the less densely populated areas in the greater area of Hobart, due to its core being commercial. In an attempt to create a more vibrant city at night, the state government has been encouraging inner city residential development in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2010 | url = http://www.hobartcity.com.au/Publications/Strategies_and_Plans/Affordable_Housing_Strategy_2010-2012 | title = Affordable Housing Strategy 2010-2012 | publisher = [[Hobart City Council]] | accessdate = 2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2010 | url = http://macquariepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Doc-L.pdf | title = Hobart- A world class, liveable waterfront city | publisher = [[Government of Tasmania]] | accessdate = 2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the city centre was 456 in 2006.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Hobart}}
Settlement of Greater Hobart spawned from the settlement of [[Sullivans Cove]] on 21 February 1804, by order of [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]] who was most unimpressed with the initial landing site at [[Risdon Cove]].

==Geography==
The Hobart city centre draws a sense of its identity from its location between the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] and the foot hills of [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]]. The city is concentrated with [[Low-rise]] office buildings, interspersed by parks such as Franklin Square and St Davids Park and historic precincts such as [[Sullivans Cove]] and [[Salamanca Place]]. Due to street width, the majority of Hobart CBD's streets are [[One-way traffic|One-way]] with a few exceptions including [[Elizabeth Street, Hobart|Elizabeth Street]], the main north-south thoroughfare of the city centre. [[Davey Street, Hobart|Davey Street]]/[[Macquarie Street, Hobart|Macquarie]] travel parallel as a [[one-way couplet]] carrying traffic between Hobart's major highways along the CBD's southern fringe. The streets run on a slightly warped [[Street grid|grid pattern]] in the CBD, due to early planning by [[Lachlan Macquarie]].

==Governance==
Administratively, the [[Hobart]] City Centre falls under the authority of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Hobart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobartcity.com.au/Home/|title=Home|publisher=[[Hobart City Council]]|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tasmanian Government]] also has authority over some aspects of the CBD, in particular the major state controlled roads passing through and around the city.
{{Wide image|Hobart-Panorama-facing-south-west-from-glebe.jpg|800px|The Hobart City Centre at Dawn}}

==Commercial area==
With the exception of [[Wrest Point Hotel Casino|Wrest Point Casino]] in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]], the Hobart CBD contains all of [[Tasmania]]’s tallest buildings, including 39 Murray Street, 188 Collins Street and the [[Trafalgar Building, Hobart|Trafalgar Building]]. The tallest building in the city centre is [[NAB House]] at {{Convert|58|m|ft|abbr=on}}, however planning restrictions limit future developments to a height of {{Convert|42|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There have been some exceptions to this rule such as Wellington Centre standing at {{Convert|48|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/dcac42ce-2871-4977-af21-a1d200ebd620/Central_Area_Review_Background_Report_June_2013.pdf|title=Central Area Provisions Background Report|publisher=[[Hobart City Council]]|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new [[Royal Hobart Hospital|Royal Hobart Hospital K1/K2 Twin Towers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/builders-named-for-two-new-towers-of-the-royal-hobart-hospital/story-fnj4f7k1-1226708599101|title=Builders named for two new towers of the Royal Hobart Hospital |publisher=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/ceece4e2-29c2-4de3-b874-a0cb00fdc973/48_Liverpool_St_RHH_redevelopment.pdf|title=Supporting Assessment Information|publisher=[[Hobart City Council]]|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which when complete, will stand at {{Convert|48|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.

==Culture==
There is a large concentration of cultural institutions within the CBD including: the [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery]], the [[State Library of Tasmania]], the Playhouse Theatre, and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]].

Every December, the city hosts the conclusion of the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] while concurrently holding the [[Taste Festival]]. 
Every January the city hosts the [[Australian Wooden Boat Festival]] and the annual [[Royal Hobart Regatta]] is held during February.

Additional, the [[Salamanca Market]] is held at [[Salamanca Place]] every Saturday.

The '''Institute of Public Accountants''' ('''IPA''') is one of the three legally recognised [[professional association|professional bodies]] for [[accountants]] in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="ASIC Website"&gt;[http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/Certificates+issued+by+a+qualified+accountant ASIC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPA represents more than 35,000 members and students working in industry, commerce, government, academia and professional practice.

The organisation rebranded from its previous title, the National Institute of Accountants (NIA), on May 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialstandard.com.au/news/view/8415439/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the IPA was ranked 19th in the [[BRW (magazine)|BRW]] Most Innovative Companies list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brw.com.au/p/sections/features/the_most_innovative_companies_41oOvi59lKUTXAoKKtwk8I&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPA launched its digital hub [http://pubacct.org.au pubacct.org.au], an expanded digital edition of its flagship journal ''Public Accountant'', in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubacct.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership levels==
The IPA has three levels of membership:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/ipa-membership/membership-levels IPA Membership Types]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Associate (AIPA)
* Member (MIPA)
* Fellow (FIPA)

'''Student Membership'''

Students studying towards an accounting qualification can join as a student member, free of charge. Student members have access to networking opportunities, receive monthly e-newsletters, employment tips, and are eligible to participate in the IPA Project.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publicaccountants.org.au/students--graduates&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, graduate IPA student members and non-members who have completed their accounting degree or advanced diploma within the last three years are eligible for the Graduate Associate level of membership (GAIPA).  This level of membership was designed to assist in the transition of students to full membership in their early career years. It provides recently graduated students with a significantly reduced rate of membership, without missing out on the benefits that full IPA membership provides.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publicaccountants.org.au/students--graduates/graduate-associate-membership&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Retired Members'''

Retired members are eligible for reduced membership fees and specific offers designed to assist semi-retired members in practice.

==Membership requirements==

'''AIPA membership requires:'''
* Australian Advanced Diploma of Accounting
or
* Bachelor's degree in Accounting (Australian, or assessed as equivalent)
or
current BAS Agent or Tax Agent registration (must also meet relevant IPA practice certificate requirements)

'''MIPA membership requires:'''
* Australian Advanced Diploma of Accounting
* Two years of pre-IPA program full-time (or equivalent) work experience in accounting or related fields
* ''IPA Program (12 subjects)'' (resulting in a [[Master of Commerce]] in Public Accounting)
* Mentored Experience Program
or
* Bachelor's degree in Accounting (Australian, or assessed as equivalent)
* ''IPA Program (4 subjects)'' (resulting in a Graduate Certificate in Public Accounting)  '''''Note.''''' Members with a recognized university qualification in accountancy may elect to complete a further 8 subjects to obtain a [[Master of Commerce]] (Public Accounting) awarded by the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].
* Mentored Experience Program

'''FIPA membership requires:'''
* 7 years' MIPA status or equivalent; plus,
* 10 years' experience in accounting (last 5 years of which are at a senior level)

===Mentored Experience Program===

The Mentored Experience Program (MEP) requires members to undergo a formal mentoring process gaining 3 years of structured work experience. With the guidance of an IPA approved mentor, usually a fully qualified accountant from one of the three professional bodies, the MEP provides the framework for members to increase both their practical experience and knowledge in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/mentored-experience-program Mentored Experience Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPA Program===
The IPA Program is a fully accredited educational pathway delivered by the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] (UNE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/ipa-membership/ipa-program IPA Program]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides rigorous and globally recognised postgraduate education resulting in the award of a Graduate Certificate in Public Accounting and/or a [[Master of Commerce]] (Public Accounting) degree.  Members are required to undertake either four (4) or twelve (12) subjects to advance to MIPA status depending on their undergraduate qualifications.  The program is delivered online via distance learning and allows members to study at their own pace.  Members have up to 5 years to complete the program. The IPA is the only accounting body to offer a [[Master of Commerce]] degree in Public Accounting as its professional program.

The Master of Commerce (Public Accounting)degree is designated by the Australian Qualifications Framework Authority (AQF) '''at Level 9.''' The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) establishes the quality of Australian qualifications.

The AQF is the national policy for regulated qualifications in the Australian education and training system.  '''Members of the IPA who complete the IPA program and obtain the Master's Degree (AQF Level 9), achieve a Higher Qualification than those from either CPA Australia (no AQF designation) or Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (AQF Level 8).
'''
Since January 2015, the IPA program was revised to a Graduate Certificate in Public Accounting (4 subjects) and/or [[Master of Commerce]] degree in Public Accounting (12 subjects), awarded by the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]]. Like the pre-2015 versions of the IPA program, the paths to full IPA membership depend on entry qualifications of members and completion of both the MEP and the particular type of IPA program associated to the entry qualification in accountancy used to joining the IPA.

The pre-2015 IPA program(s) were named respectively Graduate Certificate in Professional Accounting (4 subjects) and [[Master of Commerce]] (Professional Accounting) (8 subjects), both awarded by the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].

===Continuing Professional Education (CPE)===
All members of the IPA (except retired members) must complete a minimum of 80 hours structured CPE activity per biennium (2 years). The IPA recommends for members to meet this requirement that they complete 40 structured hours CPE activity per year. However a minimum of 10 hours per annum is possible with 70 hours being completed in the second year of the biennium.  The IPA runs a series of face-to-face and online professional development events every year, open to IPA members and the public.

===Members of other professional bodies===
Members of certain other professional bodies may apply for certain membership levels with the IPA at an equivalent level based on their existing qualifications. These include members of [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]]), [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] ([[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]]), [[CPA Australia]] ([[CPA Australia|CPA]]) and [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]] ([[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand|CA ANZ]]). The IPA accepts CPA and CA ANZ membership as entry level qualifications.  For overseas professional bodies potential members should refer to the immigration section of the IPA website for [http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/immigration/faqs---academic-evidence#Q2 further details].  The IPA accepts the professional examinations (plus membership) for certain overseas professional bodies.

The IPA collaborates with CPA Australia and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand in supporting the [[Accounting Professional &amp; Ethical Standards Board]] (APESB), founded in 2006.
APESB publishes ethics-related standards that must be followed by accountants in Australia based on the international standards published by the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Member Benefits==

The IPA offers members a range of benefits to assist in their personal and professional lives.  These include:

* Access and complimentary credits for ''Professional Assist'' a leading online technical query service, providing answers from a professional panel of industry experts.

==Mutual recognition==

The IPA has a mutual recognition agreement in place with The [[South African Institute of Professional Accountants]] (SAIPA). Formerly known as Institute of Certified Public Accountants of South Africa.

MIPA/FIPA members of the IPA are recognised by the UK's [[Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment]] (CISI) for admission to CISI's full membership (MCSI). Full membership of the CISI is recognised by several national investment professional bodies such as the [[Financial Services Institute of Australasia]] (FINSIA), formerly the Australian Institute of Banking and Finance and the [[Hong Kong Securities Institute]] (HKSI).

In November 2010 the IPA hosted a delegation of senior executives from Nigeria’s peak accounting body, the [[Association of National Accountants of Nigeria]] (ANAN). An MOU was signed with ANAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nia.org.au/media/123844/nia%20strengthens%20international%20ties%20with%20nigerian%20accounting%20body.pdf NIA Strengthens International Ties with Nigerian Accounting Body]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 the IPA entered into an MOU with peak management accounting body in India, the [[Institute of Cost Accountants of India]].  In 2012, the IPA and the [[Institute of Financial Accountants]] in the United Kingdom announced that they signed and exchanged a formal Collaboration Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/library/media-releases/media-release-ipa-and-ifa-(uk)-sign-collaboration-agreement?categoryid=1698&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, The Members of the Institute of Financial Accountants voted in favour to formally merge with the IPA to operate under a new IPA Group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.accountancylive.com/uk-ifa-and-australian-ipa-institutes-merge Accountancy Live 18 Dec 2014, Retrieved 10 Jan 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013 the IPA and the SMSF Professionals' Association (SPAA) reached a mutual understanding to work together in areas such as accreditation, advocacy, research and policy development, organisational efficiencies, and education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/library/media-releases/media-release-ipa-and-spaa-sign-collaboration-agreement?categoryid=1698&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market recognition==
The IPA has the same Australian legislative recognition as the other two Australian accounting bodies, [[CPA Australia]] (CPA) and the [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]] (CA ANZ).&lt;ref name="ASIC Website"/&gt;  In particular, the three accounting bodies are defined as "professional accounting bodies" in the Corporations Act 2001.  Such recognition entitles each of the three bodies to nominate a representative to the Australian Financial Reporting Council, the Australian Government's peak body responsible for providing oversight of the setting of accounting and auditing standards as well as monitoring the effectiveness of auditor independence requirements in Australia and giving the Government reports and advice on these matters.

The PNA designation was introduced in 2000 as part of a strategy to upgrade the standing of IPA, then NIA, in the Australian market. At the time, to become a PNA, the applicant required a university degree in accounting plus 3 years work experience in accounting.

The IPA became a member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) in November 2004. In order to obtain IFAC membership, the IPA upgraded the academic requirements for the PNA designation, including the requirement of post-graduate qualifications, developed in conjunction with the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].

From 1 July 2005, the IPA upgraded the experience requirements for the PNA designation to a three-year competence-based mentored experience program.  Applicants for this class of membership must demonstrate to a professionally qualified accountant that they have the competence to undertake various tasks required by the IPA．
The IPA is recognised in Government forums and represented on various committees.  These include those of the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] and the [[Australian Taxation Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publicaccountants.org.au/about-us/representation Representation]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2 May 2011, the NIA was rebranded as the Institute of Public Accountants.  In part this rebrand and repositioning is with a view to increase recognition and awareness as well as strengthen designations both nationally and globally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moneymanagement.com.au/news/nia-s-name-change-about-perception-and-recognition&lt;/ref&gt; Since this repositioning, full members (MIPAs and FIPAs) of the IPA use the designation “Public Accountant”.

==Qualifications assessment==
Effective from 1 July 2002, the IPA was gazetted by the Australian Minister for Immigration as an authorised assessing authority for accountants seeking to migrate to Australia under Australia's skilled migration program.  This gives the IPA the authority to assess the accounting qualifications of such persons.

The requirements to obtain a qualification assessment as an accountant for migration purposes are not the same as those for actual membership of IPA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publicaccountants.org.au/migration-assessments Migration Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful QAI applicants are eligible for membership, the IPA assesses for the same core knowledge areas for both membership and QAI.

==Public practice and BAS work==

===My Public Accountant===

In 2012, the IPA Professional Practice Certificate was revamped to bring members a package of easy-to-access services relevant to their accounting practices. The MPA sub brand is the largest uniquely branded accounting practice network in Australia. My Public Accountant members receive personalised My Public Accountant Practice Certificates, window decals, CPE discounts, insurance solutions, access to the Financial Services Package including free financial planning referral service and the benefit of belonging to a larger network of accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/mpa&lt;/ref&gt;

Members at the MIPA or FIPA level of the IPA may apply for a ''MPA Practice Certificate'' after satisfying additional requirements.

MPA members may advertise their businesses on the IPA's [http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/professional-practitioners/find-an-accountant Find an Accountant] database.

===Public BAS Practitioner===

The Public BAS Certificate formally acknowledges the importance of BAS providers to the accounting and financial services sector; and gives long overdue recognition to the growing numbers of accounting professionals who provide services in this space. Benefits of the BAS offer include tailored continuing professional education, templates and checklists, IPA collateral, dedicated partner offerings through Reckon, CCH and Xero, a dedicated technical helpline and heavily discounted Professional Indemnity insurance through our in-house broker. Members who provide BAS services only may apply for a ''Public BAS Practitioner Certificate'' after satisfying additional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/become-a-member/public-bas-practitioner&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Chaine''' (1841 – 4 May 1885)&lt;ref name="rayment"&gt;{{Rayment-hc|a|2|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Irish shipping businessman and a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;Walker, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; politician from [[County Antrim]] in [[Ulster]].

The son of James Chaine of [[Ballycraigy]] and his wife Maria, née Whittle, from [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]], he was educated in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and in 1863 married Henrietta Creery from [[Newcastle, County Down]].&lt;ref name="debrett-1881"&gt;Debrette, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaine was influential in developing the cross-channel links between [[Larne]] and [[Stranraer]], [[Scotland]]. He was the director of the Larne and Stanraer Boat Company, and was the key figure behind the building of the Port and Harbour of [[Larne]].&lt;ref name=C146&gt;Campbell, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted and financed construction of railroad lines from Larne to [[Ballyclare]] and from Larne to [[Ballymena]]&lt;ref name=T54/&gt; (the [[Ballymena and Larne Railway]]). He was elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]] as the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim]],&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt; and held the seat until his death&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt; at the age of 43 in May 1885.&lt;ref name="rayment" /&gt; Chaine, [[Sir James Corry, 1st Baronet|James Porter Corry]] and [[Sir William Ewart, 1st Baronet|William Ewart]] formed a minority of Irish MPs from "the world of the big business" while the majority were either landowners or descendants of the landed families.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 145-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaine himself became a major landowner by the purchase of a ₤64,000 estate in [[Carncastle]] followed by a £22,000 estate in [[Killead]].&lt;ref name=T54&gt;Thomson, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died after catching a chill, which developed into [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; His estate was valued at ₤62,681.&lt;ref name=C146/&gt; He was buried, in an upright position, overlooking [[Larne Lough]], near Sandy Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Long | first = Bill | title = Bright Light, White Water.

'''Khalid bin Abdullah Al Saud''' (born 1937, [[Ta'if]], [[Saudi Arabia]]) ({{lang-ar|خالد بن عبدالله آل سعود}}) is a member of the [[House of Saud]]. He has extensive business interests, run through [[Mawarid Holding]], but is probably better-known as the owner of [[Juddmonte Farms]]. As such, he is one of the leading figures in the world of [[Thoroughbred horse racing|thoroughbred horseracing]] and the list of outstanding horses to have competed in Prince Khalid's racing-colours includes the greats: [[Dancing Brave]], [[Enable (horse)|Enable]], [[Frankel (horse)|Frankel]] and [[Arrogate]].

==Early life==
Prince Khalid is one of the sons of [[Abdullah bin Abdul-Rahman]] a younger half-brother of [[Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz]].Prince Khalid is a half first cousin to all the sons of King Abdulaziz and the six siblings who have ruled modern Saudi Arabia in succession to their father the founder.&lt;ref name="sangster"&gt;Robinson, Patrick and Robinson, Nick.

Prince Khalid's wife, [[Al-Jawhara bint Abd al-Aziz bin Abdul-Rahman Al Saud|Al Jawhara bint Abdulaziz]], is herself a daughter of [[King Abdulaziz]], by his wife [[Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi]]. She is therefore a full sister of the group of sons known as the [[Sudairi Seven]], who include [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] and the present monarch, [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]].

Prince Khalid was born in [[Ta'if]], [[Saudi Arabia]], in 1937. He studied history in the United States and Riyadh,&lt;ref name="Scott interview"&gt;Scott, Brough.

==Horseracing career==

===Development===

Although Prince Khalid's father had owned horses, he had not kept them for racing.&lt;ref name="owners"&gt;[http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/peopleinracing/owners/view.asp?item=001971 "Owners: Prince Khalid Abdullah"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040819224743/http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/peopleinracing/owners/view.asp?item=001971 |date=19 August 2004 }}, [[British Horseracing Authority]]. Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Khalid's introduction to the sport came on a trip to [[Hippodrome de Longchamp|Longchamp]] with friends in 1956. Even so, he did not start owning racehorses himself until the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Ashforth interview"&gt;Ashforth, David. "Khalid Abdullah: Quiet passion of a charming prince who keeps plenty in reserve", ''[[The Racing Post]]'', 24 May 2002.

Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Khalid's purchases of yearlings at that time heralded the start of the large scale investment in horseracing by owners from the Middle East that was to transform the sport.&lt;ref name="sangster"/&gt;

In 1977 Prince Khalid's first racing adviser, the former trainer [[Humphrey Cottrill]], bought for him four yearlings at the Newmarket sales.&lt;ref name="cottrill"&gt;"Humphrey Cottrill dies at 92", [[The Racing Post]], 1 September 1999.

Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Prince Khalid bought the top two lots in the Houghton Sales at Newmarket, although the top-priced yearling, Sand Hawk, for whom he paid a record 264,000 guineas, proved largely a disappointment; as would Convention, for whom he paid 1.4 million guineas in 1983.  However, Cottrill and the trainer [[Jeremy Tree]] had also paid $225,000 for a dark bay colt by [[In Reality]] at the [[Keeneland Sales]] of 1978, their single purchase, as [[Known Fact]], won the [[Middle Park Stakes]] in the autumn of 1979 and then, after [[Nureyev (horse)|Nureyev]]'s disqualification, the [[2,000 Guineas]] of 1980, following up his victory with a win in the [[Queen Elizabeth II Stakes]].&lt;ref name="Breeders' Cup Bios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="owners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashforth interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Patrick and Robinson, Nick. ''Horsetrader: Robert Sangster and the Rise and Fall of the Sport of Kings'', London: Harper Collins (1993), pp. 135-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Known Fact's victory in the 2,000 Guineas was not only Prince Abdullah's first victory in an [[British Classic Races|English Classic race]] but was also the first by any Arab owner.&lt;ref name="Breeders' Cup Bios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cottrill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-jeremy-tree-dies-1496638.html "Racing: Jeremy Tree dies"], [[The Independent]], 9 March 1993.

In 1982 Prince Khalid had his first home-bred winner with Fine Edge at Newmarket.  His Juddmonte breeding operation soon produced [[Warning (horse)|Warning]], by Known Fact out of the broodmare Slightly Dangerous, who became Europe’s champion miler in the 1988 season. Remarkably, Prince Khalid went on to win all five British Classic races with homebred horses: [[Quest for Fame (horse)|Quest For Fame]], sired by Rainbow Quest, won Juddmonte's first [[Epsom Derby]] in 1990, followed by [[Commander in Chief (horse)|Commander In Chief]] (a son of Dancing Brave) in 1993, and finally the fourth-generation Juddmonte-bred [[Workforce (horse)|Workforce]], who broke the course record at Epsom with the victory in 2010.

===Recognition===

In North America, Prince Khalid was the recipient of an [[Eclipse Award]] as Top Owner in 1992 and 2003, and received five awards as the Top Breeder: in 1995, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Breeders' Cup Bios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a short history"&gt;[http://www.the-racehorse.com/bloodstock/features/bloodstock_scene/a_short_history_of_juddmonte_farms "A short history of Juddmonte Farms"], the-racehorse.com, 9 January 2008. 18 June Retrieved 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Prince Khalid finished third in the American owners' championship.

In Europe, Prince Khalid's 78 winners in Britain and 58 winners in France made him the champion owner in both those countries in 2003, and he was [[British flat racing Champion Owner|British flat racing's champion owner]] again in 2010, with 74 winners and prize money of more than £3 million. He took the British title once more in 2011, when he had 63 winners and won more than £3.4 million in prize money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racenewsonline.co.uk/press/newmarket/page18.htm "Media Release: Frankel (GB) Factfile"], Racenews, 29 September 2012.

In 1983 he was made an honorary member of [[The Jockey Club]].&lt;ref name="Breeders' Cup Bios"/&gt;

===Trainers===

Prince Khalid's horses were initially trained mainly by [[Jeremy Tree]], to whom he was introduced by Humphrey Cottrill, and by [[Guy Harwood]], who trained [[Dancing Brave]]. The circle of trainers widened to include the yards of [[Roger Charlton]], [[Andre Fabre]], [[Henry Cecil]], [[Barry Hills]], [[John Gosden]], [[Pascal Bary]], [[Dermot Weld]] and others, as well as latterly [[Sir Michael Stoute]]. In the US, his horses were for a long time in the care of [[Bobby Frankel]].&lt;ref name="Ashforth interview"/&gt; Prince Khalid's support for Cecil helped maintain the trainer's Warren Place stables through lean years in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Lord Grimthorpe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lightning strike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorough care"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry Cecil: 'I don't like to be defeated'"&gt;McGrath, Chris.

Retrieved 18 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juddmonte Farms===

In 1982, Khalid bin Abdullah purchased Cayton Park Stud at [[Wargrave]] in [[Berkshire]], renaming it [[Juddmonte Farms]].  From the early 1980s he built up a collection of carefully selected mares, in the early days buying from [[Robert Sangster]].&lt;ref name="lightning strike"/&gt;  By 2011 these represented, according to Lord Grimthorpe in an interview given to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', "one of the greatest brood-mare bands in the history of breeding”.&lt;ref name="Breeding: it’s all about the pedigree"/&gt;

The British arm of the Juddmonte operations came to include Juddmonte Dullingham and Estcourt Estate in [[Gloucestershire]], as well as Side Hill Stud and Banstead Manor in [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in [[Suffolk]]. There, Prince Khalid stood a number of leading stallions, notably Dansili and Oasis Dream; in 2011 their nomination fee was £65,000 and £85,000 respectively for each mare in foal.&lt;ref name="Breeding: it’s all about the pedigree"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a short history"/&gt; Juddmonte also owns Ferrans Stud and New Abbey Stud in [[Ireland]], as well as Juddmonte Farm in [[Lexington, Kentucky#Horse racing and equestrian events|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]].

The studs in Britain and Ireland are managed by Philip Mitchell, who joined Juddmonte as General Manager of European Operations in 1988, while John Chandler handles arrangements in America. Humphrey Cottrill acted as his racing manager and adviser from 1977 to his retirement in 1982, when he was replaced by Grant Pritchard-Gordon, who was in turn succeeded by the current racing manager, [[Edward Beckett, 5th Baron Grimthorpe|Lord Grimthorpe]], in 1998.&lt;ref name="Breeders' Cup Bios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a short history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord Grimthorpe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Richard. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-humphrey-cottrill-1119188.html "Obituary: Humphrey Cottrill"], ''The Independent'', 15 September 1999. Retrieved 12 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Khalid was responsible for the allocation of horses to trainers and for approval of mating lists. In a rare interview in 2010 he told ''[[The Racing Post]]'': "When I was at the sales I realised that it would be easier to buy horses and race them, but I got the feeling that this was not enough, that it would be more fun to do what people like the [[Aga Khan]] and [[Lord Howard de Walden]] did and build up your own families." He said that he had his stud book with him all the time.&lt;ref name="Scott interview"/&gt;

In 2011 the Juddmonte operation employed around 250 people and extended to 700-800 horses around the world, with a racing stock of about 250.  That year they bought just two yearlings while selling more than 100 horses.  In his ''[[Financial Times]]'' interview Lord Grimthorpe said Juddmonte was "not run as a commercial operation";&lt;ref name="Breeding: it’s all about the pedigree"/&gt; Prince Khalid once told The Racing Post, "It is still my only hobby".&lt;ref name="Scott interview"/&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Legal abuse''' refers to [[abuses]] associated with both [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[Criminal law|criminal]] legal action.  Abuse can originate from nearly any part of the legal system, including [[frivolous litigation|frivolous]] and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]] [[litigants]], [[police misconduct|abuses by law enforcement]], [[legal malpractice|incompetent, careless or corrupt attorneys]] and [[judicial misconduct|misconduct from the judiciary]] itself.&lt;ref name="r_chance"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Chance |first1= Randal P.|title= RAPED by the STATE: Fractured Justice - Legal Abuse|year= 2004 |publisher= AuthorHouse |isbn= 978-1-4140-5005-8 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=IjZu6sM4r6EC&amp;pg=PA463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r_colombo"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Colombo | first1= R. | title= Fight Back Legal Abuse: How to Protect Yourself From Your Own Attorney | year= 2010 | publisher= Morgan James Publishing | isbn= 978-1-60037-709-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal abuse is responsible not only for [[injustice]], but also harm to [[Health|physical]], [[mental health|psychological]] and [[society|societal]] health.*&lt;ref name="huffer_02"&gt;{{cite book | last1= Huffer | first1= Karin | title= Legal Abuse Syndrome | date= June 1995 | publisher= Karin Huffer | isbn= 0-9641786-0-5 | url= http://www.judicialaccountability.org/legalabuse.htm | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726212148/http://www.judicialaccountability.org/legalabuse.htm | archivedate= 2011-07-26 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Abuses can originate from virtually every part of the legal system. [[Litigants]], [[Attorney at law|attorneys]], [[law enforcement]] and [[judiciary]] can abuse the system, sometimes accidentally but more often intentionally. Legal abuse can also be [[Structural abuse|systemic]], such as when the principles, processes, and consequences of law itself encourage and enable individuals to legally harm others.

===Abusive litigants===
{{main|Vexatious litigation|Frivolous litigation|Strategic lawsuit against public participation|Frameup}}
Abusive litigants in [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] are most often classified as vexatious litigation, frivolous litigation, or both.  A ''vexatious litigant'' seeks to [[harass]] or subdue an adversary.  A ''frivolous litigant'' starts or carries on actions that have little or no merit and are very unlikely to be won.  Litigants of this sort are often unable to find [[advocate|representation]] willing to accommodate them and thus must represent themselves [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|in propria persona]].

There can often be considerable overlap between these two types of abuse.  One case in point is the ''strategic lawsuit against public participation'' (SLAPP), which is a lawsuit intended to censor, [[intimidate]] and silence critics by fear, intimidation and burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition. Such actions are self-evidently vexatious, but are typically frivolous as well in that the plaintiff does not expect, or even intend, to win.

Litigants can abuse the system in [[criminal]] ways as well.  Some of the forms of criminal legal system abuse are [[jury tampering]], the practice of directing enticements or threats to jurors in order to influence their deliberations, and [[Falsified evidence|falsification of evidence]], which refers to any of a variety of ways [[evidence]] is improperly manipulated. One particular case of falsifying evidence is the ''frameup'', a chiefly American term for the manufacture or manipulation of evidence for the purpose of indicating the guilt of an innocent party.

===Law enforcement abuse===
{{main|Police misconduct}}
There are a plethora of ways that [[law enforcement|police and law enforcement]] can undermine the [[rights]] of citizens.  Sometimes such abuses are unintentional, brought about by circumstance, imperfect understanding of some subtlety of law, or other kinds of [[good-faith]] mistakes.  In other cases rights are abused deliberately, due to [[prejudice]], self-interest, [[vigilante|vigilantism]], impaired [[value judgment]], [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] or [[corruption]].  Such [[police misconduct]] can take many forms, among them [[false arrest]], [[harassment]], [[police brutality]], [[falsification of evidence]], [[coercion]] and in rare cases, [[torture]] and [[false imprisonment]].

===Abusive advocates===
{{main|Attorney misconduct}}
[[Lawyers]], [[paralegals]] and other professionals involved in legal advocacy can abuse the system in a number of ways.  In some cases, representation may be well-intended but nonetheless incompetent.  In others, lawyers engage in [[attorney misconduct|misconduct]] in an effort to gain unfair advantage for their clients or in pursuit of some [[Ethical egoism|self-interest]].&lt;ref name="r_colombo"/&gt;

===Abusive judiciary===
{{main|Judicial misconduct}}
Abuse from the [[bench (law)|bench]] can arise from various causes, including incompetence, [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], [[impartiality|bias or prejudice]], judicial misconduct and [[Judicial corruption|corruption]].

==Consequences of abuse==
Although the primary consequence of unaddressed legal-system abuse for victims is [[injustice]], abuses of the legal system inflict harm in many other ways.  [[Civil law (common law)|Civil litigation]] and [[criminal defense]] of the innocent impose [[Chronic stress|psychological stress]], often severe, upon the parties involved.  Often such stress will affect [[health|physical health]] as well.  When the system is abused and justice is denied as a result, stress and its effects can be exacerbated enormously.&lt;ref name="r_chance"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2013}} [[Karin P. Huffer]], M.S., M.F.T. hypothesized the condition Legal Abuse Syndrome (LAS) as a form of [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) caused by ethical violation, legal abuse, [[betrayal]], [[abuse of power]], [[abuse of authority]], lack of accountability and [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="huffer_02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffer_01"&gt;{{cite book| last1= Huffer | first1= Karin | title= Overcoming the Devastation of Legal Abuse Syndrome | year= 1995 | publisher= Karin Huffer | isbn= 978-0-9641786-0-1 | url= http://www.child-abuses.com/legal-abuse/legal-definition-abuse.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic and [[wiktionary:high-profile|high-profile]] legal abuse have [[society|societal]] effects as well, including distrust of the law, law enforcement and the legal system, [[rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]] of small crimes by ordinarily honest citizens, and psychological stress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

'''Logistics Support Analysis''' (LSA) is a structured approach to increase efficiency of maintenance and reduces the cost of providing support by preplanning all aspects of [[Integrated Logistics Support]].  A successful LSA will define those support requirements that are ideal for the system design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneil.com/military/analysis.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708025651/http://www.oneil.com/military/analysis.cfm |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Logistics Support Analysis was codified into a military standard in 1973 with the publication of [[United States Military Standard|Military Standard]] 1388-1. Logistic Support Analysis (LSA) guidelines and requirements were established by Department of Defense (DOD) Instruction 5000.2, Major System Acquisition Procedures, and DOD Directive 5000.39, Acquisition and Management of Integrated Logistic Support for Systems and Equipment, to create a single, uniform approach by the Military Services to improve supportability of military weapon systems through a disciplined approach to defining the required operational support other Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) objectives during the acquisition development phase. 1388-1A was updated in 1983 and 1991 before being downgraded from a standard to a best practice on 26 November 1996. 1388-2A was updated in 1991 and 1993, and was also cancelled as a standard in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-1300-1399/MIL_STD_1388_1A_552/ MIL-STD-1388]&lt;/ref&gt;  The definitions for the database records of LSA were established by the Logistics Support Analysis Record, MIL-STD-1388-2A, on 20 JULY 84.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-1300-1399/MIL-STD-1388-2B_21788/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the US Army began to transform the paper-intensive LSAR into a desktop application known as “Computer Aided Logistics Support” (CALS).  The Navy began a similar effort in 1987. In 1991, the programs were combined and expanded to all services under the name Joint CALS (JCALS). JCALS was approved for use in August 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2000/army/00jcals.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA183948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/Images/lsar%20wp%20W%201_tcm1023-5601.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, as part of the OSD Mandate For Change, MIL-STD-1388 was cancelled. It was briefly replaced by MIL-PRF-49506&lt;ref&gt;MIL-PRF-49506, Logistics Management information, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; while a "civilian" replacement was being sought.

Alternative military specifications from other countries appeared as a replacement for MIL-STD-1388, namely DEF STAN 00-60 by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]]in 1998 (later replaced by DEF STAN 00-600 in 2010) or DEF (AUST) 5692&lt;ref&gt;DEF (AUST) 5692, Logistic Support Analysis Record Requirements for the Australian Defence Organization, dated 1 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; by the Australian Department of Defence in 2003. These military specifications had only limited distribution (typically only in their own countries) and MIL-STD-1388 was still requested by many military procurement contracts in different countries even after its cancellation.

Due to the disappearance of MIL-STD-1388, two "civilian" initiatives appeared to replace the LSA process. One was developed within the framework of the Government Electronics and Information Technology Association (GEIA), which lead to the publication of GEIA-STD-0007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.sae.org/wip/geiastd0007c/ GEIA-STD-0007, Logistics Product Data]&lt;/ref&gt; and associated GEIA-HB-0007&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.sae.org/geiahb0007/ SAE GEIA-HB-0007, Logistics Product Data Handbook, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[SAE International]] in 2007. The second one was the S3000L, published by the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s3000l.org S3000L - International specification for Logistics Support Analysis - LSA]&lt;/ref&gt; While the GEIA specification is mainly used in the US and only for military programs, S3000L has been more widely adopted, mainly in [[Europe]], but also outside it for both civilian and military projects.

==MIL-STD-1388 Structure==
As originally envisioned, the LSA data was structured as a LSA Record (LSAR), as defined by MIL-STD-1388-1A (records) and MIL-STD-1388-2A (outputs)

Tasks:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|100 || Programming, planning and control
|-
|200 || Mission and support system definition
|-
|300 || Preparation and evaluation of alternatives
|-
|400 || Determine logistics support resource requirements
|-
|500 || Supportability assessment 
|}

LSAR output was structured as:
:15 Data records
:115 Date cards
:547 Data elements
:80 STD report formats
:104 Relational tables
:518 Data elements
:48 STD report formats

A similar structure was used by DEF STAN 00-60 and DEF (AUST) 5692.

'''Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli''' (sometimes ''Paccioli'' or ''Paciolo''; {{circa}} 1447 &amp;ndash; 19 June 1517)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sj6RDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Fra+Luca+Bartolomeo+de+Pacioli+19+giugno+1517&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidh6SZ3-neAhVVOMAKHaHNBdAQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fra%20Luca%20Bartolomeo%20de%20Pacioli%2019%20giugno%201517&amp;f=false Profile of Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]], [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], collaborator with [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and an early contributor to the field now known as [[accounting]]. He is referred to as "The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping" in Europe and he was the first person to publish a work on the [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry system of book-keeping]] on the continent.&lt;ref name=jkdiwan&gt;{{cite book |last=Diwan |first=Jaswith |title=Accounting Concepts &amp; Theories |publisher=Morre |location=London |id=id# 94452 |pages=001–002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also called '''Luca di Borgo''' after his birthplace, [[Sansepolcro|Borgo Sansepolcro]], [[Tuscany]].

==Life==

Luca Pacioli was born between 1446 and 1448 in the Tuscan town of [[Sansepolcro]] where he received an [[Abacus school|abbaco education]]. This was education in the vernacular (''i.e.'', the local tongue) rather than Latin and focused on the knowledge required of merchants. His father was Bartolomeo Pacioli; however, Luca Pacioli was said to have lived with the Befolci family as a child in his birth town Sansepolcro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Pacioli.html|title=Pacioli biography|website=www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Venice]] around 1464, where he continued his own education while working as a tutor to the three sons of a merchant. It was during this period that he wrote his first book, a treatise on arithmetic for the boys he was tutoring. Between 1472 and 1475, he became a [[Franciscan]] friar. Thus, Luca Pacioli could be referred to simply as Friar Luca. 

In 1475, he started teaching in Perugia, first as a private teacher, from 1477 holding the first chair in mathematics. He wrote a comprehensive textbook in the vernacular for his students. He continued to work as a private tutor of [[mathematics]] and was instructed to stop teaching at this level in Sansepolcro in 1491. In 1494, his first book, ''[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de arithmetica, geometria, Proportioni et proportionalita]]'', was published in Venice. In 1497, he accepted an invitation from Duke [[Ludovico Sforza]] to work in [[Milan]]. There he met, taught mathematics to, collaborated, and lived with [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. In 1499, Pacioli and Leonardo were forced to flee Milan when [[Louis XII of France]] seized the city and drove out their patron. Their paths appear to have finally separated around 1506. Pacioli died at about the age of 70 on 19 June 1517, most likely in Sansepolcro where it is thought that he had spent much of his final years.

{{further|Mathematics and art}}

Pacioli published several works on [[mathematics]], including:
*''Tractatus mathematicus ad discipulos perusinos'' (Ms. Vatican Library, Lat. 3129), a nearly 600-page textbook dedicated to his students at the University of Perugia where Pacioli taught from 1477 to 1480. The manuscript was written between December 1477 and 29 April 1478. It contains 16 sections on merchant arithmetic, such as barter, exchange, profit, mixing metals, and algebra. One part of 25 pages is missing from the chapter on algebra. A modern transcription has been published by Calzoni and Cavazzoni (1996) along with a partial translation of the chapter on partitioning problems (Heeffer, 2010).
*''[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de arithmetica, geometria. Proportioni et proportionalita]]'' ([[Venice]] 1494), a textbook for use in the schools of Northern Italy. It was a synthesis of the mathematical knowledge of his time and contained the first printed work on algebra written in the vernacular (''i.e.'', the spoken language of the day). It is also notable for including one of the first published descriptions of the bookkeeping method that Venetian merchants used during the Italian Renaissance, known as the [[double-entry accounting system]]. The system he published included most of the accounting cycle as we know it today. He described the use of journals and ledgers, and warned that a person should not go to sleep at night until the debits equaled the credits. His ledger had accounts for assets (including receivables and inventories), liabilities, capital, income, and expenses — the account categories that are reported on an organization's [[balance sheet]] and [[income statement]], respectively. He demonstrated year-end closing entries and proposed that a [[trial balance]] be used to prove a balanced ledger.  He is widely considered the "Father of Accounting". Additionally, his treatise touches on a wide range of related topics from [[accounting ethics]] to [[cost accounting]]. He introduced the [[Rule of 72]], using an approximation of 100*ln 2 more than 100 years before [[John Napier|Napier]] and Briggs.&lt;ref name="paccioliLog"&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Pacioli_logarithm.html St-and.ac.uk] A Napierian logarithm before Napier, John J O'Connor and Edmund F Robertson&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''De viribus quantitatis'' (Ms. Università degli Studi di Bologna, 1496–1508), a treatise on mathematics and magic. Written between 1496 and 1508, it contains the first reference to card tricks as well as guidance on how to juggle, eat fire, and make coins dance. It is the first work to note that Leonardo was left-handed. ''De viribus quantitatis'' is divided into three sections: mathematical problems, puzzles, and tricks, along with a collection of proverbs and verses. The book has been described as the "foundation of modern magic and numerical puzzles", but it was never published and sat in the archives of the University of Bologna, where it was seen by only a small number of scholars during the Middle Ages. The book was rediscovered after [[David Singmaster]], a mathematician, came across a reference to it in a 19th-century manuscript. An English translation was published for the first time in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=And that's renaissance magic ...|last=McDonald|first=Lucy|date=10 April 2007|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/italy/story/0,,2053433,00.html|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Geometry'' (1509), a Latin translation of [[Euclid]]'s [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']].
* ''[[De divina proportione]]'' (written in Milan in 1496–98, published in Venice in 1509). Two versions of the original manuscript are extant, one in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the other in the Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire in Geneva. The subject was mathematical and artistic proportion, especially the mathematics of the [[golden ratio]] and its application in [[architecture]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew the illustrations of the regular solids in ''De divina proportione'' while he lived with and took mathematics lessons from Pacioli. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of [[skeletonic]] solids, which allowed an easy distinction between front and back. The work also discusses the use of perspective by painters such as [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Melozzo da Forlì]], and [[Marco Palmezzano]]. As a side note, the "M" logo used by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City is taken from ''De divina proportione''.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://store.metmuseum.org/magnets+bookmarks/renaissance-m-bookmark/invt/10086668 The Met Store (Metropolitan Museum of Art shopping catalog), "Renaissance 'M' Bookmark"]
The Museum claims this origin in its descriptions of many souvenir items decorated with this logo, which it calls the "Renaissance M".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation of Piero della Francesca's work===

The majority of the second volume of ''Summa de arithmetica, geometria. Proportioni et proportionalita'' was a slightly rewritten version of one of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s works. The third volume of Pacioli's ''De divina proportione'' was an Italian translation of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s Latin writings ''On [the] Five Regular Solids''. In neither case, did Pacioli include an attribution to Piero. He was severely criticized for this and accused of plagiarism by sixteenth-century art historian and biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]]. R. Emmett Taylor (1889–1956) said that Pacioli may have had nothing to do with the translated volume ''De divina proportione'', and that it may just have been appended to his work. However, no such defence can be presented concerning the inclusion of Piero della Francesca's material in Pacioli's Summa.

== Impact on accounting and business ==
Pacioli dramatically affected the practice of accounting by describing the double-entry accounting method used in parts of Italy. This revolutionized how businesses oversaw their operations, enabling improved efficiency and profitability. The ''Summa'''s section on accounting was used internationally as an accounting textbook up to the mid-16th century. The essentials of double-entry accounting have for the most part remain unchanged for over 500 years. "Accounting practitioners in public accounting, industry, and not-for-profit organizations, as well as investors, lending institutions, business firms, and all other users for financial information are indebted to Luca Pacioli for his monumental role in the development of accounting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Murphy|date=2018|title=Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2320658|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2320658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ICAEW]] Library’s rare book collection at [[Chartered Accountants' Hall]] holds the complete published works of Luca Pacioli. Sections of two of Pacioli's books, 'Summa de arithmetica' and 'Divina proportione' can be viewed online using Turning the Pages, an interactive tool developed by the British Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turning the Pages: ICAEW's collection of rare books |url=https://www.icaew.com/archive/technical/practice-resources/icaew-practice-support/practicewire/news/turning-the-pages |website=ICAEW.com |publisher=ICAEW |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Chess==
Luca Pacioli also wrote an unpublished treatise on [[chess]], ''[[De ludo scachorum]]'' (''On the Game of Chess''). Long thought to have been lost, a surviving [[manuscript]] was rediscovered in 2006, in the 22,000-volume library of Count Guglielmo Coronini. A facsimile edition of the book was published in Pacioli's home town of Sansepolcro in 2008. Based on Leonardo da Vinci's long association with the author and his having illustrated ''De divina proportione'', some scholars speculate that Leonardo either drew the [[chess problem]]s that appear in the manuscript or at least designed the chess pieces used in the problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article3523718.ece Times Online: Renaissance chess master and the Da Vinci decode mystery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/14/europe/EU-GEN-Italy-Da-Vinci-Chess-Code.php International Herald Tribune: Experts link Leonardo da Vinci to chess puzzles in long-lost Renaissance treatise]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/life/story/4150848p-4739893c.html Winnipeg Free Press: Chess]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2008-03-14-leondardo-chess-puzzles_N.htm Experts link Leonardo da Vinci to chess puzzles]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7130">The '''MaxDiff''' is a long-established academic mathematical theory with very specific assumptions about how people make choices:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some probabilistic models of best, worst, and best–worst choices|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249605000441|journal = Journal of Mathematical Psychology|date = 2005-01-01|pages = 464–480|volume = 49|issue = 6|first = Anthony AJ|last = Marley|first2 = Jordan J.|last2 = Louviere|doi=10.1016/j.jmp.2005.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; it assumes that respondents evaluate all possible pairs of items within the displayed set and choose the pair that reflects the maximum difference in preference or importance. It may be thought of as a variation of the method of [[Pairwise comparison|Paired Comparisons]]. Consider a set in which a respondent evaluates four items: A, B, C and D. If the respondent says that A is best and D is worst, these two responses inform us on five of six possible implied paired comparisons:
: A &gt; B, A &gt; C, A &gt; D, B &gt; D, C &gt; D

The only paired comparison that cannot be inferred is B vs. C. In a choice among five items, MaxDiff questioning informs on seven of ten implied paired comparisons.

== Overview ==
In 1938 Richardson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multimensional psychophysics|journal = Psychological Bulletin |date = 1938|pages = 659–660|volume = 35|first = MW|last = Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a choice method in which subjects reported the most alike pair of a triad and the most different pair. The component of this method involving the most different pair may be properly called “MaxDiff” in contrast to a “most-least” or “best-worst” method where both the most different pair and the direction of difference are obtained. Ennis, Mullen and Frijters (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Variants of the method of triads: Unidimensional Thursonian models|journal = British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology|date = 1988|pages = 25–36|volume = 41|first = Daniel M|last = Ennis|first2 = Kenneth|last2 = Mullen|first3 = Jan ER|last3 = Frijters}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived a unidimensional Thurstonian scaling model for Richardson’s method of triads so that the results could be scaled under normality assumptions about the item percepts.

It should be noted that MaxDiff may involve multidimensional percepts, unlike most-least models that assume a unidimensional representation. MaxDiff and most-least methods belong to a class of methods that do not require the estimation of a cognitive parameter as occurs in the analysis of ratings data. This is one of the reasons for their popularity in applications.  Other methods in this class include the 2- and 3-alternative forced choice methods, the triangular method which is a special case of Richardson's method, the duo-trio method and the specified and unspecified methods of tetrads. All of these methods have well developed Thurstonian scaling models as discussed recently in Ennis (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ennis|first1=Daniel M|title=Thurstonian Models:  Categorical Decision Making in the Presence of Noise|date=June 2016|publisher=The Institute for Perception|isbn=9780990644606|ref=bws}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also includes a Thurstonian model for first-last or most-least choice and ranks with rank-induced dependencies. There are a number of possible processes through which subjects may make a most-least decision, including paired comparisons and ranking, but it is typically not known how the decision is reached.

== Relationship to best–worst scaling ==
Maxdiff and [[best–worst scaling]] (BWS) have erroneously been considered synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Louviere|first1=Jordan J|last2=Flynn|first2=Terry N|last3=Marley|first3=A A J|title=Best-Worst Scaling: Theory, Methods and Applications|date=September 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107043152|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/economics/econometrics-statistics-and-mathematical-economics/best-worst-scaling-theory-methods-and-applications|accessdate=2 October 2015|ref=bws}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents can produce best-worst data in any of a number of ways, with a maxdiff process being but one. Instead of evaluating all possible pairs (the maxdiff model), they might choose the best from n items, the worst from the remaining n-1, or vice versa (sequential models). Or indeed they may use another method entirely. Thus it should be clear that maxdiff is a subset of BWS; maxdiff is BWS, but BWS is not necessarily maxdiff. Indeed, maxdiff might not be considered an attractive model on psychological and intuitive grounds: as the number of items increases, the number of possible pairs increases in a multiplicative fashion: n items produces n(n-1) pairs (where best-worst order matters). Assuming respondents do evaluate all possible pairs is a strong assumption. Early work did use the term maxdiff to refer to BWS, but with Marley's return to the field,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some probabilistic models of best, worst, and best–worst choices|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249605000441|journal = Journal of Mathematical Psychology|date = 2005-12-01|pages = 464–480|volume = 49|series = Special Issue Honoring Jean-Claude Falmagne: Part 1|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.jmp.2005.05.003|first = A. A. J.|last = Marley|first2 = J. J.|last2 = Louviere}}&lt;/ref&gt; correct academic terminology has been disseminated throughout Europe and Asia-Pacific.

== Commercial software named maxdiff ==
In North America the term maxdiff continues to be used for studies that are in fact BWS studies. This probably reflects the fact that [[Sawtooth Software]] in the United States implements a procedure it has named maxdiff. Indeed, it is unclear whether this procedure implements maxdiff procedures in estimating parameters of their models, or whether the simpler, sequential BWS model is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimating preferences for a dermatology consultation using Best-Worst Scaling: Comparison of various methods of analysis|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/8/76/abstract|journal = BMC Medical Research Methodology|date = 2008-11-18|issn = 1471-2288|pmc = 2600822|pmid = 19017376|pages = 76|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1471-2288-8-76|language = en|first = Terry N.|last = Flynn|first2 = Jordan J.|last2 = Louviere|first3 = Tim J.|last3 = Peters|first4 = Joanna|last4 = Coast}}  {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Datagame]] has implemented an application called MaxDiff Rankifier which uses [[gamification]] techniques and interactive visuals to streamline the data collection process.

==Conduct and analysis of a maxdiff survey==
A maxdiff survey may be designed and analysed in two ways:
# Through manual design and researcher-led analysis using standard statistical software procedures (see [[Best-Worst Scaling|BWS]]) or
# By utilising a commercial survey company which supports this type of discrete choice model.

Their duties include creating an effective working environment, administrating the work process, making sure it is compliant with organization's requirements, leading people and reporting to the highest level of management.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang |first1=Ann Yan|last2=Tsui|first2=Anne S.|last3=Song|first3=Lynda Jiwen|last4=Li|first4=Chaoping|last5=Jia|first5=Liangding|year=2008|title=How do I trust thee?

Since the late 20th century, middle management has been reduced in businesses and organizations as a result of [[reorganization]] and [[outsourcing]]. Such changes include [[Layoff|downsizing]], [[delayering]] and [[outsourcing]]. These changes are made in an effort to reduce costs and to make the organization [[flat organization|flatter]]—subsequently increasing the [[employee]]s responsibilities and flexibility.

==Role in an organization==

===Functions of a middle manager===
A middle manager is a link between the [[senior management]] and the lower (junior) levels of the organization. Due to involvement into day-to-day running of a business, middle managers have the opportunity to report valuable information and suggestions from the inside of an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Likert|first1=R|title=New Patterns of Management|date=1961 |publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New-York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the middle manager is a channel of communication within the organization, as they pass on major decisions of executives and the main goals of an organization to lower levels of employees. This contributes to better coordination between workers and makes a company more united.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnard |first1=Chester I.|title=The Functions of the Executive|date=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Primary responsibility of a middle manager is to implement a strategy, created by the executive level, in the most efficient way possible. In order to reach the target goals, manager may adjust and interpret the initial plan.&lt;ref name=floyd92&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Floyd|first1=S. W.|last2=Wooldridge|first2=B.|title=Middle management involvement in strategy and its association with strategic type: A research note.|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=1992|volume=13|issue=S1|pages=153–167|doi=10.1002/smj.4250131012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other functions can be divided into three main categories:&lt;ref name=linemanager /&gt;
* '''Technical'''
Middle managers are in charge of facilitating any changes needed in an organization and creating an effective working environment. They administer day-to-day routines, monitors performance and make sure everything is done in compliance with organization's needs.&lt;ref name=trust /&gt;
* '''Human resources'''
One of the most important functions of a middle manager is motivating, leading and inspiring their subordinates. This also includes building a team and supporting any team member when necessary. 
* '''Strategic'''
Strategic functions involve analyzing a subordinate group in terms of productivity and financial effectiveness, creating a strategy of improving the current situation and reporting to the executive management in the form of attending a boardroom meeting or a discussion.

===Competencies===
A number of competencies critical to become an effective middle manager.
* '''Leadership'''. The most important competency that consists of many skills. As an inherent leader, middle managers have to possess sense-making and persuading skills. They must be able to motivate, influence and guide their subordinates, become a role model for them, demonstrate the quality and the level of work contribution necessary for the organization and engage in continuous self-development and learning.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;&lt;ref name=sensemaking&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rouleau|first1=L.|last2=Balogun|first2=J.|title=Middle managers, strategic sensemaking, and discursive competence.|journal=Journal of Management Studies|date=2011|volume=48|issue=5|pages=953–983|url=http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/51519/1/10.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00941.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Decision-making'''. Ability to quickly solve the problems, make decisions under pressure and take responsibility for the outcome.
* '''Creativity &amp; Visioning'''. Managers should have a clear vision of the strategy implementation and be creative in overcoming the possible difficulties.&lt;ref name=linemanager /&gt;
* '''Performance management'''. Involves managing the performance of subordinates and, specifically, the line managers, effectively, by setting clear and measurable objectives for them and provide coaching. Middle managers must be also skilled in presenting, persuading and influencing people.

===Middle manager vs. line manager===
A middle management position is often mistakenly described as a similar to the [[line management]] one. However, there are some differences:&lt;ref name=linemanager /&gt;
*  '''Middle manager is a semi-executive position''' – line managers are promoted to become middle managers. Thus, middle managers enjoy greater salary, benefits and a closer position to a boardroom.
* '''System of subordination''' – line managers are subordinate to middle managers. Middle managers are responsible for large teams and are unable to control performance of every single individual. Thus, direct or line manager measures the team performance and reports to the middle manager.
* '''Set of duties''' – unlike line managers, who have a clear procedure of work and set of duties, middle managers have only target goals. The way of achieving those goals is decided by manager independently.

==Criticism==
The role of middle management is subjected to a number of criticisms. This position is often seen as unnecessary and middle managers are blamed for holding back the organization from achieving its full potential and using the influence for their own purposes.

===Influence===
Middle management is often accused of possessing too much influence. Their centric position in an organization allows to influence strategy and actions in "both upward and downward direction".&lt;ref name=floyd92 /&gt; When supplying information to the executive level, middle managers interpret it subjectively and may insinuate it with their own opinion and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranson|first1=S.|last2=Hinings|first2=B.|last3=Greenwood|first3=R.|title=The structuring of organizational structures|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly |date=1980|volume=25|pages=1–17|doi=10.2307/2392223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, proximity to the boardroom makes it easy for the manager to promote his or her own interests, by "synthesizing" the information and presenting data from a certain strategic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutton|first1=J. E.|last2=Duncan|first2=R. B.|title=The influence of the strategic planning process on strategic change|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=1987|volume=8|pages=103–116|doi=10.1002/smj.4250080202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same level of influence can be exploited by a middle manager towards the lower staff. Driven by the reasons of maintaining a reputation, strengthening the power and influence, middle manager may introduce company's major strategic decisions in a light, beneficial way for his or her designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Floyd|first1=Steven W.|last2=Wooldridge|first2=Bill|title=Middle management's strategic influence and organizational performance|journal=Journal of Management Studies|date=1997|volume=3|issue=34|pages=466–482|doi=10.1111/1467-6486.00059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===
Middle managers' reluctance to lose control in their teams and satisfaction with a settled situation could lead to their resistance in any changes in the strategy or direction of an organization. Usually, the resistance does not take an aggressive form such as refusal to carry out tasks or unconcealed confrontation, but result in a lack of support and eagerness to convey only those tasks, impact of which is clearly visible to the top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connors|first1=J. L.|last2=Rom berg|first2=T. A.|title=Middle management and quality control: Strategies for obstructionism|journal=Human organization|date=1991|volume=50|pages=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates barriers to a growth of a company and lags the overall working process.

===Necessity===
The overall necessity of middle managers in an organization is questioned. They are said to be too costly, non-effective and constantly underperforming employees. It has been stated{{By whom|date=June 2018}} that middle managers do not carry out their main duties of linking the organization and reporting effectively, which leads to a block of communication between different levels of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scarbrough|first1=H.|last2=Burrell|first2=G.|authorlink2=Gibson Burrell| editor1-last=Clegg|editor1-first=S.|editor2-last=Palmer|editor2-first=G.|title=The Axeman Cometh: the changing role and knowledge of middle managers|journal=The politics of management knowledge|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as rapid growth of globalization put pressures on businesses in terms of cost effectiveness and speed of information flow within the organization, middle management make companies less flexible and competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dopson|first1=S.|last2=Stewart|first2=R.|title=Information technology, organizational restructuring and the future of middle management|journal=New Technology, Work and Employment|date=1993|volume=1|issue=8|pages=10–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Development of [[information technology]] enabled an increase in the span of control and reduced the need for middle management. Moreover, an increasingly big number of modern organizations become flatter and downsized in the pursuit of flexibility, higher competitiveness and innovation. According to David Williams, flat organizations promote greater intercommunication and efficiency of the workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=David|title=The End Of Middle Managers (And Why They'll Never Be Missed) |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkwilliams/2012/07/10/the-end-of-middle-managers-and-why-theyll-never-be-missed/|website=forbes.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many organizations are being restructured, middle management is being reduced and their roles are thought to be out-dated and unnecessary.   

At the same time, there is still a need in a middle manager as an employee and they continue playing a significant role in organizations, specifically in setting an overall strategy and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balogun|first1=J|title=From Blaming the Middle to Harnessing its Potential: Creating Change Intermediaries|journal=British Journal of Management |date=2003|volume=14|issue=1|pages=69–83|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.00266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the global market forced them to become more flexible, stress-resistant, acquire new skills.

[[Malay styles and titles|Tan Sri]] '''Mokhzani bin Mahathir''' (born 2 January 1961) is a Malaysian businessman who has been listed as the 14th richest person in Malaysia. He worked as a petroleum engineer before founding oil-equipment fabricator Kencana Petroleum. Kencana Petroleum later merged with SapuraCrest to form SapuraKencana Petroleum. The company is now known as [[Sapura Energy]].&lt;ref name="Forbes Billionaires"/&gt;

Mokhzani was formerly a senior official in UMNO Youth, but has since retired from politics. He is the eldest son of the current [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]].

==Career==
Like his younger brother [[Mukhriz Mahathir|Mukhriz]], Mokhzani is a businessman and had played an active role in [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), and at one time serving as the Youth's Wing treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2001/nf20010618_117.htm Can Mahathir Run Malaysia Minus His "Alter Ego"?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-04/28/article9.shtml Mahathir's Son Leaves Corporate World]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, Mokhzani was an UMNO delegate of one of the constituencies in [[Kedah]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=44321 Mahathir loses bid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315092733/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=44321 |date=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since lain dormant in his political activities. In May 2008, he followed his father's footsteps to quit UMNO,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/5/21/nation/20080521095840&amp;sec=nation Mokhzani quits Umno (Update 2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523162626/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F5%2F21%2Fnation%2F20080521095840&amp;sec=nation |date=23 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after 22 years as a member of the Sungai Layar Hujung branch of UMNO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/5/22/nation/21321495&amp;sec=nation Mokhzani ends 22-year ties with Umno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524024040/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F5%2F22%2Fnation%2F21321495&amp;sec=nation |date=24 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Mokhzani Mahathir merged his Kencana Petroleum with SapuraCrest, run by childhood friend Shahril Shamsuddin. He stepped down from an executive role in January 2014 to concentrate on his other investments. The following month he trimmed his stake in SapuraKencana, the country's largest oil-and-gas services provider, to just over 10%, selling $248 million worth of shares. He sits on the board of not only SapuraKencana but also telecom giant Maxis and fiber-optics cable company Opcom Holdings. He's a cornerstone investor in IHH Healthcare and Astro Malaysia Holdings. But he focuses on the sector he knows best, oil and gas, where he cut his teeth as a petroleum engineer out of college. In July 2013, when news of his investment in another oil-services company, Yinson Holdings, surfaced, its stock went on a tear. He is also the chairman of the [[Sepang Circuit]], which hosts the [[Formula 1 World Championship]] in Malaysia.

==Personal life==
Mokhzani was born on 2 January 1961, in [[Alor Setar]], to [[Mahathir Mohamad]], then a practicing doctor, and [[Siti Hasmah]].

Mokhzani is currently married to Mastisa Mohamed, a businesswoman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.asiatatler.com/300list/mastisa-mohamed Puan Sri Mastisa Mohamed]&lt;/ref&gt; Together they have five children, and currently reside in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/mokhzani-mahathir/# Mokhzani Mahathir on Forbes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal fortune==
Mokhzani has been listed as the 14th richest person in Malaysia by ''[[Forbes Asia]]'' with an estimated net worth of US$685 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Forbes.com|title=The 40 Richest Malaysians|accessdate=8 August 2012|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2012/84/malaysia-billionaires-12_land.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Mokhzani is also the chairman of the [[Sepang International Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-143029059.html Mokhzani tastes victory]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6598">[[File:5 Elgin Railway Station - Molteno brothers Wintersdrift - SA.jpg|thumb|Molteno Brothers produce at the station at Glen Elgin]]

The '''Molteno Brothers''', Edward (1877-1950) and Harry (1880-1969) Molteno, were sons of Cape Prime Minister [[John Charles Molteno|John Molteno]] by his third wife Sobella Maria. Pioneering and successful exporters, they had a huge influence on South Africa's fruit industry. 

They divided up and donated most of their farming enterprise, to be distributed to, and used for the benefit of, Elgin farm workers. After his death, the younger brother Harry left the remainder as a [[trust fund]] that continues their charitable work to this day.&lt;ref&gt;C. Schoeman: ''The Historical Overberg. Traces of the Past in South Africa's Southernmost Region''. Penguin Random House South Africa. 2017. {{ISBN|978-1-77609-072-3}} p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:CT Elgin Apples - Molteno Brothers UnionCastle exporting.jpg|thumb|Glen Elgin produce being loaded for export at Cape Town harbour.]]
[[File:Apple farming in Elgin - South Africa.jpg|thumb|The undulating hills of the [[Elgin, Western Cape|Elgin region]].]]

The two brothers had long had an interest in building the agricultural export industry of southern Africa; in fact, their father had conducted one of the first experimental mass exports of South African fruit (chartering the Brig ''Comet'' to Australia, in 1841).&lt;ref&gt;S. Stander: ''Tree of Life. The Story of Cape Fruit''. S&amp;W Ltd. Cape Town. 1983. p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The brothers first invested in the [[Theewaterskloof Local Municipality|Palmiet area]] in 1903. They may have been influenced by the purchase of some land in the area by their older brothers, [[Percy Alport Molteno|Percy]] and [[Frank Molteno]].&lt;ref name=Cape&gt;{{cite web|title=Selections from the correspondence of Percy Alport Molteno 1892-1914.| work=Van Riebeeck Society|url=http://www.vanriebeecksociety.co.za/docs/molteno.htm|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From modest beginnings farming vegetables, they eventually built up a vast farming enterprise that spanned the entire valley and what is now the largest single export fruit producing area in [[Southern Africa]]. They restructured the South African fruit farming industry along [[Science|scientific lines]], pioneering new farming and [[Refrigeration|cold storage]] practices and were influential in the development and uplifting of rural communities in the area.&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;{{cite web|title=Apples of the sun : being an account of the lives, vision and achievements of the Molteno brothers, Edward Bartle Frere and Henry Anderson.| work=Vlaeberg: Fernwood Press, 1999. {{ISBN|1-874950-45-8}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also founded the [[The Cape Tercentenary Foundation|Cape Tercentenary Foundation]] in 1950 to promote and support the arts and the environment in the Cape (Both brothers were extremely well read, appreciators of music and the arts, and were deeply concerned about the natural environment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cape300foundation.org.za/|title=The Cape Tercentenary Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the height of their success, the brothers took the unusual move of ordering that their network of farms was to be divided up and returned ''"...to Elgin's farmworkers and inhabitants for their own use."''&lt;ref&gt;C. Schoeman: ''The Historical Overberg. Traces of the Past in South Africa's Southernmost Region''. Penguin Random House South Africa. 2017. {{ISBN|978-1-77609-072-3}} p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; This process accelerated in the 1950s after Edward's death. 

Their farming enterprise was broken up and ceased to exist, but its name, Elgin, came to refer to the whole [[Elgin, Western Cape|region]]. This area is today one of the more intensively farmed districts of South Africa and produces 60% of the national apple crop.&lt;ref&gt;D. Jansen, K. Leresche: ''Exploring the Cape Winelands''. CTP. Penstock Publishing, South Africa. 2015. {{ISBN| 1928283071}}. ''Route 9: The Elgin Wine Region'' pp.142-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molteno Trust==
[[File:Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve - city of Cape Town.JPG|thumb|Molteno Bros gave extensive land and funding for the establishment of the [[Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve]]]]
[[File:Harry Molteno Library and Research Centre - Kirstenbosch - SANBI - Cape Town 9.jpg|thumb|Library and Research centre of [[Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens]], another major beneficiary of the trust]]

A body that seeks to support education, cultural institutions and environmental causes in Southern Africa, in terms of the will of the younger brother Harry Molteno, who died in 1969. Annual donations from the trust to such causes are derived mainly from the remaining [[Elgin, Western Cape|Glen Elgin]] farms, which they bequeathed to the Trust. The operations are today managed by a team who are overseen by a board of Directors, also appointed according to Harry's will.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Murray Williams |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/farm-village-given-to-workers-1.396045 |title=Farm village given to workers - South Africa &amp;#124; IOL News |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific projects and charities of the trust include:

*[[The Molteno Institute for Language and Literacy]], a charity that has enliterated over 10 million learners across Africa.
*Bursaries to universities like the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT) and [[Rhodes University]].
*Extensive support for [[Kirstenbosch|Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens]], including funding the research centre and the Molteno Library Wing.
*Gifts of land and funding for the establishment of the [[Kogelberg]] [[Nature Reserve]] with its 100,000 ha [[Kogelberg]] [[Biosphere Reserve]].
*Continued support for the [[The Cape Tercentenary Foundation|Cape Tercentenary Foundation]] and its projects.

{{nihongo|'''Nezu Kaichirō'''|根津 嘉一郎|extra=August 8, 1860 – January 4, 1940}} was a Japanese businessman, national politician and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cybriwsky|first1=Roman|title=Historical Dictionary of Tokyo|date=2011|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0-8108-3234-3|page=161|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born into an established merchant family in [[Yamanashi, Yamanashi|Yamanashi]], [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], he moved to Tokyo in 1897, and became independently wealthy through stock investments.

Nezu was elected as a member of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] in the [[National Diet]] in 1904 and won three subsequent reelections. He was elevated to the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Peers]] in 1926.

In 1905 Nezu became President of [[Tobu Railway]] and successfully helped to grow the company to one of the largest private rail operators in the Kanto region. Other business interests included managerial and shareholding roles in Tokyo Basha Tetsudo (Tokyo Horse-Drawn Carriage Railways), Tokyo Dento (Tokyo electric Light Company) and in [[Tokyo Gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portraits of Modern Japanese Historical Figures|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/portrait/e/datas/480.html?cat=91|website=National Diet Library, Japan|publisher=National Diet Library, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Accompanying [[Shibusawa Eiichi]] on a trade mission to the United States in 1909, Nezu was inspired by American industrialist's enthusiasm for civic and philanthropic activities. On his return to Japan Nezu founded and donated to a number of new educational and cultural initiatives including [[Musashi Junior and Senior High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yamamoto|first1=Tadashi|title=The Nonprofit Sector in Japan|date=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-5385-4|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1909 Business Mission|url=http://www.shibusawa.or.jp/english/eiichi/1909/member.html#tky06|website=Shibusawa Eiichi Memorial Foundation|publisher=Shibusawa Eiichi Memorial Foundation|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nezu Memorial Museum main building.JPG|thumb|Nezu Memorial Museum, Yamanashi]]Nezu was a keen practitioner of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]] and his extensive private collection of pre-modern Japanese and East Asian art, served as the basis for the [[Nezu Museum]] in [[Minato, Tokyo]]. The museum buildings were rebuilt in 2006 to modern design by Japanese architect [[Kengo Kuma]], but the gardens of the museum also retain multiple traditional [[Chashitsu]] structures for tea ceremony gatherings.

Constructed in 1933, Nezu's family home in Yamanashi has been preserved as the Nezu Memorial Museum. The main house, gate house and three story [[Kura (storehouse)]], were listed as registered tangible cultural properties in 2007.

OHADA is the acronym for the French "''Organisation pour l'harmonisation en Afrique du droit des affaires''", which translates into English as "Organisation for the Harmonization of Corporate Law in Africa".

The OHADA Treaty is made up today of 17 African states. Initially fourteen African countries signed the treaty, with two countries ([[Comoros]] and [[Guinea]]) subsequently adhering to the treaty and a third (the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) due to adhere shortly.{{When|date=November 2017}} The Treaty is open to all states, whether or not they are members of the [[Organisation of African Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.int/en/ Organization of African Unity]&lt;/ref&gt;  OHADA was created with the objective of fostering economic development in West and Central Africa by creating a better investment climate so as to attract investment in a 225 million-consumer market.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

As a West and Central African initiative to harmonize business laws and implementing institutions, OHADA aims to find alternative solutions to the lack of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa - a region which has challenged and puzzled [[economic development|development economists]] for several decades. The stated purpose of the initiative is to facilitate and encourage both domestic and foreign investment in the member states, and as most of the participating countries are former [[French colonies]], they draw chiefly on a modernised French legal model to achieve their goals. The laws promulgated by OHADA are exclusively business-related. The OHADA treaty has created a supranational court ([[Common Court of Justice and Arbitration of the Organization for the Harmonization in Africa of Business Law]] [http://www.ohada.org/index.php/en/court-of-justice-and-arbitration/ccja-at-a-glance]) to ensure uniformity and consistent legal interpretations across the member countries, and the French influence in court proceedings is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3073&amp;context=expresso Dickerson, Claire M.: "Harmonizing Business Laws in Africa: OHADA Calls the Tune"] 44:1 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law (2005), 63 pages, retrieved 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical tool for legal integration is the Uniform Act. A uniform act is the recollection of all relevant legal norms needed to ease business in the Member States. As of today,{{when|date=May 2016}} OHADA includes nine validated Uniform Acts: General Commercial Law, Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups, Secured Transactions Law, Debt Resolution Law, Insolvency Law, Arbitration Law, Harmonization of Corporate Accounting, Contracts for the Carriage of Goods, Cooperatives Companies Law. Two Uniform Acts (Arbitration and Accounting) are currently being revised.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''Occupy South Africa''' was a South African initiative primarily aimed at protesting and inciting [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] against the [[racism|racial]], economic and [[social inequality]] in [[South Africa]]. It is part of the globally [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement. It consists of a loose informal affiliation of on the ground groups and individuals across South Africa as well as internet based groups. Groups such as ''Taking Back South Africa!'', ''Occupy South Africa''{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} are involved in South Africa and online. The movement is also involved with the [[Marikana miners' strike]].

==Broad objectives==
Like the occupy movement elsewhere the South African movement is a heterogeneous campaign. Some aspects of it deal with the governments failure to render equitable distribution of wealth, while other aspects of it deal with White minority dominance and other forms of ongoing out crops of [[apartheid]] such as [[Legacies of apartheid|economic apartheid]]. Others focus on White media domination and inequity in representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrijobs.co.za |title='Jobs South Africa|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anonymous' message==
[[File:Tabasa2.jpg|thumb|alt=A taking back South Africa logo.|The logo of the initiative.]]On 18 March 2011 a video purportedly by the hacktivist group '[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]' was released by Winds of Change Media calling on the South African people to rise up against the government and the capitalist system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townshiptimes.co.za/?p=89 |title=Anonymous sends a message to 'the South African people' |work=Township Times |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This video expressed support for the 'Taking Back South Africa!' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy Daniel| date=2011-03-23 |url=http://memeburn.com/2011/03/anonymous-sends-a-message-to-the-south-african-people/ |title=Anonymous sends a message to 'the South African people' |publisher=memeburn |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2012}} James Lorimer, spokesperson for the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], the second biggest political party in South Africa, said in response to the call that because nobody knew who was behind the call, the uprising call lacked credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article989003.ece/Rise-up-call-sparks-debate |title='Rise up' call sparks debate |publisher=Times LIVE |date=26 March 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupy South Africa by region==
After months of networking with individuals and social groups in South Africa a call was made by Taking Back South Africa! to hold countrywide occupations in various cities in South Africa on 15 October 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Location Settings |url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/SA-joins-as-Indignant-protests-go-global-20111015 |title=SA joins as 'Indignant' protests go global |publisher=News24 |date=15 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the same successful tactic used by [[Occupy Wall Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frstephensmuts.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/occupy-south-africa-is-coming/ |title=Occupy South Africa is Coming « Fr Stephen Smuts |publisher=Frstephensmuts.wordpress.com |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call went viral over the week preceding 15 October and many social groups and individual activists started preparing for the occupation of symbolic locations in their cities. Saturday, 15 October witnessed South Africa's first coordinated occupation which took place in five cities simultaneously, namely Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Grahamstown and East London. Joe Hani, one of the admins of 'Taking Back South Africa!' said when questioned by the Mail&amp;Guardian newspaper as to the motivation behind Occupy South Africa that "no country was more worthy of an uprising against capitalism than South Africa".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-10-14-occupy-wall-street-uprising-could-be-explosive/ |title=Occupy Wall Street uprising could be 'explosive' – News – Mail &amp; Guardian Online |work=Mail &amp; Guardian |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayanda Kota, the chairperson of the Unemployed People's Movement said: ""We, the poor, suffer whenever companies fix the price of bread or when there are more job losses while chief executives get rich. But our protest is also localised, in the sense that we are protesting about the R19-million that is unaccounted for by the Makana municipality, the R240 000 spent by local government on bogus soccer development clinics and the privatisation of our struggle by the [[ANC]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Richard Pithouse, a Rhodes University political scientist, said the Grahamstown occupation protest could stand out as an example to other cities. It had been preceded by months of careful political work involving the Unemployed Peoples' Movement and the Students for Social Justice. This had culminated in "a negotiated solidarity based on equality" between disillusioned middle-class youth and grassroots communities, which had "explosive political potential".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Occupy Johannesburg===
[[File:OccupyJhb1.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators at Occupy Johannesburg.]]
Around two hundred occupiers gathered outside the [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange]] and gave speeches over a microphone claiming to be of the 99% and they were very angry with the corporates and the politicians. Police later told the protesters they had to disperse or face arrest. There were problems related to the retreat point also at which point the occupiers decided to disperse and return another day. In attendance were activists from [[Soweto]] and Thembelihle, the [[Democratic Left Front]] had a prominent presence and members of Zeitgeist and September National Imbizo/Blackwash were in attendance as well.&lt;ref name="thesouthafrican1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/occupy-south-africa-a-tale-of-five-cities.htm |title=Occupy South Africa: A Tale of Five Cities |publisher=The South African |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Bennie of the [[Democratic Left Front]] movement (DLF)noted in an interview with ABN news that South Africa's class divide was worse than many countries also Occupying.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1oxQH_7Ss8 |title=Occupying the JSE |publisher=YouTube |date=15 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African Civil Society Information Service (SACSIS) also attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/444.19 |title=Voices from Occupy Johannesburg, South Africa |publisher=SACSIS.org.za |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupy Cape Town===
Around 200 attended with people coming and going throughout the day. A hot speaker was set up and speeches were given from occupiers from various backgrounds and ideologies.  Police mingled past but did not intervene. City police stopped people bringing a trailer in and tried to tell a crafter not to sell his wire beaded flowers but the occupiers insisted he be allowed to stay. At the occupation were members of community organisations from Blikiesdorp and Manenburg, Zeitgesters, Anarchists, and Blackwash members amongst others.&lt;ref name="libcom1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/news/two-reports-occupy-south-africa-29102011 |title=Two Reports from Occupy South Africa |publisher=libcom.org |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following occupations in [[Cape Town]] were held in Thibault Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sacks |first=Jared |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201111250300.html |title=South Africa: Occupy Cape Town Attempts to Decolonise Thibault Square |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Wanza, of 'Proudly Manenberg' and one of the organizers of Occupy Cape Town stated that "People have started realising that political parties don't have the answers. They make speeches everyday but nothing happens. Our lives don't get any better, our lives get worse. What is important is that this is a growing movement of change and we have given up on the government solving our problems. We have given up on the rich solving our problems. We are the only ones that can change things in this country."&lt;ref name="vocfm1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocfm.co.za/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;task=tag&amp;tag=Mario+Wantza&amp;Itemid=140 |title=Displaying items by tag: Mario Wantza |publisher=Vocfm.co.za |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupy Durban===
[[Activist]] Sarah Dawson reported that [[Durban]] had a steady flow of occupiers through the day, and had some really interesting discussions, and the occupiers had the opportunity to inform passers by about the movement. There were some natural arguments about what the movement is directed towards, but a general consensus that diversity should accommodated, and that the movement is about acknowledging a problem. Things were peaceful and spirits were high for the most part. Between 50 and 100 people occupied. Discussions were had about the possibility of making it a weekly occurrence into the future and seeking greater cooperation with other civil society groups and grassroot movements. There were children, [[guitarists]] and a slam poet.&lt;ref name="thesouthafrican1"/&gt;

Sarah Dawson argued on behalf of the largely [[middle class]] attendance that "The movement is clearly not about "The Poor" with a capital P, but about a systemic problem. The 99% consists of people at every end of the spectrum, who have diverse experiences and responsibilities, but who acknowledge that their experiences share a cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahala.co.za/culture/middle-class-manifesto/#more-22036 |title=Occupy SA &amp;#124; Middle Class Manifesto |publisher=Mahala |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cop 17]] climate talks of December 2011, the occupation seemed to become more serious in Durban.&lt;ref name="voanews1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gabe Joselow | location=Durban |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/environment/Protesters-Occupy-Durban-Climate-Conference-135333748.html |title=Protesters Occupy Durban Climate Conference &amp;#124; English |publisher=Voice of America |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupy Grahamstown===
Mbali Baduza from Students for Social Justice reported&lt;ref name="thesouthafrican1"/&gt; that an initial group of 20 [[Rhodes University]] students gathered at the Botanical Gardens at 10&amp;nbsp;am.  After having distributed T-shirts they made their way down to High Street to meet the masses ([[Unemployed People's Movement]] comrades and many others). As they walked down they chanted "Enough is Enough. We want our country back". While they walked down High Street, they distributed pamphlets which contained information about why the demonstration was happening and why it was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacobinmag.com/blog/2011/10/dispatch-from-south-africa/ |title=Dispatch from South Africa |publisher=Jacobinmag.com |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they reached the crowd gathered at the Cathedral (about 30–40 people) they all merged and sang protest songs for about an hour. Together they marched up and down high street and the louder they sang, the more people from the street joined. People of all races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Africa |first=Thinking |url=http://thinkingafricarhodesuniversity.blogspot.com/2011/10/occupy-grahamstown-photographic-essay.html |title=Thinking Africa: The Frantz Fanon Blog: Occupy Grahamstown: A photographic essay by Timothy Gabb |publisher=Thinkingafricarhodesuniversity.blogspot.com |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their return to the cathedral, the floor was opened up to the crowd to share their grievances. People from Phaphamani, Vukani and other locations spoke mainly about their need for 3 essentials: [[electricity]], [[water]] and [[house|housing]].

They then made their way to the Makana Municipal buildings and chanted "Amandla, ngawethu! Amanga ngawabo!" Richard Pithouse and [[Ayanda Kota]] addressed the crowd and spoke about how although the government officials were not present, they would hear of the day's events. It was more of a symbolic gesture. Ayanda Kota and some UPM comrades went into the municipal buildings and threw shit inside to protest the bucket system and this was broadcast on South African news.

After that activity, the police came and asked the crowd to leave.&lt;ref name="libcom1"/&gt;

Ben Fogel stated that Occupy [[Grahamstown]] offers hope to the South Africa left, as it shows that radical students and the poor can form a political alliance based upon equality and solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fogel |first=Ben |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201110210531.html |title=Africa: Occupy Grahamstown – Hope for South Africa's Left? |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupy East London===
Chloe Menteath stated that five people later to be six stood underneath the [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] [[Steve Biko]] Statue and in front of the Imperialists Old Shack. The small group shouted slogans out for an hour and a half while curious passers by looked on.&lt;ref name="thesouthafrican1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23551">'''On-demand outsourcing''' is a trend in [[outsourcing]] wherein major internal operations processes of a [[company]] are being shifted to a [[Distribution (business)|provider]] that is paid for by the number of transactions involved. The business transferring the services pays for the quality, special skills and the competence of the service provider's employees. There has been an expansion of the outsourcing concept to include on-demand outsourcing. This refers to the process undertaken by business managers to adopt an outsourcing policy that ensures that the specific business and supplies including technical manpower are accessed as the need arises. It focuses a business strategy to improve its [[goods and services]] and to drive a business towards quality improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maurice F. Greaver|title=Strategic Outsourcing: A Structured Approach to Outsourcing Decisions and Initiatives|date=1999|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn, 1999|isbn= 9780814404348|pages=115–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b42-i5zwt5QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=outsourcing&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=outsourcing&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The reasons for general outsourcing can be summarized in following factors: the rising [[wages]] of the [[domestic worker]], or companies wish to gain access to the exceptional capability. The risk of outsourcing service is normally assumed by the outsourcing service provider, not by the companies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Corporate Computer Service,Inc|title=IT Outsourcing: The Reasons, Risks and Rewards|url=http://www.corpcomputerservices.com/articles/outsourcing-reasons|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, outsourcing on demand is preferred by many because of its ability to reap diverse sources of material and labour supply. Under this strategy, the driving motivation is the desire for business diversification and quality.

This type of outsourcing becomes more popular as service providers may not be able to outsource their employees on a daily basis owing to high demand and [[workload]]. Therefore, the service provider has to consider the order of [[resource allocation]] into different departments, according to the needed level and price offset by the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1= Rhode Island(US)|title=On–Demand IT Outsourcing To streamline your business requirements|url=http://www.slideshare.net/clarion_tech/on-demand-it-outsourcing-9437388|publisher=Clarion Technologies|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common that the companies will always outsource for their [[core business]].

==Essence of strategic on-demand outsourcing==
The most important difference between this type of outsourcing and general [[outsourcing]] is the critical transfer of ownership of the organisation from to a service provider. In an ideal on-demand outsourcing, there is an important passage of factors of production from the owner to the service provider. It encourages a system where business exists in a simple but comprehensive relationship. In some cases, the employees and entire [[human resources]] is transferred to the service provider. 
Notably, in order to undertake a strategic outsourcing, there are conditions that have to be met. Firstly, it should include the creation of a [[competitive advantage]]; this is an important element that should form the basis of adopting this type of outsourcing.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Secondly, on-demand outsourcing demands that the managers spend more time in streamlining the activities that are important for business success. In addition, they need to undertake repositioning of the business in the marketplace or achieve a dramatic increase in market share. When these elements and motivating factors are met, it will make the outsourcing strategy a competitive edge.

==Application in IT and financial sectors==
Leading economists {{who|date=November 2015}} suggest that on-demand outsourcing use will drive business from local to international platforms. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of each sourcing strategy, a business can gain a competitive edge over the others.

===HSBC===
[[File:HSBC GLT PUNE.jpg|thumb|HSBC GLT PUNE]]

For instance, [[HSBC]] Holdings has succeeded in acquiring other companies and integrating their customers. Originally, HSBC made the decision on outsourcing mainly because the bank started to find it difficult to update its technology and services at the same pace with the rapidly changing financial and digital world. Besides their core financial business, they also started to consider improvements on their banking services part, where their reputation could be maintained and developed.

"Moreover, we wanted to be able to turn the tap on and off whenever we wanted," says Rumi Contractor, HSBC's chief information officer for Europe, who helped build the company's outsourcing center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Extra: HSBC's Lessons in Outsourcing|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-01-29/online-extra-hsbcs-lessons-in-outsourcing|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2014|format=Magazine article}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that HSBC also seeks to put more people to work according to their different talents and skills, as the larger workforce could increase the working efficiency.

Nowadays, HSBC has over 9,500 offices in 80 countries worldwide, a huge increase from the original size of 30 people working on HSBC software maintenance in India in 2002. The "back office" mainly provides call centre and bank process services for HSBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nirmal Pal|author2=Daniel Pantaleo|title=The Agile Enterprise: Reinventing your Organization for Success in an On-Demand World|date=2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387250786|pages=129–130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wZRXeXjGHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM===
IBM entered into a $5 billion manufacturing outsourcing arrangement with the [[Sanmina-SCI Corporation]] in 1992. During this outsourcing process, the expanded operations of Sammina-SCI passed the $1 billion mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brown, D|title=It is good to be green: Environment friendly credentials are influencing business outsourcing decisions|journal=Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal|date=2008 |issn=1753-8297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case was the only one of the successes that IBM and their outsourcing services providers achieved from the information technology outsourcing in the early 1990s. IBM has also signed a ten-year outsourcing service plan with [[Bharti Airtel]] Ltd in Bangalore, India. In 2013, IBM prepared to renew this IT contract in India to compete with intense multinational and local Indian rivals that they had never faced before. The BPO outsourcing contract for managing software application and computer networks for Airtel is now estimated to be worth over $2.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Anirban Sen|author2=Pankaj Mishra|title=Indian IT firms eye Airtel's IBM outsourcing contract|url=http://www.livemint.com/Industry/N3ZUp9QeuqaVvtV88HIaKM/Indian-IT-firms-eye-Airtels-IBM-outsourcing-contract.html|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two present good examples of on-demand outsourcing. Both business organizations benefited by acquiring the necessary equipment and labour from the partner company.

==Implications==

===Benefits===
In the past, the purpose of outsourcing was narrow and related to business acquisition. Today, the purpose has transformed into a strategic competitive advantage. Strategic operations and on-demand outsourcing has increased business activities, creating a transformative approach that has allowed businesses to expand their operations. In addition, on-demand outsourcing has reduced unnecessary expenditures and the quality of goods and services has been excellent.
One of the leading social benefits of this strategy is globalization. When this strategy is incorporated with the Internet, it facilitates e-commerce that has succeeded in building inter-business corporations. The formation of strong business relationships between partnering entrepreneurs has been immense. The social drive has been leading business managers to meet and discuss the future of their cooperation partnership jointly, thus enhancing each of their respective operations. Today,{{when|date=November 2015}} the concept of the globalization of business activities and e-commerce is no longer a . In fact, this form of outsourcing has enabled trust-building among partners, and a positive environment of building business has been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kirti Sharda|editor1-last=Leena Chatterjee|title=Configurations of outsourcing firms and organizational performance: A study of outsourcing industry in India|journal=Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal|date=2008|volume=4|issue=2|pages=152–178|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17538291111147991?journalCode=so|accessdate=25 October 2014|issn=1753-8297|doi=10.1108/17538291111147991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic impact has been immense; India has grown it on-demand outsourcing services to over 38% as per 2010.Over 400,000 people are now employed in outsourcing services in India according to the Pricewaterhouse Coopers Survey 2012. In addition, the growth in Europe has led to increasers employment opportunities and overall growth in GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ravi Kumar Jain|author2=Ramachandran Natarajan|title=Factors influencing the outsourcing decisions: a study of the banking sector in India|journal=Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal|date=2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=294–322|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17538291111185485|accessdate=25 October 2014|issn=1753-8297|doi=10.1108/17538291111185485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts believe that India is an ideal country that has undergone tremendous market revolution through a diverse on-demand outsourcing. Information Technology today commands 43% of on-demand outsourcing while finance, communication and manufacturing industries have significantly embraced this form of outsourcing as significant in achieving quality of services and reduction of costs of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Outsourcing Statistics|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/outsourcing-statistics-by-country/|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
However, the expansion of outsourcing services brought up the issue of the loss of employees in the host country. For instance, the New York Post reported that IBM employed more workers in their outsourced service provider places, such as India, than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=John Aidon Bryne|title=IBM now employs more workers in India than US|url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/05/ibm-now-employs-more-workers-in-india-than-us/|accessdate=24 October 2014|format=News|date=October 5, 2013|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, outsourcing may be making a big comeback, as word leaked that IBM would cut about 5,000 jobs in the U.S. and move the work to India. This may be the beginning of a new wave of exporting of American jobs to developing countries, which have large pools of well-educated workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author1=Douglas A. McIntyre|title=M and the Rebirth of Outsourcing|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1887779,00.html|accessdate=24 October 2014|magazine=Time|date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries involved in on-demand outsourcing==

=== India ===
India is said to be the dominant country in providing outsourcing services in Asia, as India offers more integrated services across the offshoring spectrum, while countries such as China and Malaysia have limitations in the form of their smaller labour pools and lower-end technology in their outsourcing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karl Flinders|title=Asia dominates as outsourcing location and India remains unrivaled|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240230951/Asia-dominates-as-outsourcing-location-and-India-remains-unrivalled|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contract with IBM====
The rapidly growing, integrated outsourcing service in India also attracts some of the [[Fortune Global 500]] companies set their outsource operation in India, such as [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM IT Strategic Outsourcing Services|url=http://www-935.ibm.com/services/in/gts/strategic_outsourcing|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM's architects department started their outsourcing contract with the fast-growing mobile telecom firm Bharti Airtel—Jai Menon, Bharti’s former CIO, both IBM and the mobile telecom firm gained great benefits from this ten-year deal. India has become one of IBM's biggest platforms, and this resulted in the fact that IBM has more employees in India than in its U.S headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Patrick Thibodeau|title=In a symbolic shift, IBM's India workforce likely exceeds U.S.|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2493565/it-careers/in-a-symbolic-shift--ibm-s-india-workforce-likely-exceeds-u-s-.html|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=29 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual revenue in India was growing at two-digit rate from 2005, 55% in 2005, 37% in 2006, and stayed over 30% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Heather Timmons|title=India's emerging market roller coaster has been a brutal ride for IBM|url=http://qz.com/173601/ibms-india-problem/|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from ITO outsourcing to India, the biggest UK flag carrier [[airline]], [[British Airways]], began their business process outsourcing in India in 1996. Outsourcing services started to include the British Airways [[customer service]]s, also known as the [[World Network Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dipti Kumar|title=India Still Tops For ITO, BPO Outsourcing|url=http://www.cruxialcio.com/outsourcing-india-pays-some-2851#situation|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some predictions that there will be a recession in the Indian on-demand outsourcing industry in the early years. The analysis reported that India was still the world's [[Back office|backoffice]], whereas it put too much attention to 'servicing' information technology to other countries such as the United States. As a result, India has not yet developed its own technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sramana Mitra|title=The Coming Death of Indian Outsourcing|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/29/mitra-india-outsourcing-tech-enter-cx_sm_0229outsource.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=29 February 2008|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future challenges in India====
It seems that India has overcome these difficulties. However, there will still emerge new challenges that India will have to face in such a rapid-growing, competitive environment, such as they should consider recruiting the workforce based on quality and not quantity. They also need to consider further investments on training highly skilled individuals in order to fulfill the demand for a skilled workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outsourcing Challenges in India|url=http://www.tmaworld.com/news-insights/viewpoints-articles/outsourcing-challenges-in-india/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Factors in Europe====
Based on an increase on-demand outsourcing concept in business platform, there has been a paradigm shift in the European market. The business outsourcing strategies now depend on five key factors, including current sourcing strategies in European markets, trends in the market, transition of services, contract laws and risks involved in outsourcing. According to a survey conducted among eight countries in Europe, Finland had 19% of its total goods and services using on-demand outsourcing while the United Kingdom and Spain were at 17%. Germany, the Netherlands and Norway had outsourced 15%, 13% and 10% of all services respectively. Notably, Sweden and Denmark had 9% of their service industries employing on-demand outsourcing. In addition, the survey revealed that the fundamental reasons for adopting this strategy was informed by three key issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geishecker|first1=Ingo|title=Does Outsourcing to Central and Eastern Europe Really Threaten Manual Workers' Jobs in Germany?|journal=The World Economy|date=May 2006|volume=29|issue=5|pages=559–583|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9701.2006.00800.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fundamental reasons====
#The strategy proved to be cost effective in larger-scale firms. Any leading business organizations aims to achieve operational and logistic activities that are cost effective.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} As an advantage, the process of on-demand outsourcing creates a confluence of activities integrated into one overall function, since this specific outsourcing strategy encourages limitation of activities, and encourages cutting down the operational and excess costs.
#The strategy is efficient because it allows [[division of labour]] and duties of all process to the service provider. At the service provider point, there are a series of departments that specifically deals with the delegated responsibilities to achieve quality and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outsourcing in Europe|url=http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Advisory/Factors-governing-outsourcing-in-Europe-2013|publisher=© 2013 EYGM Limited|accessdate=23 October 2014|format=Survey|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#There is marked quality improvement due to use of an external service provider. The primary goal of on-demand outsourcing is the desire of quality goods and standardized services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Per Hilletofth|author2=Olli-Pekka Hilmola|title=Role of logistics outsourcing on supply chain strategy and management: Survey findings from Northern Europe|journal=Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal|date=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=46–61|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|format=Research Paper|issn=1753-8297|doi=10.1108/17538291011023070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures==
[[Dell]], a privately owned multinational company based in the United States, is one of the largest technological corporations in the world, employing more than 103,300 people worldwide. However, the call center operation for the OptiPlex desktops and Latitude laptops was moved back to the United States. Dell moved its customer services and technical support centre to Bangalore in India in 2001, and set their second site in Hyderabad in 2003. However, the company found that the brand started to lose its reputation when the language and culture barrier between the customers and the employees hindered communication, especially when the employee in the Bangalore centre had professional skills but weren't experienced enough to service customers. The lack of training time on outsourcing and resolving these cultural barriers could have contributed to the strategy's lack of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elizabeth Corcoran|title=Dell moves outsource back to U.S shores|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4853511/ns/business-forbes_com/t/dell-moves-outsourced-jobs-back-us-shores/#.VEhR1twjJ_Q|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=29 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome was that even though Dell's market continued to grow, customer satisfaction declined. One of the positive outcomes was that Dell started to understand the importance of outsourcing based on the average need and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Andy McCue|title=For Dell, Indian call center failure a lesson|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001_3-5182611.html|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=March 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forbes also concluded that some factors that may lead to failure for companies using outsourcing services, such as desire for in-house expertise and marketplace pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Savitz|title=Why Some U.S. Companies Are Giving Up On Outsourcing|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/01/16/why-some-u-s-companies-are-giving-up-on-outsourcing/|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=16 Jan 2013|work=Forbes|series=CIO Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging trends and strategy==
With the growth of the global economy, it is believed that more countries, such as [[Brazil]] and Russia, will put their focus on providing on-demand outsourcing industries and services. From the perspective of individual companies and organisations, their local increasing [[Wage labour|labour]] [[wages]], facilities [[cost]] and other competitive factors will make them use such customized outsourcing service in more areas of their business. The industry experts also predict that such specific outsourcing services will not only be used mainly in the information technology and financial sector, but more focus will be put in industries such as automobile production and medicine production.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The growth of on-demand outsourcing has hugely impacted the overall performance of outpouring in business. A majority of established businesses today have established automated payments that offset the transfer of the important business operation. The expansion of this form of outsourcing to cut a competitive edge has already greatly enriched the competitive market. In a competitive market, Internet-enabled on-demand outsourcing has created an immense cost reduction and achieved higher quality of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=E.Mahmoodzadeh|author2=Sh.Jalalinia|author3=F.Nekui Yazdi|title=A business process outsourcing framework based on business process management and knowledge management|journal= Business Process Management Journal|date=2009|volume=15|issue=6|pages=845–864|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/14637150911003748|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|format=Literature review|issn=1463-7154|doi=10.1108/14637150911003748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, globalization has enabled businesses to expand outsourcing, thus attracting diverse business partnerships that have allowed businesses to continue to flourish by bringing diversity in production and service provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazzawi|first1=Elias|title=Transformational Outsourcing|journal=Business Strategy Review|date=2002|volume=13|issue=3|pages=39–43|doi=10.1111/1467-8616.00221|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8616.00221/abstract|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the future of this concept remains positive as competition in the market continues to grow.

'''Plating''' is a surface covering in which a [[metal]] is deposited on a [[conductive]] surface. Plating has been done for hundreds of years; it is also critical for modern technology. Plating is used to decorate objects, for corrosion inhibition, to improve solderability, to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to improve paint adhesion, to alter conductivity, to improve IR reflectivity, for radiation shielding, and for other purposes. [[Jewelry]] typically uses plating to give a [[silver]] or [[gold]] finish. 


[[Thin-film deposition]] has plated objects as small as an atom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuo|first=Hong-Shi|author2=Hwang, Ing-Shouh |author3=Fu, Tsu-Yi |author4=Lin, Yu-Chun |author5=Chang, Che-Cheng |author6= Tsong, Tien T. |title==Noble Metal/W(111) Single-Atom Tips and Their Field Electron and Ion Emission Characteristics|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|date=7 November 2006|volume=45|issue=11|pages=8972–8983|doi=10.1143/JJAP.45.8972|bibcode=2006JaJAP..45.8972K}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore plating finds uses in [[nanotechnology]].

There are several plating methods, and many variations. In one method, a solid surface is covered with a metal sheet, and then heat and pressure are applied to fuse them (a version of this is [[Sheffield plate]]). Other plating techniques include [[electroplating]], [[vapor deposition]] under [[vacuum]] and [[sputter deposition]]. Recently, plating often refers to using liquids. [[Metallizing]] refers to coating metal on non-metallic objects.

==Electroplating==
{{Main|Electroplating}}

In electroplating, an [[ion]]ic metal is supplied with [[electrons]] to form a non-ionic coating on a [[Wiktionary:substrate|substrate]]. A common system involves a chemical solution with the ionic form of the metal, an [[anode]] (negatively charged) which may consist of the metal being plated (a [[soluble]] anode) or an [[insoluble]] anode (usually carbon, platinum, titanium, lead, or steel), and finally, a [[cathode]] (positively charged) where electrons are supplied to produce a film of non-ionic metal.

==Electroless plating==
{{Main|Electroplating#Electroless deposition}}

Electroless plating, also known as chemical or auto-[[catalytic]] plating, is a non-[[Galvanization|galvanic]] plating method that involves several simultaneous reactions in an [[aqueous solution]], which occur without the use of external electrical power. The reaction is accomplished when [[hydrogen]] is released by a reducing agent, normally [[sodium hypophosphite]] (Note: the hydrogen leaves as a hydride ion) or [[thiourea]], and oxidized, thus producing a negative charge on the surface of the part. The most common electroless plating method is [[electroless nickel plating]], although silver, gold and copper layers can also be applied in this manner, as in the technique of [[Angel gilding]].

== Specific cases ==

=== Gold plating ===
{{main|Gold plating}}
[[Gold plating]] is a method of depositing a thin layer of gold on the surface of glass or metal, most often [[copper]] or silver.

Gold plating is often used in electronics, to provide a [[corrosion]]-resistant electrically conductive layer on copper, typically in [[electrical connector]]s and [[printed circuit board]]s. With direct gold-on-copper plating, the copper atoms have the tendency to diffuse through the gold layer, causing tarnishing of its surface and formation of an oxide/sulfide layer. Therefore, a layer of a suitable [[barrier metal]], usually nickel, has to be deposited on the copper substrate, forming a copper-nickel-gold sandwich.

Metals and glass may also be coated with gold for ornamental purposes, using a number of different processes usually referred to as ''[[gilding]]''.

Sapphires, plastics, and carbon fiber are some other materials that are able to be plated using advance plating techniques. The substrates that can be used are almost limitless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epner.com/default/index.cfm/applications/plating-on-plastics/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101233221/http://epner.com/default/index.cfm/applications/plating-on-plastics/ |archivedate=2013-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Silver plating ===
:''This section is about the method of adding a thin layer of silver to an object. For the Manhattan Project operation, see [[Silverplate]]''.
{{See also|Weighted sterling}}
[[File:KeilwerthAltoSax.JPG|thumb|right|A silver-plated [[alto saxophone]]]]

Silver plating has been used since the 18th century to provide cheaper versions of household items that would otherwise be made of solid silver, including [[cutlery]], vessels of various kinds, and candlesticks. In the UK the [[assay office]]s, and silver dealers and collectors, use the term "silver plate" for items made from solid silver, derived long before silver plating was invented from the Spanish word for silver "plata", seizures of silver from Spanish ships carrying silver from America being a large source of silver at the time. This can cause confusion when talking about silver items; plate or plated. In the UK it is illegal to describe silver-plated items as "silver". It is not illegal to describe silver-plated items as "silver plate", although this is grammatically incorrect, and should also be avoided to prevent confusion.

The earliest form of silver plating was [[Sheffield Plate]], where thin sheets of silver are fused to a layer or core of base metal, but in the 19th century new methods of production (including electroplating) were introduced. [[Britannia metal]] is an alloy of tin, [[antimony]] and copper developed as a base metal for plating with silver.

Another method that can be used to apply a thin layer of silver to objects such as glass, is to place [[Tollens' reagent]] in a glass, add glucose/dextrose, and shake the bottle to promote the reaction.

:AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + KOH → AgOH + KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

:AgOH + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + [OH]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (Note: see [[Tollens' reagent]])

:[Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + [OH]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + [[aldehyde]] (usually glucose/dextrose) → Ag + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

For applications in electronics, silver is sometimes used for plating copper, as its [[electrical resistance]] is lower (see [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity#Resistivity of various materials|Resistivity of various materials]]); more so at higher frequencies due to the [[skin effect]]. [[Variable capacitor]]s are considered of the highest quality when they have silver-plated plates. Similarly, silver-plated, or even solid silver cables, are prized in [[audiophile]] applications; however some experts consider that in practice the plating is often poorly implemented, making the result inferior to similarly priced copper cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audioholics.com/education/cables/silver-saboteurs-are-silver-audio-cables-better|title=Silver Saboteurs - Are Silver Audio Cables Better?|author=Clint DeBoer|publisher=Audioholics|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2011-12-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130211636/http://www.audioholics.com/education/cables/silver-saboteurs-are-silver-audio-cables-better|archivedate=2012-01-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Care should be used for parts exposed to high [[humidity]] environments because in such environments, when the silver layer is porous or contains cracks, the underlying copper undergoes rapid [[galvanic corrosion]], flaking off the plating and exposing the copper itself; a process known as [[red plague (corrosion)|red plague]].  Silver plated copper maintained in a moisture-free environment will not undergo this type of corrosion.

=== Copper plating ===
{{main|Copper plating}}
Copper plating is the process of electrolytically forming a layer of copper on the surface of an item. 

=== Rhodium plating ===
[[Rhodium]] plating is occasionally used on white gold, silver or copper and its alloys. A barrier layer of nickel is usually deposited on silver first, though in this case it is not to prevent migration of silver through rhodium, but to prevent contamination of the rhodium bath with silver and copper, which slightly dissolve in the [[sulfuric acid]] usually present in the bath composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0376-4583(81)90029-7 | title = Rhodium — Electrodeposition and applications | year = 1981 | author = Pushpavanam, M | journal = Surface Technology | volume = 12 | pages = 351 | last2 = Raman | first2 = V | last3 = Shenoi | first3 = B | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chrome plating ===
{{main|Chrome plating}}

Chrome plating is a finishing treatment using the [[electroplating|electrolytic deposition]] of [[chromium]]. The most common form of chrome plating is the thin, decorative ''bright chrome'', which is typically a 10-[[&amp;#181;m]] layer over an underlying [[nickel]] plate. When plating on iron or steel, an underlying plating of copper allows the nickel to adhere. The pores (tiny holes) in the nickel and chromium layers work to alleviate stress caused by [[thermal expansion]] mismatch but also hurt the corrosion resistance of the coating. Corrosion resistance relies on what is called the [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]], which is determined by the chemical composition and processing, and is damaged by cracks and pores. In a special case, micropores can help distribute the [[electrochemical potential]] that accelerates [[galvanic corrosion]] between the layers of nickel and chromium. Depending on the application, coatings of different thicknesses will require different balances of the aforementioned properties. Thin, bright chrome imparts a [[mirror]]-like finish to items such as metal furniture frames and automotive trim. Thicker deposits, up to 1000&amp;#160;µm, are called ''hard chrome'' and are used in industrial equipment to reduce [[friction]] and wear.

The traditional solution used for industrial hard chrome plating is made up of about 250 g/L of CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and about 2.5 g/L of SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. In solution, the chrome exists as chromic acid, known as [[hexavalent chromium]]. A high current is used, in part to stabilize a thin layer of chromium(+2) at the surface of the plated work. Acid chrome has poor throwing power, fine details or holes are further away and receive less current resulting in poor plating.

===Zinc plating ===
{{See also|Galvanization|Hot-dip galvanization|Electrogalvanization|Bethanization|Sherardising}}

[[Zinc]] coatings prevent [[oxidation]] of the protected metal by forming a barrier and by acting as a sacrificial anode if this barrier is damaged. [[Zinc oxide]] is a fine white dust that (in contrast to [[iron oxide]]) does not cause a breakdown of the substrate's surface integrity as it is formed. Indeed, the zinc oxide, if undisturbed, can act as a barrier to further oxidation, in a way similar to the protection afforded to [[aluminum]] and [[stainless steel]]s by their [[oxide]] layers. The majority of hardware parts are zinc-plated, rather than [[#Cadmium plating|cadmium-plated]].&lt;ref name="fin2"/&gt;

===Zinc-nickel plating===

Zinc-nickel plating is one of the best corrosion resistant finishes available offering over 5 times the protection of conventional zinc plating and up to 1,500 hours of neutral salt spray test performance. This plating is a combination of a high-nickel zinc-nickel alloy (10–15% nickel) and some variation of chromate. The most common mixed chromates include hexavalent iridescent, trivalent or black trivalent chromate. Used to protect steel, cast iron, brass, copper, and other materials, this acidic plating is an environmentally safe option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gattoplaters.com/zinc-nickel-plating.html|title=Zinc Nickel Plating - Zinc Nickel Electroplating - Gatto Industrial Platers, Inc.|first=Gatto Industrial Platers,|last=Inc.|website=www.gattoplaters.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207134253/http://www.gattoplaters.com/zinc-nickel-plating.html|archivedate=2016-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hexavalent chromate has been classified as a human carcinogen by the EPA and OSHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/airtoxics/hlthef/chromium.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520174855/https://www3.epa.gov/airtoxics/hlthef/chromium.html |archivedate=2016-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_228697.html|title=Chemical Sampling Information - Chromium (VI) (Hexavalent Chromium) - Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305072102/https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_228697.html|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tin plating===
{{See also|Tinplate}}

The [[tin]]-plating process is used extensively to protect both [[ferrous]] and [[nonferrous]] surfaces. Tin is a useful metal for the [[food processing]] industry since it is non-toxic, ductile and corrosion resistant. The excellent [[ductility]] of tin allows a tin coated base metal sheet to be formed into a variety of shapes without damage to the surface tin layer. It provides sacrificial protection for copper, nickel and other non-ferrous metals, but not for [[steel]].

Tin is also widely used in the [[electronics]] industry because of its ability to protect the base metal from oxidation thus preserving its solderability. In electronic applications, 3% to 7% [[lead]] may be added to improve solderability and to prevent the growth of metallic "whiskers" in compression stressed deposits, which would otherwise cause electrical shorting. However, [[ROHS|RoHS]] (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) regulations enacted beginning in 2006 require that no lead be added intentionally and that the maximum percentage not exceed 1%. Some exemptions have been issued to RoHS requirements in critical electronics applications due to failures which are known to have occurred as a result of tin whisker formation.

===Alloy plating===
In some cases, it is desirable to co-deposit two or more metals resulting in an electroplated alloy deposit. Depending on the alloy system, an electroplated alloy may be [[Solid solution strengthening|solid solution strengthened]] or [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] by [[heat treatment]] to improve the plating's physical and chemical properties. Nickel-Cobalt is a common electroplated alloy.

===Composite plating===
[[Metal matrix composite]] plating can be manufactured when a substrate is plated in a bath containing a suspension of ceramic particles. Careful selection of the size and composition of the particles can fine-tune the deposit for wear resistance, high temperature performance, or mechanical strength. [[Tungsten carbide]], [[silicon carbide]], [[chromium carbide]], and aluminum oxide (alumina) are commonly used in composite electroplating.

===Cadmium plating===
[[Cadmium]] plating is under scrutiny because of the [[cadmium poisoning|environmental toxicity]] of the cadmium metal. Cadmium plating is widely used in some applications in the aerospace, military, and aviation fields. However, it is being phased out due to its toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finishing.com/136/09.shtml Why use cadmium plated fasteners in the aeronautical field] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702002108/http://www.finishing.com/136/09.shtml |date=2008-07-02 }}. finishing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadmium plating (or ''cad. plating'') offers a long list of technical advantages such as excellent corrosion resistance even at relatively low thickness and in salt atmospheres, softness and [[malleability]], freedom from sticky and/or bulky corrosion products, galvanic compatibility with aluminum, freedom from [[stick-slip]] thus allowing reliable [[torque|torquing]] of plated threads, can be dyed to many colors and clear, has good lubricity and solderability, and works well either as a final finish or as a paint base.&lt;ref name="fin2"&gt;"[http://www.finishing.com/130/89.shtml Cadmium vs. Zinc vs. Nickel Plating Comparison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515153159/http://www.finishing.com/130/89.shtml |date=2009-05-15 }}" Finishing.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://erieplating.com/cadmium-plating Cadmium plating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001234316/http://erieplating.com/cadmium-plating |date=2008-10-01 }}. Erie Plating Company&lt;/ref&gt;

If environmental concerns matter, in most aspects cadmium plating can be directly replaced with gold plating as it shares most of the material properties, but gold is more expensive and cannot serve as a paint base.

===Nickel plating===
{{Contradicts other|date=October 2010|1=Nickel electroplating}}
{{main|Nickel electroplating}}

The chemical reaction for nickel plating is:{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

At cathode: Ni → Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

At anode: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Compared to cadmium plating, nickel plating offers a shinier and harder finish, but lower corrosion resistance, [[lubricity]], and malleability, resulting in a tendency to crack or flake if the piece is further processed.&lt;ref name="fin2"/&gt;

===Electroless nickel plating===
{{Contradicts other|date=June 2010|1=Electroless nickel plating}}
{{main|Electroless nickel plating}} {{main|Electroless nickel}}

Electroless nickel plating, also known as ''enickel'' and ''NiP'', offers many advantages: uniform layer thickness over most complicated surfaces, direct plating of ferrous metals (steel), superior wear and corrosion resistance to electroplated nickel or chrome. Much of the chrome plating done in aerospace industry can be replaced with electroless nickel plating, again environmental costs, costs of hexavalent chromium waste disposal and notorious tendency of uneven current distribution favor electroless nickel plating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schnarr.eu/en/files/SCHNARR_EN_Kanigen.pdf Kanigen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720172201/http://www.schnarr.eu/en/files/SCHNARR_EN_Kanigen.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}. schnarr.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

Electroless nickel plating is self-catalyzing process, the resultant nickel layer is NiP compound, with 7–11% phosphorus content. Properties of the resultant layer hardness and wear resistance are greatly altered with bath composition and deposition temperature, which should be regulated with 1&amp;nbsp;°C precision, typically at 91&amp;nbsp;°C.

During bath circulation, any particles in it will become also nickel-plated; this effect is used to advantage in processes which deposit plating with particles like silicon carbide (SiC) or [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE). While superior compared to many other plating processes, it is expensive because the process is complex. Moreover, the process is lengthy even for thin layers. When only corrosion resistance or surface treatment is of concern, very strict bath composition and temperature control is not required and the process is used for plating many tons in one bath at once.

Electroless nickel plating layers are known to provide extreme surface adhesion when plated properly. Electroless nickel plating is non-magnetic and amorphous. Electroless nickel plating layers are not easily solderable, nor do they seize with other metals or another electroless nickel-plated workpiece under pressure. This effect benefits electroless nickel-plated screws made out of malleable materials like titanium. Electrical resistance is higher compared to pure metal plating.

'''Re-exportation''', also called '''entrepot trade''', may occur when one member of a [[free trade agreement]] charges lower [[tariff|tariffs]] to external nations to win trade, and then re-exports the same product to another partner in the trade agreement, but tariff-free. Re-exportation can be used to avoid sanctions by other nations. 

== Definition of re-export ==
Re-exports consist of foreign goods exported in the same state as previously imported, from the free circulation area, premises for inward processing or industrial free zones, directly to the rest of the world and from premises for customs warehousing or commercial free zones, to the rest of the world.

When dealing with trade data, it is essential to subtract re-exports from normal exports to arrive at the final value of exports.  This is necessary because re-exports do not undergo any value-added processes, so cannot be counted towards a nation's exports.

==Examples==
For example, the [[United Arab Emirates]] may have engaged in re-exportation of goods to [[Iran]] as a way for Iran to avoid U.S. [[trade sanctions]] against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/United-Arab-Emirates.html United Arab Emirates]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus re-exportation involves export without further processing or transformation of a good that has been imported. In contrast, [[Finland]] imported crude oil from the [[Soviet Union]] as part of bilateral trade between these two countries and refined the oil for export to other Western European countries, while the Soviet Union did not intend to sell oil to these capitalist countries, but this was not re-exportation because the crude oil was refined before selling.
[[Dubai]] has emerged as the major re-export center for the entire [[Middle East]] region.

'''Richard Ferdinand Ericson''' (1919–1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[organizational theorist]],  professor emeritus of [[management]] and director of the Interdisciplinary Systems and Cybernetics Project, Program of Policy Studies in Science and Technology at [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

== Biography ==
Richard Ericson received a bachelor's with [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and a master's degree at [[University of Chicago]] and received his doctorate in [[economics]] at [[Indiana University]] in 1952.

He was a full professor at [[Stetson University]] and head of the Department of Management in the School of Business from 1952 to 1956. From 1956 he was appointed associate professor of management in hospital administration at the [[State University of Iowa]]. In 1959 he was a consultant to the Ohio Department of Transportation. After that he moved to Washington DC in 1960, where he had been named professor of business administration at [[George Washington University]], and there in 1969 he became professor of management.

Ericson was organizationally active. He was chairman of the Comparative Administration Task Force at the Academy of Management from 1966 to 1968, and president and managing director of the [[Society for General Systems Research]] in 1968 for a year. In 1969 he became director of the Interdisciplinary Systems and Cybernetics Project, Program of Policy Studies in Science and Technology at George Washington University in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name = "RFE69"&gt;Richard F. Ericson (1969). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710070289_1971070289.pdf ''Organizational cybernetics and human values'']. Program of Policy Studies in Science and Technology. Monograph. George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ericson was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], [[Beta Gamma Sigma]], the [[American Economic Association]], the [[American Management Association]], the [[Society for General Systems Research]], the American Cybernetics Association, the Academy of Management, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and the [[World Future Society]].&lt;ref name = "RFE69"/&gt;

One of his students was an author on management and systems thinking [[Stephen G. Haines]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G. Haines (2000). ''The Complete Guide to Systems Thinking &amp; Learning''. page v.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Ericson's research interests were in the fields of general systems and cybernetics approaches to management theory and practice, value issues in contemporary management,.&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Emeritus" at management.gwu.edu George Washington University. 
Retrieved 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Ericson (1979) believed that "society has now thrust upon it a kind of moral imperative to focus efforts on the utilization of general systems concepts and conceptualizations by policy-forming executives, administrators, and [[Management|manager]]s in all kinds of large-scale organizations."&lt;ref name="BG 1979"&gt;Ericson (1969) cited in: [[Brian R. Gaines]] Ed. [http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/reports/SYS/GS79/GS79.pdf "General systems research: quo vadis?"] in: ''General Systems'': Yearbook of the Society for General Systems Research, Vol.24, 1979, pp.1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Visions of Cybernetic Organizations'', 1972 ===
In his 1972 paper "Visions of Cybernetic Organizations" Ericson stipulated, that in his days a great number of people associated the word "cybernetics" with "computerized information networks, closed loop systems, and robotized man-surrogates, such as ''artorgas'' and ''cyborgs.''"&lt;ref name="RFE 1972"&gt;Ericson (1972, p. 427)&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of the cybernetic organization, Ericson argued is that "they are self-controlling, self-maintaining, self-realizing. Indeed, cybernetics has been characterized as the ''science of effective organization,'' in just these terms."&lt;ref name="RFE 1972"/&gt; In modern organizational cybernetics, the organization is viewed as "a subsystem of a larger system(s), and as comprised itself of functionally interdependent subsystems."&lt;ref&gt;Ericson (1969, p. 14-15.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Society for General Systems Research === 
Ericson was president of the [[Society for General Systems Research]] in the year 1978-79. In his presidential address at the annual meeting in Houston. as Gaines (1979) recalled, Ericson "called for an ''action research agenda'' for the Society for General Systems Research where ''action research is that which results from application of transforming concepts and techniques in an ongoing real world organizational context.''"&lt;ref name="BG 1979"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">'''Robert Christiaan Noortman''' (5 March 1946 – 14 January 2007) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] art dealer.

Noortman, born in [[Heemstede]] opened his first gallery in [[Hulsberg]]. In 1974 he expanded to [[London]] and later also to [[New York City]]. In 1980 he moved his Hulsberg gallery to [[Maastricht]] to merge it with the already existing gallery there, while he closed his foreign galleries. In June 2006 he sold his last gallery for 44 million [[euro]]s and still remained in function as a director.&lt;ref&gt;Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), pp. 157-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Noortman was instrumental in the founding of the Maastricht-based [[The European Fine Art Fair]] and for ten years was TEFAF's director.

For fun Noortman studied for and graduated as a commercial pilot and later flew through twelve European countries in one single day by daylight. This record was named in the [[Guinness Book of Records]].

Noortman suffered from [[osteoarthritis]] and [[cancer]], but died because of a [[myocardial infarction]] on 14 January 2007 in [[Kuttekoven]], two days after he received an award from the city of Maastricht for his positive influence on Maastricht and its area. Earlier in his life he already won the title of "Honorary [[Liveryman]] of the City of London" and the " Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres" in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his death Noortman was accused of art theft, willful destruction of artworks and insurance fraude.&lt;ref&gt;Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), pp. 153-155.&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations by the police, private detectives, the [[Art Loss Register]], Sotheby's and the insurance companies involved, has not led to a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;A quotation from Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), pp. 162-163: ''There is still no legal proof that Noortman orchestrated the theft, and there probably never will be. Nevertheless, Julian Radcliffe [director of the [[Art Loss Register]]] thinks "there's very strong evidence that Noortman was behind the theft and it's highly likely that the insurance companies expect that their claims will be rewarded."''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery, owned by Sotheby's, continued with Noortman's son William as its director, but suffered from negative publicity. After moving first to [[Amsterdam]] and then to London, it closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), pp. 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sports rating system''' is a system that analyzes the results of sports competitions to provide [[Evaluation|rating]]s for each team or player. Common systems include polls of expert voters, [[crowdsourcing]] non-expert voters, betting markets, and computer systems. Ratings, or '''power ratings''', are numerical representations of competitive strength, often directly comparable so that the game outcome between any two teams can be predicted. [[Ranking]]s, or '''power rankings''', can be directly provided (e.g., by asking people to rank teams), or can be derived by sorting each team's ratings and assigning an [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] rank to each team, so that the highest rated team earns the #1 rank. Rating systems provide an alternative to traditional sports [[standings]] which are based on win-loss-tie ratios.

In the United States, the biggest use of sports ratings systems is to rate [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] college football teams in [[NCAA Division I|Division I FBS]], choosing teams to play in the [[College Football Playoff]]. Sports ratings systems are also used to help determine the field for the NCAA [[College basketball|men's and women's basketball]] tournaments, men's professional [[golf]] tournaments, professional [[tennis]] tournaments, and [[NASCAR]]. They are often mentioned in discussions about the teams that could or should receive invitations to participate in certain contests, despite not earning the most direct entrance path (such as a league championship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2011-03-09/sorting-through-teams-on-one-big-bubble |website=[[Sporting News]] |accessdate=2011-03-24 |date=2011-03-09 |last=Fagan |first=Ryan |title=Sorting through teams on one big bubble |quote=This is a look at 20 of the teams (in alphabetical order) residing on this year’s big ol’ bubble.

The two other ranking indexes include margin of victory in their formulas—the Pomeroy ratings (at kenpom.com) and Sagarin ratings (via USA Today)—aren’t new but have played an increased role in discussions about potential seeds during this college basketball season.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer rating systems can tend toward [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], without specific player, team, regional, or style bias. [[Ken Massey]] writes that an advantage of computer rating systems is that they can "objectively track all" 351 college basketball teams, while human polls "have limited value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Ken Massey]] |user= masseyratings|number= 529238966965661696 |date= 3 Nov 2014 |title= @kenpomeroy human polls have limited value.  Computer systems can objectively track all the teams.  http://www.masseyratings.com/cb/compare.htm #all351 |access-date= 9 Nov 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer ratings are verifiable and repeatable, and are comprehensive, requiring assessment of all selected criteria. By comparison, rating systems relying on human polls include inherent human subjectivity; this may or may not be an attractive property depending on system needs.

== History ==

Sports ratings systems have been around for almost 80 years, when ratings were calculated on paper rather than by computer, as most are today.  Some older computer systems still in use today include: [[Jeff Sagarin|Jeff Sagarin's]] systems, the ''[[New York Times]]'' system, and the [[Dunkel Index]], which dates back to 1929. Before the advent of the college football playoff, the [[Bowl Championship Series]] championship game participants were determined by a combination of expert polls and computer systems.

== Theory ==

Sports ratings systems use a variety of methods for rating teams, but the most prevalent method is called a power rating.  The power rating of a team is a calculation of the team's strength relative to other teams in the same league or division.  The basic idea is to maximize the amount of [[transitive relation]]s in a given data set due to game outcomes.  For example, if A defeats B and B defeats C, then one can safely say that A&gt;B&gt;C.

There are obvious problems with basing a system solely on wins and losses.  For example, if C defeats A, then an [[Intransitivity|intransitive]] relation is established (A&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;C&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;A) and a ranking violation will occur if this is the only data available.  Scenarios such as this happen fairly regularly in sports—for example, in the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] beat [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], Ohio State beat [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], and Michigan beat Penn State.  To address these logical breakdowns, rating systems usually consider other criteria such as the game's score and where the match was held (for example, to assess a [[home field advantage]]).  In most cases though, each team plays a sufficient amount of other games during a given season, which lessens the overall effect of such violations.

From an [[academic]] perspective, the use of [[linear algebra]] and [[statistics]] are popular among many of the systems' authors to determine their ratings. Some academic work is published in forums like the [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]], others in traditional statistics, mathematics, psychology, and computer science journals.

If sufficient "inter-divisional" league play is not accomplished, teams in an isolated division may be artificially propped up or down in the overall ratings due to a lack of correlation to other teams in the overall league.  This phenomenon is evident in systems that analyze historical college football seasons, such as when the top [[Ivy League]] teams of the 1970s, like [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], were calculated by some rating systems to be comparable with accomplished powerhouse teams of that era such as [[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], and [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]].  This conflicts with the subjective opinion that claims that while good in their own right, they were not nearly as good as those top programs.  However, this may be considered a "pro" by non-[[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] teams in Division I-A college football who point out that ratings systems have proven that their top teams belong in the same strata as the BCS teams.  This is evidenced by the 2004 [[University of Utah|Utah]] team that went undefeated in the regular season and earned a BCS bowl bid due to the bump in their overall BCS ratings via the computer ratings component.  They went on to play and defeat the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] champion [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] in the 2005 [[Fiesta Bowl]] by a score of 35-7.  A related example occurred during the 2006 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] where [[George Mason University|George Mason]] were awarded an at-large tournament bid due to their regular season record and their [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI rating]] and rode that opportunity all the way to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]].

Goals of some rating systems differ from one another. For example, systems may be crafted to provide a perfect retrodictive analysis of the games played to-date, while others are predictive and give more weight to future trends rather than past results.  This results in the potential for misinterpretation of rating system results by people unfamiliar with these goals; for example, a rating system designed to give accurate [[point spread]] predictions for gamblers might be ill-suited for use in selecting teams most deserving to play in a championship game or tournament.

==Rating considerations==

===Home advantage===
[[File:France national team fans.jpg|thumb|right|France national basketball team fans]]
{{main article|Home advantage}}
When two teams of equal quality play, the team at home tends to win more often. The size of the effect changes based on the era of play, game type, season length, sport, even [[Circadian advantage|number of time zones crossed]]. But across all conditions, "simply playing at home increases the chances of winning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wjh.harvard.edu/~jamieson/JJ_JASP.pdf|title=The Home Field Advantage in Athletics: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|last=Jamieson|first=Jeremy P.|accessdate=11 November 2014|date=2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=1819–1848|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A win away from home is therefore seen more favorably than a win at home, because it was more challenging. Home advantage (which, for sports played on a pitch, is almost always called "home field advantage") is also based on the qualities of the individual stadium and crowd; the advantage in the NFL can be more than a 4-point difference from the stadium with the least advantage to the stadium with the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/bill-barnwell-best-home-field-advantages/|website=[[Grantland]]|last=Barnwell|first=Bill|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2014|title=Safe at Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strength of schedule===
{{main article|Strength of schedule}}
Strength of schedule refers to the quality of a team's opponents. A win against an inferior opponent is usually seen less favorably than a win against a superior opponent. Often teams in the same league, who are compared against each other for championship or playoff consideration, have not played the same opponents. Therefore, judging their relative win-loss records is complicated.
{{quote|text=We looked beyond the record. The committee placed significant value on Oregon's quality of wins.|sign=[[College football playoff]] committee chairman [[Jeff Long (athletic director)|Jeff Long]]|source=press conference, week 12 of the 2014 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Russo |first=Ralph D. |title=Oregon up to 2 in playoff rankings; TCU to 4th |url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/347875155d53465d95cec892aeb06419/Article_2014-11-11-FBC-Playoff-Rankings/id-c0570dfb5a0044a798224fbef5da73b8 |agency=Associated Press |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after ranking 9–1 Oregon above 9–0 Florida State}}
The college football playoff committee uses a limited strength-of-schedule algorithm that only considers opponents' records and opponents' opponents' records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Stewart Mandel]] |user= slmandel|number= 532624545300369408 |date= 12 Nov 2014 |title= Committee doesn't use an SOS ranking. It looks at opponents' record and opponents' opponents record. |access-date= 12 Nov 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (much like [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI]]).

===Points versus wins===
A key dichotomy among sports rating systems lies in the representation of game outcomes. Some systems store final scores as [[Three-valued logic|ternary]] discrete events: wins, draws, and losses. Other systems record the exact final game score, then judge teams based on [[margin of victory]]. Rating teams based on margin of victory is often criticized as creating an incentive for coaches to run up the score, an "unsportsmanlike" outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/RICHARDS%253A-BCS-removes-margin-of-victory-element |newspaper=[[Fox Sports]] |date=2001 |accessdate=12 November 2014|last=Richards|first=Darryl|title=BCS removes margin-of-victory element}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other systems choose a middle ground, reducing the [[marginal value]] of additional points as the margin of victory increases. Sagarin chose to clamp the margin of victory to a predetermined amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/ncaaf/sagarin/|title=NCAAF Jeff Sagarin Ratings|last=Sagarin|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Sagarin|date=Fall 2014|accessdate=12 November 2014|website=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches include the use of a decay function, such as a [[logarithm]] or placement on a [[cumulative distribution function]].

===In-game information===
Beyond points or wins, some system designers choose to include more granular information about the game. Examples include time of possession of the ball, individual statistics, and lead changes. Data about weather, injuries, or "throw-away" games near season's end may affect game outcomes but are difficult to model. "Throw-away games" are games where teams have already earned playoff slots and have secured their playoff seeding before the end of the regular season, and want to rest/protect their starting players by benching them for remaining regular season games. This usually results in unpredictable outcomes and may skew the outcome of rating systems.

===Team composition===
Teams often shift their composition between and within games, and players routinely get injured. Rating a team is often about rating a specific collection of players. Some systems assume [[parity (sports)|parity]] among all members of the league, such as each team being built from an equitable pool of players via a [[Draft (sports)|draft]] or [[free agent|free agency]] system as is done in many major league sports such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. This is certainly not the case in collegiate leagues such as Division I-A football or men's and women's basketball.

===Cold start===
At the beginning of a season, there have been no games from which to judge teams' relative quality. Solutions to the cold start problem often include some measure of the previous season, perhaps weighted by what percent of the team is returning for the new season. [[ARGH Power Ratings]] is an example of a system that uses multiple previous years plus a percentage weight of returning players.

==Rating methods==
{{inc-sport}}

===Permutation of standings===
Several methods offer some permutation of traditional standings. This search for the "real" win-loss record often involves using other data, such as point differential or identity of opponents, to alter a team's record in a way that is easily understandable. Sportswriter [[Gregg Easterbrook]] created a measure of Authentic Games, which only considers games played against opponents deemed to be of sufficiently high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/TMQWeekEleven141118/more-defensive-penalties-causes-change-nfl-tuesday-morning-quarterback|title=More flags on D spins scoreboards|last=Easterbrook|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Easterbrook|date=18 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014|website=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that all wins are not created equal.
{{quote|text=I went through the first few weeks of games and redid everyone’s records, tagging each game as either a legitimate win or loss, an ass-kicking win or loss, or an either/or game. And if anything else happened in that game with gambling repercussions – a comeback win, a blown lead, major dysfunction, whatever — I tagged that, too.|sign=[[Bill Simmons]], sportswriter|source=[[Grantland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/week-8-picks-a-gambling-epiphany/|title=Week 8 Picks: A Gambling Epiphany|last=Simmons|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Simmons|date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014|website=[[Grantland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Pythagorean====
{{main article|Pythagorean expectation}}
Pythagorean expectation, or Pythagorean projection, calculates a percentage based on the number of points a team has scored and allowed. Typically the formula involves the number of points scored, raised to some exponent, placed in the numerator. Then the number of points the team allowed, raised to the same exponent, is placed in the denominator and added to the value in the numerator. [[Football Outsiders]] has used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schatz|first1=Aaron|last2=Alamar|first2=Ben|last3=Barnwell|first3=Bill |author4=Bill Connelly |author5=Doug Farrar|title=Football Outsiders Almanac 2011: The Essential Guide to the 2011 NFL and College Football Seasons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E84YYAAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=978-1-4662-4613-3|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Pythagorean wins} = \frac{\text{Points For}^{2.37}}{\text{Points For}^{2.37} + \text{Points Against}^{2.37}}\times \text{Games Played}.&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting percentage is often compared to a team's true winning percentage, and a team is said to have "overachieved" or "underachieved" compared to the Pythagorean expectation. For example, [[Bill Barnwell]] calculated that before week 9 of the 2014 NFL season, the [[Arizona Cardinals]] had a Pythagorean record two wins lower than their real record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nfl-at-the-half-breaking-down-the-numbers/|title=NFL at the Half: Breaking Down the Numbers|last=Barnwell|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Barnwell|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2015|website=[[Grantland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Simmons]] cites Barnwell's work before week 10 of that season and adds that "any numbers nerd is waving a “REGRESSION!!!!!” flag right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/revisiting-the-y2k-compliant-quarterbacks/|last=Simmons|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Simmons|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014|title=Revisiting the Y2K-Compliant Quarterbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the Arizona Cardinals' regular season record was 8-1 going into the 10th week of the 2014 season. The Pythagorean win formula implied a winning percentage of 57.5%, based on 208 points scored and 183 points allowed. Multiplied by 9 games played, the Cardinals' Pythagorean expectation was 5.2 wins and 3.8 losses. The team had "overachieved" at that time by 2.8 wins, derived from their actual 8 wins less the expected 5.2 wins, an increase of 0.8 overachieved wins from just a week prior.

===Trading "skill points"===
{{main article|Elo rating system}}
Originally designed by [[Arpad Elo]] as a method for ranking chess players, several people have adapted the Elo rating system for team sports such as basketball, soccer and American football. For instance, [[Jeff Sagarin]] and [[FiveThirtyEight]] publish NFL football rankings using Elo methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/|title=Introducing NFL Elo Ratings|last=Silver|first=Nate|authorlink=Nate Silver|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014|website=[[FiveThirtyEight]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elo ratings initially assign strength values to each team, and teams trade points based on the outcome of each game.

===Solving equations===

Researchers like Matt Mills use [[Markov chains]] to model college football games, with team strength scores as outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thespread.us/continuous-markov-ratings.html|last=Mills|first=Matt|website=The Spread|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=21 December 2014|title=Using Continuous-Time Markov Chains to Rank College Football Teams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms like Google's [[PageRank]] have also been adapted to rank football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ranking-nfl-teams-using-network-science-konstantinos-pelechrinis?trk=prof-post/|website=[[LinkedIN]]|date=17 March 2016|accessdate=17 March 2016|title=Ranking NFL teams using Network Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBAnalysis/comments/2ppfg3/modifying_googles_page_ranking_algorithm_to_rank/|website=[[Reddit]]|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|title=Modifying Google's Page Ranking Algorithm to rank teams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Federation of Private Entrepreneurs of La Paz (Federación de Empresarios Privados de la Paz, FEPLP)''', is a [[Chamber of commerce|civil association]], independent and autonomous, that represents all the private business in the Department of [[La Paz|La Paz, Bolivia]]. A non-profit organization, the Federation of Private Entrepreneurs of La Paz was founded on November 25, 1993, as a result of the necessity to protect and represent private entrepreneurs and their chambers in La Paz, as well as to promote economic and social development in La Paz.

From 2011 to 2012, the FELPLP worked on the initiative '''Forum for the Development of the Department of La Paz''', A partnership with government entities, foundations, and other organizations to undertake and design actions to articulate all different levels of government and public entities, and to prioritize actions that would lead to the development of La Paz. The main participants were: the Association of Organizations of Ecological Producers of Bolivia (la Asociación de Organizaciones de Productores Ecológicos de Bolivia, AOPEB), the Joint Committee of Campesino Economic Organizations (Coordinadora Integral de Organizaciones Económicas Campesinas, CIOEC), the Federation of Private Entrepreneurs of La Paz (FEPLP), the government of La Paz, the Jubilee Foundation, the [[University of San Andrés]] (Universidad de San Andrés), and the Autonomous Government of the Municipality of La Paz (Gobierno Autónomo Municipal de La Paz, GAMLP),). The FEPLP then coordinated roundtables to further discuss the topics concluded at the Forum. The priority areas taken into consideration were energy, tourism, textiles, water, organic food production, and the importance of improving productive supply chains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Some of the sponsors of the Forum were the Embassy of Denmark, PNUD Art Bolivia, Al Invest IV Region Andina, and National Chamber of Commerce, Bolivia.

'''Sir Thomas Elder''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|GCMG}} (5 August 1818 – 6 March 1897) was a Scottish-Australian pastoralist, highly successful businessman, philanthropist, politician, race-horse owner and breeder, and public figure. Amongst many other things, he is notable for introducing camels to Australia.

==Early years==
Elder was born at [[Kirkcaldy]], Scotland, the fourth son of George Elder, merchant, and his wife Joanna Haddow, ''née'' Lang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Australasia|Elder, Sir Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas' second eldest brother, [[Alexander Lang Elder]] (1815–1885),&lt;ref name=Alex&gt;Gosse, Fayette, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/elder-alexander-lang-3888 'Elder, Alexander Lang (1815–1885)'], ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 4, Melbourne University Press, 1972, pp. 133–134. Retrieved on 15 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; went to [[South Australia]] in 1839 and founded the firm of Elder and Company in [[Adelaide]]. He was joined by his brothers William (1813–1882)&lt;ref name=William&gt;Gosse, Fayette, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040135b.htm 'Elder, William (1813–1882)'], ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 4, Melbourne University Press, 1972, pp. 133–134. Retrieved on 11 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and George (1816–1897).&lt;ref name=George&gt;Gosse, Fayette, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040578b.htm 'Elder, George (1816–1897)'], ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 4, Melbourne University Press, 1972, pp. 133–134. Retrieved on 11 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1846 George and Alex went into partnership with experienced pastoralist [[William Spence Peter|W.S. Peter]] to establish a sheep run they named Warrow Station, located at Coulta near Port Lincoln. In August 1851 Alex was elected a member of the Legislative Council for West Adelaide. He resigned his seat in March 1853, and left South Australia. He settled in London in 1855, and acted as agent for the Adelaide company until 1884, when he and his sons established A. L. Elder &amp; Company. William left Adelaide soon after Alexander. George left in 1855.

==South Australia==
Thomas Elder&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Gosse, Fayette, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040579b.htm 'Elder, Sir Thomas (1818–1897)'], ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 4, Melbourne University Press, 1972, pp. 133–134. Retrieved on 11 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; migrated to Adelaide in 1854 and worked with George for a year. After George departed, Thomas formed Elder, Stirling &amp; Co, a partnership with [[Edward Stirling]],&lt;ref&gt;Hans Mincham, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060217b.htm 'Stirling, Edward (1804–1873)'], ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, 1976, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Barr Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Dissel, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060175b.htm 'Smith, Robert Barr (1824–1915)'], ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, 1976, pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; and John Taylor. In 1856 Barr Smith married Thomas Elder's sister Joanna, and on Stirling and Taylor's retirement in 1863, Barr Smith and Thomas Elder formed [[Elders Limited|Elder Smith and Co]]. In 1875, with [[Andrew Tennant (pastoralist)|Andrew Tennant]],&lt;ref name=Tennant&gt;Combe, Gordon D., [http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060273b.htm 'Tennant, Andrew (1835–1913)'], ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, 1976, pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt; they formed the [[Adelaide Steamship Company]].

In 1864 he persuaded [[Arthur Hardy (businessman)|Arthur Hardy]] to sell him his [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] home "Birksgate", which he developed considerably. In 1897 it passed to his nephew [[T. E. Barr Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunton, Eric ''Gracious Homes of Colonial Adelaide'' published by the author 1983 {{ISBN|0 959 2094 0 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastoralist==
Elder also had other important interests. In partnership with Robert Barr Smith, they acquired [[Nilpena]] Station in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/overview.htm|title=The Early South Australian Pastoral Industry |year=2014|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=Flinders Range Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became associated with [[Peter Waite (philanthropist)|Peter Waite]] in the Paratoo run in 1862, in the same year bought [[Beltana, South Australia|Beltana]] station, and eventually became the owner of an enormous tract of country. Other properties Thomas acquired during this time included [[Ketchowla Station]], [[Oulnina]], Anabama, Tualkilky, Grampus, Ouratan and Netley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article56565858 |title=The man on the land |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=25 May 1926 |accessdate=14 September 2013 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have held at one time a pastoral area greater in extent than the whole of Scotland. Much of this was land with a very low rainfall, and Elder spent a great deal of money sinking [[artesian well]]s, making dams and fencing. In January 1866&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28783869 |title=Camels for the North |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=9 January 1866 |accessdate=29 April 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; he imported 120 [[Australian feral camel|camel]]s from India with [[Afghan (Australia)|"Afghan"]] attendants, which were of much use in the dry areas and in conveying supplies from [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]]. In 1868 he chartered [[Henry Simpson (shipping)|Henry Simpson]]'s ''Kohinoor'' to return the "Afghans" and bring out another 60 camels and a fresh contingent of attendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31984053 |title=Novel Overland Carriage |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=13 November 1868 |accessdate=29 April 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; They became an important factor in the development of the northern area of South Australia.

==Investor, politician, race horses, vigneron==
Elder was very fortunate in his mining ventures. Early in the sixties he had large interests in the [[Moonta, South Australia|Moonta]] and [[Wallaroo, South Australia|Wallaroo]] copper-mines which brought him in a huge fortune. He entered political life as a member of the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] in 1863 but retired in 1869. He was again elected in 1871, but resigned in 1878 and took no further part in politics.

Elder was much interested in horses and made the breeding of blood stock a hobby. He was a leading racing man between 1875 and 1884 and had the highest reputation. It was well known that any horse bearing his colours was in the race to win. He sold his race-horses in 1884 but continued his stud.

Elder also had interests in the wine industry and was quite successful in exhibitions in Adelaide and London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The winding vine of time|url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/columnists/the-winding-vine-of-time/story-fn845mx8-1226993068626|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a founder of the [[Tintara]] Vineyard company in 1862.

==Philanthropy==
Elder encouraged exploration, contributed largely to [[Peter Egerton Warburton|Warburton's]] 1873 expedition and [[Ernest Giles|Giles's]] in 1875, supplying camels in each case, which proved to be of the greatest value. He also contributed liberally to the cost of other explorations, and in no case sought or obtained any return for himself. On one occasion he offered £5,000 on condition that a like sum was subscribed by the public to finance an expedition to the [[Southern Ocean]], but the condition was not fulfilled.

He supported every kind of manly sport and his benefactions both private and public were widespread and almost without limit.

The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] received a bequest of £25,000, and many of the finest pictures of the gallery were purchased from this fund. He contributed substantially to the Library's acquisition program. He himself published a small booklet in 1893: ''Notes from a Pocket Journal of a Trip up the River Murray in 1856'', recounting a voyage in the steamer ''Gundagai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article101505270 |title=The Early Navigation of the Murray |newspaper=[[The Albury Banner and Wodonga Express]] |location=NSW |date=25 July 1919 |accessdate=31 May 2014 |page=40 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 he gave £20,000 towards an endowment fund for the newly established [[University of Adelaide]], and on his death in 1897 bequeathed a further £65,000 to the University, £20,000 of which was for a School of Music. The [[Elder Conservatorium|Elder Conservatorium of Music]] perpetuates his name. Elder's combined gifts and bequests to the University amount to nearly £100,000.

===Elder Professor of Mathematics===
One of Elder's bequests established and funded the first professorships at the fledgeling University; the Elder Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy; and the Elder Professor of Natural Sciences. The first incumbent, Sir [[Horace Lamb]], an applied mathematician, lectured in pure and applied mathematics as well as giving instruction in practical physics. After Lamb's resignation in 1885 to take up a post at Owens College, Manchester, separate Chairs in Mathematics and Physics were established. The Elder Chair of Mathematics at the University of Adelaide has been held by many eminent mathematicians, including Nobel Prize winner Sir William Henry Bragg.

The '''Trueblood Committee''' was formed by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) in 1972, and developed the Objective of Financial Statements. The committee's goal was to create financial statements that helped external users make decisions about the economics of companies. In 1978, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB), whose purpose is to develop generally accepted accounting principles, adopted the key objectives established by the Trueblood Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Trueblood Committee: Objectives of Financial Statements|last=|first=|date=1987|website=|publisher=Journal of Accountancy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trueblood Committee was named for its chairman Robert M. Trueblood.  His previous experience on the executive committees of both the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) and the [[Accounting Principles Board]] (APB) earned him the position of chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Profile of the President: Robert M. Trueblood|last=|first=|date=1965|website=|publisher=Journal of Accountancy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AICPA began hunting for new objectives of financial statements because prior to the development of the Trueblood Committee many accountants were confused and dissatisfied with the current objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, C. Reed. “The Trueblood Report: An Analyst's View.” ''Financial Analysts Journal'', vol. 31, no. 1, 1975, pp. 32–56. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/4477781&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying the objectives to financial statements was the purpose behind the creation of the Trueblood Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seagov.org/aboutpmg/history.shtml|title=SEA Reporting for Governments—About SEA Reporting|website=www.seagov.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's mission was to create the objectives in a way that would be more easily understandable by accountants and also more relatable to their work.&lt;ref&gt;Trueblood Committee: Objectives of Financial Statements. (1987). ''Journal of Accountancy'', ''163''(5), 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two key concepts to take away from the findings of the Trueblood Committee are:
* The basic objective of financial statements is to provide useful information to external users for making decisions about a company.
* The management of a business is responsible for effectively using resources to achieve maximum profits.

He flew to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to lobby against drug legalization, meeting with the Los Angeles mayor, Los Angeles county sheriff, and U.S. drug czar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14640">In United Kingdom law, the concept of '''wrongful dismissal''' refers exclusively to dismissal contrary to the contract of employment, which effectively means premature termination, either due to insufficient notice or lack of grounds. Although [[wrongful dismissal]] is usually associated with lack of notice sometimes it can also be caused by arbitrary dismissal where no notice was required but certain grounds were specified in the contract as being the only ones available but none existed.

{{Clist wrongful dismissal}}

== Definitions ==
Wrongful dismissal does not terminate the contract - it is a [[repudiatory breach]], i.e. one entitling the employee to consider himself no longer bound on the basis of the employer no longer considering itself bound. The employer's repudiatory breach (wrongful dismissal) forces the employee to accept it as he is prevented from earning from the employer and required to mitigate by working for someone else, thus terminating the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Boyo v Lambeth London Borough Council [1994] ICR 727&lt;/ref&gt; This does not follow contract law and is an invention by judges, disliked by others, designed to reflect the reality of employment, using the dual fictions that because the right to wages depends on the obligation to work, there is no right to wages if the employer tells the employee not to work&lt;ref&gt;Gunton v Richmond upon Thames LBC [1980] ICR 755&lt;/ref&gt; (forgetting that the employer is not able to terminate the obligation to work other than in accordance with the contract) and that the employee has accepted the repudiation by not working for the employer even though he is willing and able. Otherwise the employee would be entitled to stay at home at the employer's request yet sue for unpaid wages as a debt.

An employer is only entitled to dismiss an employee without notice:
* in the first month,
* if the contract says so, or
* if the employee conducts himself so as to undermine the trust and confidence such that the employer should no longer be required to retain the employee in his employment.

The last example, trust and confidence, is commonly known as "gross misconduct", but  employment law only distinguishes between misconduct that justifies dismissal and misconduct that does not. Conduct entitling the employer to terminate the contract is conduct indicating the employee no longer considers himself bound by it and so is technically accepting the termination caused by the employee. Gross misconduct is really just a vague list of offences that could most easily justify summary dismissal for a first offence.

Dismissal for a reason contrary to statute or contrary to a statutory procedure is described as "[[unfair dismissal]]" but not all wrongful dismissals are unfair dismissals, and dismissal by forcing somebody to resign through serious breach of contract is known as [[constructive dismissal]] and constructive dismissal is usually a wrongful dismissal due to lack of notice.

===Employer loses restrictive covenants===
If an employer dismisses an employee without legally required notice then the employee is usually not bound by restrictive covenants&lt;ref&gt;General Billposting Co Ltd v Atkinson [1909] AC 118&lt;/ref&gt; (increasingly though courts treat pay in lieu of notice as curing lack of notice&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams v Performing Rights Society Ltd [1995] ICR 1028&lt;/ref&gt;). This means the employer of a senior employee privy to company secrets should be careful not to unjustifiably summarily dismiss him, or put him on garden leave or pay him in lieu of notice without a contractual provision allowing it, or even miscalculate his notice period making it a day short.

Sometimes an employer can restore such covenants in a compromise agreement by paying a nominal sum of, say, £500 for them. The employer cannot circumvent the risk of a summary dismissal turning out to have been unlawful by giving notice, as that would imply the employee's breach of contract was insufficient to justify summary dismissal.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Notice period===
The notice period will usually be in the written agreement, otherwise there are statutory minimums but a court can imply a reasonable period and often will if it thinks the employee has been treated shabbily - for example, one week can turn into a month, and one month can turn into three months. The statutory minima are one week for one month to two years' service then one extra week per year of service from two to twelve years up to a maximum of 12 weeks. The minima will also override contractual provisions if insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Employment Rights Act 1996 s86&lt;/ref&gt; Common law notice, used by courts where the contract is silent, depends on the work, seniority, length of service and payment intervals, but not on what the employer can afford;&lt;ref&gt;Clark v Fahrenheit 451 (Communications) Ltd EAT/591/99&lt;/ref&gt; senior specialists can be given six or even up to twelve months.

===Right to work===

The employee is always entitled to be paid during his employment and the required notice period; they are often also entitled to work. Requiring the employee to spend the time in leisure (IE at home, on vacation, etc.) in order to "get them out of the way" can be considered illegal, even though it may be usually considered a benefit to the employee.

If an employer wants an exiting employee out of the way and does not have the contractual right to put him on [[garden leave]], or pay him in lieu of notice, then the only options are to encourage the use of holiday and offer a compromise agreement to waive his right to sue, in return for the intentional breach of contract. Sometimes the breach turns the termination payment into compensation rather than wages, making it tax-free, so the employee may be only too happy to go along with the ruse.

===Remedies===

In a tribunal the remedy would be compensation; in court the remedy would be damages but rarely an injunction. An injunction could be awarded to enforce a contractual disciplinary procedure,&lt;ref&gt;Barros D'sa v University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust [2001] EWCA Civ 983&lt;/ref&gt; but because compensation is usually an adequate remedy for premature termination, an injunction is generally not available to keep a job going,&lt;ref&gt;Marsh v National Autistic Society [1993] ICR 453&lt;/ref&gt; even in a redundancy situation where the selection process has been circumvented.
Action for wrongful dismissal can be brought within 6 years following the breach of an employment contract.

===Compensation===

====Losses====
For the notice period the employer must pay wages (including any anticipated pay rise&lt;ref&gt;Clarke v BET plc [1997] IRLR 348&lt;/ref&gt;) and benefits&lt;ref&gt;Fosca Services (UK) Ltd v Birkett [1996] IRLR 325&lt;/ref&gt; except holiday;
for wrongful dismissal, it is only possible to claim for lost earnings&lt;ref&gt;Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909]&lt;/ref&gt; and damage to reputation,&lt;ref&gt;Malik v Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International SA [1997] ICR 606&lt;/ref&gt; not for the manner of dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull CC [2004] EWCA Civ 84, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefits====
Benefits include:
* pension,
* commission accrued and owed,&lt;ref&gt;M De Luca v Longbridge International plc 2002 LTL 2 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* bonus,
* overtime,
* accrued holiday on unpaid sick leave,&lt;ref&gt;Brown v Kigass Aero Components Ltd [2002] IRLR 312&lt;/ref&gt;
* income protection benefit and personal use of company car (usually running cost or hire car).&lt;ref&gt;Shove v Downs Surgical plc [1984] 1 All ER 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Share options will often be excluded by small print.

====Bonuses====
To avoid arguments about whether these would have been earned, it may make sense to compromise by paying the usual sort of overtime or bonus the employee would have gotten if working. Courts are astute to employers trying to wriggle out of paying commission with arguments like "it was not triggered because we dismissed him before pay day".&lt;ref&gt;Brand v Compro Computer Services Ltd [2004] IDS Brief 754&lt;/ref&gt; The employer is under a duty to act in good faith,&lt;ref&gt;Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald [2003] IRLR 765&lt;/ref&gt; not to exercise discretion spitefully or in bad faith&lt;ref&gt;Midland Bank plc v McCann, EAT 1041/97&lt;/ref&gt; and not to act perversely, irrationally or capriciously.&lt;ref&gt;Manor House Healthcare v Hayes, EAT 1196/99&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deductions====
The deductions that can be made from compensation are:
* replacement earnings or what the employee should have earned had he bothered to try (failure to mitigate),&lt;ref&gt;Yetton v Eastwoods Froy Ltd [1967] 1 WLR 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy v Polk (Leeds) Ltd [2004] IRLR 420&lt;/ref&gt;
* social security actually received&lt;ref&gt;Secretary of State for Employment v Stewart [1996] IRLR 334&lt;/ref&gt; or which could have been had he bothered to apply&lt;ref&gt;Westwood v Secretary of State for Employment [1985] ICR 209&lt;/ref&gt; and
* compensation already awarded for unfair dismissal under the same heading.&lt;ref&gt;O'Laoire v Jackel International Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mitigation====
Because it is a contract claim, the employee has a duty to mitigate his loss by seeking employment, as soon as possible, for as high a wage as possible;so the tribunal or court would deduct earnings from a new job, during the correct notice period from compensation due, but if the employer attempts to do this unilaterally, it may simply trigger a claim that would not otherwise have happened, had it turned a blind eye to the employee making a couple of weeks' wages out of the situation. Due to the disproportionate cost of employment litigations, it is usually sensible for an employer to err on the side of generosity, trying to ensure the parting of ways is amicable rather than showing off how many loopholes can be found.
Pensions cannot be deducted.&lt;ref&gt;Parry v Cleaver [1970] AC 1, HL&lt;/ref&gt;
It is possible for a contract to be worded so as to make the pay in lieu of notice a debt, to which the employee is entitled even if he gets a new job the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory v Wallace [1998] IRLR 387&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==

===Breaches of contract===

Wrongful dismissal is the lesser type of unlawful dismissal, costing only what it would have done to keep the employee during the notice period, but it can be slightly dangerous for the employer, due to the potential loss of restrictive covenants and due to the employee being able to start alleging all sorts of breaches of contract, to try to use up the £25,000 breach of contract allowance in a tribunal, and if he takes the employer to court instead there is no limit and it could end  with significantly high costs.

====Examples====

Breaches of contract by the employer serious enough to create a wrongful dismissal are also a constructive dismissal; wrongful dismissals not caused by insufficient notice would have been caused by another breach, such as of the duty not to destroy the mutual bond of trust, and have included failure to inform of pension rights.&lt;ref&gt;Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board [1991] ICR 771&lt;/ref&gt;
The employer has no duty to act what would normally be called in good faith, but must not act in bad faith or insufficiently in good faith such that it breaks the mutual bond of trust.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd [1991] ICR 524&lt;/ref&gt; The obligation is usually not to do anything bad as opposed to doing something good.

====Losses====

The employee could allege extra breaches of contract and losses including:

* loss of earnings and psychiatrist fees for psychiatric injury caused by wrongful dismissal,&lt;ref&gt;Gogay v Hertfordshire CC [2000] IRLR 703&lt;/ref&gt;
* loss of earnings for the time it would have taken to follow the correct disciplinary procedure,
* loss of earnings for unpaid sick leave caused by bullying,
* loss of earnings caused by demotion,
* loss of earnings caused by stigma of association with a corrupt employer affecting many employees (as opposed to an incident of dishonesty),
* redundancy pay lost due to being terminated just before they would have qualified for two years' service, and
* loss of health insurance.

==Defences==

Successful defences have been:
* the employer discovers that the employee was in such serious breach, that he could have been summarily dismissed,&lt;ref&gt;Boston Deep Sea Fishing and Ice Co Ltd v Ansell (1888) 39 ChD 339&lt;/ref&gt;
* the contract allowed dismissal  without disciplinary procedure, as long as notice was given or paid in lieu.&lt;ref&gt;Bridgen v American Express Bank Ltd [2000] IRLR 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to unfair dismissal==

A wrongful dismissal can be a fair or unfair dismissal, just as an unfair dismissal may or may not be a wrongful dismissal in terms of whether the correct notice was given.

If the employee had two year's service he could claim unfair dismissal if there was something wrong with the decision to dismiss as opposed to the length of notice. If the wrongfulness was the lack of grounds then is it pretty certain to also be an unfair dismissal.

The unfair dismissal claim would, if he is well advised, be in respect of the post-termination period and sue in court for wrongful dismissal in respect of the notice period, thus stretching out the statutory limits by making the unfair dismissal limit only start running from a later date to allow perhaps more loss of earnings and ignoring the breach of contract limit by using the court instead of tribunal to deal with wrongful dismissal. The burden of proving double recovery is on the employer and tribunal awards for unfair dismissal can be vague as to what and when they are for.&lt;ref&gt;O'Laoire v Jackel International Ltd (No 2) [1991] ICR 718&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to constructive dismissal==
A wrongful dismissal can be actual or constructive, but a constructive dismissal is almost certain to be a wrongful one, since the correct notice will not have been given if the dismissal was caused by a resignation, itself caused by the employer's serious breach of contract. An employee who was constructively dismissed, as well as possibly having a claim for breach of the duty not to destroy the bond of mutual trust, will usually have a claim for wrongful dismissal. As only economic loss can be claimed for breach of contract, the main loss will be earnings due to the lost notice period, as opposed to any disgruntlement about the manner or reason for dismissal, so the constructive nature of the dismissal tends to disappear into the claim for lost notice period.
