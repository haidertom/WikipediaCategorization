'''''A Prairie Home Companion''''' is a 2006 American [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Robert Altman]] and is his final film. The film is a fictional representation of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running [[A Prairie Home Companion|public radio show of the same name]]. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box office success on its small budget.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Meryl Streep]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Garrison Keillor]], [[Virginia Madsen]], [[John C. Reilly]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]].

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=October 2015}}
A long-running live radio show is in danger of being canceled by new owners of the company that holds both radio station "WLT" and the theater where the show is broadcast. The film takes place on the night of the show's last performance. The show has two visitors: an angel calling herself Asphodel ([[Virginia Madsen]]) comes to comfort the people who work on the show and to escort one of them to the afterlife, while "the Axeman" ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), a representative of the new owners, arrives to judge whether the show should be canceled. He makes it clear that the show is not what he considers modern popular programming, and though he too is escorted by the angel, the show is shut down anyway. In an [[epilogue]] at the end of the film the former cast members are reunited at [[Mickey's Diner]]. Their conversation pauses as they are joined by Asphodel.

==Production notes==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
To receive insurance for the shoot, [[Robert Altman]] had to hire [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] as a "backup" director to observe filming at all times and be prepared to take over for Altman in case of his incapacity. Using the working title ''The Last Show'', [[principal photography]] for the film began on June 29, 2005, at the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] (the usual venue for the radio show). Filming ended on July 28, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The film was the second major picture (after ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]'', starring [[Charlize Theron]] and Harrelson) to be filmed in [[Minnesota]] in 2005.{{cn|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/02/daily_dispatch_3.html Indie Wire] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060611214920/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/02/daily_dispatch_3.html |date=June 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/27/AR2005072702372_pf.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Peter|last=Kaufman|title=Radio for the Eyes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/23/movies/MoviesFeatures/23prai.html?ex=1279771200&amp;en=3fa151765fc0ec7f&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|work=The New York Times|first=David|last=Carr|title=Lake Wobegon Goes Hollywood (or Is It Vice Versa?), With a Pretty Good Cast|date=July 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the Fitzgerald is a rather small building, other stage theaters in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] region had been considered as stand-ins, but in the end, the necessary film equipment was crammed into the structure.{{cn|date=December 2016}} The lack of space led to the basement also being used for some sets.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Set design had to make the show more visually interesting, and fake dressing rooms were used in the film.{{cn|date=December 2016}} The movie's production designer noted that Keillor's actual dressing room is "about the size of a very, very small bathroom."{{cite quote|date=December 2016}} 

[[Mickey's Diner]], a downtown St. Paul landmark, is also featured in the film.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

On November 1, 2005, the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported that an early screening in [[New York City]] for film distributors resulted in a heavy bidding war.{{full|date=December 2016}} [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse]] bought the rights, and company president Bob Berney, "aiming to capitalize on the name recognition of the 31-year-old radio program, recommended that the title revert to ''A Prairie Home Companion''. 'At the screening, Garrison said that to broaden the film's appeal, they were thinking about changing the name to ''[[Savage Love]]'', so we may have an argument there,' Berney said."{{cite quote|date=December 2016}}

==Reception==

===Critics===
''A Prairie Home Companion'' opened the 2006 [[South by Southwest]] film festival on March 10, then premiered in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], on May 3, 2006, at the [[Fitzgerald Theater]], which had projection and sound equipment brought in for that purpose. The film's stars arrived in ten horse-drawn carriages. [[Brian Williams]] of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' anchored his newscast from neighboring [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], that night so that he would be able to attend.

Critics' general reaction to the film was favorable, and it garnered an 82% fresh rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, "What a lovely film this is, so gentle and whimsical, so simple and profound",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060608/REVIEWS/60606001|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=A Prairie Home Companion | date=June 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later added the film to his "Great Movies" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081112/REVIEWS08/811129987/1004|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=A Prairie Home Companion (2006) | date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Medved]] (himself a radio host) gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, "The entertainment value stands somewhere between thin and nonexistent" and "[it may be] the worst movie ever made that pooled the talents of four (count ‘em – four!) Oscar winners".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelmedved.com/pg/jsp/eot/home.jsp Michael Medved's Movie Minute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311114306/http://www.michaelmedved.com/pg/jsp/eot/home.jsp |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desson Thomson]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' fell in between, saying in a review headlined "Honey, You Could Ask for More" (a reference to the theme song of the radio show and film) that while the movie had its strengths, it was weaker than it should have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060801841.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Desson|last=Thomson|title=Honey, You Could Ask for More|date=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===

=== Box office ===

'''''A Woman Drinking with Two Men''''' is a 1658 painting by [[Pieter de Hooch]], an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[National Gallery, London]].

This painting by Hooch was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; &lt;!---- What follows is a quote. Do not edit the text in the quote. Sourced statements proving or disproving Hofstede de Groot should be added after the quote. ----&gt; "183. GIRL WITH TWO CAVALIERS (or, Interior of a Dutch House). [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm.]] 49. ; de G. 37.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/569/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between John Smith's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in [[Oud Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt;  At a table by a broad double window, to the left of a room with wooden rafters and a pavement or black and white tiles, sit two gentlemen. One, at the farther side of the table, faces the spectator ; he wears a hat, and with smiling face holds a pipe in each hand in the attitude of a fiddler. The other, seated before the table in profile to the left, holds his plumed hat on his knee, with his right hand above it. He looks at a girl, with her back to the spectator, who stands close to the window. She holds up a glass of wine in her right hand, as if she were about to give it to the cavalier with the pipes. A servant-girl comes from the right with a pan of burning peat. Behind her is a chimney-piece with two pilasters, above which hangs a large figure-piece. Between the chimney-piece and the window to the left is a map. Signed " P. D. H. " ; canvas, 29 inches by 25 inches.

'''Aristotle's views on women''' influenced later [[Western philosophy|Western thinkers]], as well as [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic thinkers]], who quoted him as an authority until the end of the [[Middle Ages]], influencing [[women's history]].

In his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], [[Aristotle]] saw women as subject to men, but as higher than slaves, and lacking authority; he believed the husband should exert political rule over the wife. Among women's differences from men were that they were, in his view, more impulsive, more compassionate, more complaining, and more deceptive. He gave the same weight to women's happiness as to men's, and in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' stated that society could not be happy unless women were happy too. Whereas [[Plato]] stated that women, while inferior, should be educated, Aristotle appears to have disagreed.

In his [[Aristotle's biology#Inheritance|theory of inheritance]], Aristotle considered the mother to provide a passive material element to the child, while the father provided an active, ensouling element with the form of the human species.

==Differences between males and females==

Aristotle believed women were inferior to men. For example, in his work [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] (1254b13–14), Aristotle states "as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plato and Aristotle on the Nature of Women|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236725862|journal = Journal of the History of Philosophy|pages = 467–478|volume = 21|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/hph.1983.0090|first = Nicholas D.|last = Smith|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Politics'' 1.12 he wrote, "The slave is wholly lacking the [[Deliberation|deliberative]] element; the female has it but it lacks authority; the child has it but it is incomplete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/#SH7e |title=Aristotle: Politics [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; 1260a11 |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Freeland wrote: "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2016|title = Feminist History of Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-femhist/|date = 2016-01-01|first = Charlotte|last = Witt|first2 = Lisa|last2 = Shapiro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are "more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate ... more easily moved to tears ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action" than men.&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Animals]]'', 608b1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He wrote that only fair-skinned women, not darker-skinned women, had a sexual discharge and climaxed. He also believed this discharge could be increased by eating of pungent foods. Aristotle thought a woman's sexual discharge was akin to that of an infertile or amputated male's.&lt;ref name=728a&gt;''[[Generation of Animals]]'', I, 728a.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that both sexes contributed to the material of generation, but that the female's contribution was in her discharge (as in a male's) rather than within the ovary.&lt;ref name=728a/&gt;

Aristotle explains how and why the association between man and woman takes on a hierarchical character by commenting on male rule over 'barbarians', or non-Greeks. "By nature the female has been distinguished from the slave. For nature makes nothing in the manner that the coppersmiths make the Delphic knife – that is, frugally – but, rather, it makes each thing for one purpose. For each thing would do its work most nobly if it had one task rather than many. Among the barbarians the female and the slave have the same status. This is because there are no natural rulers among them but, rather, the association among them is between male and female slave. On account of this, the poets say that 'it is fitting that Greeks rule barbarians', as the barbarian and the slave are by nature the same."&lt;ref name=Stauffer/&gt; While Aristotle reduced women's roles in society, and promoted the idea that women should receive less food and nourishment than males, he also criticised the results: a woman, he thought, was then more [[compassionate]], more opinionated, more apt to scold and to strike. He stated that women are more prone to despondency, more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, and of having a better memory.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Animals'', book IX, part 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's role in inheritance==
{{further|Aristotle's biology|Telegony (pregnancy)}}
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|300px|Inheritance: model of transmission of movements from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|form]] from the father. The model is not fully symmetric.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}]]

Aristotle's inheritance model sought to explain how the parents' characteristics are transmitted to the child, subject to influence from the environment.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} In his view, an active, ensouling masculine element brought life to a passive female element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfoundations.com/WOMAN/Aristotle.html Aristotle on woman]&lt;/ref&gt; The system worked as follows. The father's semen and the mother's menses encode their parental characteristics.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=50}} The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define [[Aristotle#Aristotle's epistemology|the form or ''eidos'']] of the human species, while the movements of both the father's and the mother's fluids define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} The theory has some symmetry, as semen movements carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is hot enough to overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if it is too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus [[particulate inheritance|particulate]] (definitely one trait or another), as in [[Mendelian genetics]], unlike the [[Hippocratic]] model which was continuous and [[blending inheritance|blending]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} The child's sex can be influenced by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}

==Morality and politics==
According to Aristotle, there should be "political rule" of the husband over the wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' I, 1259a–b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zamfir&gt;Korinna Zamfir, ''Men and Women in the Household of God: A Contextual Approach to Roles and Ministries in the Pastoral Epistle'', Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2013, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As for the differences between husband and wife, Aristotle says that these "always" consisted in external appearances, in speeches, and in honors.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 1259b.&lt;/ref&gt; The household functions of a man and of a woman are different because his business is "to get" and hers "to keep".&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' 1277b.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===On good wives===
[[Image:Aristotelous Oikonomikos.png|thumb|upright|Book cover of an edition of [[Economics (Aristotle)|''Economics'']] from 1830.]]
In his [[Economics (Aristotle)|''Economics'']], Aristotle wrote that it befits not a man of sound mind to bestow his person promiscuously, or have random intercourse with women; for otherwise the base-born will share in the rights of his lawful children, and his wife will be robbed of her honor due, and shame be attached to his sons. It is fitting that he should approach his wife in honor, full of self-restraint and awe, and in his conversation with her, should use only the words of a right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are themselves lawful and honorable. Aristotle's thought that a wife was best honored when she saw that her husband was faithful to her, and that he had no preference for another woman, but before all others loves, trusts her and holds her as his own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics and Economics of Aristotle'', Edward English Walford and John Gillies, trans. (London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1908), pp. 298ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle wrote that a husband should secure the agreement, loyalty, and devotion of his wife, so that whether he himself is present or not, there may be no difference in her attitude towards him, since she realizes that they are alike guardians of the common interests, and so when he is away she may feel that to her no man is kinder or more virtuous or more truly hers than her own husband.

===Spartan women===
{{Main article|Women in ancient Sparta}}
Aristotle wrote that in [[Sparta]], the legislator wanted to make the whole city (or country) hardy and temperate, and that he carried out his intention in the case of the men, but he overlooked the women, who lived in every sort of intemperance and wealth. He added that in those regimes in which the condition of the women was bad, half the city could be regarded as having no laws.&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics of Aristotle'', Book 2, Ch. 9, trans. Benjamin Jowett, London: Colonial Press, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal weight to female and male happiness===

Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his ''Rhetoric'' that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too. In an article titled "Aristotle's Account of the Subjection of Women", Stauffer explains that Aristotle believed that in nature a common good came of the rule of a superior being. But he does not indicate a common good for men being superior to women. He uses the word κρείττων ''kreitton'' to indicate superiority, meaning stronger. Aristotle believed that rational reasoning is what made you superior over lesser beings in nature, yet still used the term meaning stronger, not more rational or intelligent.&lt;ref name=Stauffer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauffer |first=Dana |title=Aristotle's Account of the Subjection of Women |journal=The Journal of Politics |date=Oct 2008 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=929–941 |jstor=30219476 |doi=10.1017/s0022381608080973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

On children, he said, "And what could be more divine than this, or more desired by a man of sound mind, than to beget by a noble and honored wife children who shall be the most loyal supporters and discreet guardians of their parents in old age, and the preservers of the whole house? Rightly reared by father and mother, children will grow up virtuous, as those who have treated them piously and righteously deserve that they should..."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Aristotle's Politics: Writings from the Complete Works: Politics, Economics, Constitution of Athens'', Princeton University Press, 2016, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed we all have a biological drive to procreate, to leave behind something to take the place and be similar to ourselves. This then justifies the natural partnership between man and woman. And each person has one specific purpose because we are better at mastering one specific trait rather than being adequate at multiple. For Aristotle, women's purpose is to give birth to children. Aristotle stressed that man and woman work together to raise the children and that how they raise them has a huge influence over the kind of people they become and thus the kind of society or community that everyone lives in.

==Comparison with Plato's views on women&lt;!--'Plato's views on women' redirects here--&gt;==

Aristotle appears to disagree with [[Plato]] on the topic whether women ought to be educated, as Plato says that they must be. Both of them, however, consider women to be inferior. Plato in ''Timaeus'' (90e) claims that men who were cowards and were lazy throughout their life shall be reborn as women and in the ''Laws'' (781b), he offers his reasons why women should be educated: "Because you neglected this sex, you gradually lost control of a great many things which would be in a far better state today if they had been regulated by law. A woman's natural potential for virtue is inferior to a man's, so she's proportionately a greater danger, perhaps even twice as great." Plato further establishes his opinion on the inferiority of women's "natural potential" by claiming in ''Republic'' (455d) that "Women share by nature in every way of life just as men do, but in all of them women are weaker than men."

Plato firmly believed in reincarnation and this was very important for the distinction he made between the nature of men and women. This was not the case for Aristotle, who saw the differences as biological. Plato discusses this matter with more detail in ''Timaeus'', where he states that men have a superior soul than women (42a): "Humans have a twofold nature, the superior kind should be such as would from then on be called "man". He added, once again, that men who led bad lives shall be reborn as women (42b): "And if a person lived a good life throughout the due course of his time, he would at the end return to his dwelling place in his companion star, to live a life of happiness that agreed with his character. But if he failed in this, he would be born a second time, now as a woman."

Plato also appears to use the term "womanish" or "female-like" as an derogatory term implying inferiority and emotional instability, as this is clear from ''Republic'' 469d and 605e, amongst others.

==Legacy==
===Galen===
Aristotle's assumptions on female coldness influenced [[Galen]] and others for almost two thousand years until the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Tuana, Nancy|title=The Less Noble Sex: Scientific, Religious and Philosophical Conceptions of Women's Nature|year=1993|pages=21, 169|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-36098-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church Fathers===
Joyce E. Salisbury argues that the [[Women in the patristic age|Church Fathers]], influenced by Aristotle's opinions, opposed the practice of independent female [[Asceticism|ascetism]] because it threatened to emancipate women from men.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce E. Salisbury, ''Church Fathers, Independent Virgins'', Verso, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Otto Weininger===
In his ''[[Sex and Character]]'', written in 1903, [[Otto Weininger]] explained that all people are composed of a mixture of the male and the female substance, and that these views are supported scientifically. Weininger cited Aristotle's views in the chapter "Male and Female Psychology" of his book.

== Career ==
Graduated in applied graphic arts from Képző- és Iparművészeti Szakközépiskola (Fine and Applied Arts School) in 1972. Against his parents’ and teachers’ wishes, he did not continue his education as he did not want to move away from everyday life. He also believed that self-education was worth more than institutional education. He spent the following years doing various, mostly physical jobs such as baker, stone sculptor, decorator, plumber etc. He continued his art activities in his free time beginning to turn towards films.

Attila Meszlényi took part in a study called ‘A magyar film formanyelve és közleménye’ about film semiotics in cooperation with [[:hu:Beke László|László Beke]], [[:hu:Horányi Özséb|Özséb Horányi]], [[:hu:Lányi András (író)|András Lányi]] and Róbert Vadas led by Péter Józsa. Spotted by Foky Ottó, he started directing animated films in [[Pannonia Film Studio|Pannónia Filmstúdió]] from 1977 to ’79, mostly parts of the popular cartoon series ‘Frakk, a macskák réme’,.&lt;ref name="Frakk, a macskák réme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frakk, a macskák réme|url=https://widgets.imdb.com/title/tt0167595/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frakk(TV Series)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frakk (TV Series)|url=http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film824919.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the series ended, he started working as a freelance graphic designer. Made covers and illustrations for no less than two hundred books, drew many slide films, occasionally took commercial graphic design work orders as well. Since 1980, he is member of [[:hu:Magyar Alkotóművészeti Közalapítvány|Művészeti Alap]] (Artist Fund) and its successor organisation [[:hu:Magyar Alkotóművészek Országos Egyesülete|Magyar Alkotóművészek Országos Egyesülete]] (National Association of Hungarian Artists).

In 1983, he founded an [[early music]] ensemble, Musica Profana, in which he played the [[Baroque flute]] and [[Musette de cour|musette]] till 1993.

Due to the instigation of Muray Róbert and Dr. Zoltán Attila, from 1987, he started painting wild birds and mammals of Europe and occasionally other continents, mixing naturalist depiction with various stylistic elements.

In 1990, he founded (and has been leading ever since) the TARON TÁRSASÁG (called Gondolkodókör after 2001).
Between 1998 and 2006, he was a regular participant of national exhibitions, fine art biennales. He keeps painting animals, animal and plant remains using watercolour or oil. Since 1999, he has been member of the Magyar Vízfestők Társasága (Association of the Hungarian Watercolour Painters).&lt;ref name="Association of the Hungarian Watercolour Painters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of the Hungarian Watercolour Painters|url=https://www.facebook.com/MagyarVizfestokTarsasaga/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded the Unikornis fine art group with Péchy Tamás in 2001. Its members: Csíkszentmihályi Róbert sculptor, Nagy Judit gobelin artist, Nemes István painter and graphic artist, Szemadám György fine artist, Péchy Tamás environmentalist and Sárosdy Judit art historian.
In recent years, he has mainly been painting and publishing his art-, ecology-themed books, writings.

[[File:BachMedia-Logo Bg Color Blue.jpg|thumb|Bach Media Logotype]]

'''Bach Media''' is an audiovisual production company founded by the [[Cuba]]n filmmaker Jesús Hernández Bach in April, 2014. Based in [[New York City]], Bach Media specializes in the production, screening and distribution of Cuban films both in Cuba and in the [[United States]]. Bach Media also collaborates with producers from other countries who are interested in doing on-location filming in Cuba.

== History ==

While Bach Media has been in operation as a producer of Cuban audiovisual projects since April, 2014, the official start of its headquarters in New York City was April 2016. Under the direction of filmmaker Jesús Hernández Bach,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jes%C3%BAs-miguel-hern%C3%A1ndez-bach-41176343|title=Jesús Hernández Bach|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bach Media has offered support to producers from various countries with interest in filming in Cuba via its consultancy that offers them invaluable insights for filming on the island. Jesús Hernández Bach collaborated in Cuba with the Irish film director [[Paddy Breathnach]] during the preparation for his film ''Viva'' (2015),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4334482/|title=Viva|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with the German director [[Fatih Akin]] for his feature film ''El Padre'' (''The Cut'', 2014).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film596286.html|title=El padre|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Bach Media has provided support services to VICE productions &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://en.daily.vice.com/|title=Daily VICE|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Cuba and has also collaborated with Condé Nast. Bach Media founder Jesús Hernández Bach says, "We look for interesting projects. The human aspects behind each one of these (projects) is of utmost importance, so that ultimately the Cuba that is shown to the world isn't the stereotypical view." &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oncubamagazine.com/cultura/una-compania-cubana-de-cine-en-nueva-york/|title= Una compañía cubana de cine en Nueva York |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the fundamental objectives of Bach Media is to make the island's audiovisual output visible in the United States by means of festivals and screenings. In May, 2016, Bach Media presented the film ''Ella trabaja'' (''She Works'', Jesús Miguel Hernández, 2007) in the graduate Center of the City University of New York.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://lademajagua.cu/un-documental-cubano-en-nueva-york/|title= Un documental cubano en Nueva York |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he organized the presentation of the short films ''Afuera'' (''Outside'', Vanessa Portieles and Yanelvis González, 2012) &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film132447.html|title= Afuera |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Una noche (film)|Una noche]]'' (''One Night'', Lucy Mulloy, 2012)  at the Miami-based CCEMiami. In 2016, Bach Media co-sponsored the prestigious New York Havana Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hffny.com/2016/|title= Havana Film Festival |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bach Media supports works created in Cuba or by Cubans with marketing campaigns, outreach and public relations services. It was responsible for the marketing campaign for the film ''Tocando la luz'' (''Touching the Light'', 2015),&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4553130/|title= Tocando luz |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker Jennifer Redfearn at the [[Miami International Film Festival|Miami Film Festival]] (MIFF, 2016) &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miamifilmfestival.com/|title= Festival de Cine de Miami |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOCNY 2015,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docnyc.net/about-us/what-is-doc-nyc/|title= DOC NY |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the "five most captivating documentary film festivals in the world."

== Future plans ==

Jesús Hernández Bach has declared that he intends to turn Bach Media into an audiovisual multiplatform that connects Cuba with countries outside of the island, especially the United States. In this way, it is an organization that contributes to the normalization of relations between the two nations in a positive context.

'''Bart Cassiman''' (born 1961), freelance-curator, art critic and editor, is an art historian and studied press- and communication sciences at the [[Ghent University]] (1979-1984).

== Early career ==

He was the project-leader of the exhibition ''Initatief 86'' which took place in the St. Pieters Abbey and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Ghent in 1986. 
This was an exhibition on Belgian art for which [[Kasper König]], [[Jan Hoet]], [[Jean-Hubert Martin]] and Gosse Oosterhof made the selection. The exhibition included a.o. works by [[Chantal Akerman]], [[Guillaume Bijl]], Jacques Charlier, [[Luc Deleu]], [[Lili Dujourie]], [[Jef Geys]], René Heyvaert, [[Raoul De Keyser]], [[Marie-Jo Lafontaine]], [[Panamarenko]], Guy Rombouts, [[Walter Swennen]], Narcisse Tordoir, [[Jan Vercruysse]] and Didier Vermeiren,…&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://primo.getty.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=GRI&amp;search_scope=default_scope&amp;docId=GETTY_ALMA21167959280001551&amp;fn=permalink|title=Initiatief 1986|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|last2=Martin|first2=Jean-Hubert|last3=König|first3=Kasper|last4=Oosterhof|first4=Gosse|last5=Hoet|first5=Jan|date=|publisher=Imschoot|year=1986|isbn=|location=Gent, Belgium|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1986 until the end of 1988, Bart Cassiman was curator for Contemporary Art at the [[Palais des Beaux Arts|Palais des Beaux-Arts (BOZAR)]] in Brussels where he organized (in collaboration with the director Jan Debbaut) several exhibitions of contemporary art (Didier Vermeiren &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Didier Vermeiren|last=Debbaut|first=Jan|publisher=Vereniging voor Tentoonstellingen van het Paleis voor Schone Kunsten|year=1987|isbn=|location=Brussel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Narcisse Tordoir &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Narcisse Tordoir|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|publisher=Vereniging voor tentoonstellingen van het Paleis voor Schone Kunsten Brussel|year=1987|isbn=|location=Brussel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Art &amp; Language]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art &amp; Language: de schilderijen|last=Harrison|first=Charles|last2=Roberts|first2=John|publisher=Vereniging voor Tentoonstellingen van het Paleis voor Schone Kunsten|year=1987|isbn=|location=Brussel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jan Vercruysse]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jan Vercruysse|last=Brouwer|first=Marianne|publisher=Vereniging voor tentoonstellingen van het Paleis voor Schone Kunsten|year=1988|isbn=|location=Brussel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;,…) 

== Curatorial practice ==
As a free-lance curator he organized several exhibitions between 1989 and 1991. Amongst others: 

* ''Rombouts and Tordoir'', Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/guy-rombouts-narcisse-tordoir/oclc/21078454|title=Guy Rombouts, Narcisse Tordoir|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|publisher=Douglas Hyde Gallery|year=1989|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The solo-exhibitions of ''Lili Dujourie'', Kunstverein, Bonn, 1989; Le Magasin, Grenoble, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23212241|title=Lili Dujourie.|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|date=|publisher=Centre national d'art contemporain|year=1989|isbn=2906732214|location=Grenoble|pages=|oclc=23212241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Espacio Mental'' with [[René Daniëls]], [[Thierry De Cordier]], [[Isa Genzken]], [[Cristina Iglesias]], [[Thomas Schütte]] and [[Jan Vercruysse]] at Valencia, [[Institut Valencià d'Art Modern|IVAM]]-El Carme in 1991 was his first major group show. The exhibition contained about 80 artworks, was complex and layered so that the different interrelations between the artworks became almost endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47715801|title=Espacio mental|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|date=|publisher=Generalitat Valenciana|others=|year=1991|isbn=8478904808|location=Valencia|pages=|oclc=47715801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bart Cassiman was the project-leader of the section Contemporary Visual Art of Antwerp 93, [[European Capital of Culture]]. For this temporary organization he realized three major projects which differed in terms of intent and content. 

For the [[Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum|Middelheim Museum]] he invited ten artists ([[Per Kirkeby]], [[Richard Deacon (sculptor)|Richard Deacon]], [[Panamarenko]], [[Thomas Schütte]], [[Juan Muñoz]], [[Matt Mullican]], Bernd Lohaus, Harald Klingelhöller, Didier Vermeiren, [[Isa Genzken]]) to make a work, which was bought by ''Antwerp 93'' for the permanent collection. They were placed on Middelheim Low, which became by doing so the section of contemporary art of the museum. A section invented by Cassiman and realized with the support of Bob Cools (The Mayor), Eric Antonis (the intendant of ''Antwerp 93'') and Hans Nieuwdorp (the director of the Art Historical Museums of the City of Antwerp). This project became known as ''New Sculptures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nieuwe beelden : Openluchtmuseum voor Beeldhouwkunst Middelheim|last=Pauwels|first=Hilde|publisher=Antwerpen|year=1993|isbn=9074759017|location=Antwerpen|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp|Royal Museum of Fine Arts]] hosted contemporary artists who gave form to entwining of remembrance and imagination in the creative process. This project (exhibition and book), ''The Sublime Void (on the memory of the imagination)'',  included the artists [[Jean-Marc Bustamante]], [[Jan Vercruysse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]], [[Juan Muñoz]], [[Niek Kemps]], John Murphy, Mitja Tušek, [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Luc Tuymans]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Cristina Iglesias]], Harald Klingelhöller, Didier Vermeiren, [[Thomas Schütte]], [[Ettore Spalletti]], [[Luciano Fabro]], [[Jeff Wall]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[René Daniëls|René Daniels]], [[Franz West]], Fortuyn/O’Brien, [[James Welling]], [[Lili Dujourie]] and [[Thierry De Cordier]].

For the third project, he invited after conscientiously research and several workshops three colleagues-curators ([[Iwona Blazwick]], Yves Aupetitallot and [[Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev|Carolyn-Christov Bakargiev]]) to make an exhibition with artists from different cultural backgrounds to produce a new work in the extended [[Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp|M HKA]]. The for a long time underestimated exhibition ''On taking a normal situation and translating it into overlapping and multiple readings of conditions past and present'' which included at that time a few well-known artists (such as Jimmy Durham, [[Mark Dion]], Eugenio Dittborn, [[Judith Barry]] and [[Renée Green]]) in combination with a lot of artists who were at the beginning of their public life and have since then co- determined the international discourse for years (Maria Eichhorn, [[Zarina Bhimji]], [[Ann Veronica Janssens]], [[Andrea Fraser]],…)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32009921|title=On taking a normal situation ...|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|date=|publisher=Antwerpen 1993 v.z.w. / Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst, Antwerpen.|others=|year=1993|isbn=907475905X|location=Antwerpen|pages=|oclc=32009921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
On the level of education, Bart Cassiman has been, besides for almost a decade (1989 – 1998) tutor at the [[Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten|Rijksakademie]], Amsterdam, a guest-lecturer at the [[De Appel|Appel Foundation]] in Amsterdam and [[Le Magasin]] in Grenoble (for the curator training which is organized by those institutes), at [[Sotheby's Institute of Art|Sotheby’s]] London (educational studies for future artworld-professionals) and at [[P.A.R.T.S.]], the institute for dance founded by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker of Rosas.

Since 1985 he participated at many lectures, symposiums and workshops on the subject of contemporary art, organised by different museums, art institutions and galleries. Amongst others in Geneva he participated at the symposium ''{{lang|fr|La possibilité de l’art. Où commence, où finit l’art dans le monde de l’art contemporain}}'' (25-26 February 1989, [[Centre d’Art Contemporain Genève|Centre d’art contemporain]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dokumen.tips/documents/activities-83-09.html|title=DESTE Foundation For Contemporary Art activities 1983 – 2009|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Stuttgart at ''A new spirit in curating'' (25-26 January 1992, Künstlerhaus) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kuenstlerhaus.de/events/a-new-spirit-in-curating-internationale-konferenz-zur-aktuellen-kunst-und-ihrer-vermittlung/|title=A new spirit in curating|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was a member of the studygroup which prepared the symposium ''Writing about art'' (1991, [[Van Abbemuseum|Van Abbe Museum]], Eindhoven) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mediabank.vanabbemuseum.nl/vam/files/alexandria/publiciteit/tentoonstellingen/Tentoonstellingen_VAM_Jan_Debbaut.pdf|title=Tentoonstellingen Van Abbemuseum Jan Debbaut 1988-2003|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the occasion of the publication ''Art, gallery, exhibition. The gallery as a vehicle for art'', edited by gallery Andriesse and [[De Balie]], Amsterdam, he took part in the symposiums organized in Amsterdam (7 September 1996), Rotterdam (8 September 1996) and Antwerp (8 October 1996) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1996/09/13/art-gallery-exhibiting-7323897-a595177|title=Art Gallery Exhibiting|last=Pieters|first=Din|date=13 September 1996|work=NRC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In Brussels (25-26 October 1996) he participated at the colloquium ''Art et commande publics'', organized by ''Encore Bruxelles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docplayer.fr/amp/35636646-Gerard-monnier-publications-references-creteil-sceren-cndp-crdp-creteil-2005-240-p.html|title=Gérard Monnier : publications. références|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Absent Museum ==
From 1989 until 2000 he was responsible for the BACOB bank collection of contemporary art. The collection contained at the end about 180 works of around 40 different international artists, a.o. [[Stan Douglas]], [[Franz West]], Herbert Brandl, [[Lili Dujourie]], [[Cristina Iglesias]], [[Thomas Schütte]], Harald Klingelhöller, [[Allan McCollum]], Narcisse Tordoir, Helmut Dorner, [[Luc Tuymans]], [[Jan Fabre]], Bazilebustamante, [[Jean-Marc Bustamante]], [[Thierry De Cordier]], [[James Welling]], [[Juan Muñoz]], [[Jan Vercruysse]], Mitja Tušek, Gert Verhoeven, Stephen Wilks, Dianne Hagen, [[Jan Van Imschoot]], Robert Suermondt, Carla Klein, [[Niek Kemps]], [[Alicia Framis]], [[Isa Genzken]], Ebru Özseçen, [[Gregor Schneider]], Valerie Mannaerts, [[Bjarne Melgaard]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Carlos Amorales]], [[Mirosław Bałka|Miroslav Balka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bacob &amp; Art|last=Michel|first=Mast|publisher=Bacob&amp;Art|year=1996|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a severe illness Bart Cassiman was forced to stop all his professional activities at the end of the nineties. Without any doubt one can say that he was one of the most active and energized persons of the artworld between the mid-eighties and the end of the nineties. With colleagues such as Saskia Bos, Ulrich Loock, Julian Heynen, Dennis Zacharopoulos and a few others he was responsible  for the visualization of a generation by making exhibitions and writing texts and convincing many museums and collectors to buy their works. 

The bank for which he collected more than a decade bought as a result of his engagement and advise the well-known Vanderborght building in the heart of Brussels, at the end of the nineties. Everything was prepared to open the first private (corporate) museum on this scale in Western Europe. The opening was planned for the spring of 2002. But because the engine of this whole operation fell silent the project died a quiet dead. Big parts of the collection were sold and so stays the capital of Europe deprived of an urgently needed Museum of Contemporary Art…

The '''Bikaner style of painting''' is a [[Art of Rajasthan|Rajasthani]] style of [[Indian painting]] developed in the city of [[Bikaner]]. It emerged in medieval India and was founded by Prince [[Rao Bika]] in 1488.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bikanerminiaturearts.com/art.asp|title = Miniature Art - A snapshot|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The subjects painted often originate from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]]. Elephant trunks are frequently featured. Jain, Buddhist, Mughal, Rajput, and Deccan miniatures have been found using the Bikaner style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Raja [[Rai Singh]] was particularly influenced by Mughal art. Some notable examples of this school of art were painted during reigns of [[Rai Singh]], [[Karan Singh]] and [[Rao Anup Singh|Anup Singh]]. They painted scenes from the [[Ragmala]], [[Bhagavata Purana]], and [[Rasa lila]].

What distinguishes the Bikaner style of painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rajuswami.com/about/|title=About Bikaner Miniature Painting Style Rajasthani Miniature Style|website=Raju Swami|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; from other Rajasthani styles of painting are finer lines and a more reserved range of colors than what are typically present in Mughal artwork. [[Shahjahan]] employed patrons of this school of art such as [[Karan Singh]]. [[Ali Raza (painter)|Ali Raza]] painted paintings of [[Lakshmi Narayana]] and a portrait of Karan Singh. Another famous painter was [[Rukn ud din Firuz|Rukh-ud-din]] who used [[Deccan]] art elements. Rukh-ud-din used the technique of painting fountains and court scenes using a nature-based background. Later Bikaneri art focused on [[Bikaner]]’s architecture such as [[havelis]] in the city. [[Bikaner]]i artists displayed their work outside royal courts giving businessmen and landlords the chance to appreciate this style of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://mahaveerswami.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/history-of-bikaner-style-of-painting-and-its-contemporary-contexts/|title = History of Bikaner Style of Painting and its Contemporary Contexts|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Swami|first = Mahaveer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Serbian culture}}
The '''Cinema of Serbia''' comprises the art of [[film]] and creative movies made within the nation of [[Serbia]] or by Serbian filmmakers abroad.

[[Serbia]] (both as an independent country and as of [[former Yugoslavia]]) has been home to many internationally acclaimed films and directors, and is considered to be the most successful Balkan nation in term of filming. Most of the prominent films from the Balkans are mainly from Serbia, and have acquired a great level of commercial successes.

==Serbian theatre and cinema==
Serbia has a well-established theatrical tradition with many theatres. The [[Serbian National Theatre]] was established in 1861 with its building dating from 1868. The company started performing opera from the end of the 19th century and the permanent opera was established in 1947. It established a ballet company.

[[Bitef]], Belgrade International Theatre Festival, is one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world. New Theatre Tendencies is the constant subtitle of the Festival. Founded in 1967, Bitef has continually followed and supported the latest theater trends. It has become one of five most important and biggest European festivals. It has become one of the most significant culture institutions of Serbia.

Serbian cinema dates back to 1896. with the release of the oldest movie in the Balkans, ''[[The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Vožd Karađorđe]]'', a biography about Serbian revolutionary leader, [[Karađorđe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/magazine/sr/story/411/Film/998168/Restauriran+najstariji+srpski+igrani+film.html |title=Restauriran najstariji srpski igrani film |language=sr |publisher=Rts.rs |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netsrbija.net/srpska-kultura-film-i-kinematografija.html |title=Razvoj filma i kinematografije u Srbiji |publisher=Netsrbija.net |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinema was established reasonably early in Serbia with 12 films being produced before the start of [[World War II]]. The most notable of the prewar films was Mihailo Popovic's The Battle of Kosovo in 1939.

Cinema prospered after World War II. The most notable postwar director was [[Dušan Makavejev]] who was internationally recognised for ''[[Love Affair: Or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator]]'' in 1969 focusing on Yugoslav politics. Makavejev's ''Montenegro'' was made in Sweden in 1981. [[Zoran Radmilovic|Zoran Radmilović]] was one of the most notable actors of the postwar period.

Serbian cinema continued to make progress in the 1990s and today despite the turmoil of the 1990s. [[Emir Kusturica]] won two Golden Palms for Best Feature Film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], for ''[[When Father Was Away on Business]]'' in 1985 and then again for ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' in 1995. In 1998, Kusturica won a Silver Lion for directing ''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]''.

As at 2001, there were 167 cinemas in Serbia (excluding [[Kosovo]]) and over 4 million Serbs went to the cinema in that year. In 2005, ''[[San zimske noći]]'' (A Midwinter Night's Dream ) directed by [[Goran Paskaljevic|Goran Paskaljević]] caused controversy over its criticism of Serbia's role in the [[Yugoslav wars]] in the 1990s.

Several Serbian-American filmmakers have established a loose, intellectual multi-mediamaking tradition, working within prominent academic institutions and also creating works marked by high stylistic experimentation.  Three figures here would include [[Slavko Vorkapic]], creator of famed montage sequences for Hollywood films and Dean of the USC Film School; Vlada Petric, television and film director, archivist, and founding curator of the [[Harvard Film Archive]]; and [[Vladan Nikolic]], creator of the [[Zenith (film)|Zenith film]] and transmedia project as well as Professor at the New School for Social Media in New York City.

"'''Cog'''" is a British [[television advertisement|television and cinema advertisement]] launched by [[Honda]] in 2003 to promote the [[Honda Accord (Japan and Europe seventh generation)|seventh-generation]] [[Honda Accord|Accord]] line of cars. It follows the convention of a [[Rube Goldberg machine]], utilizing a chain of colliding parts taken from a disassembled Accord. [[Wieden+Kennedy]] developed a  GB£6&amp;nbsp;million marketing campaign around "Cog" and its partner pieces, "Sense" and "Everyday", broadcast later in the year. The piece itself was produced on a budget of £1&amp;nbsp;million by [[Partizan Midi-Minuit]]. Antoine Bardou-Jacquet directed the seven-month [[Filmmaking|production]], contracting [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]] to handle [[post-production]]. The 120-second final cut of "Cog" was broadcast on British television on 6 April 2003, during a commercial break in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[2003 Brazilian Grand Prix]].

The campaign was very successful both critically and financially. Honda's [[.uk|UK domain]] saw more [[web traffic]] in the 24&amp;nbsp;hours after "Cog"'s television début than all but one UK automotive brand received during that entire month. The branded content attached to "Cog" through [[interactive television]] was accessed by over 250,000 people, and 10,000 people followed up with a request for a [[brochure]] for the Honda Accord or a [[DVD]] copy of the advertisement. The media reaction to the advertisement was equally effusive; ''[[The Independent]]'''s [[Peter York (author)|Peter York]] described it as creating "the water-cooler ad conversation of the year",&lt;ref name="York"&gt;[[Peter York (author)|York, Peter]]; "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/clickstart-hondas-chain-reaction-is-poetry-in-motion-594254.html Click-Start: Honda's Chain Reaction is Poetry in Motion]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 13 April 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Quentin Letts]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' believed it was "certain to become an advertising legend".&lt;ref name="Qletts"/&gt;

The high cost of 120-second slots in televised commercial breaks meant that the full version of "Cog" was broadcast only a handful of times, and only in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden. Despite its limited run, it is regarded as one of the most groundbreaking&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;"[http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/181026/Honda-cog-ad-centre-rip-off-debate-1987-film/ Honda 'cog' ad at centre of rip-off debate over 1987 film], ''[[Marketing (magazine)|Marketing]]'', 27 May 2003.

Its success was blighted, however, by persistent accusations of plagiarism by [[Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss|Peter Fischli and David Weiss]], the creators of ''[[The Way Things Go]]'' (1987).

==Sequence==
"Cog" opens with a [[close-up]] on a [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] rolling down a board into a [[Manual transmission#Synchronized transmission|synchro hub]]. The hub in turn rolls into a gear wheel cog, which falls off the board and into a [[camshaft]] and [[pulley|pulley wheel]]. The camera [[tracking shot|tracks]] slowly from left to right, following the domino chain of reactions across an otherwise empty gallery space. The complexity of the interactions increases as the commercial progresses, growing from simple collisions to [[zipline]]s made from a bonnet release cable, scales and see-saws constructed from multiple carefully balanced parts, and a swinging [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] of suspended glass windows. Later sequences begin to make use of the Accord's electronic systems; the automated water sensors attached to the windscreen are used to make wiper blades start crawling across the floor, and a side door with a door-mirror indicator lowers the automated window to let a part pass through.

The majority of "Cog" takes place in complete silence, the only sounds coming from the collisions of the pieces themselves. This is broken with the activation of the CD player from the Accord, which begins playing [[The Sugarhill Gang]]'s 1979 single "[[Rapper's Delight]]". The sequence ends when the button of an electronic [[Key (lock)#Car key|key fob]] is pressed, closing the [[hatchback]] of a fully  assembled Honda Accord on a carefully balanced trailer. The car rolls off the trailer, and stops in front of a [[tonneau|tonneau cover]] bearing the "Accord" marque, while narrator [[Garrison Keillor]] asks "Isn't it nice when things just work?". The screen fades to white and the piece closes on the Honda logo and the brand's motto, "The Power of Dreams".

===Background===
[[File:Honda Accord front 20080521.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A blue saloon car parked in a bay in an empty car park. The licence plate is blank.|"Cog" was released to promote the seventh-generation [[Honda Accord]].]]
Sales of Honda products within Europe had been in decline since 1998, and the company's position as the number two [[Japan]]ese [[automotive industry|automotive company]], behind [[Toyota]], had been taken by [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]]. European consumers perceived the brand as staid, uninspiring, and the cars to be of lesser quality than those produced by European manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Enc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Jeff; "Mechanical Marvel", ''[[The Oregonian]]'', 29 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In one survey, one quarter of respondents "wouldn't dream of buying a Honda as their next car".&lt;ref&gt;"Which brand has the best advertising? Honda", ''Creative Review'', 22 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this climate in 2001 that [[Wieden+Kennedy]] proposed to Honda a new advertising strategy based on the company's Japanese motto, "Yume No Chikara" ("Power of Dreams"). The stated goal of the campaign was to increase Honda's share of the UK market to five percent within three years and to change the public image of the brand from "dull but functional" to "warm and consumer-friendly", all on a lower marketing budget than their predecessors had demanded.&lt;ref name="Dob"&gt;Dobele, Angela; Toleman, David; Beverland, Michael; "Controlled infection! Spreading the brand message through viral marketing", ''[[Business Horizons]]'', Vol. 48, No. 2, March 2005, pp. 143–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first series of promotions in the United Kingdom adopted the [[advertising slogan|strapline]] "What if...?", and explored various "dream-like" scenarios. The first television campaign explicitly introduced the premise of the campaign by asking what would happen if the world's favourite word ([[Okay]]) was replaced with "What if?". The next few pieces of the campaign, "Pecking Order", "Seats", and "Bus Lane" for television and "Doodle", "Big Grin", and "Oblonger" for radio, became progressively more surreal, and featured oddities ranging from a traffic cone draped in leopard fur to trees growing traffic lights from their branches.&lt;ref name="Enc"/&gt; In 2002, Matt Gooden, a [[creative director]], and Ben Walker, a [[copywriting|copywriter]], proposed a new television and cinema advertisement to promote the [[Honda Accord (Japan and Europe seventh generation)|seventh-generation]] [[Honda Accord]] line that had recently been rolled out in Europe and Japan. The advertisement, based on a complex chain reaction of moving parts from the Accord itself,&lt;ref name="MGBWint"&gt;Wynne, Christopher; "Interview with Matt Gooden and Ben Walker", ''Advertising'', 28 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; was approved and given the working title "Cog".

===Pre-production===
Gooden and Walker had been working together since 1988. By 2002, their portfolio included a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]]-holding one-second advertisement produced for [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]], and a [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]-awareness booklet for the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust.&lt;ref name="Adweek"&gt;Parpis, Eleftheria; "[http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/4202298-1.html Ben Walker On The Spot]", ''[[Adweek]]'', 21 June 2004.

The Honda executives were intrigued, but demanded a cut using actual automotive parts before giving permission to go ahead with the full-scale project.&lt;ref name="Mae"&gt;Anderson, Mae; "[http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/how-sell-strange-idea-6566 How to Sell a Strange Idea]", ''[[Adweek]]'', 14 July 2003.

Retrieved 2 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Approval for the script took another month. Honda insisted that several specific  Accord features, such as a door with a wing-mirror indicator and a rain-sensitive windscreen, appear in the final cut. The company planned to highlight these features in sales brochures.&lt;ref name="mad"&gt;Lucas, Gavin; "Disassembly Line", ''Creative Review'', 1 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Bardou-Jacquet was hired to direct the piece.&lt;ref name="MGBWint"/&gt; Bardou-Jacquet was mostly known for directing several award-winning [[music video]]s, including Alex Gopher's "The Child", [[Playgroup (band)|Playgroup]]'s "Number One", and [[Air (French band)|Air]]'s "How Does It Make You Feel".&lt;ref name="Partizan"&gt;"[http://www.partizan.com/partizan/commercials/?antoine_bardou_jacquet/biography Profile: Antoine Bardou-Jacquet]", ''Partizan''.

===Filming===
Bardou-Jacquet wanted to compose the advertisement with as little [[computer-generated imagery]] as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience.&lt;ref name="hard"&gt;Hardstaff, Johnny; "The Impossibly Real: Green Belting the Imaginary", ''[[Animation: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]'', July 2007 vol. 2 no. 2 pp. 187–201.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, he set two months aside for the creation of hundreds&lt;ref name="Cognizant"&gt;Wakelin, Simon; "[http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20030601/spot.html Cognizant kinetics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217020120/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20030601/spot.html |date=17 February 2012 }}", ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'', 1 June 2003. Retrieved 2 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development.&lt;ref name="Guardmay"/&gt; For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as [[airbag]] explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned,&lt;ref name="MGBWint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cognizant"/&gt; and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.&lt;ref name="Cognizant"/&gt;

The final cut of "Cog" consists of two continuous sixty-second [[tracking shot|dolly shots]] taken from a [[technocrane]], stitched together  later in [[post-production]]. (The stitching appears during the moment when the muffler rolls across the floor.)&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/classic-ad-honda-cog/ Classic Ad: Honda ‘Cog’]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 31 December 2009. Retrieved 13 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section.&lt;ref name="Cognizant"/&gt; Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second.&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;Boyer, Trevor; "Practical Motion", ''Millimeter'', 1 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Between testing and filming, 606&amp;nbsp;[[take]]s were needed to capture the final cut.&lt;ref name="Qletts"/&gt; The team commandeered two of Honda's six hand-assembled Accords—one to roll off the trailer at the end of the advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts.&lt;ref name="Qletts"/&gt; While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two [[articulated vehicle|articulated]] [[truck|lorries]].&lt;ref name="Qletts"/&gt;

===Post-production===
"Cog" needed only limited post-production work, as the decision had been made early on to eschew computer-generated imagery wherever possible. To further reduce the work required, "Barnsley", a specialist in the [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment|Flame]] editing tool (real name, Andrew Wood),&lt;ref&gt;"The Mill Promotes Flame Artist Barnsley to Board", ''Broadcast'', 9 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]], spent a lot of time on set during filming, where he advised the film crew on whether particular sections could be accomplished more easily by re-filming or by manipulating the image afterwards. Even so, the constant movement of the components on-camera made it difficult to achieve a seamless transition between the two 60-second shots. Several sections also required minor video editing, such as re-centering the frame to stay closer to the action, removal of wires, highlighting a spray of water, and adjusting the pace for dramatic purposes.&lt;ref name="mad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mm"/&gt;

==Release and reception==

===Schedule===
"Cog" was first aired on [[Television in the United Kingdom|British television]] on Sunday 6 April 2003. It filled an entire commercial break in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[2003 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]].&lt;ref name="mad"/&gt; The release was widely remarked upon by the media, with articles appearing in both [[broadsheets]] such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',&lt;ref name=Qletts/&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name="York"/&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Cozens, Claire; ''[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/apr/15/features11.g2 Never work with cars]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 April 2003.

The full 120-second version of the advertisement aired only 10 times in all,&lt;ref name="Mae"/&gt; and only in the 10 days after the initial screening. The slots were chosen for maximum impact, mostly in high-profile sporting events such as the [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champion's League]] [[Association football|football]] match between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref name="Qletts"/&gt; The full version was then put aside in favour of a 60-second and five 30-second variations, which continued to air for a further six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, Michael; "Now that's a real motion picture", ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]'', 14 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These shortened versions made use of newly introduced [[interactive advertising|interactive options]] on the [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Digital]] [[television network]]. Viewers were encouraged to press a button on their remote control, bringing up a menu that allowed the viewer to see the full 120-second version of the advertisement. Other menu options included placing an order for a free documentary DVD and a brochure for the Honda Accord.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Jennifer; "[http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/176689/Honda-adds-interactive-element-epic-6m-Accord-ad/ Honda adds interactive element to epic £6m Accord ad]", ''Brand Republic'', 9 April 2003.

A significant number watched the looped 120-second version for up to ten minutes. Of those who opened the menu, 10,000 requested either a DVD or a brochure, and Honda used the data collected from the interactive option to arrange a number of [[test drive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/ConCaseStudy.330 Case Study: "Cog"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828112523/http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/ConCaseStudy.330 |date=28 August 2010 }}", ''[[Thinkbox]]''.

Expansion of the "Cog" campaign to a worldwide market was fraught with a number of logistical difficulties. The cost of airing a 120-second commercial proved prohibitive in most markets.&lt;ref name="Dob"/&gt; Combined with Honda's use of different advertising agencies in different regions and the relative autonomy of its various [[Strategic business unit|business unit]]s in marketing decisions,&lt;ref name="Enc"/&gt; meant that "Cog" screened in only a few selected markets: the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia,&lt;ref name="mm"/&gt; and in cinemas in only a handful of other countries. For most markets, including the United States, the only way for audiences to see the piece was via the Internet, or in one of a handful of unsolicited and unpaid broadcasts on news channel review programmes.&lt;ref name="Dob"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20120723002536/http://www.canneslions.com/lions/videos.cfm?media_id=85 The story of Honda "Cog".]", [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]] (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic to Honda websites quadrupled; in the first few weeks, "Cog" was downloaded by over a million people. By mid-May, the number was twice that.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Battelle|Battelle, John]]; "Downloading the future of TV advertising", ''[[Business 2.0]]'', July 2003, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that more people in the United States voluntarily chose to watch "Cog" than any other Honda commercial.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, Joseph; ''Life After the 30-Second Spot'', John Wiley &amp; Sons (1 July 2005), p. 193. {{ISBN|978-0-471-71837-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In financial terms, "Cog" was an unprecedented success for Honda. The £32,000 spent on placements on the [[BSkyB]] network alone achieved a greater response than a previous £1&amp;nbsp;million direct mailing campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Albaum, Gerald; Duerr, Edwin; ''International Marketing and Export Management'' (6th edition), Prentice Hall, 22 May 2008, p. 569. {{ISBN|978-0-273-71387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of Honda vehicles in the United Kingdom jumped by 28 percent, despite lower marketing and public relations spending by the company and an increase in prices relative to their competitors. Visits to Honda dealerships rose from an average of 3,500 to 3,700 per month, with 22 percent of these resulting in the purchase of a Honda, compared to 19 percent before the campaign.&lt;ref name="Dob"/&gt; In all, "Cog" has been credited with increasing Honda's revenue by nearly £400m.&lt;ref&gt;Earls, Mark; ''Herd: How to Change Mass Behaviour by Harnessing Our True Nature'', John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 24 August 2009, p. 274. {{ISBN|978-0-470-68548-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plagiarism accusations===
Shortly after Cog appeared on television, Wieden+Kennedy received a letter from [[Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss|Peter Fischli and David Weiss]], creators of the 1987 art film ''[[The Way Things Go|Der Lauf der Dinge]]''. The film was well known in the advertising industry, and its creators had been approached several times with offers for the right to use the concept, but had always declined. The letter pointed out several similarities between their work and "Cog", and warned the agency that they were considering legal action on the basis of the "commercialisation and simplification of the film's content and the false impression that [they] might have endorsed the use".&lt;ref name="Bent"&gt;Bently, Lionel; Davis, Jennifer; Ginsburg, Jane C.; ''Copyright and Piracy: An Interdisciplinary Critique'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 28 October 2010, p. 329. {{ISBN|978-0-521-19343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed by ''Creative Review'' magazine, the pair made clear that they wished they had been consulted on the advertisement, and that they would not have given permission if asked.&lt;ref name="indcopy"&gt;Beard, Matthew; "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/artists-claim-honda-copied-their-film-in-tv-cog-advert-539158.html Artists claim Honda copied their film in TV cog advert]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 28 May 2003.

Comparisons were made between the case and that of [[Mehdi Norowzian]], a British director who complained about [[Diageo]]'s, the drinks conglomerate, for allegedly plagiarising his work in their 1994 ''[[Anticipation (advert)|Anticipation]]'' campaign for [[Guinness]]-brand [[stout]].&lt;ref name="Mark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telemills"&gt;"Mills, Dominic; [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/2853721/Art-for-ads-sake-is-a-copyright-fight.html Art for ad's sake is a copyright fight]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 3 June 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was complicated by the fact that Wieden+Kennedy acknowledged that the film had served as an "inspiration" for "Cog", and had distributed copies of the work to its script-writers.&lt;ref name="hard"/&gt; Ultimately, Fischli and Weiss did not file a lawsuit against either Wieden+Kennedy or Honda UK.&lt;ref name="MGBWint"/&gt;

Despite the lingering shadow of these accusations, "Cog" drew an unprecedented amount of critical acclaim. It received more awards than any commercial in history;&lt;ref name="Partizan"/&gt; so many that it was both the most-awarded commercial of 2004 and the 33rd-most-awarded commercial of 2003.&lt;ref name="Gunn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, Donald; Wilkie, Emma; ''[[Gunn Report|The Gunn Report and Showreel of the Year]]'' (5th edition), (Holbrook: FlaxmanWilkie, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The jury for the British Television Advertising Awards gave the piece the highest score of any commercial ever recorded; the jury's chairman Charles Inge commented: "My own opinion is that this is the best commercial that I have seen for at least ten years."&lt;ref name="Chair"/&gt; After awarding "Cog" with several Silver awards, the president-elect of the D&amp;AD Awards, Dick Powell, said of the piece: "It delights and entrances, [...] it communicates engineering quality and quality of thinking, and leaves you with a smile."&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, Gordon; "[http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/212170/cog-denied-dad-gold-no-black-pencils-awarded/ Cog denied D&amp;AD gold as no black pencils are awarded]" ''Brand Republic'', 27 May 2004. Retrieved 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having swept the majority of award ceremonies within the advertising community to date, "Cog" was widely believed to be the favourite for the industry's top award, the Grand Prix at the [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cognizant"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fera, Rae Ann; "[http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20030601/predict.html ''Boards'' Cannes Predictions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217020146/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20030601/predict.html |date=17 February 2012 }}, ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'', 1 June 2003.

Retrieved 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "Cog" held a disadvantage in that the chairman of the Cannes voting jury, [[Dan Wieden]], was one of the founders of Wieden+Kennedy, the firm responsible for creating "Cog"; tradition holds that it is bad form for the chairman of the jury to vote for a piece by his or her own agency.&lt;ref name="jun20"/&gt;

The result at Cannes was a surprise; after the longest judging period in the festival's history,&lt;ref name="jun23"/&gt; the Grand Prix went to neither of the two event favourites. Instead, the jury awarded the prize to "[[Lamp (advertisement)|Lamp]]", a U.S. advertisement directed by [[Spike Jonze]] for the [[IKEA]] chain of furniture stores. Voted second was a British ad, "Ear Tennis" for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console]].&lt;ref name="jun23"/&gt; Chief among speculated reasons for the outcome was the plagiarism debate surrounding "Cog".&lt;ref name="BBCcopy"&gt;Brook, Stephen; "[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/sep/20/advertising.bbc BBC 'tribute' ad drives Honda forward]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 September 2004. Retrieved 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Walker told ''[[Adweek]]'' "A couple of people on the jury told me the reason it didn't win is 'cause they didn't want to be seen to be awarding something which people in some corners had said we copied."&lt;ref name="Adweek"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===In advertising===
The popularity and recognition received by "Cog" led a number of other companies to create pieces in a similar vein—either as homages, in parody, or simply to further explore the design space. The first of these was ''Just Works'', a deliberate parody advertisement for the [[118 118 (UK)|118 118]] [[directory assistance]] service in the summer of 2003, in which the Honda parts are replaced with such oddities as a tractor wheel, a flamingo and a space hopper, with impetus provided by two moustachioed runners.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/News/EmailThisArticle/183323/Watch-WCRSs-spoof-Hondas-cog-ad Watch WCRS's spoof of Honda's 'cog' ad]", ''Brand Republic'', 20 June 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2009. (via Mediaweek).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Just Works'' was created by advertising agency WCRS. It was written by Anson Harris and directed by JJ Keith,&lt;ref name="118campaign"&gt;Sweney, Mark; "[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/182740/ Honda blocks airing of WCRSs spoof Cog ad]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 13 June 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; whose previous work included spots for [[Telefónica Europe|BT Cellnet]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], and [[Guinness]], and the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated short film ''[[Holiday Romance]]''.&lt;ref name="10dir"&gt;Fera, Rae Ann; "[http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20041001/10more.html 10 more directors to watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819205142/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20041001/10more.html |date=19 August 2011 }}", ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'', 1 October 2004. Retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Honda refused to give WCRS permission to copy their advert, which, under [[Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre|BACC]] guidelines, prevented either the 60- or 90-second ''Just Works'' spots from appearing on British television.&lt;ref name="118campaign"/&gt; Instead, the ad was shown online and promoted [[Viral marketing|virally]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Jennifer; "[http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/185272/Number-hires-agency-redesign-118-118-site/ The Number hires agency to redesign 118 118 site]", ''Brand Republic'', 11 July 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Just Works'' went on to win a number of awards in its own right, including Golds in several categories at the British Television Advertising Awards and the Creative Circle Awards, a Silver Lion from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, and a Bronze award from [[The One Club]].&lt;ref name="10dir"/&gt;

In 2004, [[BBC Radio Manchester]] asked for and received permission from Wieden+Kennedy to produce a television advertisement in the style of "Cog" to advertise coverage of football events by local radio stations. The ad, which was directed by Reg Sanders and produced by Tracy Williams, shows pieces of sports equipment such as footballs and team shirts knocking into each other in sequence. In all, 65&amp;nbsp;versions were broadcast, each tailored to advertise the local BBC Radio station. Wieden+Kennedy were pleased to gain the extra publicity and Neil Christie, managing director of Wieden+Kennedy London, commented: "We are very happy that every time the BBC runs one of their adverts, the person who watches it thinks of Honda."&lt;ref name="BBCcopy"/&gt;

[[Campaign (magazine)|''Campaign'']] magazine listed "Cog", along with ''[[Sony marketing#Specific commercials|Balls]]'' for the [[BRAVIA|Sony BRAVIA]] line of [[high-definition television]]s, as one of the most-imitated commercials in recent times.&lt;ref name="cognballs"&gt;Bussey, Noel; "[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/784587/ Advertising: is it just a load of cog and balls?]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'' 15 February 2008. Retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the pieces believed to draw inspiration from "Cog" are a 2003 piece for [[breakfast cereal]] [[Sugar Puffs]],&lt;ref name="BBCcopy"/&gt; ''[[Nearness (advert)|Nearness]]'' for the [[Oslo School of Architecture and Design]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://berglondon.com/blog/2009/09/15/nearness/ Nearness]", ''BERG blog'', 15 September 2009. Retrieved 20 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a 30-second animated advertisement for [[Heinz Tomato Ketchup]], an advertisement for [[BBC Radio Merseyside]] football coverage, and the 2007 ''Tipping Point'', advertising Guinness stout.&lt;ref name="Sweney123"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, Gavin; "[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2007/november/tipping-point-the-most-expensive-guinness-ad-ever Tipping Point: The Most Expensive Guinness Ad Ever]", ''Creative Review'', 8 November 2007. Retrieved 9 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the similarities between "Cog" and "Tipping Point", Paul Brazier, executive creative director at the advertising agency behind ''Tipping Point'', replied: "I knew the ad was similar in places, but as an executive creative director, you have to look at things like that and make a decision. The fact the TV ad was only part of a huge internet campaign meant that I thought it wasn’t that near "Cog"."&lt;ref name="cognballs"/&gt;

===Outside advertising===
"Cog" has also inspired a number of other creative endeavours outside of the advertising industry, including an elaborate [[Dominoes|domino]]-toppling world record attempt by Robin Weijers,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/190567/DIARY-Dead-Dutchman-will-recreate-Hondas-cog-true-domino-effect/ 'Dead' Dutchman will recreate Honda's 'cog' for true domino effect]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 19 September 2003.

Retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of "Cog" as an example of the confluence of art and advertising, and as an example of inspiration versus plagiarism, has been ongoing.

Retrieved 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next piece created by Wieden+Kennedy for Honda, ''Sense'', advertised the company's "[[Integrated Motor Assist|Integrated Motor System]]" [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid car]] technology. Deliberate steps were taken to distance the spot from "Cog", using metaphor to make the promotion, rather than focusing on the technology itself.&lt;ref&gt;Eastwood, Allison; "[http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/online/20030703/honda.html Apres-cog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217020137/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/online/20030703/honda.html |date=17 February 2012 }}", ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'', 3 July 2003.

'''Creative computing''' covers the interdisciplinary area at the cross-over of the [[creative arts]] and [[computing]]. Issues of [[creativity]] include [[knowledge discovery]], for example.&lt;ref name="yang15"&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23766-4_7 | chapter=Knowledge Discovery in Creative Computing for Creative Tasks | first1=Lu | last1=Zhang | first2=Hongji | last2=Yang | authorlink2=Hongji Yang | title=Creativity in Intelligent, Technologies and Data Science | volume=535 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=Communications in Computer and Information Science | pages=93–104 | year=2015 | isbn=978-3-319-23765-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The ''International Journal of Creative Computing'' describes creative computing as follows:&lt;ref name="IJCrC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inderscience.com/ijcrc | title=International Journal of Creative Computing | publisher=[[Inderscience Publishers]] | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines.  People use computers as aids to  creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. Applications are seen in [[arts]], [[entertainment]]/[[games]], [[mobile applications]], [[multimedia]], product/[[web design]] and other [[interactive system]]s.&lt;!-- ICRC aims to shape a significant body of creative computing research. --&gt;}}

Creative computing is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature and topics relating to it include [[Application software|applications]], [[Software development|development method]], [[evaluation]], [[Conceptual model|modeling]], [[philosophy]], [[principle]]s, [[Operating environment|support environment]], and [[theory]].&lt;ref name="IJCrC" /&gt;

The term "creative computing" is used both in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (e.g., at [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/ | title=Creative Computing – An Introductory Computing Curriculum using Scratch | publisher=[[Harvard University]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ | title=Creative Computing | publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | work=[[MIT Media Lab]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Theodosii De Situ Terrae Sanctae ''''' is a short 6th-century [[travel guide]] to the [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage sites]] in the [[Holy Land]].
Its author is identified as an archdeacon named Theodosius in a 9th-century manuscript (cod. Vaticanus 6018).
The work includes a list of places and routes, and occasionally commentary on relevant biblical passages, combining the genre of ''[[itinerarium]]'' with  stories reminiscent of a  modern [[Travel literature|travelogue]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nicklas in: C. R. Moss et al. (eds.),  ''The Other Side: Apocryphal Perspectives on Ancient Christian “Orthodoxies”'' (2017), p. 26. &lt;/ref&gt;  It was compiled after 518 and before 530, as the author is aware of the construction work done under [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]] but not of that done under [[Justinian I|Justinian]].
Tsafrir (1986) has argued that the topographical information in the work is based on maps used by tour guides, also reflected in the [[Madaba Map]] of the same period. The author inserted additional information based either on his own travels or on accounts by other pilgrims. 

The text is divided into 32 sections or paragraphs.
Sections 1&amp;ndash;6, 27 and 32 have the character of an ''Itinerarium''.
The holy sites in Jerusalem are described in sections 7–11, 17, 21 and 31),
interspersed with descriptions of holy sites in Asia Minor  (12–13, 15, 26), Egypt (14), the Jordan Valley (18–20), Phoenicia (23) and  Arabia (24).
The biblical geography of Jordan is given in section 22, a biblical geography of Paradise in section 16.
A list of provinces in the Holy Land is given in section 25.
Three sections are short narratives: on [[Urbicius (eunuch)|Urbicius]] and the [[Seat of Mary]] (28), The Persians in [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] (29), [[Eudoxius of Antioch|Eudoxius]] on Melitene and Susa (30).

The work was known to [[Gregory of Tours]]. It was also included in the ''[[Otia Imperialia]]'' by  [[Gervase of Tilbury]] (c. 1211). 
Notable manuscripts include codd. Guelferbytanus (Weissenburg 99) (8th/9th c.), Haganus 165 (8th c.),  Vaticanus 6018 (9th c.) and  Parisinus 4808 (9th c.).

The text was edited by T. Tobler (1865), T. Tobler and A. Molinier (1879), [[Johann Gildemeister|J. Gildemeister]] (1882), J. Pomialowsky (1891) and P. Geyer (1898). It has also been translated into a number of European languages. English translations include those by J. H. Bernard (1893) and J. Wilkinson (1977).

The '''director of audiography''', (DA) within Indian-style [[filmmaking]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/india/ The Culture-Specific Use of Sound in Indian Cinema (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; is the head of the sound department and the person responsible for planning the [[audiography]]  and managing the audiographers of a film. 
The title is not used professionally in most of the world. The role of audiographer and the title "director of audiography" derives from [[Bollywood]]-style filmmaking in India, where it is an established title credit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254967/fullcredits#cast Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1958)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276628/combined Yehi Hai Zindagi (1977)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120456/fullcredits#cast Virasat (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0991346/fullcredits#cast Bhoothnath (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The DA works to carry out the [[Film director|director's]] vision, identifies the tasks necessary to realize this vision, budgets for those tasks and coordinates all the work from pre-production to post-production whilst keeping an eye on overall sound quality.

Since the onset of the "[[talkies]]", a creative and professional conflict has emerged from the ongoing tension between the visual and aural dimensions of film. Production sound crews often complain about the lack of consideration given to sound on film productions.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/production-sound/openletter.htm An Open Letter from your Sound Department] by John Coffey et al. (v 1.0)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curleysound.com/soundltr.pdf  An Open Letter from your Sound Department] by John Coffey et al. (v 1.4)&lt;/ref&gt; Having a DA in pre-production helps to exert a powerful presence to defend the dimension of sound in film.

In the early days of the Hollywood [[studio system]], every studio had a sound director (SD)&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 35) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; or a recording director (RD), who headed the sound department and took sole credit for the work done by a large crew of sound technicians.
&lt;ref&gt;''Sound-On-Film'' by Vincent LoBrutto (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsound.org/murch/stretching.htm Walter Murch]&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood sound editor David Yewdall bemoans the loss of the SD in [[Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 35) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and recalls the story of [[film producer]] Ross Hunter, working on the film ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', who neglected to take the advice of sound editor Joe Sikorski to record aircraft sound effects on location; an SD would have immediately appreciated the financial implications of ''not'' taking such advice.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Sound Director'' (page 116) in ''The Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'' by David Lewis Yewdall, M.P.S.E., Focal Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the studio system and the loss of the sound director, part of this role was delegated to the post-production supervisor, [[supervising sound editor]], [[sound designer]] or [[production sound mixer]] - each role allegedly having less influence, responsibility and scope than the former SD. Where no DA is hired - as is the case when making films in the [[Western world|West]] - there has been some debate on the most appropriate role to head the sound department; a supervising sound editor is seen as a technical manager - comparable to an [[art director]] - whereas a sound designer is viewed as a creative visionary, analogous to a [[production designer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sound-On-Film'' by Vincent LoBrutto (1994), page. 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sounds of Movies'' by Nicholas Pasquariello (1996, 1997), page. 130&lt;/ref&gt; 
In practice, the industry sees both roles as equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amps.net/ AMPS website] - see the note on Supervising Sound Editors in the Directory of Members PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The DA should not be confused with a production supervisor or post-production supervisor - both are administrative roles in the production department. In contrast, the DA is a technical role blending leadership, management and administrative skills with creative audiography ranging over pre-production, production and post-production - constrained only by the Director's vision and the production's schedule and budget. In many ways the DoA role is a natural extension of the more limited post-production role of supervising sound editor.

The term director of sound (DoS) has also been proposed as an alternative title to that of DA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/QA/sound-design-philosophy.htm Randy Thom]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5849">[[File:Elements of art.jpg|thumb|right|Elements of art and design]]
A work of art can be analyzed by considering a variety of aspects of it individually. These aspects are often called the '''elements of art'''.  A commonly used list of the main elements include form, shape, line, color, value, space and texture.

== Point ==
[[File:Stars in orion constellation.jpg|thumb|right|Stars in a constellation are a natural example of using points in a composition]]
A point is basically the beginning of “something” in “nothing”. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms.

== Line ==
[[Line (geometry)|Lines]] and [[curve]]s are marks that span a distance between two points (or the path of a moving point). As an element of visual art, line is the use of various marks, outlines, and implied lines during  artwork and design. A line has a width, direction, and length.&lt;ref name="getty" /&gt; A line's width is most times called its "thickness". Lines are sometimes called "strokes", especially when referring to lines in digital artwork.
[[File:Stars in orion constellation (connected).jpg|thumb|right|Similarly stars in a constellation connected via imaginary lines are a natural example of using lines in a composition]]

== Shape ==
Shape refers to a 2-dimensional, enclosed area. Shapes could be geometric, such as squares, circles, triangles etc. or organic and curvaceous.

== Form ==
The form of a work is its shape, including its volume or perceived volume. A [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] artwork has depth as well as width and height. Three-dimensional form is the basis of [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name="getty"&gt;{{cite web|title = Understanding Formal Analysis|url = http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis.html|publisher = Getty|accessdate = 9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] artwork can achieve the illusion of form with the use of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and/or [[shading]] or modelling techniques.&lt;ref name="incredible art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elements and Principles of Design|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/files/elements2.htm|publisher=IncredibleArt.org|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Elements of Art?|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/elements.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the analysis of works by their form or shapes in [[art history]] or [[archeology]].

== Color ==
[[Color]] is the element of art that is produced when light, striking an object, is reflected back to the eye.&lt;ref name="getty" /&gt; There are three properties to color. The first is [[hue]], which simply means the name we give to a color (red, yellow, blue, green, etc.). The second property is intensity, which refers to the vividness of the color. A color's intensity is sometimes referred to as its "[[colorfulness]]", its "saturation", its "purity" or its "strength".The third and final property of color is its [[Value (colorimetry)|value]], meaning how light or dark it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Value in Art? |url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/glossaries/g/v_value.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms [[Tints and shades|shade and tint]] refer to value changes in colors. In painting, shades are created by adding black to a color, while tints are created by adding white to a color.&lt;ref name="incredible art" /&gt;

== Space ==
Space is any conducive  area that an artist provides for a particular purpose.&lt;ref name="getty"/&gt; Space includes the background, foreground and middle ground, and refers to the distances or area(s) around, between, and within things. There are two kinds of space: [[negative space]] and positive space.&lt;ref name="oberlin"&gt;{{cite web|title = Vocabulary: Elements of Art, Principles of Art|url = http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/asia/sculpture/documents/vocabulary.pdf|publisher = Oberlin|accessdate = 9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative space is the area in between, around, through or within an object. Positive spaces are the areas that are occupied by an object and/or form.

==Texture==
Texture, another element of art, is used to describe how something feels or looks. There are many forms of texture; the two main forms are actual and visual. 

Visual texture is strictly two-dimensional and is perceived by the eye that makes it seem like the texture.

Actual texture (tactile texture) is one not only visible, but can be felt. It rises above the surface transitioning it from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. 

Some Examples: Furry, Bumpy, Smooth, Rough, Soft, Hard... etc... 

== Value ==
Value is the degree of lightness and darkness in a color. The difference in values is called contrast. Value can relate to shades, where a color gets darker by adding black to it, or tints, where a color gets lighter by adding white to it. White is considered the lightest value whereas black is the darkest. The middle value between these extremes is also known as a half-tone, all of which can be found on a value scale. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrawingsource.com/value-drawing.html|title=Value Drawing- The Key to Realism|last=Friedman|first=Marina|date=|website=The Drawing Source|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''England, Their England''''' (1933) is an affectionately [[satirical]] [[comic novel]] of 1920s English urban and rural society by the Scottish writer [[A. G. Macdonell]].  It is particularly famed for its portrayal of village [[cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]]. ''Britain Between the wars: 1918-1940''. Taylor &amp; Francis, (1978) {{ISBN|978-0-416-29510-8}} p. 521&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social satire==
One of a genre at the time, the novel examines the changing nature of English society during the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Sutton. [http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/england.htm England, whose England? Class, gender and national identity in the 20th century folklore revival]. Musical Traditions. #53. Accessed 2009-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The style and subject matter recall the works of [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]], Macdonell's contemporaries, as well as earlier writers such as [[Jerome K. Jerome]]. It is also known for its description of traditional village cricket.  The novel is purported to be a [[roman à clef]].&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Hurst. [http://www.rbd26.dial.pipex.com/agm_ete.htm A.G. Macdonell's England, Their England (1933) Who was who?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815233912/http://www.rbd26.dial.pipex.com/agm_ete.htm |date=2007-08-15 }}. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction in 1933.  The title alludes to the refrain "England, My England" of the poem "Pro Rege Nostro" by [[William Ernest Henley]].

==Plot==
Set in 1920s England, the book takes the form of a travel memoir by a young [[Scotsman]] who has been invalided away from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], "Donald Cameron", whose father's will forces him to reside in England.  There he writes for a series of London newspapers, before being commissioned by a [[Welshman]] to write a book about the English from the view of a foreigner. Taking to the country and provincial cities, Donald spends his time doing research for a book on the [[English people|English]] by consorting with journalists and minor poets, attending a [[country house]] weekend, serving as [[private secretary]] to a [[UK MPs|Member of Parliament]], attending the [[League of Nations]], and playing village cricket.  The village cricket match is the most celebrated episode in the novel, and a reason cited for its enduring appeal. An important character is Mr Hodge, a caricature of [[Sir John Squire]] (poet and editor of the ''[[London Mercury]]''), while the cricket team described in the book’s most famous chapter is a representation of Sir John’s Cricket Club – the Invalids – which survives today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Paul (screenwriter)|Jeremy Paul]]. Sing Willow. Book Guild Ltd, Lewes. (2002) {{ISBN|1-85776-688-1}} ''The true history of the Invalids Cricket Club''&lt;/ref&gt; The book ends in the ancient city of [[Winchester]], where Macdonell went to school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28278">A '''film adaptation''' is the transfer of a work or story, in whole or in part, to a feature film. Although often considered a type of [[derivative work]], recent academic developments by scholars such as [[Robert Stam]] conceptualize film adaptation as a [[dialogic]] process.

A common form of film adaptation is the use of a novel as the basis of a feature film. Other works adapted into films include non-fiction (including journalism), autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays, historical sources, and other films. From the earliest days of cinema, in nineteenth-century Europe, adaptation from such diverse resources has been a ubiquitous practice of filmmaking.

==Elision and interpolation==

In 1924, Erich von Stroheim attempted a literal adaptation of Frank Norris's novel ''McTeague'' with his moving picture ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'', and the resulting film was 9½ hours long. It was cut, at studio insistence, to four hours, then without Stroheim's input, cut again to around two hours. The end result was a film that was largely incoherent. Since that time, few directors have attempted to put everything in a novel into a film. Therefore, [[wikt:elision|elision]] is all but essential.

In some cases, film adaptations also interpolate scenes or invent characters. This is especially true when a novel is part of a literary saga. Incidents or quotations from later or earlier novels will be inserted into a single film. Additionally, and far more controversially, filmmakers will invent new characters or create stories that were not present in the source material at all. Given the anticipated audience for a film, the screenwriter, director, or movie studio may wish to increase character time or to invent new characters. For example, William J. Kennedy's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel ''[[Ironweed (novel)|Ironweed]]'' included a short appearance by a prostitute named Helen. Because the film studio anticipated a female audience for the film and had Meryl Streep for the role, Helen became a significant part of the film. However, characters are also sometimes invented to provide the narrative voice.

==Interpretation as adaptation==

There have been several notable cases of massive inventive adaptation, including the Roland Joffe adaptation of ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' with explicit sex between Hester Prynn and the minister and Native American obscene puns into a major character and the film's villain. The Charlie Kaufman and "Donald Kaufman" penned ''Adaptation'', credited as an adaptation of the novel ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'', was an intentional satire and commentary on the process of film adaptation itself. All of those are cases of Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. The creators of the ''Gulliver's Travels'' [[Gulliver's Travels (miniseries)|miniseries]] interpolated a sanity trial to reflect the ongoing scholarly debate over whether or not Gulliver himself is sane at the conclusion of Book IV. In those cases, adaptation is a form of criticism and recreation as well as translation.

Change is essential and practically unavoidable, mandated both by the constraints of time and medium, but how much is always a balance. Some film theorists have argued that a director should be entirely unconcerned with the source, as a novel is a novel and a film is a film, and the two works of art must be seen as separate entities. Since a transcription of a novel into film is impossible, even holding up a goal of "accuracy" is absurd. Others argue that what a film adaptation does is change to fit (literally, adapt), and the film must be accurate to the effect (aesthetics), the theme, or the message of a novel and that the filmmaker must introduce changes, if necessary, to fit the demands of time and to maximize faithfulness along one of those axes.

In most cases adaptation, the films are required to create identities (for example, a characters' costume or set decor) since they are not specified in the original material. Then, the influence of film-makers may go unrecognised because there is no comparison in the original material even though the new visual identities will affect narrative interpretation. [[Peter Jackson]]'s adaptations of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]] and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' by author [[JRR Tolkien]] represent an unusual case since many visual and stylistic details were specified by Tolkien. For the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]], author [[JK Rowling]] was closely consulted by the filmmakers, and she provided production designer [[Stuart Craig]] with a map of [[Hogwarts]]' grounds and also prevented director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] from adding a graveyard scene because the graveyard would appear elsewhere in a later novel.

An often overlooked aspect of film adaptation is the inclusion of sound and music. In a literary text, a specific sound effect can often be implied or specified by an event, but in the process of adaptation, filmmakers must determine specific the sound characteristics that subliminally affects narrative interpretation. In some cases of adaptation, music may have been specified in the original material (usually [[Diegesis|diegetic]] music). In [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s 2005 ''[[Twilight (Meyer novel)|Twilight]]'' novel, the characters [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]] both listen to Debussy's [[Debussy's Claire de Lune|''Clair de lune'']] and Edward composes the piece ''Bella's Lullaby'' for Bella. While ''Clair de lune'' was a pre-existing piece of music, ''Bella's Lullaby'' was not and required original music to be composed for the 2008 [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|movie adaptation]].

In the 2016 sci-fi film ''[[2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be]]'' adapted from the story by [[Kurt Vonnegut]], the film-makers decided to abandon Vonnegut's choice of music. They stated that they felt that it worked in his prose only because it was not actually heard. Filmmakers' test screenings found that Vonnegut's style of music confused audiences and detracted from narrative comprehension. The film's composer, [[Leon Coward]], stated, "You can try to be as true to Vonnegut's material as possible, but at the end of the day also you’re working with the material that you as a team have generated, not just Vonnegut's, and that’s what you've got to make work."&lt;ref name=Schubertian&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black|first=Anna|title=''"...for a father hear a child!"''

==Theatrical adaptation==
Stage plays are frequent sources for film adaptations. 

Many of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays, including ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[Othello]]'', have been adapted into films.  The first sound adaptation of any Shakespeare play was the [[The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_(1929_film) | 1929 production]] of ''The Taming of the Shrew'', starring [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]].&lt;ref name="Barnet"&gt;{{cite book | last=Barnet | first=Sylvan | authorlink=Sylvan Barnet | chapter=''The Shrew'' on Stage and Screen | editor-last=Heilman | editor-first=Robert B. | editor-link=Robert B. Heilman | title=The Taming of the Shrew | series=Signet Classic Shakespeare | location=New York | publisher=New American Library | year=1998 | edition=Second Revised | origyear=1966 | page=188 | isbn=9780451526793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later adapted as both a musical play called ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', which opened on Broadway in 1948, and as the 1953 Hollywood [[Kiss_Me_Kate_(film) | musical of the same name]].  ''The Taming of the Shrew'' was again retold in 1999 as a teen comedy set in a high school in ''[[10 Things I Hate about You]]'', and also in 2003 as an urban romantic comedy, ''[[Deliver Us from Eva]]''. The 1961 musical film ''[[West Side Story]]'' was adapted from ''Romeo and Juliet'', with its first incarnation as a Broadway musical play that opened in 1957. The animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994) was inspired by ''Hamlet'' as well as various traditional African myths, and 2001's '' [[O_(film) |O]]'' was based on ''Othello''.

Film adaptations of Shakespeare's works in languages other than English are numerous, including Akira Kurosawa's films ''Throne of Blood'' (1957, an epic film version of ''Macbeth''), '' [[The_Bad_Sleep_Well |The Bad Sleep Well]]'' (1960, inspired by ''Hamlet'') and ''Ran'' (1985, based on ''King Lear''); and [[Vishal Bhardwaj]]'s  "Shakespearean trilogy" consisting of '' [[Haider_(film) |Haider]]'' (2014, a retelling of ''Hamlet''), ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]'' (2006, based on ''Othello'') and ''[[Maqbool]]'' (2003, based on ''Macbeth''). 

Another way in which Shakespearean texts have been incorporated in films is to feature characters who are either actors performing those texts or characters who are somehow influenced or effected by seeing one of Shakespeare's plays, within a larger non-Shakespearean story.  Generally, Shakespeare's basic themes or certain elements of the plot will parallel the main plot of the film or become part of a character's development in some way.  Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are the two plays which have most often been used in this way.&lt;ref&gt;McKernan, Luke and Terris, Olwen (eds.) ''Walking Shadows: Shakespeare in the National Film and Television Archive'' (British Film Institute Publishing, 1994).  The authors list 45 uses of ''Hamlet'' which do not include films of the play itself, on pp.45-66. They list 39 such instances for ''Romeo and Juliet'' on pp.141-156, and 23 uses of ''Othello'', on pp.119-131.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Éric Rohmer]]'s 1992 film ''[[Conte d'hiver]]'' (''A Tale of Winter'') is one example.  Rohmer uses one scene from Shakepeare's ''[[A Winter's Tale]]'' as a major plot device within a story that is not based on the play at all.

In Britain, where stage plays tend to be more popular as a form of entertainment than currently in the United States, many films began as a stage productions.  Some British films and British/American collaborations that were based on successful British plays include ''[[Gaslight_(1940_film)|Gaslight]]'' (1940), ''[[Blithe_Spirit_(film)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1945), ''[[Rope_(film)|Rope]]'' (1948), ''[[Look_Back_in_Anger_(1959_film)|Look Back in Anger]]'' (1959), ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!]]'' (1969), ''[[Sleuth_(1972_film)|Sleuth]]'' (1972), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), ''[[Shirley_Valentine_(film)|Shirley Valentine]]'' (1989), ''[[The Madness of King George]]'' (1994), ''[[The_History_Boys_(film)|The History Boys]]'' (2006), '' [[Quartet (2012 film) |Quartet]]'' (2012), and ''[[The Lady in the Van]]'' (2015).

Similarly, hit Broadway plays are often adapted into films, whether from musicals or dramas. Some examples of American film adaptations based on successful Broadway plays are ''[[Arsenic_and_Old_Lace_(film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), ''[[Harvey_(film)|Harvey]]'' (1950), ''[[A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), ''[[The_Odd_Couple_(film)|The Odd Couple]]'' (1968), ''[[The Boys in the Band]]'' (1970), ''[[Agnes_of_God_(film)|Agnes of God]]'' (1985), ''[[Children_of_a_Lesser_God_(film)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' (1986), [[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]] (1992), ''[[Real Women Have Curves]]'' (2002), ''[[Rabbit_Hole_(film)|Rabbit Hole]]'' (2010), and ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'' (2016).

On one hand, theatrical adaptation does not involve as many interpolations or elisions as novel adaptation, but on the other, the demands of scenery and possibilities of motion frequently entail changes from one medium to the other. Film critics will often mention if an adapted play has a static camera or emulates a proscenium arch. Laurence Olivier consciously imitated the arch with his ''Henry V'' (1944), having the camera begin to move and to use color stock after the prologue, indicating the passage from physical to imaginative space. Sometimes, the adaptive process can continue after one translation. Mel Brooks' ''The Producers'' began as a film in 1967, was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2001, and then adapted again in 2005 as a musical film.

==Television adaptation==
Feature films are occasionally created from television series or television segments. In some cases, the film will offer a longer storyline than the usual television program's format and/or expanded production values. In the adaptation of ''The X-Files'' to film, for example, greater effects and a longer plotline were involved. Additionally, adaptations of television shows will offer the viewer the opportunity to see the television show's characters without broadcast restrictions. These additions (nudity, profanity, explicit drug use, and explicit violence) are only rarely a featured adaptive addition (film versions of "procedurals" such as ''Miami Vice'' are most inclined to such additions as featured adaptations) – ''South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut'' is a notable example of a film being more explicit than its parent TV series.

At the same time, some theatrically released films are adaptations of television miniseries events. When national film boards and state-controlled television networks co-exist, filmmakers can sometimes create very long films for television that they may adapt solely for time for theatrical release. Both Ingmar Bergman (notably with ''Fanny and Alexander'' but with other films as well) and Lars von Trier have created long television films that they then recut for international distribution.

Even segments of television series have been adapted into feature films. The American television variety show ''Saturday Night Live'' has been the origin of a number of films, beginning with ''The Blues Brothers,'' which began as a one-off performance by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Mr. Bean was adapted into ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' and the sequel, ''Mr. Bean's Holiday''.

==Radio adaptation==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}Radio narratives have also provided the basis of film adaptation. ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'' for example, began as a radio series for the BBC and then became a novel that was adapted to film. In the heyday of radio, radio segments, like television segments today, translated to film on several occasions, usually as shorts. Dialog-heavy stories and fantastic stories from radio also adapted to film (e.g. ''Fibber McGee and Molly'' and ''The Life of Riley'').

==Comic book adaptation==
{{see also|List of films based on comics}}
[[Comic book]] characters, particularly [[superhero]]es, have long been adapted into film, beginning in the 1940s with Saturday movie serials aimed at children. ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) are two later successful movie adaptations of famous comic book characters. In the early 2000s, [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] such as ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000) and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002) have led to dozens of superhero films. The success of these films has also led to other comic books not necessarily about superheroes being adapted for the big screen, such as ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]'' (2001), ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001), ''[[American Splendor (film)|American Splendor]]'' (2003), ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005), ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007), ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' (2008), and ''[[Whiteout (2009 film)|Whiteout]]'' (2009).

The adaptation process for comics is different from that of novels. Many successful comic book series last for several decades and have featured several variations of the characters in that time. Films based on such series usually try to capture the back story and “spirit” of the character instead of adapting a particular storyline. Occasionally, aspects of the characters and their origins are simplified or modernized.

Self-contained graphic novels, and miniseries many of which do not feature superheroes, can be adapted more directly, such as in the case of ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' (2002) or ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' (2006). In particular, Robert Rodriguez did not use a screenplay for ''Sin City'' but utilized actual panels from writer/artist Frank Miller's series as storyboards to create what Rodriguez regards as a "translation" rather than an adaptation.

Furthermore, some films based on long-running franchises use particular story lines from the franchise as a basis for a plot. The [[X2 (film)|second X-Men film]] was loosely based on the graphic novel ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills]]'' and the [[X-Men: The Last Stand|third film]] on the storyline "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]". ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' was based on the storyline "Spider-Man No More!" Likewise, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' owes many of its elements to Miller's "[[Batman: Year One]]" and the film's sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', uses subplots from ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]''.

The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] starting in 2008 is a [[shared universe]] with films combining characters from different works by [[Marvel Comics]]. The [[DC Extended Universe]] starting in 2013 uses the same model for [[DC Comics]].

==Video game adaptation==
{{see also|Category:Video games by type of adaptation}}
{{see also|Category:Lists of works based on video games}}
 
Video games have also been adapted into films, beginning in the early 1980s. Films closely related to the computer and video game industries were also done in this time, such as ''[[Tron]]'' and ''[[Cloak &amp; Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak &amp; Dagger]]'', but only after the release of several films based on well-known brands has this genre become recognized in its own right.

Similar to comic book-based films in the past (especially from 1980s), films based on video games tend to carry a reputation of lackluster quality and receive negative reaction from both film critics and fans of the source material. A number of films have been successful at the box office, such as ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'', and ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''), but critical reception of the films is either mixed to poor.

Some, such as ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'', were particularly negatively received and are considered among the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]]. ''Super Mario Bros.'' was criticized for being too dark, violent and unfaithful (in plot) to the popular video game series. Many anime Original Video Animations (OVAs) based on popular games have been released such as ''[[Dead Space: Downfall]]'', ''[[Halo Legends]]'', ''[[Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic]]'', and numerous films based on the video game series ''[[Pokémon]]''.

Among the most well-known video game filmmakers is [[Uwe Boll]], a German writer, director, and producer whose works include ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]'', ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'', ''[[BloodRayne (film)|BloodRayne]]'', ''[[In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale]]'', ''[[Postal (film)|Postal]]'', and ''[[Far Cry (film)|Far Cry]]'', all of which were almost universally panned by critics.

Another likely reason for the failure of video game adaptations is that structural conversion from video game to film format can be challenging for filmmakers. [[Nintendo]] [[video game designer]] [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] said in a 2007 interview:
{{quote|I think that part of the problem with translating games to movies is that the structure of what makes a good game is very different from the structure of what makes a good movie. Movies are a much more passive medium, where the movie itself is telling a story and you, as the viewer, are relaxing and taking that in passively. Whereas video games are a much more active medium where you are playing along with the story. ... I think that video games, as a whole, have a very simple flow in terms of what’s going on in the game. We make that flow entertaining by implementing many different elements to the video game to keep the player entertained. Movies have much more complex stories, or flow, to them, but the elements that affect that flow are limited in number. So I think that because these surrounding elements in these two different mediums vary so greatly, when you fail to take that into account then you run into problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/miyamoto-interview|title=Miyamoto: The Interview|publisher=[[Edge Magazine]]|date=November 27, 2007|accessdate=August 9, 2010|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503102141/http://www.edge-online.com/features/miyamoto-interview|archivedate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an interview with ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in August 2015, Miyamoto said, "Because games and movies seem like similar mediums, people’s natural expectation is we want to take our games and turn them into movies. … I’ve always felt video games, being an interactive medium, and movies, being a passive medium, mean the two are quite different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Chris|title=Shigeru Miyamoto Talks Nintendo's Return to the Movie World|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/21/nintendo-movie-partnerships/|website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations from other sources==
{{category see also|Films based on works}}
While documentary films have often been made from journalism and reportage, so too have some dramatic films, including: ''All the President's Men'' (1976, adapted from the 1974 book); ''Miracle,'' (2004, from an account published shortly after the 1980 "miracle on ice"); and ''Pushing Tin'' (1999, from a 1996 ''New York Times'' article by Darcy Frey). ''An Inconvenient Truth'' is [[Al Gore]]'s film adaptation of his own Keynote multimedia presentation. The 2011 independent comedy film, ''Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins'' was based on ''Kermode and Mayo's Film Review'' of ''Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief''.

Films adapted from songs include ''Coward of the County'', ''Ode to Billy Joe'', ''Convoy'', and ''Pretty Baby'' (each from a song of the same name).

Films based on toys include the Transformers franchise and the G.I. Joe films; there is a longer history of animated television series being created simultaneous to toy lines as a marketing tool. Hasbro's plans to for films based on their board games began with 2012's ''Battleship''. While amusement park rides have often been based on action movies, conversely the 1967 Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland was adapted into ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' in 2003.

Remakes and film sequels are technically adaptations of the original film. Less direct derivations include ''The Magnificent Seven'' from ''The Seven Samurai'', ''Star Wars'' from ''The Hidden Fortress'', and ''Twelve Monkeys'' from ''La Jetée''.

Many films have been made from mythology and religious texts. Both Greek mythology and the Bible have been adapted frequently. Homer's works have been adapted multiple times in several nations.  In these cases, the audience already knows the story well, and so the adaptation will de-emphasize elements of suspense and concentrate instead on detail and phrasing.{{or|date=November 2015}}

==Awards==
Many major film award programs present an award for adapted screenplays, separate from the award for original screenplays. 

In the case of a film which was adapted from an unpublished work, however, different awards have different rules around which category the screenplay qualifies for. In 1983, the Canadian [[Genie Awards]] rescinded the Best Adapted Screenplay award they had presented to the film ''[[Melanie (film)|Melanie]]'' when they learned that the original work had been unpublished;&lt;ref name=returned&gt;"Melanie adaptation Genie returned". ''Cinema Canada'', No. 96 (May 1983). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017, the film ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'', which was adapted from an unpublished theatrical play, was classified and nominated as an adapted screenplay by some awards but as an original screenplay by others.&lt;ref name=ineligible&gt;[http://ew.com/article/2016/12/15/oscars-loving-moonlight-original-screenplay/ "Oscars: Moonlight ineligible for Best Original Screenplay"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', December 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation of films==
When a film's screenplay is original, it can also be the source of derivative works such as novels and plays. For example, movie studios will commission novelizations of their popular titles or sell the rights to their titles to publishing houses. These novelized films will frequently be written on assignment and sometimes written by authors who have only an early script as their source. Consequently, novelizations are quite often changed from the films as they appear in theatres.

Novelization can build up characters and incidents for commercial reasons (e.g. to market a card or computer game, to promote the publisher's "saga" of novels, or to create continuity between films in a series)

There have been instances of novelists who have worked from their own screenplays to create novels at nearly the same time as a film. Both Arthur C. Clarke, with ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', and Graham Greene, with ''The Third Man'', have worked from their own film ideas to a novel form (although the novel version of ''The Third Man'' was written more to aid in the development of the screenplay than for the purposes of being released as a novel). Both John Sayles and Ingmar Bergman write their film ideas as novels before they begin producing them as films, although neither director has allowed these prose treatments to be published.

Finally, films have inspired and been adapted into plays. John Waters's films have been successfully mounted as plays; both ''Hairspray'' and ''Cry-Baby'' have been adapted, and other films have spurred subsequent theatrical adaptations. ''Spamalot'' is a Broadway play based on Monty Python films. In a rare case of a film being adapted from a stage musical adaptation of a film, in 2005, the film adaptation of the stage musical based on Mel Brooks' classic comedy film ''The Producers'' was released.

'''''Fires''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Feux'''}}) is a 1936 prose book by the French writer [[Marguerite Yourcenar]]. It consists of aphorisms, prose poetry and fragmentary diary entries alluding to a love story.

==Reception==
Stephen Koch reviewed the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1981, and described it as an "unwritten novel", a type of fragmentary book he compared to works by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Colette]], [[Cyril Connolly]], and [[Roland Barthes]]: "These books insist - on everypage - that they are not novels. They refuse to be novels. Yet through their fragmented alternatives, we still can glimpse the novels they refuse to be - tales otherwise untellable, masked and revealed - for reasons ranging from discretion to despair to a certain visionary breathlessness. ... The unwritten novel among the fantasies and aphorisms of ''Fires'' is a classic tale."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Koch|first=Stephen|date=1981-10-04|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/04/books/flights-of-a-polymath-s-fancy.html|title=Flights of a Polymath's Fancy|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels''''' is a 1653 painting of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]]'s Italian art collection by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] painter [[David Teniers the Younger]], now held in the collection of [[Museo Lázaro Galdiano]] in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://database.flg.es/ficha.asp?ID=8447 La visita del Archiduque Leopoldo Guillermo a su gabinete, acompañado de David Teniers el joven] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the Archduke as a collector with friends admiring a set of paintings. The artist himself holds his hat in his hand and is listening to his patron as the archduke gestures with his cane towards some recent acquisitions. The paintings are arranged in rows on the walls of an L-shaped room, with the men standing in front of a doorway with the sculpted portrait of the archduke. Another set of paintings are positioned in the foreground leaning against chairs for inspection.

This painting is dated 1653 and was painted after earlier, larger versions that [[David Teniers the Younger]] prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]'', considered the "first illustrated art catalog". He published this book of engravings after the Archduke had moved to Austria and taken his collection with him. It was published in Antwerp in 1659 and again in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009347911 Online version] of the [[Theatrum Pictorium]], 1673&lt;/ref&gt; The most impressive of these gallery paintings was the [[The Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Painting Gallery in Brussels|large version on copper]] in the [[Museo del Prado]] with a different selection of paintings. That was produced as a gift from the archduke to  [[Philip IV of Spain]].

Many of the recognizable paintings in the collection, not all of which were included in the Italian catalog prepared by Teniers, are still in the Viennese collection. This copy was probably produced as a gift in tandem with a similar version formerly in the [[Rothschild]] collection.

'''Guerrilla art''' is a [[street art]] [[art movement|movement]] that first emerged in the [[UK]], but has since spread across the world and is now established in most countries that already had developed [[graffiti]] scenes. In fact, it owes so much to the early graffiti movement, in the [[United States]] guerrilla art is still referred to as ‘post-graffiti art’.
  
Guerrilla art differs from other art forms in it has no external boundary between the image and the environment. While a traditional painting can be moved from one gallery to another without the meaning or the artistic credibility of the piece being affected, street art is environmental, the surface to which it is applied to being as fundamental to the piece's meaning as that which is applied. Without the dynamics of modern life, guerrilla art is reduced to ‘art for arts sake’ and would be defined by ''what it is'' as opposed to ''what it does''.

The production of [[guerrilla]] art is focused on cause and effect, not the material piece itself. It aims to produce an effect within the minds of those people who live within the environment being altered. It does not necessarily aim to produce meaningful art in itself.

== Guerrilla artists ==
Guerrilla artists increasingly seem to be moving towards a philosophy of painting a continuous work of art, adding to it over time as less developed elements of the piece are erased by graffiti cleaning efforts or in the battle for space. Art on canvas is not guerrilla art. Although many guerrilla artists regularly produce ‘trapped art’, they do not generally consider it to be the same thing. This has manifested itself in a wave of new canvas styles that have a guerrilla art style, but are more comprehensive and finished. Few traditional artists would create artwork intentionally meaning for it to be [[mass produced]] with little fidelity and put up with [[wheat paste]]. Many guerrilla artists hijack major branding for their own publicity and identity, often at odds with the brand itself. This can be seen with [[D*Face]]'s hijacking of the [[Walt Disney]] signature.

It's not a movement that attempts to support or to oppose brand conditioning. It is the general public's artistic response to it.

* [[Banksy]] is an English-based graffiti artist, political activist and film director whose real identity is unknown. His [[satirical]] street art and subversive [[epigrams]] combine [[dark humour]] with graffiti executed in a distinctive [[Stencil graffiti|stenciling]] technique.

&lt;!-- Wellington New Zealand--&gt;
&lt;!-- 'Vacant Lot Of Cabbages' (1978) --&gt;
&lt;!-- http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2012/11/02/vacant-lot-of-cabbages-documentation-enters-te-papas-archives/ --&gt;

In 1978 in downtown Wellington, [[New Zealand]] artist Barry Thomas, in collaboration with Chris Lipscombe, Hugh Walton and others, planted 180 cabbages "on the demolished Duke of Edinburgh/Roxy Theatre site in the centre of Wellington. This cabbage patch, planted in such a way as to spell the word CABBAGE immediately captured the imagination of both the media and the public and engendered a flurry of other activities on the site, culminating in a week-long festival... when the cabbages were ceremonially harvested."&lt;ref name="wellington"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harper |first1=Jenny |first2=Aaron |last2=Lister |date= |title=Wellington: A City for Sculpture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWhH1fjliCwC&amp;q=barry+thomas#v=snippet&amp;q=barry%20thomas&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a work of conceptual sculpture, this intervention is also an early example of Guerrilla art and [[guerilla gardening]] in New Zealand. Thomas' work remained for six months, "astonishingly unvandalised, as a living, breathing sculpture in the heart of the city." &lt;ref&gt;"The Artists' Co-op: Barry Thomas; Eva Yuen; Ian Hunter; Ross Boyd; Terry Handscombe; Robin White"&lt;/ref&gt; Christina Barton writes in the following months, "it captured the hearts and minds of Wellingtonians, who followed the growth of the cabbages, adding their own embellishments to the site, and contributed to the week of festivities (with poetry readings, performances, and the distribution of free coleslaw) that celebrated their harvest", describing the work as "a provocation to the local council and the city's developers".&lt;ref name="wellington" /&gt; Thomas' documentation of the project was recently purchased by New Zealand's national gallery Te Papa, who described the work as an "important moment in New Zealand’s art and social history" with links to the "[[Occupy movement]], [[urban farming]] and [[guerrilla gardening]]".&lt;ref&gt;"‘Vacant lot of cabbages’ documentation enters Te Papa’s archives"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic movement ==
[[Art]]istic [[Art movement|movement]]s are responsive. This movement is a response to the ever-increasing power and importance of the brand in everyday life. Developed, inner-city environments are where both [[brand]]ing and guerrilla art flourish. This is not coincidental.

The most important development in the street art movement and the reason for its 'guerrilla' tag is the adoption of guerrilla marketing techniques over traditional artistic methods. The use of [[guerrilla marketing]] methods to create ‘artistic publicity’ has seen the evolution away from artists as creative individuals and towards artists as brands.

It is this branding and the profound effect it has upon the minds of the general public that drives the guerrilla art movement.

'''Hyŏpyul-sa''' (협률사) was the first modern theatre of Korea, supported by the [[Korean Empire]] from 1902 until its closing.&lt;ref name="guy1"&gt;유민영, 『한국근대연극사』. 서울: 단국대학교출판부. 1996. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1902, [[Korean theatre]] took the forms of outdoor performance and folk theatre. In that year of 1902, the ''Hyŏpyul-sa'' was established as the first modern indoor theatre in Korea, where they staged dramatized stories in [[Pansori]] musical styles. This reformed style of Pansori was a kind of opera or music drama called [[Changgeuk]].&lt;ref name="brandon"&gt;Brandon, James R. and Martin Banham. ''The Cambridge guide to Asian Theatre.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, with strong financial support, it overpowered other private theatres and exercised great influence on other theatres.&lt;ref name="guy1"/&gt; 

As the theatre began to evolve from outdoor to indoor, the style of theatre was also transformed. That change was necessary because the style of outdoor theatre was limited spatially, especially when it came into an enclosed space. As the modern theatre grew, new types of theatre appeared later on.

'''''I Am Legend''''' is a 2007 American [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] [[drama film]] based on the [[I Am Legend (novel)|novel of the same name]], directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] and starring [[Will Smith]], who plays [[United States Army|US Army]] [[virology|virologist]] Robert Neville. The story is set in [[New York City]] after a virus, which was originally created to cure cancer, has wiped out most of mankind, leaving Neville as the last human in New York, other than nocturnal mutants.  Neville is immune to the virus and he works to develop a cure while defending himself against the hostile mutants.

[[Warner Bros.]] began developing ''I Am Legend'' in 1994, and various actors and directors were attached to the project, though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production began in 2006 in [[New York City]], filming mainly on location in the city, including a $5 million scene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 | title=A 'Legend' in the Making | work=The Hollywood Reporter | accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011204523/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. It is the third feature-film adaptation of [[Richard Matheson]]'s 1954 ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'' novel, following 1964's ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' and 1971's ''[[The Omega Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Before ''I Am Legend''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s release in cinemas in 2007, the direct -to-DVD ''[[I Am Omega]]'' was released by [[The Asylum]] to cash-in on the adaptation's potential success. {{cite news | url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935602.html | title=I Am Legend review | author=Todd McCarthy | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=December 7, 2007 | accessdate=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released on December 14, 2007, in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and opened to the largest ever [[box office]] (not adjusted for [[inflation]]) for a non-[[Christmas]] film released in the U.S. in December. The film was the seventh-[[2007 in film#Top grossing films|highest grossing film of 2007]], earning $256 million domestically and $329 million internationally, for a total of $585 million.

&lt;!-- Leave real-world perspective in place per MoS (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)#Real-world perspective);
Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400-700 words. The current version is 622 words excluding alternative ending.
--&gt;
In 2009, a [[genetic engineering|genetically re-engineered]] [[measles]] [[virus]], originally created as a [[Cancer research|cure for cancer]], turns into a lethal strain which kills 90% of those it infects, mutates over 9% into predatory, nocturnal and [[vampiric]] mutants, called Darkseekers, who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight, with less than 1% immune. Three years after the outbreak, [[United States Army|US Army]] virologist [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Robert Neville ([[Will Smith]]) lives an isolated life in the deserted ruins of [[New York City]], unsure if any other uninfected humans are left in the world.

Neville's daily routine includes experimentation on infected rats to find a cure to the virus and venturing through [[Manhattan]] to search for food and supplies, as well as waiting each day for any human survivors who have responded to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct any uninfected people to meet him at midday at the [[South Street Seaport]].

Flashbacks reveal that his wife ([[Salli Richardson]]) and daughter ([[Willow Smith]]) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced [[quarantine]] of the island in 2009, when Neville stayed behind on the island as military personnel.  Neville's only mitigation for his loneliness is his [[German Shepherd]] named Samantha, a.k.a. Sam (given to him by his daughter as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash), interaction with [[mannequins]] he has set up as patrons at a video store, and recordings of old television broadcasts. At night, he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]] home to hide from the Darkseekers. One day, while waiting for survivors, Sam follows a deer into a dark building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and finds the deer's corpse along with Sam, but the building is infested by a colony of Darkseekers. Both manage to escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight.

&lt;!--all edits to trap section need to be [[WP:SYNTH]] free. Please do not speculate on who set the second trap and motives of the infected--&gt;
Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a [[Animal trapping#Snares|snare trap]] and captures a female Darkseeker from the colony building, while a male Darkseeker (termed "Alpha Male" in the script, and played by [[Dash Mihok]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-1aM7D_ymdAC&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=201|title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2010|author=Roger Ebert|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 9 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; tries to go after them, but is blocked by the sunlight and returns to the shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female without success. The next day, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female; by the time he manages to escape, the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam manage to eliminate them, but Sam is bitten in the fight. Neville injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, Neville is forced to strangle her to death. Heartbroken and driven over the edge of insanity by his dog's death, he ventures out and suicidally attacks a group of Darkseekers the next night. He kills a large number of Darkseekers but the rest overwhelm him and he is nearly killed, but is rescued by a pair of immune survivors, Anna ([[Alice Braga]]) and a young boy named Ethan ([[Charlie Tahan]]), who have traveled from [[Maryland]] after hearing one of his broadcasts. They take the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a [[Red Cross]] evacuation ship from [[São Paulo]] and are making their way to a survivors' camp in [[Bethel, Vermont]]. Neville angrily argues that no such survivors' camp exists.

Neville once again attempts to administer a potential cure to the infected woman in his laboratory, but the next night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in [[Vermont]]. They are greeted by military officers and other human survivors before Anna is shown handing the cure to military personnel.

===Director's Cut ending===
&lt;!-- NOTE: The alternative ending is covered in its own section. Please do not replace the original ending here with the alternative ending. Thanks! --&gt;
During the lab attack, the alpha male makes a butterfly-shaped smear on the glass. Neville realizes that the alpha male is identifying the female which he was experimenting on by her butterfly tattoo and that it wants her back. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down as the former apologizes to the latter. The alpha male accepts it and the Darkseekers leave. Shocked, Neville looks over the pictures of his numerous test subjects and the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him. Neville, Anna, and Ethan then drive to the survivors' camp in Vermont with the antidote.

==Cast==

[[Mark Protosevich]] was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his [[spec script]] of ''[[The Cell]]''. Protosevich's first draft took place in 2000 in [[San Francisco]], and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called 'Hemocytes') were civilized to the point of the creatures in ''The Omega Man'' and Anna was a lone [[morphine]] [[Substance dependence|addict]], as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville. Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track, attaching [[Neal H. Moritz]] as [[film producer|producer]].&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

Actors [[Tom Cruise]], [[Michael Douglas]],&lt;ref name="duo"/&gt; and [[Mel Gibson]]&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; had been considered to star in the film,&lt;ref name="duo"&gt;{{cite news | author=Anita M.

In July, Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anita M.

Parks | url= | title=Arnold's 'Legend' coming here | publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]] | date=August 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott had Protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing, [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts. The Scott/Logan version of ''I Am Legend'' was a mix of sci-fi and psychological thriller, without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; The creatures in Logan's version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic, barbaric nature. The studio, fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential, began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott&amp;nbsp;– then on a negative streak of box office disappointments&amp;nbsp;– and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay. After an "esoteric" draft by writer [[Neal Jimenez]], Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project, reluctantly working with Scott again.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

In December 1997, the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR111729674.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1 | title='Legend' may not live on; Leighton lightens up | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=December 4, 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott rewrote the script in an attempt to reduce the film's budget by $20 million,&lt;ref name="reins"&gt;{{cite news | author=Chris Petrikin | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117469681.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Fox reins in 'Riders' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=April 13, 1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-16/news/9803160197_1_legend-hollywood-reporter-million-budget | title=Schwarzenegger's 'Legend' is in peril | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=March 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott's last three films, ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'', ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'', and ''[[G.I. Jane]]''.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; Likewise, Schwarzenegger's recent films at the time (''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' and Warner Bros. own ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'') also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies ''[[Sphere (1998 film)|Sphere]]'' and ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' were negative, as well.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; In August 1998, director [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] was attached to the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Benedict Carver | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117479598.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Col taps duo for 'Space' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=August 18, 1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions,&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; but the director (who reportedly wished for [[Nicolas Cage]] to play the lead) moved on to direct ''[[Reign of Fire (film)|Reign of Fire]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Charles Lyons | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117783821.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Bowman will reign over Spyglass' 'Fire' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 17, 2000 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the project did not get off the ground.

In March 2002, Schwarzenegger became the producer of ''I Am Legend'', commencing negotiations with [[Michael Bay]] to direct and [[Will Smith]] to star in the film.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117864047.html?categoryid=1201&amp;cs=1 | title='Legend' rekindled by Arnold | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=March 17, 2002 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was shelved due to Warner Bros. president [[Alan F.

[[Guillermo del Toro]] was originally approached to direct by Smith, but turned it down to direct ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929062.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Helmer takes on 'Legend' for WB | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=September 13, 2005 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence, whose film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' was produced by Goldsman, was fascinated by empty urban environments. He said, "Something's always really excited me about that... to have experienced that much loss, to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Goldsman took on the project as he admired the second ''I Am Legend'' film adaptation, ''The Omega Man''.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Jensen | title=Will Smith: Making a 'Legend' | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=August 16, 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20052055,00.html | accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other [[zombie]] films inspired by the novel,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; as well as from the recently released ''[[28 Days Later]],'' although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted [[London]] in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'', which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and [[solitary confinement]].&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The director had watched [[Jane Campion]]'s film ''[[The Piano]]'' with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.&lt;ref name=empire2/&gt;

===Casting===
Will Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006.&lt;ref name="reborn"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942073?cs=1 | title='Legend' reborn again at Warners | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=April 25, 2006 | accessdate=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he took on ''I Am Legend'' because he felt it could be like "''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' [or] ''[[Forrest Gump]]''—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [This] always felt like it had those possibilities to me."&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' (2001). He said that "when you're on your own, it is kind of hard to find conflict." The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = I Am Legend | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = October 2007 | pages = 78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare for his role, Smith visited the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref name=china/&gt; Smith compared Neville to [[Job (Bible)|Job]], who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the [[Book of Job]], ''I Am Legend'' studies the questions, "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?"&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He also cited an influence in [[Tom Hanks]]' performance in ''[[Cast Away]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

Abbey and Kona, both three-year-old German Shepherd dogs, played Neville's dog Sam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Adam Markowitz | title = The Dog | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = November 2, 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20156358,00.html | accessdate=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the supporting cast consists of [[Salli Richardson]] as Zoe, Robert's wife,&lt;ref name="blackfilm"&gt;{{cite news | author=Wilson Morales | url=http://www.blackfilm.com/20060915/features/iamlegendnews.shtml | title=''I Am Legend'' casting news | publisher=Blackfilm.com | date=September 19, 2006 | accessdate=September 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alice Braga]] as a survivor named Anna.&lt;ref name="blackfilm" /&gt; [[Willow Smith]], Will Smith's daughter, makes her film debut as Marley, Neville's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Davidson | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/737/737180p1.html | title=Another Smith Joins Legend | publisher=IGN | date=October 4, 2006 | accessdate=October 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Thompson]] has an uncredited role as Dr. Alice Krippin, who appears on television explaining her vaccine for cancer that mutates into the virus.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news |first=Dana |last=Stevens | title=I Am Legend, reviewed | publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=December 14, 2007 | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2007/12/i_am_legend.html | accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Mike Patton]] provided the guttural screams of the infected "hemocytes", and [[Dash Mihok]] provided the character animation for the infected "alpha male". Several filler characters with uncredited roles were in old news broadcasts and flashbacks, such as the unnamed President's voice ([[Pat Fraley]]), and the cast of ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''.

Akiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness.&lt;ref name="variation" /&gt; Goldsman explained, "L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [but] New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world."&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics,&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a [[camcorder]], and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives.&lt;ref name="empire2"&gt;{{cite news |first= Ian |last=Nathan | title=Last Man Standing | publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=January 2008 | pages=109–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the [[Grand Central Terminal]] viaduct, several blocks of [[Fifth Avenue]], and [[Washington Square Park]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The film was shot primarily in the [[anamorphic format]], with flashback scenes shot in [[Super 35]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Simon |last=Gray | title=Island of Lost Souls | journal=[[American Cinematographer]] | publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] | volume=89 | issue=2 | page=32 | location=Los Angeles, California, United States | date=February 1, 2008 | issn=0002-7928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will Smith said, "I don't think anyone's going to be able to do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That's the most middle fingers I've ever gotten in my career."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

A bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to serve as a flashback scene in which New York's citizens evacuate the city. Shooting the scene consumed $5 million of the film's reported $150 million budget, which was likely the most expensive shoot in the city to date. The scene, which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies, involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras, including 160 National Guard members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Steuer | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 | title=A 'Legend' in the making | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=April 26, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070428014812/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Addiego |first= Walter | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/14/DDCFTTNAT.DTL | title=Review: I, human – Will Smith plays last man standing in 'I Am Legend' | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | date=December 14, 2007 | accessdate=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also present were several [[Humvee]]s, three [[Stryker]]s, a {{convert|110|ft|m|adj=on}} [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]], a {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on}} [[USCG Utility Boat|utility boat]], and two {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} response boat small craft, as well as other vehicles including taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Steuer | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSN2335654320070424 | title=Government agencies cover filmmakers in red tape | publisher=Reuters | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming concluded on March 31, 2007.&lt;ref name="taking" /&gt; [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the [[Manhattan Bridge]] collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island.

Reshoots were conducted around November 2007. Lawrence noted, "We weren't seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago. The movie starts to take on a whole other life. It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.'

===Effects===
A week into filming, Francis felt the infected (referred to as "Darkseekers" or "hemocytes" in the script), who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended [[post-production]], although the end results were not always well received.&lt;ref name="timesreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rtreview" /&gt; The concept behind the infected was that their [[adrenal gland]]s were open all of the time and Lawrence explained, "They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can't get out of people in the middle of the night when they're barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they're constantly [[hyperventilation|hyperventilating]], which you can't really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The actors remained on set to provide [[motion capture]].&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/nv_i_am_legend.html|title=Sony Pictures Imageworks - I Am Legend|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard", so Mike Patton, lead singer of [[Faith No More]], was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Harris |first= Chris | title=Mike Patton Hits The Big Screen, Voicing 'I Am Legend' Baddies And Scoring 'Perfect' Indie Flick  | date=December 13, 2007 | url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576342/story.jhtml | accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, CGI was used for the [[lion]]s and [[deer]] in the film, and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators, and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited [[John Ford]] as his influence: "We didn't want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic. A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day. There's something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted."&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

Premieres were held in Tokyo, New York, and London. At the London premiere in [[Leicester Square]], British comedian and actor [[Neg Dupree]] was arrested after pushing his way onto the red carpet and running around shouting "I am Negend!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.negdupree.com/urban-sports/uk/red-carpet-run/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117081800/http://www.negdupree.com/urban-sports/uk/red-carpet-run/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} Neg Dupree Red Carpet Run&lt;/ref&gt; The stunt was part of his "Neg's Urban Sports" section of comedy game show ''[[Balls of Steel (TV series)|Balls of Steel]]''.

===Marketing===
The film's teaser was attached to the screenings of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''. And a tie-in comic from [[DC Comics]] and [[Vertigo Comics]] has been created, ''I Am Legend: Awakening''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.futuremovies.co.uk/filmmaking/one-man-his-dog-and-a-cg-apocalypse/nick-goundry |title=I Am Legend: Awakening|publisher=Future Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project draws upon collaboration from [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], screenwriter Mark Protosevich, and author [[Orson Scott Card]]. The son of the original book's author, Richard Christian Matheson, also collaborated on the project. The project will advance from the comic to an online format in which animated featurettes (created by the team from [[Broken Saints]]) will be shown on the official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Erik Amaya | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10992 | title=CCI: This Book is Legend | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=July 28, 2007 | accessdate=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film had an approval rating of 69% based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''I Am Legend'' overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith's mesmerizing performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_am_legend/ |title=I Am Legend |accessdate=April 11, 2010|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a rating to reviews, the film has an [[arithmetic mean|average]] score of 65 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/iamlegend |title=I Am Legend (2007): Reviews |accessdate=April 11, 2010|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] wrote that Will Smith gave a "graceful and effortless performance" and also noted the "third-act collapse". He felt that the movie "does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=A. O. |last=Scott |authorlink= A. O.

''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' published an article on December 14, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= McCarthy |first= Erin
|publication-date= December 14, 2007 |title= I Am Legend's Junk Science: Hollywood Sci-Fi vs. Reality |periodical= [[Popular Mechanics]] |url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a2399/4236920/ |accessdate= November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film:

# the rate of deterioration of urban structures, [[infrastructure]], and survival of [[fauna]] and [[flora]]
# the plausibility of a [[retrovirus]] spreading out of control as depicted in the film (The [[measles]] virus depicted in the film, however, is not a retrovirus, but is in fact a part of the ''[[Paramyxovirus]]'' family.)
# the mechanics of the Brooklyn Bridge's destruction

The magazine solicited reactions from [[Alan Weisman]], author of ''[[The World Without Us]]'', [[virology|virologist]] W. Ian Lipkin, [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], and Michel Bruneau, [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], comparing their predictions with the film's depictions. The article raised the most questions regarding the virus' mutation and the medical results, and pointed out that a [[suspension bridge]] like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span. Neville's method of producing power using gasoline-powered generators seemed the most credible: "This part of the tale is possible, if not entirely likely," ''Popular Mechanics'' editor Roy Berendsohn says.

Philosopher [[Slavoj Zizek]] criticized the film politically as being the most [[Reactionary|regressive]] adaptation from the novel. He said that while the original novel had a progressive [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] message where Neville became a "legend" to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them (much like vampires were legends to humans), the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through apparent [[miracle|divine intervention]]. According to Zizek, this misses the original message and "openly opt[s] for [[religious fundamentalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zizek |first=Slavoj  |authorlink=Slavoj Žižek |title=Living in the End Times |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MIz6BPT23Q4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=I+Am+legend+zizek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JlR9UY_8NJKu4AObpIGgBw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20Am%20legend%20zizek&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 28, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Verso Books |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what happened to Neville before the infected took over New York. [[D. B. Weiss]] was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director on the contingent that the story was interesting enough. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to [[Washington, D.C.]], as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Weintraub|title=Will Smith talks I AM LEGEND prequel|work=Collider.com|date=December 5, 2008|url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/news/article.asp/aid/10055/tcid/1|accessdate=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would again explore the premise of what it is like to be alone. Lawrence stated, "... the tough thing is, how do we do that again and in a different way?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=11673&amp;count=0|title=Director Talks "I Am Legend" Prequel|work=WorstPreviews.com|date=January 16, 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, Francis Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying, "I don't think that's ever going to happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/05/03/i-am-legend-prequel-will-smith-francis-lawrence|title=EXCLUSIVE: 'I Am Legend Prequel' Is Dead, Says Francis Lawrence|work=MoviesBlog.MTV.com|date=May 3, 2011|accessdate=August 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808124621/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/05/03/i-am-legend-prequel-will-smith-francis-lawrence|archivedate=August 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Warner Bros. announced that negotiations had been made to produce another installment, with the intention of having Will Smith reprise his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Fleming Jr |first= Mike |title= Warner Bros Plans More 'I Am Legend' With Will Smith |work= Deadline |publisher= Penske Business Media, LLC |date= February 17, 2012 |url= http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/warner-bros-plans-more-i-am-legend/ |accessdate= February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled ''A Garden at the End of the World'', described as a post-apocalyptic variation of ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Studio executives found so many similarities to ''I Am Legend'' in the screenplay, they had the writer Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as the next film. Serving as a reboot of the story, the studio hopes to create a franchise of films.

{{wiktionary pipe|know-how}}
'''Know-how''' (or '''knowhow''') is a term for practical knowledge on how to accomplish something, as opposed to "know-what" (facts), "know-why" (science), or "know-who" (communication). Know-how is often [[tacit knowledge]], which means that it is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalising it. Dubickis and Gaile-Sarkane (2017) states that the performance of know-how transfer is affected by accuracy of the stated aim, applied teaching, learning and assessment methods and both internal and external environment characteristics of the stakeholders involved in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Dubickis and Gaile-Sarkane (2017). Transfer of know-how based on learning
outcomes for development of open innovation. Retrieved from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313896176_Transfer_of_know-how_based_on_learning_outcomes_for_development_of_open_innovation&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of tacit knowledge is [[explicit knowledge]].

In the context of [[industrial property]] (now generally viewed as [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property]] or IP), know-how is a component in the transfer of technology in national and international environments, co-existing with or separate from other IP rights such as [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[copyright]] and is an economic asset.&lt;ref&gt;Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (A Reference for Policy-makers and Practitioners on Technology Transfer), [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]], [[Vienna, Austria]] (1996) {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is transferred by itself, know-how should be converted into a [[trade secret]] before transfer in a legal agreement.

==Definition of industrial know-how==
Know-how can be defined as ''confidentially held'', or better, "closely held" information in the form of unpatented inventions, formulae, designs, drawings, procedures and methods, together with accumulated skills and experience in the hands of a licensor firm's professional personnel which could assist a transferee/licensee of the object product in its manufacture and use and bring to it a competitive advantage. It can be further supported with privately maintained expert knowledge on the operation, maintenance, use/application of the object product and of its sale, usage or disposition.

The inherent proprietary value of know-how lies embedded in the legal protection afforded to [[trade secrets]] in general law, particularly, "case law".&lt;ref&gt;Licensing Guide for Developing Countries, [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), Geneva, 1977, {{ISBN|92-805-0395-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Know-how, in short, is "private intellectual property" which can be said to be a form of precursor to other intellectual property rights. The "trade secret law" varies from country to country, unlike the case for patents, trademarks and copyright for which there are formal "conventions" through which subscribing countries grant the same protection to the "property" as the others; examples of which are the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] and the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), under United Nations, a supportive organization designed "to encourage creative activity, [and] to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world".

A trade- secret may be defined as&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm3d_e.htm TRIPS Agreement (1995), Section 7, Article 39(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:#  it is secret meaning it is not, as a whole or in the way its parts are arranged, known by or readily accessible to people in the field that would normally deal with that information
:# it is commercially valuable because it is secret
:# reasonable effort has been made to keep it secret
For purposes of illustration, the following may be a provision in a [[license agreement]] serving to define know-how:

:&lt;small&gt;'''Know-how shall  mean technical data, formulae, standards, technical information,  specifications, processes, methods, code  books, raw materials, as well as all information, knowledge, assistance, trade practices and secrets, and improvements thereto,  divulged, disclosed,  or in any way communicated to the Licensee under  this  Agreement, unless such information was, at the time of disclosure,  or thereafter  becomes part of the general knowledge  or  literature which  is  generally available for public use from  other  lawful sources. The burden of proving that any  information  disclosed hereunder is not confidential information shall rest on the licensee'''.&lt;/small&gt;

==Show-how==
'''Show-how''' is a diluted form of know-how since even a walk-through of a manufacturing plant provides valuable insights to the client's representatives into how a product is made, assembled, or processed. Show-how is also used to demonstrate technique. {{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

An enlarged program of show-how is the typical content of '''Technical Assistance Agreements''' where the licensor firm, if one is involved, provides a substantial training program to the client's personnel on-site and off-site. (Note: Such training does not imply any grant of "license".) {{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Disclosure agreements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
There are two sets of agreements associated with the transfer of know-how agreement: (a) the disclosure and (b) the non-disclosure agreements, which are not separately parts of the principal know-how agreement. {{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The initial need for "disclosure" is due to the requirement of a licensee firm to know what is the specific, unique, or general "content" of the know-how that a licensor firm possesses that promises value to the licensee on entering into a contract. Disclosure also aids the potential licensee in selecting among competitive offers, if any. Such disclosures are made by licensors only under non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements in which there are express undertakings that should the ultimate license not materialize, the firm to whom the disclosure is made will not reveal - and equally important - by any manner apply, any part of the disclosed knowledge which is not in the public domain or previously known to the firm receiving the information.

Non-disclosure agreements are undertaken by those who receive confidential information from the ''licensee'', relating to licensed know-how, so as to perform their tasks. Among them are the personnel of engineering firms who construct the plant for the licensee or those who are key employees of the licensee who have detailed access to disclosed data, etc. to administer their functions in operating the know-how-based plant. These are also in the nature of confidentiality agreements and carry the definition of know-how, in full or truncated part, on a need-to-know basis.

==General know-how==
Outside usage in terms of industrial property, know-how is viewed as [[procedural knowledge]] (a term that also reveals its nature).

== Employee knowledge ==
Under English law, employees have a duty of [[good faith]] and fidelity until their employment ceases whereby only the former still applies. 

It is sometimes unclear what forms "know how" that was divulged to an employee in order to carry out their functions and then becomes their own knowledge rather than a secret of their previous employer. Some employers will specify in their employment contracts that a "[[grace period]]" will apply to know how that starts when a person leaves them as an employee. 

Specifying exactly what information this includes would increase the likelihood of it being upheld in court in the event of a breach, i.e. saying "when your employment contract is terminated, you must keep all information about your previous employment with us secret for 4 years" would be difficult to support because that person has to be able to use the skills and knowledge they learnt to gain employment elsewhere.

'''Mary Miss''' (born May 27, 1944&lt;ref name="FamilySearch-USPR-2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KKWV-V2B|title=Mary M Miss - United States Public Records|website=[[FamilySearch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American artist and designer whose primary interest is the public realm. Her work has crossed boundaries between architecture, landscape architecture, engineering and urban design. Her installations are collaborative in nature: she has worked with scientists, historians, designers and public administrators. She is primarily interested in how to engage the public in decoding their surrounding environment.

==Early life and education==
Miss was born May 27, 1944 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], but she spent her youth moving every year while living primarily in the western United States .&lt;ref name="FamilySearch-USPR-2009"/&gt;

Miss studied art and received a B.A. from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1966.&lt;ref name='mas'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mas.org/summitnyc/speakers/mary-miss/ |title=Summit NYC 2011: Mary Miss |website=The Municipal Art Society of New York |accessdate=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miss later received an M.F.A. from the Rhinehart School of Sculpture of [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tclf.org/pioneer/mary-miss|title=Mary Miss {{!}} The Cultural Landscape Foundation|website=tclf.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence in public art ==

As a public artist, Mary Miss is considered a pioneer in [[environmental art]] and [[site-specific art]], as well a leading sculptor during the feminist movement of the 1970s. She was a founding member of the journal ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies]]''. From her earliest work, she has been interested in bringing the specific attributes of a site into focus along with and audience engagement within public space. Miss’ work crosses boundaries between landscape architecture, architecture, urban design, and graphic communication. Her work creates situations that emphasize a site’s history, ecology or aspects of the environment that have gone unnoticed. She has been particularly interested in redefining the role of the artist in the public domain.

In her influential 1979 essay, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/778224?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents '''Sculpture in the Expanded Field''']''',''''' art critic [[Rosalind E. Krauss|Rosalind Krauss]] opens with a description of Mary Miss’s, ''[http://www.vdb.org/titles/mary-miss-interview '''Perimeters/Pavilions/Decoys''']'''''.''' Krauss uses Miss’s work to support her examination of sculpture’s interdisciplinary nature between architecture and landscape. '''''South Cove (1988)'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bpcparks.org/whats-here/parks/south-cove/|title=South Cove|website=bpcparks.org|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a permanent public project in Battery Park, is a seminal project in Miss' career as it signified new possibilities for artists working in the public realm. The project, located on a three-acre site at the base of the riverfront Esplande, was made in collaboration with architect Stanton Eckstut and landscape designer Susan Childs. "South Cove brings the public more intimately in contact with the water than any other component of Battery park City or, indeed, any other Manhattan riverside park."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Princenthal|first=Nancy|date=June 7, 1988|title=In The Waterfront|url=|journal=Village Voice|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 Miss has worked on the development of the [http://www.centerforthehumanities.org/programming/mary-miss-studio-and-city-as-living-laboratory-call '''City as Living Laboratory: Sustainability Made Tangible through the Arts'''], a non- profit organization which nurtures teams of artists and scientists working with neighborhood communities to bring about greater environmental awareness and envision more livable cities of sustenance.

== Notable Work ==
'''''Ropes/Shore (1969)''','' traced the edge of Ward’s Island with ropes staked and pulled taut at 20-foot intervals.
'''''[http://www.sculpturenature.com/en/mary-misss-south-cove/ Battery Park Landfill (1973)]''''' installation was a temporary piece of five signboard-like structures, placed 50-feet apart across the landfill site. A series of large cut out circles descended into the ground describing a column of air that materialized only when the viewer stood with the boards aligned.

'''''Perimeters/Pavilions/Decoys (1977)''','' located at the Nassau County Museum. For this installation, three tower-like structures, two mounds and an underground courtyard were built on a 5-acre park site. The towers varied in size, from 12’ to 18’ tall. After passing between the earth mounds, the viewer came upon a 16’ square opening in the ground with a protruding ladder. Approaching the hole and descending, a sunken courtyard is revealed. Inside the submerged courtyard were numerous doorways, windows and corridors to venture. The viewer encounters experiences and multiple perspectives, both above and below ground.

'''''South Cove'' (1984)''', New York City, the Battery Park City Fine Arts Commission chose Miss to be the lead artist for ''South Cove,'' a restoration and waterfront promenade along the Hudson River in Manhattan. The 3.5-acre park near the tip of Manhattan, is composed of wooden pilings, trellises, grids and a steel mesh overlook. The project also served restorative functions for both the damaged landscape and isolated waterfront. Miss worked in collaboration with landscape architect Susan Child and architect Stanton Eckstut on this project. [[File:Union Sq frame vc.jpg|thumb|Framing Union Square, 14th Street Subway, NYC]]'''''[http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Artwork:_Framing_Union_Square_(Mary_Miss) Framing Union Square]'' (1992-2000)''', New York City, Miss collaborated with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy to create 125 red frame elements scattered throughout the Fourteenth Street Union Square Subway Station. The red elements highlight the disappearance of lost infrastructure as well as industrial elements that remain.

'''''[http://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/greenwood-pond-double-site/ The]''''' [http://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/greenwood-pond-double-site/ '''''Des Moines Art Center'' (''']'''1986-96)''', Des Moines, Iowa, is a 7.5-acre site that was developed as both an art installation and restoration site. It includes a demonstration wetland, outdoor classroom, overhanging walkways, a pavilion and a curved trellis. The structures highlight the connection between land and water. Visual elements and images are interwoven throughout the site to reflect the history of the park and its surroundings.

'''''CALL/City as Living Laboratory: Sustainability Made Tangible through the Arts'' (2008–present)'''. CaLL focuses on reshaping the boundaries between artists and urban infrastructure by articulating a vision of the public sphere where artists are able to address environmental issues of our time. Multiple projects have been developed or are under development as part of this initiative.

== CALL Projects ==
'''[http://cfa.aiany.org/index.php?section=upcoming&amp;expid=250 BROADWAY: 1000 Steps] (2011 – ongoing)'''  A long-term initiative to establish Broadway as the “green” corridor of New York City where sustainability is made accessible to citizens at street level.
'''BROADWAY-1000 Steps''',started by Mary Miss in City as Living Laboratory, is used to decode the environment of city in art. in long term, this project makes a great outline to change the Broadway in art with the collaboration of scientists and citizens. it has huge impact on art and science, and it helps the city to change itself into a modern city.

'''''Ravenswood/CaLL'' (2011''') An initiative to establish a district of innovation in Long Island City that recognizes the ad hoc nature of the area, its often hidden ecology, the history of manufacturing, and the presence of small-scale artisanal fabrication and artists. The project focuses on the historic and now submerged, Sunswick Creek. By tracing the path of the creek through the neighborhood, patrons will learn about Ravenswood’s history and influence in New York City.

'''''[http://www.imamuseum.org/visit/100acres/artworks-projects/flow?) FLOW (Can You See the River?)]'' (2011)''' A project made up of a series of ‘stopping places’ along a six-mile stretch of the White River between the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the center of Indianapolis. The project brings together the cognitive power of science with the affective power of art to raise river awareness.

'''''The Passage'' (2010)''' This installation intended to make the journey to the Staten Island Courthouse Memorial Green an integral part of tourist experiences available in New York Harbor. The ride on the Staten Island Ferry was turned into an opportunity to follow the experiences of immigration: stories of departure, crossing and arrival are sequenced from Manhattan, to the ferry, to the Staten Island Terminal, to the Memorial Green.

'''''[http://eco-publicart.org/48-degrees-celsius/ Roshanara’s Net]'' (2008)''' The project created a temporary garden of medicinal plants—ayurvedic herbs, trees and bushes—in New Delhi, India. The installation focused on the small scale—the health and well being of the individuals and their communities.
'''''[http://www.artpark.net/2015-artpark-artist-discussions Parks as Living Laboratory]'' (2005-2006)''' A concept and program developed by Mary Miss during the Master Plan phase for the Orange County Great Park in Irvine, California that will transform city parks into a place of active participation and collaboration. The goal is to create a Research and Residency Center, a place where artists can collaborate/engage with scientists - botanists, hydrologists, biologists, - and social scientists - environmental ecologists, sociologists, anthropologists.

'''''[http://streamlines.org/ StreamLines] (2015)''','' In five modest neighborhoods in Indianapolis a cluster of mirrors and red beams radiate out from a central point to nearby streams and waterways: these elements stake out a territory for observation. All are intended to provoke the visitor’s curiosity and send them out to the nearby waterways. This project was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation.

== Exhibitions ==
Miss was included in the exhibition "Twenty-Six Contemporary Women Artists," at the Aldrich Museum in 1971. [[Lucy Lippard]] was the curator, and other artists included [[Alice Aycock]] and [[Jacqueline Winsor|Jackie Winsor]].&lt;ref name="Chadwick2"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Chadwick|first1 = Whitney|title = Women, Art, and Society|date = 2012|publisher = Thames and Hudson|location = New York|isbn = 9780500204054|page = 349|edition = 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title alludes to ''[[Rubyfruit Jungle]]'', a 1973 novel by [[Rita Mae Brown]] that has explicitly [[lesbian]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vdb.org/titles/me-and-rubyfruit&lt;/ref&gt;

The video bears the signature features of [[PixelVision]]: It is black and white and the image is grainy, fuzzy, and contained within a solid black frame. These hallmark characteristics are why PixelVision has been recognized for an erotic, tactile visuality &lt;ref&gt;Marks, L. "Video Haptics and Erotics." Screen 39.4 (1998): 331-48. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; which compliments the video's erotic subject matter.

Issues of female sexuality, and whether or not homoerotic desires can be reconciled with mainstream culture and normative gender roles are explored in the video. The dialogue, presented alternately through spoken words and hand-written quotations on scraps of paper, questions whether or not [[Sapphic love|sapphic]] attraction is acceptable, and depending on the answer to this, what the future holds for [[lesbian]] relationships.

The dialogue is an almost word-for-word recreation of a conversation between Molly Bolt, the protagonist of ''Rubyfruit Jungle'' with whom Benning identified,&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Ellen. "Shooting Star: Teenage Video Maker Sadie Benning Attracts a Youthful Audience." The Advocate. 26 Mar. 1991: 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; and her first girlfriend, Leota. The story is told in the style of a video-diary, through which Benning came out,&lt;ref&gt;Horrigan, Bill. "Sadie Benning or the Secret Annex." Art Journal 54.4 (1995): 26-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is unclear to what extent the video constitutes an autobiography or memoir. Spoken dialogue is often paired with close-up shots of Benning's eye, while shots of written text pan from left to right, so that at each moment the viewer can read only a portion of what is written on the paper;&lt;ref&gt;Sadie Benning, “Me and Rubyfruit” (1990, 5:30) Video Works, Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; the movement of the camera mimics the movement of the eye when reading. The dialogue is not attributed to its speakers in the book, nor are they distinguished by medium; both girls' lines appear in written and spoken word. For this reason, the video's dialogue has also been interpreted as an internal conversation between two parts of Sadie herself, one that is more traditional and one that is more rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newmedia-art.org/cgi-bin/show-oeu.asp?ID=BEN007-3&amp;lg=GBR&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other Sadie Benning videos, such as ''[[Girl Power (video)|Girl Power]]'', the video is shot in her bedroom &lt;ref&gt;Horsfield, Kate. "Busting the Tube: A Brief History of Video Art." Feedback: The Video Data Bank Catalog of Video Art and Artist Interviews. Philadelphia: Temple UP, 2006. 14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been said to create an intimate safe space apart from the [[Heterosexism]] of the mainstream media and the real world; though there is a tension between the protective shelter of Benning's bedroom and the exposure of her body through close ups of her eyes, hands, and ears.&lt;ref&gt;Horrigan, Bill. "Sadie Benning or the Secret Annex." Art Journal 54.4 (1995): 26-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream media only surfaces when the camera pans over sexualized photos of heterosexual couples, muscular men, and phone sex ads&lt;ref&gt;http://dvblog.org/?p=1062&lt;/ref&gt; and snippets of heteronormative love songs, including [[Your Cheatin' Heart]], [[Darling Nikki]], [[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]], [[Get Up Offa That Thing]], and [[Mardi Gras Mambo]].

[[File:Maestro_oltremontano,_nicchia_di_sinistra.jpg|thumb|The left loggia of the north transept in the Upper Church at the Basilica of St Francis in Assisi]]
[[File:Maestro_oltremontano,_innesti_della_volta_del_transetto_destro_con_mascheroni_02.jpg|thumb|Mascherone]]
The '''Northern Master''' was an anonymous artist in the late 13th century who worked in the Upper Church of the [[Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi]]. Although his precise origin is unknown, he is thought to be of French, German, or English origin. He and his assistants played a critical role in painting by merging northern Gothic and Italian influences in the frescoes. Also attributed to him are the designs for some of the stained glass windows.

== Works ==
The Northern Master worked in the Upper Church of the [[Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi]] at roughly the same time as [[Cimabue]] did,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/sites/default/files/08-binski.pdf|title=How Northern was the Northern Master at Assisi?|last=Binski|first=Paul|date=29 March 2001|website=|publisher=|pages=12–15|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; decorating the upper part of the north [[transept]]. The style of the work is markedly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], perhaps French, German, or English, and for this the artist is referred to as the Northern Master (called in Italian either the ''Maestro Oltremontano, ''"master from over the mountains" or the ''Maestro Oltralpe'', "master from over the Alps").
[[File:Maestro Oltremontano, trasfigurazione (dettaglio).jpg|thumb|The Northern Master's ''Transfiguration'']]
Attributed to him are two large [[lunette]]s (containing images of the ''[[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] ''and ''Saint Luke kneeling next to a throne''); all the work in the left [[loggia]] (with busts of angels in [[clipeus]]es and life-sized figures of saints and prophets behind the columns); and various decorative elements (perhaps entrusted to his assistants) with geometric and floral motifs found underneath the arches of the lunettes, stained glass windows, and columns. Sometimes also attributed to him are the decorative bands of the [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], in particular the masks near the joints on the [[pilaster]]s, as well as the remains of the two grand figures in the niches (''Isaiah ''and ''David'') flanking the stained glass windows at the head of the transept along with the two painted rosettes above them. The work in the right loggia is generally attributed one of the Roman masters.

The Northern Master's work (unfortunately much damaged) is particularly important not only for its quality of painting but even more so because it represents a bridge between the purely Gothic style from over the Alps (in France, England, and Germany) and the Italian schools (in Assisi, Florence, and Rome). In a few places his work is patently Gothic (in an epoch in which this style had only just taken root in Italian architecture); in other areas it demonstrates an assimilation of elements from Roman culture (as in the [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus leaves]] with their classical flavor, found underneath the arches of the windows); and yet other areas show an exclusively Roman influence tied to a collaborator and successor.

Cimabue himself also appears to have been inspired by this Gothic influence, especially in the decorative bands and motifs, and to a certain scale and fluency in design. Some art historians even hypothesize that the two artists worked together in the lower register of the apse (the ''Annunciation of Joachim and his offering'', the angels holding vases at the bases of the ''Four Evangelists ''in the vaults, and the ''Crucifixion ''in the left transept).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:Maestro_oltremontano,_loggetta_di_sinistra,_dettaglio.jpg|left|thumb|Leaf motifs under the arches of the lunettes in the right transept]]
The profile of [[spire]]s and [[pinnacle]]s drawn over the small [[trefoil]] arches of the loggia in itself indicates a clear adhesion to Gothic culture. There is a particular dialogue established in the frescoes between these painted details and the real architectonic elements, that produce the window frames made with columns and arches that create the spaces into which the frescoed prophets are inserted. The loggias have created a series of painted [[Niche (architecture)|niches]], behind a gallery of real columns, which do not always correspond: a feature previously seen only in the [[Sancta Sanctorum|Sancta Sanctorum of St. John Lateran]] (rediscovered in the middle of the 20th century) which perhaps suggests that the artist was at some point in Rome where he distinguished himself and was then enlisted by Nicholas IV to assist in the Assisi decoration.

The idea of painting that not only imiates, but that is engaged enough to actually alter its environment, was then a novelty in an area normally accessible to the public and would have far-reaching consequences in later works of art.

Another characteristic of the Northern Master can be found in his figures, which are physiologically individualized. This can be seen in the way the masks at the bases of the vaults are treated, or in the figures of saints and prophets in the left loggia. Inspired by the decorative designs found in the French [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]], which contain spiraling leaves and vines, the artist clearly owes a debt to classical culture for the presence of [[Meander (art)|meander]] and rhombus, with [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves also present.

[[Oil painting|Oil paint]], at the time a predominantly northern medium, was also found to have been used by this artist in Assisi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In addition to the paintings, the design of some of the [[Stained glass|stained glass windows]], also a chiefly northern medium, are attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47394426_Concerning_the_chronology_of_Cimabue's_oeuvre_and_the_origin_of_pictorial_depth_in_Italian_painting_of_the_later_middle_ages|title=Concerning the chronology of Cimabue's oeuvre and the origin of pictorial depth in Italian painting of the later middle ages (PDF Download Available)|last=|first=|date=|website=ResearchGate|publisher=|page=124|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==
Some critics (for example [[Henry Thode]], [[Josef Strzygowski]], [[Bernard Berenson]], and [[Federico Zeri]]) believe no such artist as the Northern Master existed, attributing everything to Cimabue and his school on the basis of what Vasari indicated.

It was Aubert who first noted the decidedly gothic aspect of the work in this portion of the transept,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-01-01|title=Il 'pittore oltremontano' di Assisi, il Gotico a Siena e la formazione di Simone Martini|jstor=24434623|journal=Prospettiva|issue=121/124|pages=227–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting it to the style seen in the stained glass windows (constructed in part by French and German artists). Luigi Coletti followed, insisting on a connection to [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris based on the peculiarly harsh color scheme of this part of the frescos (golds, dark reds, ''turchini'', etc.). He wrote: "The style is rigorously linear; and this is very clear in the figurative parts, where the volumes appear resolved in many flat layers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=w3XsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Lo+stile+%C3%A8+rigorosamente+lineare;+e+ci%C3%B2+appare+con+migliore+evidenza+nelle+parti+figurate,+dove+i+volumi+risultano+risolti+in+tanti+piani+schiacciati&amp;dq=Lo+stile+%C3%A8+rigorosamente+lineare;+e+ci%C3%B2+appare+con+migliore+evidenza+nelle+parti+figurate,+dove+i+volumi+risultano+risolti+in+tanti+piani+schiacciati&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=L'opera completa di Cimabue e il momento figurativo pregiottesco|last=Cimabue|date=1975-01-01|publisher=Rizzoli|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandi in 1951 spoke of a painter "transalpino" for the ''Transfiguration'', without hypothesizing for any specific nationality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ultimately, the question of the artist's origin is one that has been extremely difficult to resolve, even if some studies have indicated points of contact with details in the stained glass windows that are decidedly German in taste,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or in the other frescoes, like those in the [[Nonnberg Abbey]] in Salzburg where the figures have a similar design and the faces a similar composition.

'''P. W. Halton''' (22 April 1841 &amp;ndash; 7 June 1909), was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born conductor.  He is best known for his long tenure as music director and conductor of [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] touring companies during the original runs and early revivals of the [[Savoy opera|Savoy Operas]], including many of the New York premieres.

==Life and career==
Patrick William Halton was born in [[Mullingar]], Ireland, and died in Manchester, England.  For nearly 25 years, Halton served as one of D'Oyly Carte's leading provincial musical directors.  Halton was the father of Frederick J. Halton, the author of "The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Operas: A Concordance" (New York, Bass, 1935).

In the early to mid-1870s, Halton moved to London and worked in a music store, playing the organ in a local church, and giving music lessons.  He also conducted at various music halls during this time.  In 1876, he was hired as a conductor by the Theatre Royal, in Manchester.

===Early years and premieres===
In December 1879, D'Oyly Carte hired Halton in Hastings as music director for one of its touring companies, presenting ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''.  In 1880 he toured with ''Pinafore'' and ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', along with shorter [[Savoy opera|companion pieces]], and in December 1880, the company began to play ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''.  Among the companion pieces included on this tour was Halton's own composition ''Six and Six'', a one-act operetta with words by B. T. Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/companions/six/index.html Information about ''Six and Six'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1881, Halton traveled to America to music direct ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', at the Standard Theatre in New York, until March 1882.  During the last month he also conducted [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]] and [[Edward Solomon]]'s ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'', alternating with ''Patience''.  He then returned to England to music direct ''Patience'' on tour until December 1883.  Next, beginning in February 1884, was ''[[Princess Ida]]''.  Then, beginning in February 1885, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' and ''Sorcerer'' were played in repertory with ''Princess Ida''.

Back in New York, at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]], Halton music directed the American premiere of ''[[The Mikado]]'' from August 1885 to April 1886.  He then toured with ''Pinafore'' and ''The Mikado'', first in England and then took in Germany and Austria, until January 1887. He then returned to New York and the Fifth Avenue Theatre, with most of the same principals, for the premiere of ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which ran until April.  He was back to Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and then Britain with ''Patience'' and ''The Mikado'' until December 1887.

In 1888, Halton toured with a repertory consisting at various times of ''Pinafore'', ''Patience'', ''The Mikado'' and ''Pirates'', until October.  On November 1, 1888, he began a tour of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which ran for over a year.  In January 1890, Halton was back in New York music directing the ill-starred premiere of ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' at the Park Theatre.  The weak cast meant a disaster, and Carte and Halton assembled a new cast for a re-launch on February 18 at Palmer's Theatre, which was better received.

===Later years===
Halton was called back to England to begin touring in March, 1890 with ''The Gondoliers'' until December.  After this, they added shows in repertory, including ''The Mikado'' in December 1890 and ''Yeomen'' in January 1891.  On 4 September 1891, he conducted ''The Mikado'' for [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Balmoral Castle]] &amp;ndash; an assignment that the patriotic Irishman accepted grudgingly.  In October 1891, ''Iolanthe'' was added to the company's repertory, and from January to July 1892 they also included ''[[The Nautch Girl]]''.  The company continued to add more shows: ''Patience'' in August 1892, ''Pirates'' in May 1893, ''Pinafore'' and ''Trial'' in January 1894, ''The Sorcerer'' in April 1895, the curtain raiser ''Cox and Box'' in May, and ''Princess Ida'' in December 1895.  The repertoire was now eleven, and the tour continued through 1896.

In late November 1896, Halton sailed for South Africa for an ambitious tour through June 1897. It embraced all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas Halton had been conducting, except ''Princess Ida'', and also included ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' and ''[[The Grand Duke]]''.  Halton toured Britain from December 1897 with most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas plus, briefly, ''His Majesty''.  Over the next six-and-a-half years, with Halton as their musical director, the same touring company played all the G &amp; S operas except ''Ruddigore'' and ''The Grand Duke'' plus, in 1900, ''[[The Rose of Persia]]''.

Halton retired on June 18, 1904.

The '''Poetry Society''' is a membership organisation, open to all, whose stated aim is "to promote the study, use and enjoyment of poetry".

The Society was founded in London in February 1909 as the Poetry Recital Society, becoming the Poetry Society in 1912. Its first President was Lady [[Margaret Sackville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.gov.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19090924.2.15 "Premiums for Poets"], ''Evening Post'', 24 September 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polystylism''' is the use of multiple [[music genre|style]]s or [[wikt:technique|techniques]] in literature, art, film, or, especially, music, and is a [[postmodern]] characteristic.

Some prominent [[contemporary music|contemporary]] polystylist composers include [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]&lt;ref&gt;John Webb, "Schnittke in Context" ''Tempo'' New Series/182, September 1992. 19-22. Citation on 19. &lt;/ref&gt;, [[Michael Colgrass]], [[Lera Auerbach]], [[Sofia Gubaidulina]], [[George Rochberg]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;!--citations for all of the preceding names are needed, unless a single citation can be found that supports al of the names in this sentence.--&gt; [[Alfred Schnittke]],&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Moody, "The Music of Alfred Schnittke", ''Tempo'' new series, no. 168, 50th Anniversary 1939-1989 (March 1989): 4–11. Citation on 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Django Bates]], [[Alexander Zhurbin]], [[Lev Zhurbin]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} and [[John Zorn]],&lt;ref&gt;Ted Gordon, "John Zorn: Autonomy and the Avant-Garde" ''Avant'' Vol. 3/T, 2012. 329-343. citation on 331.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gubaidulina, among others, has rejected the term as not applicable to her work.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Lukomsky, "Sofia Gubaidulina: 'My Desire Is Always to Rebel, to Swim against the Stream!'”. ''Perspectives of New Music'' 36. no. 1 (Winter 1998): 5–41, citation on 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Polystylist composers from earlier in the twentieth century include [[Charles Ives]]&lt;ref&gt;Nachum Schoffman, "Charles Ives's Song 'Vote for Names', ''Current Musicology'' 23 (1977): 56–68.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erik Satie]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, "Postmodern Interpretations of Satie's ''Parade''", ''Canadian University Music Review/Revue de Musique des Universités Canadiennes'' 22, no. 1 (2002): 22–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Among literary figures, [[James Joyce]] has been referred to as a polystylist.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph von Abele, "Film as Interpretation: A Case Study of ''Ulysses''", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' 31 (1973): 487–500, citation on 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though perhaps not the original source of the term, the first important discussion of the subject is Alfred Schnittke's essay "Polystylistic Tendencies in Modern Music (1971)".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schnittke, "Polystylistic Tendencies in Modern Music (1971)", in ''A Schnittke Reader'', edited by Aleksandr Ivashkin, English translation by John Derek Goodliffe, 87–90 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-253-33818-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-253-33818-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The composers cited by Schnittke as those who make use of polystylism are [[Alban Berg]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Edison Denisov]], [[Hans Werner Henze]], [[Mauricio Kagel]], [[Jan Klusák]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Carl Orff]], [[Arvo Pärt]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Rodion Shchedrin]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Slonimsky]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Boris Tishchenko]], [[Anton Webern]], and [[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]].

[[File:Paul Cézanne, Pyramid of Skulls, c. 1901.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Paul Cézanne]]. ''Pyramid of Skulls'', oil on canvas, c. 1901, 37 cm × 45.5 cm. Private collection.]] 

'''''Pyramid of Skulls''''' is a c. 1901 oil painting by [[France|French]] [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] artist [[Paul Cézanne]]. It depicts four [[human skulls]] stacked in a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramidal configuration]]. Painted in a pale light against a dark background, ''Pyramid of Skulls'' is exceptional in the artist's oeuvre, for "in no other painting did Cézanne place his objects so close to the viewer."&lt;ref name="A254"&gt;Adriani, 254&lt;/ref&gt; For art historian [[Françoise Cachin]], "these bony visages all but assault the viewer, displaying an assertiveness very much at odds with the usual reserve of domestic [[still-life]] tableaux."&lt;ref name="C491"&gt;Cachin, et al, 491&lt;/ref&gt;

Working in isolation in the last decade of his life, Cézanne frequently alluded to mortality in his letters: "For me, life has begun to be deathly monotonous"; "As for me, I'm old. I won't have time to express myself"; and "I might as well be dead."&lt;ref name="A254"/&gt;  It is possible that the death of his mother on October 25, 1897—she had been a protective and supportive influence—accelerated his meditations on mortality, a subject which had obsessed the artist since the late 1870s, but did not find pictorial form for another twenty years.&lt;ref name="C490"&gt;Cachin, et al, 490&lt;/ref&gt; Cézanne's health started to deteriorate at the same time.&lt;ref name="C490"/&gt; The dramatic resignation to death informs a number of still life paintings he made between 1898 and 1905 of skulls. These works, some painted in oils and some with watercolor, are more subtle in meaning yet also more visually stark than the traditional approach to the theme of ''[[vanitas]]''.&lt;ref name="C490"/&gt;

[[File:Cezanne - Stilleben mit drei Totenschädel.jpg|thumb|left|Paul Cézanne. ''Three Skulls'', 1902-1906, graphite and watercolor on paper. [[Art Institute of Chicago]].]]
Cézanne's interest in the subject may have had roots in thoughts other than the contemplation of death. He could have been drawn to the skulls' volumetric forms, just as he was to those of fruits and vases, and he supposedly exclaimed "How beautiful a skull is to paint!"&lt;ref name="C490"/&gt; They also share physical similarities with his self-portrayals: "the skulls confront the viewer straight-on in a manner reminiscent of the artist's portraits."&lt;ref name="C491"/&gt;  In both sets of works the mass of the cranium is emphasized: in the self-portraits the lower half of his face is obscured by his beard, while the skulls lack lower jaws altogether. In both series attention is focused on the round pate and eye sockets.&lt;ref&gt;Cachin, et al, 492-493&lt;/ref&gt; There would have been further reason for the subject to interest Cézanne: skulls were prominent in the homes of Catholics, and Cézanne was a devout Catholic knowledgeable in ancient Christian texts. Human skulls had also long been common accessories in artists' studios.&lt;ref name="C490"/&gt; Indeed, the contents of Cézanne's studio were known to include "three skulls, (and) an ivory Christ on an ebony cross" near one another on the mantelpiece.&lt;ref name="C490"/&gt; 

[[Joachim Gasquet]], a friend of the artist, later recalled:&lt;ref name="C490"/&gt; {{quote|style=margin-top: inherit;|text=On his last mornings he clarified this idea of death into a heap of bony brainpans to which the eyeholes added a bluish notion. I can still hear him reciting to me, one evening along the [[Arc (Provence)|Arc River]], the quatrain by [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]:  

:For in this lethargic world
:Perpetually prey to old remorse
:The only laughter to still make sense
:Is that of death's heads.}}

''Pyramid of Skulls'' was painted at Cézanne's studio in [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]], where he worked prior to his move into the new Les Lauves studio in September 1902.&lt;ref name="C491"/&gt; A visitor to the studio in July 1902 wrote: "In his bedroom, on a narrow table in the middle, I noticed three human skulls facing one another, three beautiful polished ivories. He spoke of a very good painted study that was somewhere in the attic. I wanted to see it." But Cézanne could not find the key to the garret, and blamed his maid for its misplacement.&lt;ref name="C491"/&gt;

A watercolor study, ''Three Skulls'', at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], is similar in composition, though relatively more graceful in handling.&lt;ref&gt;Cachin, et al, 493&lt;/ref&gt; The skull studies would serve as inspiration to 20th-century artists like [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name="A254"/&gt;  Today the skulls themselves remain in Cézanne's studio outside of [[Aix-en-Provence]].

'''Radley''' is a London-based, British accessories brand which designs and manufactures handbags, purses and other women's accessories for UK and international markets. The brand was founded by Lowell Harder in 1998. Justin Stead is the current CEO of the brand and was appointed in May 2015.&lt;ref name="basics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Faulkner|first=Ruth|title=Bag to Basics|url=http://www.drapersonline.com/news/multiples/the-drapers-interview/bag-to-basics/5041932.article|work=Drapers Magazine|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
Radley founder and current Creative Director, Australian Lowell Harder, began working in the accessories industry as a weekend stall holder on London's [[Camden Market]] in 1984 selling Indian men's accessories brand [[Hidesign]]. Harder began working with the Hidesign design team and together developed new designs for the UK market.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

Harder's business with Hidesign soon outgrew its market stall setting and needed increased investment and infrastructure which was supplied by the handbag company Tula Group in 1991. With the backing of the Tula Group, Harder was able to continue with Hidesign and in 1997, with a new working partner, develop a new women's accessories brand, Radley.

‘Harder launched it [Radley] in 1998 after becoming "fed up" with seeing bags in the same colours – such as black and navy. Instead she wanted to create something different and colourful,' wrote Drapers trade magazine in an interview with Harder in 2012.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

Initial sales of Radley were low, however through a pre-existing relationship with Department store John Lewis via Hidesign, John Lewis began to trial a selection of Radley designs. Radley became a success for [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], which then led to an interest from other UK based department stores.

==Scottie dog logo==
In an October 2012 interview with Drapers trade magazine, Radley founder Lowell Harder said of the conception of the brand's dog shaped logo 'we were experimenting with different things and one of the designers came-up with it. We hung it off a bag and people loved it.'&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

The dog logo, which hung from the bag strap, was put on a few ranges in the collection for Autumn/Winter 2000 but was added to most of the range by 2001 because of increased interest from customers. After the departure of Harder in December 2010, the new design team implemented a new version of the dog logo which saw a negative reception from the consumer. In her October 2012 [[Drapers]] magazine interview, she explained why the original design of the logo was reinstated on her return 'He was changed after I left and was made too butch. The idea of him was that he was meant to look cute and fun so we are going back to that…it was important to us that we changed him back.'&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

==First buy-out==
With the increased sales of Radley in 2002, Harder led a buyout of Tula Group from its founding members. Tula and Hidesign were maintained as brands&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

==Second buy-out==
[[Phoenix Equity Partners]] purchased a majority stake of Radley in a £45m deal in March 2006. It was listed again for sale the following December in 2007. The majority stake was purchased in a second buyout by private equity fund Exponent Private Equity in a transaction valued at £130m.  Exponent Private Equity presently maintains their majority ownership to this day alongside Radley's management team and Phoenix Equity Partners reinvested as minority stakeholders.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

==Retail==

===UK===
The company's first store opened in 2005 on London's [[Kings Road]]. There are currently 19 full-price Radley stores and 14 outlets in the UK. The brand is also currently stocked in a number of other retail locations and department stores across the UK including British retailers [[Fenwick (department store)|Fenwick]] Ltd, [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] and [[House of Fraser]].&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

===International===
Radley is currently stocked in Germany, [[Switzerland]], Japan, Russia, South Africa, [[Thailand]], and [[New Zealand]]. The bags are also available at Macy’s in the United States.

===Online===
Radley started online trading in 2007 and is currently stocked online in the UK by John Lewis, [[House of Fraser]], [[Next plc|Next]] and [[Shop Direct]].

==Rebranding==
The company re-branded in Autumn 2009 to Radley London.

==Collaborations==
In 2013, Radley collaborated with the Scottish fashion designer [[Holly Fulton]] for a capsule collection of accessories. In 2010, and again in 2013, Radley announced a partnership with [[Harris Tweed]], to incorporate the Scottish textiles into their handbag designs. There have also been capsule collections with the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] and illustrators William Grill, Emma Cowlam and Rory Crichton.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

==Brand ambassadors==
From Spring/Summer 2012 through to Spring/Summer 2013, [[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]] UK's contributing Editor [[Laura Bailey (model)|Laura Bailey]] was Radley's Brand Ambassador. The partnership also saw the launch of two capsule collections co-designed by Bailey. For Autumn/Winter 2013, British model [[Erin O'Connor]] appeared in Radley's UK advertising campaign.

==Product offering==
The brand currently produces handbags, small leather goods, luggage, hats, scarves, gloves, eyewear, casual footwear, watches, gifts and stationery.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt; Radley launched their signature fragrance Radley London in March 2015. The fragrance is available in an Eau De Parfum, body wash and body lotion.

==Charity==

===British Heart Foundation===
Radley has maintained a working relationship with the [[British Heart Foundation]], a UK based cardiovascular research charity, over the last five years. In that time Radley has produced two capsule collections with a portion of the proceeds being donated to the charity.

'''''Raising the Flag on the Three-Country Cairn'''''{{refn|Colonel Oinonen originally titled the picture as "[a] scene at the three-country boundary stone on 27 April 1945" ({{lang-fi|Kohtaus kolmen valtakunnan rajakivellä 27.4.1945}}; original photograph scan received from the Military Museum of Finland), but it is usually labelled as "Finnish soldiers raising the flag on the three-country cairn" ({{lang-fi|Suomalaissotilaat nostavat lipun kolmen valtakunnan rajapyykille}}) or a similar variation.&lt;ref name="Yle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESS"/&gt;|group="Note"}} is a historic photograph taken on 27 April 1945, which was the last day of the [[Military history of Finland during World War II|Second World War in Finland]]. It depicts a [[Finnish Army]] patrol of Battle Group Loimu, Infantry Regiment 1 ({{Lang-fi|taisteluosasto Loimu, jalkaväkirykmentti 1}}), raising the [[Flag of Finland|Finnish flag]] on the [[Three-Country Cairn|three-country cairn]] between [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Finland]] to celebrate the last German troops withdrawing from Finland. The photograph was taken by the commander of Infantry Regiment 1, Colonel [[Väinö Oinonen]] (alternatively V.J. Oinonen). It became a widely circulated symbol of World War II in Finland.

== Background ==
[[File:Flag_at_Kilpisjärvi_1945.jpg|left|thumb|
The small Finnish flag raised first on the cairn on 26 April 1945
]]
Amidst World War II, Finland fought both the [[Winter War]] of 1939–1940 and [[Continuation War]] of 1941–1944 against the Soviet Union. During the latter, Finland cooperated with [[Nazi Germany]], which had the 200,000-strong [[20th Mountain Army (Wehrmacht)|20th Mountain Army]] led by {{Lang|de|Generaloberst}} [[Lothar Rendulic]] stationed in [[Finnish Lapland]]. On September 1944, Finland agreed to a separate peace with the Soviet Union; a peace which required that Finland disarm or expel any German soldiers from Finland. The demand led to the [[Lapland War]]; the 20th Mountain Army started withdrawing north towards [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]] with the [[Finnish Army]]'s [[Finnish III Corps (Continuation War)|III Corps]], led by General [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], in pursuit. By November, the war came to an effective end when most German units had withdrawn to Norway and the [[Lyngen]] Line—although some entrenched German forces still remained in Finland at [[Kilpisjärvi]] in the corridor leading to the border tripoint between Norway, Sweden, and Finland.{{refn|The corridor is nationally called Arm's Lapland ({{lang-fi|Käsivarren Lappi}}) or the Finnish Arm ({{lang-sv|Finska armen}}).|group="Note"}}{{sfn|Jowett|Snodgrass|2012}}{{sfn|Nenye|Munter|Wirtanen|Birks|2016|loc=Chpt. 3}}

On 25 April 1945, after it was determined that the final German formations in Finnish territory were withdrawing, a 60-strong battle patrol led by Captain Valkonen was assigned to recon if Finnish Lapland was free from ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' forces. The detachment was assembled from 1st Company, Battle Group Loimu, Infantry Regiment 1, and departed on its mission at 13.00 pm the same day from southern Kilpisjärvi. The ski patrol advanced north-west towards Norway for around {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} until it was split in two near the [[Saana]] fell. The smaller group would approach the Norwegian border along the road while the bulk of the patrol would continue with Captain Valkonen towards the three-country cairn farther off. They reached the cairn by 1:15 am on 26 April after skiing approximately {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} more. [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer]] Antti Poikola attached a small [[flag of Finland]] to the cairn and the patrol reported back by radio that no Germans had been sighted on Finnish soil. Valkonen and his team shot three gun salutes at the cairn before leaving; the shots rang out across the [[fell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and startled a Swedish border guard unit nearby.{{sfn|Kulju|2017|loc=Chpt. 4}}{{sfn|Oilinki|1998|loc=Chpt.

Around the noon of 26 April, commander of the battalion, Major Martti Santavuori and a mixed Finnish–Swedish patrol arrived at the tripoint. A German {{Lang|de|Gebirgsjäger}} unit approached them from Norway, and, with knowledge that they would not engage the Swedes, Major Santavuori signaled the German leader to meet up at the border. An Austrian {{Lang|de|Feldwebel}} soon skied closer and they discussed the war, both past and future. Major Santavuori and the {{Lang|de|Feldwebel}} saluted, shook hands and bid each other "as good a future as fate has to offer" before parting ways.{{sfn|Kulju|2017|loc=Chpt. 4}}

Oinonen), arrived at the cairn to inspect the situation with a detachment of soldiers including photography specialists, a larger flag, and a better flagpole. The war flag of Finland was ceremoniously raised on the cairn and Colonel Oinonen took the titular photo—with the {{convert|894|m|ft|abbr=on}}-high Golddabakti fell of Norway in the background.{{sfn|Kulju|2017|loc=Chpt. 4}}{{sfn|Oilinki|1998|loc=Chpt.

Even though the area had been inspected, a German unit lay waiting in position on the Norwegian side of the border. The flag-raising soldiers took cover behind the cairn. Battle was avoided after a Swedish officer approached to act as an intermediary. Soon after, Colonel Oinonen resolved the situation with two {{Lang|de|Oberleutnante}}, who shared German Juno cigarettes with him. The officers saluted each other and went their ways; the time was 13:30 pm. On 28 April, General Siilasvuo sent a telegram to Finnish Commander-in-Chief [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C.G.E. Mannerheim]], reporting that the {{Lang|de|Wehrmacht}} had been expelled from Northern Finland.{{sfn|Kulju|2017|loc=Chpt. 4}}

== Aftermath ==

The picture became widely circulated in Finland and was an example of an iconic [[War photography|war photograph]] in Finnish World War II history. It was compared to similar pictures, such as the American ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]'' and the Soviet ''[[Raising a Flag over the Reichstag]]'', although it was not considered to have become as symbolic as they were. In fact, the Finnish popular memory of the conflict relied equally on fictional pictures, such as the cover of ''[[The Unknown Soldier (novel)|The Unknown Soldier]]'', a 1954 war novel about the [[Continuation War]].&lt;ref name="Yle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9927243|title=Sotilaiden omat kamerat taltioivat Suomen sodista todellisuuden, joka ei kelvannut virallisiin kuviin – tutkija: "Hyvin rajua huumoria"|last=Mäntymäki|first=Varpu|date=2017-11-19|website=Yle Uutiset|language=fi|trans-title=Soldiers' own cameras captured the reality of Finland's wars, which wasn't approved for official photographs – researcher: "Very rough humour"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119092018/https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9927243|archivedate=19 November 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=2018-02-28|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IS"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000916473.html|title=Tämä ikoninen sotakuva on kuin suomalainen versio Iwo Jiman lipun pystytyksestä|last=Juuti|first=Mikko|date=2015-04-27|work=Ilta-Sanomat|access-date=2018-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302150051/https://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000916473.html|archive-date=2 March 2018|dead-url=no|language=fi-FI|trans-title=This iconic war photograph is like the Finnish version of raising the flag on Iwo Jima|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindstendt|first=Risto|last2=Kleemola|first2=Olli|date=2011-12-02|title=Tuntematon ikoni|trans-title=Unknown icon|url=|deadurl=no|journal=[[Suomen Kuvalehti]]|language=fi|volume=|issue=48|pages=48–57|archiveurl=|archivedate=2 March 2018|access-date=|via=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESS"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ess.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/art2364591|title=Lasten ristiretki päätti Suomen sotatien Lapissa 27. huhtikuuta 1945|last=Vainonen|first=Joel M.|date=2017-04-27|work=Etelä-Suomen Sanomat|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504222749/http://www.ess.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/art2364591|archive-date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no|language=fi-FI|trans-title=The children's crusade concluded the Finnish war effort in Lapland on 27 April 1945|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Oilinki|1998|loc=Chpt.

'''Robert Olen Butler''' (born January 20, 1945) is an American fiction writer. His short-story collection ''[[A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain]]'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

==Early life==
Butler was born in [[Granite City, Illinois|Granite City]], Illinois, to Robert Olen Butler Sr., an actor and theater professor who became the chairman of the theater department of [[Saint Louis University]], and his wife, the former Lucille Frances Hall, an executive secretary.&lt;ref&gt;

Butler attended [[Northwestern University]] as a theater major ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1967) and switched to [[Playwright|playwriting]] at the [[University of Iowa]] ([[Master of Arts|MA]], 1969).

Butler served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] from 1969 to 1971, first as a [[counter-intelligence]] special agent for the [[United States Army|Army]] and later as a translator. He rose to the rank of [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]] in the Army [[Military Intelligence Corps]]. His experiences during that period have informed his writings, and as a result, in 1987 Butler received the Tu Do Chinh Kien Award from the [[Vietnam Veterans of America]] for outstanding contributions to American culture by a veteran. "My greatest pleasure in life was at 2 in the morning to wander out into the steamy back alleys of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], where nobody ever seemed to sleep, and just walk the alleys and crouch in the doorways with the people," Butler told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1993. "The Vietnamese were the warmest, most open and welcoming people I've ever met, and they just invited me into their homes and into their culture and into their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Applebome, "An Author Catapulted into the Foreground," ''The New York Times'', April 20, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as a steel mill laborer, a taxi driver, and a substitute teacher in high schools in the years following his tour of duty in Vietnam, Butler joined [[Fairchild Publications]], where he worked on the staffs of trade publications such as ''Electronic News''. From 1975 until 1985, he was the editor-in-chief of Fairchild's ''Energy User News'' (now ''Energy &amp; Power Management'').&lt;ref&gt;It is now a publication of [[BNP Media]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Robert Olen Butler is the author of 12 novels and six short story collections, including ''A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain'', which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In a review for the ''Guardian'' newspaper, renowned author Claire Messud wrote, "The book has attracted such acclaim not simply because it is beautifully and powerfully written, but because it convincingly pulls off an immense imaginative risk. . . . Butler has not entered the significant and ever-growing canon of Vietnam-related fiction (he has long been a member)—he has changed its composition forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Messud|first=Claire|title=Voices of Vietnam|newspaper=Guardian (London)|date=June 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler began writing novels on the Long Island Railroad while working as a publicist for Fairchild Publications. "Every word of my first four published novels was written on a legal pad, by hand, on my lap, on the [[Long Island Rail Road]] as I commuted back and forth from [[Sea Cliff, New York|Sea Cliff]] to [[Manhattan]]," Butler has said about his early writing.&lt;ref name=Powells&gt;

  |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author's first novel was ''[[The Alleys of Eden]]'', which was published in 1981 by Horizon Press after being rejected by 21 publishers.&lt;ref name=Powells/&gt; Its protagonist is an American deserter who decides to stay in Vietnam, as Butler's one-time writing professor [[Anatole Broyard]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', "because, with all its troubles, Vietnam seems to him to retain more of its integrity, its sense of self, than the America he has left behind."&lt;ref name=TimesReview&gt;

  |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the publication of ''The Alleys of Eden'', Butler had written, by his estimation, "five ghastly novels, about forty dreadful short stories, and twelve truly awful full-length plays, all of which have never seen the light of day and never will."&lt;ref name=Powells/&gt;

Butler has always been a controversial artist, seemingly reinventing himself with each new novel or short story collection. His shape-shifting often polarizes reviewers, as was the case with Butler's second novel ''Sun Dogs'' (Horizon, 1983), which ''The New York Times'' described as having "some powerful moments, some engrossing scenes and deft touches, but there is little momentum, no satisfying pattern, none of the magic of synergy."&lt;ref name=TimesReview/&gt; Conversely, the ''Ft. Worth Star-Telegram'' lauded the book as "full of power and energy...mov[ing] from the most feverish of prose to a flatness and sparseness that is reminiscent of the best of Chandler and Hammett. And most importantly, he has something to say... Butler is an intelligent novelist who cares about his characters. He is skillful enough to make the reader feel the same way. It is not often that we get the chance to witness the birth of something this important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Ronald|title=Now See What He's Done for an Encore|newspaper=Ft. Worth Star-Telegram|date=November 14, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler's stories have appeared in such publications as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', and ''[[Zoetrope: All-Story]]''. He has had stories included in a combined twelve editions of ''[[Best American Short Stories|The Best American Short Stories]]'', ''[[New Stories From the South]]'', and numerous college literature textbooks. Butler has also written screenplays for film and television, most of them based on other writers' material.&lt;ref&gt;

Butler's short-story collections ''Tabloid Dreams'' (1996) and ''Had a Good Time'' (2004) take their inspiration from popular culture. The stories in ''Tabloid Dreams'' were spun from the titles of outlandish articles in supermarket tabloids. ''Had a Good Time'' builds its narratives around the images on vintage American picture postcards, which Butler has collected for more than a decade. One example is the tale "Mother in the Trenches", first published in ''Harper's'' in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Butler. {{cite web|url= http://www.harpers.org/archive/2003/02/0079484|date=February 2003|accessdate= 2007-08-04|title= Mother in the Trenches|work= Harper's Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the journey of Mrs. Jack Gaines, a prosperous matron, from her comfortable home to the battlefields of [[World War I]] France, in order to convince her soldier son to come home; the story's basis is a period postcard that depicts a stout, middle-aged woman wearing dark clothes and a cloche hat.

Again the critical response varied dramatically. While the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said that the stories "feel like a literary parlor game,"&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, John. {{cite news|url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2004/08/22/RVGH889K2R1.DTL|date= August 22, 2004|accessdate= 2007-08-04|title= Faces look out from postcards to inspire stories|work= The San Francisco Chronicle | first=John | last=Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Boston Globe'' raved that it was full of "crisp writing, marvelous imagining, the discussion of large, existential questions that are as central to life now as they were a hundred years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merullo|first=Roland|title=A Past's Captured Souls|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Severance,'' his 2006 collection of 240-word short stories about the post-beheading thoughts of decapitated individuals (from [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] to [[Louis XVI]] to the author himself) was the basis of ''Severance'', a one-act play by [[David Jette]]. It was produced in 2007 at McCadden Place Theatre in Los Angeles. At the time, Butler described ''Severance'' as his best and most ambitious book.&lt;ref&gt;

This was the first of an extended venture into defining and exploring the short short story form.  His companion collection, ''Intercourse'', comprising 100 very short stories, revealed the inner monologues of couples (often famous) engaged in sexual intercourse. ''Weegee Stories,'' presenting the inner monologues of the subjects of 60 iconic photographs of Arthur "Weegee" Fellig, continued his interest in the form.  He also published a theory of the short short story in ''[[Narrative Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Robert Olen|title=A Short Short Theory|url=http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2009/short-short-theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As further evidence of his predilection for self-reinvention, in 2009 he published ''Hell'', a "roaring satire"&lt;ref name="Seaman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seaman|first=Donna|title=Review|newspaper=Booklist|date=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a novel set entirely in the underworld. His 2011 novel, ''A Small Hotel'', is described by Donna Seaman of ''Booklist'', the American Library Association's magazine, as a "sexy novel of psychological suspense."  She goes on to say, "Butler executes a plot twist of profound proportions in this gorgeously controlled, unnerving, and beautifully revealing tale of the consequences of emotional withholding."&lt;ref name="Seaman"/&gt;

In still another act of reinvention, Butler publishes his first literary/historical/espionage/thriller, ''The Hot Country'', with Otto Penzler's ''[[Mysterious Press]]'' in the fall of 2012.

In 2001, Butler wrote in real-time, a complete short story, "This is Earl Sandt," from first inspiration to final story, in a webcast of 17 two-hour sessions. As the author explained of the broadcasts, "What we're trying to do here is reproduce for you what is normally hidden behind the veil of private life.".&lt;ref&gt;

Butler taught creative writing from 1985 to 2000&lt;!-- Not positive about this year--may be 2001. --&gt; at [[McNeese State University]] in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], with his colleague [[John Wood (poet)|John Wood]], to whom he dedicated ''[[A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain]]''. He then joined the faculty of [[Florida State University]] as a Francis Eppes Distinguished Professor, holding the [[Michael Shaara]] Chair in Creative Writing, where he currently teaches.

==Awards and honors==
Butler is a recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in fiction and a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grant, and was a finalist for the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]]. In 2001 he won a [[National Magazine Award]] for "Fair Warning," a short story that was published in the journal ''Zoetrope: All-Story'', and, four years later, he won another National Magazine Award for "The One in White," a short story published in ''The Atlantic Monthly''.

In 1993, his first story collection, ''[[A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain]]'', won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction. ''The New York Times'' praised the book's "startling, dreamlike"&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Saint Bernardino of Siena''''' is a 1603 work by [[El Greco]]. It is owned by the [[Museo del Prado]] but displayed at the [[El Greco Museum, Toledo|El Greco Museum]] in [[Toledo, Spain]].

Showing [[Bernardino of Siena]] in a Franciscan habit, holding a cane topped with the monogram [[Holy Name of Jesus|IHS]] and with a book under his left arm, it was commissioned for the university college of San Bernardino in Toledo. He was paid 3,000 [[Spanish real|reales]] for it in February 1603 and it was ready the following September. In the left background is a landscape of the city of Toledo, whilst in the right foreground are three mitres, each representing one of the bishoprics the saint declined ([[Bishop of Siena|Siena]], [[Bishop of Urbino|Urbino]] and [[Bishop of Ferrara|Ferrara]]).

Appears as W111 in the listing.&lt;/ref&gt; while a student of [[Hans von Koessler]]. It was never formally published, and although awarded the Hungarian King's Prize,{{sfn|Grymes|2005|p=4}} it did not achieve significant critical acclaim. The work, like many of Dohnányi's early compositions, bears the imprint of [[Johannes Brahms]], who had championed the young composer after hearing a performance of Dohnányi's ''Piano Quintet No. 1''. The ''Symphony in F'' was given moderate attention after being recorded in 2011. It is approximately thirty minutes in length.

It requires 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani and strings&lt;ref name="grymes2001"/&gt; and while not published in his lifetime, exists in sketches and score at the [[National Széchényi Library]], Budapest.&lt;ref name="grymes2001"/&gt; It was premiered 2 June 1897, in Budapest with Gyula Erkel (son of [[Ferenc Erkel|Ferenc]]) conducting.&lt;ref name="grymes2001"/&gt;

==Form==
Dohnányi wrote the work in the traditional four-movement symphonic format. He marks the score with the following:

#Allegro  
#Adagio  
#Scherzo – Prestissimo  
#Andante

==Recording==
In 2011, the symphony's premiere recording (and only recording to date) was conducted by László Kovács.&lt;ref&gt;László Kovács (with the Miskolc Symphony Orchestra), recorded and released in 2011 on ''Ernő Dohnányi (1877-1960): Symphony in F, Zrínyi Overture, Op. 2, Suite en valse, Op. 39'' ([[Hungaroton|Hungaroton Records Publisher Ltd]]) as "Dohnányi: Symphony in F" (29:34)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tank Man''' (also known as the '''Unknown Protester''' or '''Unknown Rebel''') is the nickname of an unidentified man who stood in front of a column of tanks on June 5, 1989, the morning after the [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Chinese military had suppressed]] the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] by force. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank's attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and smuggled out to a worldwide audience. Internationally, it is considered one of the most iconic images of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ | work=The New York Times | first=Patrick | last=Witty | title=Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen | date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"&gt;[[Joe Pitts|Pitts, Joe]].

 | last = Corless | first = Kieron | title = Time In – Plugged In – Tank Man | magazine= Time Out | date = May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside China, the image and the events leading up were subject to heavy state censorship, and as a result they are being forgotten.

There is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SACHK-W4o1E&amp;t=4m28s |title=Photographer Jeff Widener |work=BBC interview |date=2014|edition= Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one witness has stated that "Tank Man" was not the only person who had opposed the tanks during the protest.  Shao Jiang, who was a student leader, said: "I witnessed a lot of the people standing up, blocking the tanks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1UUS1ZGAi4&amp;t=1m22s |title=Shao Jiang interview |work=Amnesty International|edition= Video posted for 25th anniversary|accessdate= May 28, 2014 }} Those interviewed include photographer Stuart Franklin with ''Magnum'' for TIME, who was on the 5th floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tank Man is unique in that he is the only one who was photographed and recorded on video.

==Incident==
The incident took place at the north edge of [[Tiananmen Square]], along [[Chang'an Avenue]], on June 5, 1989, two days after the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Makinen |first=Julie |date=4 June 2014 |title=Tiananmen Square mystery: Who was 'Tank Man'? |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-tiananmen-square-tank-man-20140603-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=16 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The man stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] tanks. Stuart Franklin, who was on assignment for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine, told the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' "At some point, shots were fired and the tanks carried on down the road toward us, leaving Tiananmen Square behind, until blocked by a lone protester."&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt; He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langely|first=Andrew|title=Tiananmen Square: Massacre Crushes China's Democracy Movement|publisher=Compass Point Books|year=2009|page=45|isbn=978-0-7565-4101-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of [[nonviolent action]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988169,00.html The Unknown Rebel] ''Time'' Magazine profile, 13 April 1998. Retrieved 10 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse.

Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver's hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank's turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner's hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on.  At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff.

Video footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. [[Charlie Cole (photographer)|Charlie Cole]], who was there for ''[[Newsweek]]'', said it was the Chinese government [[Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau|PSB]] (the police),&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power:Tiananmen Standoff] BBC News. Last updated October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jan Wong]], who was there for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included the "Unknown Rebel" in a feature titled "[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Iyer |first=Pico |title=The Unknown Rebel |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988169,00.html |journal=Time |date=13 April 1998 |access-date=16 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included Jeff Widener's photograph in "Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time |url=http://100photos.time.com|journal=Time |date=6 November 2016 |access-date=19 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity and fate==
Little is publicly known of the man's identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid ''[[Sunday Express]]'' named him as '''Wang Weilin''' ({{lang|zh-hans|王维林}}), a 19-year-old student&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-03/news/mn-819_1_man-tank-pictures Man who defied tanks may be dead]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' June 3, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; who was later charged with "political hooliganism" and "attempting to subvert members of the [[People's Liberation Army]]."&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Robin; Spiegel, Mickey (1994). ''Detained in China and Tibet: a directory of political and religious prisoners''. Asia Watch Committee. p. 194. {{ISBN|978-1-56432-105-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been rejected by internal [[Communist Party of China]] documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based [[Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy|Information Center for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=times30&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6390782.ece|title=Identity of Tank Man of Tiananmen Square remains a mystery |last=Macartney|first=Jane|date=May 30, 2009|work=The Times |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One party member was quoted as saying, "We can’t find him.

There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President's Club in 1999, [[Bruce Herschensohn]], former deputy special assistant to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], reported that he was [[Execution (legal)|executed]] 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by [[firing squad]] a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; In ''[[Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now]]'', [[Jan Wong]] writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have "no idea who he was either" and that he's still alive somewhere on the mainland. Another theory is that he escaped to [[Taiwan]] and remains employed there as an archaeologist in the [[National Palace Museum]]. This was first reported by the [[Yonhap|Yonhap news agency]] in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-what-happened-to-tank-man-9483398.html|title=Tiananmen Square 25th anniversary: What happened to Tank Man?|date=2014-06-04|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government of the People's Republic of China]] has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], then-[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), "I can't confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not," and then replied in English, "I think never killed"{{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html|title=''Frontline'': ''The Tank Man'' transcript|accessdate=June 30, 2008|date=April 11, 2006|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also argued that the incident evidenced the "humanity" of the country's military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Andrew|title=Tycoon prods Taiwan closer to China|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/tycoon-prods-taiwan-closer-to-china/2012/01/20/gIQAhswmFQ_story.html|accessdate=January 31, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2000 interview with [[Mike Wallace]], [[Jiang Zemin]] said, "He was never arrested." He then stated, "I don't know where he is now." He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinas-leader-talks-to-60-minutes/|title=China's Leader Talks To 60 Minutes|date=August 31, 2000|work=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International notability and censorship==

Internationally, the image of the lone man in front of the tank has come to symbolize the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989&lt;ref name=times30/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTNewPhoto"/&gt; and is widely considered one of the most iconic images of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corless2006"/&gt;

A [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/themes/legacy.html|title=Legacy of June Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of the protest on the Internet have been [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|censored in China]].&lt;ref name=times30/&gt; When undergraduate students at Peking University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they were "genuinely mystified."&lt;ref name=frontlineinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/interviews/wong.html|title=The Tank Man: Interview: Jan Wong |accessdate=August 12, 2010|date=April 11, 2006|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the students said that the image was "artwork." It is noted in the documentary ''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]: The Tank Man'' that he whispered to the student next to him "89," which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event.

It has been suggested that the "Unknown Rebel," if still alive, never made himself known as he is unaware of his international recognition due to Chinese media suppression of events relating to government protest.&lt;ref name=times30/&gt;

At and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.&lt;ref name="BBCnews"/&gt;

==Photographic versions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TankMan.JPG|thumb|300px|"Tank Man", far off in the background to the left of the leader, prepares to face down the row of incoming tanks. This photograph, taken by Terril Jones, was only released in 2009.]] --&gt;

Five photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was not later confiscated by the PSB.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect"&gt;Witty, Patrick (June 3, 2009). [http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.&lt;ref name="NYTNewPhoto"&gt;Witty, Patrick (June 4, 2009). [http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/behind-the-scenes-a-new-angle-on-history/?hp Behind the Scenes: A New Angle on History] ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The widest coverage of the event and one of the best-known photographs of the event appearing in both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazines, was documented by [[Stuart Franklin]]. He was on the same balcony as [[Charlie Cole (photographer)|Charlie Cole]], and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt;

The most-used photograph of the event was taken by [[Jeff Widener]] of the [[Associated Press]], from a sixth-floor balcony of the [[Beijing Hotel]], about half a mile (800&amp;nbsp;meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from the flu. The image was taken using a [[Nikon FE2]] camera through a Nikkor [[Telephoto lens|400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens]] and [[Nikon TC-301|TC-301]] teleconverter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/02/world/main5057008.shtml|title="Tank Man": The Picture That Almost Wasn't|last=Alfano |first=Sean |date=June 4, 2009|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Widener running out of film, a friend (by the name of Kirk)  hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt; Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers.&lt;ref name="urlNew York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ |title=Behind the Scenes: Tank Man of Tiananmen |author=Patrick Witty |date=June 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5shP0U7jv?url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/ |archivedate=September 12, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but did not win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of all time.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloorSpeech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corless2006"/&gt;

[[File:Tankman new longshot StuartFranklin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Wider shot by Stuart Franklin showing column of tanks approaching Tank Man, who is shown near the lower-left corner.]]
Charlie Cole, working for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the [[Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau|PSB]] raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to ''Newsweek''.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; He was awarded the 1990 [[World Press Photo]] of the Year&lt;ref name="WorldPressPhoto"&gt;[https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1990/world-press-photo-year/charlie-cole] World Press Photo&lt;/ref&gt; and the picture was featured in ''Life''{{'s}} "[[100 Photographs that Changed the World|100 Photographs That Changed the World]]" in 2003.

On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter, Terril Jones, revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Terril|year=2009|title=Tank Man|journal=Pomona College Magazine|volume=41|issue=1 |url=http://pomona.edu/Magazine/PCMFL09/FStankman.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306041054/http://pomona.edu/Magazine/PCMFL09/FStankman.shtml|archivedate=March 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of [[Reuters]] took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel,&lt;ref name="HKPPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.com.hk/translate?hl=zh-TW&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://thehousenews.com/society/%25E5%259B%259E%25E5%2588%25B0%25E5%25A1%25B5%25E5%259C%259F%25E4%25BA%25BA%25E9%2596%2593-%25E6%259B%25BE%25E9%25A1%25AF%25E8%258F%25AF%25E8%25A8%25AA%25E8%25AB%2587/|title=Arthur Tsang Hin Wah interview, March 20, 2013|work=google.com.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen.&lt;ref name="NYTimeretrospect" /&gt; It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Tsang's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A "foreign" photographer accompanying him suddenly said, "I am not gonna die for your country," and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the [[Chinese public security bureau|public security]] stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.&lt;ref name="HKPPA" /&gt;

In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the globe. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) cameraman [[Willie Phua]], [[CNN]] cameraman Jonathan Schaer and [[NBC]] cameraman Tony Wasserman appear to be the only television cameramen who captured the scene.&lt;ref name="Shooting the 'tank man' of Tiananmen Square"&gt;{{cite web|title=Capturing Asia|url=http://www.bobwurth.com/capturing-asia.html|website=Books and Essays by Bob Wurth on the Asia Pacific Region|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willie Phua 7.30 report ABC"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkck39jSV-M&amp;t=4m51s Willie Phua on Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 7.30 Report].

After seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the "tank man" incident occurred.&lt;ref name="BBCnews"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power: Tiananmen Standoff].

==Legacy==
In [[Tom Clancy]]'s 2000 novel ''[[The Bear and the Dragon]]'', the Chinese authorities apprehend and execute Tank Man, then bill the surviving family for the cost of the pistol round expended to shoot him in the back of the head.

A similar scene is depicted in the music video for ''[[Club Foot (song)|Club Foot]]'' (2004) by the English rock band [[Kasabian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/91923534 |author=Kasabian |title=Club Foot feat. Dinara Drukarova|website=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tank Man is briefly referenced in the 2007 film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''.

The music video for "[[Refuse/Resist]]" by the thrash/death metal band [[Sepultura]] features brief footage of the Tank Man.

A fictionalized version of the fates of both the Tank Man and a soldier in the tank is told in [[Lucy Kirkwood]]'s 2013 play ''[[Chimerica (play)|Chimerica]]'', which premiered at the Almeida Theatre from May 20, 2013 to July 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitchings|first=Henry|title=Chimerica, Almeida Theatre – theatre review |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/chimerica-almeida-theatre--theatre-review-8635490.html|accessdate=June 16, 2015|work=London Evening Standard|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2013, [[Sina Weibo]], China's most popular microblog, blocked terms whose English translations are "today", "tonight", "[[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|June 4]]", and "big yellow duck". If these were searched for, a message appeared stating that, in accordance with relevant laws, statutes, and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a [[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|photoshopped]] version of Tank Man, in which [[rubber ducks]] replaced the tanks, had been circulating around [[Twitter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Didi Kirsten Tatlow|title=Censored in China: ‘Today,’ ‘Tonight’ and ‘Big Yellow Duck’|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/censored-in-china-today-tonight-and-big-yellow-duck/|work=International New York Times IHT Rendezvous|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a reference to [[Florentijn Hofman]]'s [[Rubber Duck (sculpture)|''Rubber Duck'']] sculpture, which at that time was floating in Hong Kong's [[Victoria Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/04/fools-errand-why-china-censors-rubber-duckies-on-tiananmen-anniversary/|date=June 4, 2013|title=Fool's Errand: Why China Censors Rubber Duckies On Tiananmen Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage of Tank Man is included in the 2014 film adaptation of [[Lois Lowry|Lowis Lowry]]'s ''[[The Giver]]'', during a montage intended to give the protagonist strength.

A 2017 novel published by Random House Mondadori, [https://www.penguinrandomhousegrupoeditorial.com/foreign-rights-catalogue/la-quimera-del-hombre-tanque/ La quimera del Hombre Tanque] fictionalizes a second, hypothetical encounter between the two protagonists of the iconic photo of 1989. Aiming at social reconciliation, a group of Chinese leaders tries to broadcast on TV, a quarter of a century after the incident, a peaceful encounter between Tank Man and the tank commander.&lt;ref&gt;Víctor Sombra, Barcelona 2017 {{ISBN|978-84-3973292-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[Oaxaca]] in southern [[Mexico]] has a noteworthy tradition of finely crafted '''textiles''', particularly handmade [[embroidery]] and [[weaving|woven]] goods that frequently use a backstrap [[loom]]. Oaxaca is home to several different groups of indigenous peoples, each of which has a distinctive [[textile]] tradition.

Most notably present in the Oaxaca state are the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]], [[Nahua peoples| Nahua]] and [[Mixtec]] tribes. Each of these groups of indigenous people contributed their own influences on the modern atuendos or “attires” in Oaxaca today. Textiles and particular clothing garments and accessories can tell a lot about the culture in which they were produced. By analyzing the textiles, the technology used to create the garment can be deciphered. Many of the tools used were similar throughout Mexico, however, some tools were more common in specific regions or villages, resulting in many of the similarities in embroidery and patterns. The different garments created in Oaxaca also differ based on the indigenous peoples’ view of the world and their own social structures.&lt;ref&gt; Susan Kellogg, "Weaving the Past", Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a cape-like garment called a [[Tilmàtli|Tilma]] or Las Capa, made of cotton was strictly reserved for members of upper-class. Most textiles made from cotton were used by the upper class because it was a material that was much easier to work with than the usual leaves of plants, thus making the crop a luxury.&lt;ref name="Anawalt1019"&gt;Patricia Rieff Anawalt, "Atuenos Del México Antiguo" in "Arqueología Mexicana", Eds. Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (Mexico), Mexico, 2005, p.10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vestido_tehuana.jpg|left|thumb|The Traje de Tehuana, a contemporary indigenous dress in Oaxaca displaying the variation of color and textiles.]]
 
Many of the ancient textile and attire traditions from Mexico have disappeared over time with climate change being one of the reasons why. Because many of these antique, traditional styles of dress have become obsolete, they can often [[Handcrafts and folk art in Oaxaca|only be recreated or analyzed]] from murals and sculptures that depict the textiles and attire as well as how both were worn. Consequently, as these older textiles and traditional styles became less popular over time, it gave rise to the contemporary [[Huipil| indigenous dress]] that is often seen today; this contemporary dress is known as the [http://amanoarte.org/sobre-el-traje-de-la-tehuana/ Traje de Tehuana].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Teresa Pomar, "La Indumentaria Indígena" in "Arqueología Mexicana', Eds. Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (Mexico), Mexico, 2005, p.
 32-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The attires of ancient Mexico still influence the contemporary dress; some of the garments have actually been passed on over time which slight adjustments of textile, materials used, embroidery, patterns etc. The effect of the ancient attire on the contemporary dress is evident through the similarities and purposes of the contemporary styles. In ancient dress, a Tilma, was a part of a man’s dress, usually made of cotton and worn by the upper-class.&lt;ref name="Anawalt1019"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is evident that in contemporary dress, a [[Rebozo]] (also called Sarape or Gabán) is a shawl worn by women and heavily influenced by the Tilma. Many of the key aspects and characteristics of older attire serve as a template for the patterns and embroidery seen in contemporary textiles and garments.

According to Alejandro de Ávila B., founding director of the Ethnobotanical Garden in Oaxaca, the region's biological diversity yields Mexico's greatest variety of fibers and dyes, and "the technical sophistication of Oaxaca's textiles is unparalelled in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro de Ávila B., "Weavings that Protect the Soul" in ''The Crafts of Mexico'', Eds.

Traditional clothing items among the peoples of Oaxaca include the ''[[huipil]]'', a women's blouse constructed from several panels; the ''[[ceñidor]]'', a type of sash among the Mazatec; and the ''[[paño (head covering)|paño]]'', a [[Chinantec]] head covering.  Handcrafted Oaxacan textiles employ [[plainweave]], [[brocade]] patterns, [[gauze]] weave.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 224, 228-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much can be said about the technology being used to create these textiles based on the final product when they are complete. In ancient Mexico, waist [[Loom|looms]] were used to craft the garments. These specific tools would not allow the specific garment being weave to exceed an arm’s length in width. Though this meant that the specific garment being weaved was relatively narrow, the waist loomed allowed for the edges and borders of these pieces to be very neat and straight without needing an additional correction process afterward. The construction of these textiles varies significantly from each other. Many of the fabrics and garments created are created using natural resources such as the leaves of plants, cotton etc. A lot of fibers can be made from the leaves of plants which is a good because these resources are natural and abundant. This also aids in the [[Dyeing|dyeing process]]. Many of the bright colors attributed to the traditional dress can be attained by the use of [[Natural dye|natural dyes]] that culminate to create a [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/science/mexico-textiles-natural-dyes.html vivid spectrum of indigenous dress].&lt;ref name="Anawalt1019"/&gt;

==Motifs==
Mexican textile expepayasosrt Irmbard Weitlaner Johnson associates pre-Christian spiritual traditions with the presence of butterflies in Mazatec textile motifs.  "To this day the Mazatecs identify the [[butterfly]] as the soul that leaves the body.  They believe that the souls of the deceased have permission to come to this world once a year on [[All Saints' Day]] and the [[Day of the Dead]] to visit their family.  This is the period when butterflies are most abundant in the area and the Mazatecs consider it a sin to kill them."&lt;ref name="Johnson, p. 227"&gt;Johnson, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional motifs without specific spiritual meaning, or for which disputed interpretations exist, include a class of stepped fret known as ''[[xicalcoliuhqui]]'', which means "twisted ornament for decorating gourds" in the [[Nahuatl language]]; and the double spiral ''ilhuitl'', whose name translates as "fiesta day."  Pre-Colonial tradition associates color with the four cardinal directions: yellow with east, red with north, blue and green with west, and white with south.  Another shared motif among the region's indigenous peoples is a rectangular ornament below the neckline of the ''huipil''.  No specific symbolism is known, but it is a frequent theme in pre-colonial [[codex|codices]] and surviving historic textiles that remains in popular use.&lt;ref name="Johnson, p. 227"/&gt;

==Other symbolic uses==
Traditionally, Oaxacan women wrap a red ''faja'' (a woven [[sash]]) around their [[waist]]s as a protection from [[evil]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Faction is beginning to develop a real signature in imaginative, contemporary and visceral versions of the classics.

The Faction became a registered charity in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1145820&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Charity overview|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their first production was ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' at the [[Brockley Jack Theatre]], London, in October 2008. The Faction is now led by two artistic directors; Mark Leipacher and Rachel Valentine Smith, and is supported by a core ensemble of eleven actors and associate artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefaction.org.uk/ensemble|title=thefaction|website=thefaction.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

During The Faction's formative years, they toured across the UK, played studio theatres across London, and established an open-air season in [[Brockwell Park]]. They were then invited to be an associate ensemble of the [[New Diorama Theatre]]. With the support of their 5-year relationship at The New Diorama, The Faction was able to trial a more permanent model of working in [[repertory theatre]], with a core ensemble.  

Since 2012, The Faction have produced five annual sell-out repertory seasons, engaging with over 26,000 audience members and 4,000 students. In 2016, The Faction partnered with [[Selfridges]] to create an auditorium in their [[Oxford Street]] store for Shakespeare 400 celebrations, where they produced a version of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/richard-brownliemarshall/much-ado-about-nothing-at_b_11759604.html|title=''Much Ado About Nothing'' At Selfridges|website=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faction took their work even further afield later that year, in partnership with the [[British Council]], and the [[American University of Beirut]], producing and co-directing an Arabic premiere production of ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aub.edu.lb/news/2016/Pages/malik-lear.aspx|title=AUB – 2016 – ''Al-Malik Lear'' adds Lebanese twist to Shakespearean tragedy|website=www.aub.edu.lb|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Shakespeare, The Faction have produced work by other classic writers such Cervantes, Euripedes, Gorky, Lorca and Schiller. They also bridge the divide between classics and new writing by engaging some of the UK's most exciting and emerging writers. To date, this has included Ranjit Bolt (''Three Sisters''), Gareth Jandrell (''Thebes'', published by Bloomsbury Methuen Drama), Emily Juniper (''[[Miss Julie]]'' and ''[[Vassa Zheleznova (play)|Vassa Zheleznova]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/13/rewriting-classical-theatre-women-faction-maxim-gorky-vassa-zheleznova|title=Rewriting classical theatre: 'Female characters are sad, have babies or talk about men'|last=Saner|first=Emine|date=2016-06-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-05|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and two unique projects: ''Reptember'' and ''Demetrius''.  

''Reptember'' is an [[Off West End]] award-nominated project, consisting of 12 classic texts adapted for solo performance by some of our most promising playwrights, including Jessica Sian and Will Gore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newdiorama.com/whats-on/reptember|title=New Diorama|last=http://feastcreative.com|first=Feast Creative|website=newdiorama.com|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Demetrius'' is an ongoing portmanteau project to complete [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s [[Demetrius (play)|final unfinished work]]. Established writers such as April de Angelis, Glyn Maxwell and Simon Reade complete a "unit" before passing the baton to up and coming writers like Jon Brittain and Daniel Kanaber.

[[File:Transfigurazione (Raffaello) September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Raphael's ''Transfiguration'']], [[Vatican_Museums#Pinacoteca_Vaticana|Vatican Pinacoteca]]]] 
'''''The Raising of Lazarus''''' is a large [[altarpiece]] of 1517–1519 by the Italian [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], for which [[Michelangelo]] supplied drawings for some figures. Intended for [[Narbonne Cathedral]] in France, it is now normally in Room 18 of the [[National Gallery]] in London, where it is "NG1", the first painting catalogued at the founding of the gallery in 1824.  Until 25 June 2017 it is in the exhibition ''Michelangelo &amp; Sebastiano'' at the National Gallery, together with several of the preparatory drawings for it by both artists, and letters between them.

It was commissioned by Cardinal [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]], then [[Archbishop of Narbonne]] and later Pope Clement VII (r. 1523–24), in what was effectively a contest engineered by Michelangelo, using Sebastiano as "a kind of deputy",&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 111&lt;/ref&gt; or "cat's paw",&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150&lt;/ref&gt; in a rivalry between the two and [[Raphael]], whose ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'' (now in the [[Vatican_Museums#Pinacoteca_Vaticana|Vatican Pinacoteca]]) is the same size of 381 cm × 299 cm (150 in × 118 in) and was commissioned for the same cathedral.  The verdict of Roman critical opinion was that Raphael's painting won. 

According to [[Michael Levey]], the painting is "a tour de force of massed, gesticulating bodies and glittering colour ... Perhaps all the elements have not been quite successfully fused, but the grand manner of the composition is impressive, and in its conscious rhetoric the painting looks forward to the Baroque."&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 62&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sebastiano, who had arrived in Rome from [[Venice]] in 1511,&lt;ref&gt;Lucco&lt;/ref&gt; may have intended to dazzle the Roman critics with the colouring for which the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] was famous, giving "the greatest and most subtly varied range of colours ever seen in a single painting".&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 36&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the complicated restoration history of the painting, and aspects of Sebastiano's technique combined with effects of age, have led to a general darkening of the painting, and significant changes in some of the large number of colour shades.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject and description==
[[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]'s resurrection from the dead was the most frequently depicted of the [[miracles of Jesus]] in medieval and Renaissance art, as both the most remarkable and the easiest to recognize visually, because of the grave-cloths. As well as following the Transfiguration in traditional sequences of the [[Life of Christ in art]],&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150, these sequences generally followed the liturgical calendar but the celebrations of both Lazarus and the Transfiguration had variable dates until the end of the Middle Ages&lt;/ref&gt; the subject was especially appropriate for the cathedral at Narbonne, which had relics of Lazarus. The [[Medici]] family, whose name means "doctors" in Italian, were often attracted to subjects showing Christ as a healer (or ''medicus'').&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150; Jones &amp; Penny, 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The account in [[John 11|Chapter 11]] of the [[Gospel of John]] of the [[Raising of Lazarus]] from the dead is followed closely, though different moments in it are combined in the picture.  For Sebastiano and his contemporaries, Mary the sister of [[Lazarus of Bethany]] was the same person as [[Mary Magdalene]], though today even the Catholic Church agrees with Protestants that [[Mary of Bethany]] was a separate person.&lt;ref&gt;By coincidence, it was in 1517 that [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] published ''De Maria Magdalena et triduo Christi disceptatio'', his suggestion that the medieval Mary Magdalene was actually three different people in the Bible.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the figure kneeling in front of Christ, which in the gospels precedes the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Biblegateway |title=John 11:1–46 |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011:1-11:46&amp;version=NIV|publisher=NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main moment shown is just after John 11:45 when : "Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go".  But in the upper left background a group of Jews and [[Pharisees]] are depicted discussing the event, which completes the story in the gospels.  The standing female in orange is [[Martha of Bethany]], sister of Lazarus and Mary; in the gospel, before the tomb is opened, she protests that the body will smell, and her gesture suggests she was right.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 242–243; Langmuir, 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Biblegateway |title=John 11:1–46 |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011:1-11:46&amp;version=NIV|publisher=NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Twelve Apostles]] are crowded to the left of Christ and behind him.  The younger man standing at the left, seen in profile, is Saint [[John the Evangelist]],&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 35&lt;/ref&gt; and the bearded kneeling man at lower left is [[Saint Peter]], given an orange overgarment, as often in art.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 42&lt;/ref&gt;  The others are probably not intended to be individually identifiable.  By this stage of the [[High Renaissance]], not even Christ is given a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], making it harder to pick out any specific individuals from the crowd that the gospel account mentions.  Michael Levey said the painting was "full of obvious portrait heads",&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 62&lt;/ref&gt; but there has been much much less speculation as to the individuals with inserted likenesses than for Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' of a few years earlier.

The painting is signed in Latin "SEBASTIANVS. VENETVS. FACIE|BAT" ("Sebastian the Venetian made this") on the stone platform below Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 242&lt;/ref&gt; Born Sebastiano Luciani, after coming to Rome he had become "Sebastiano Veneziano", until in 1531 he became the Keeper of the Seal to the Papacy, and so got the nickname ''del Piombo'' thereafter, meaning "of the lead", from his new job title.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150–151; Lucco&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus (cropped4).jpg|thumb|The landscape]]
The painting was begun some five years after Sebastiano had moved from his native [[Venice]] to Rome, and shows that his adaption to a monumental and classical Roman style was effectively complete, though the colours "retain a Venice-like luminosity that enchants the eye".  Despite being conceived as a move against Raphael, with the help of Michelangelo, in its general composition it shows a good deal of influence from Raphael, and although the two paintings for Narbonne have only ever been seen together for a few days in 1520, and were both painted in conditions of great secrecy by the rival artists, in many ways they are a well-matched pair, showing how much Sebastiano had absorbed from Raphael.&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 113–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The help received from Michelangelo was limited to the main male figures (see below), and the crowd and landscape background was Sebastiano's composition.&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 113; Langmuir, 150; Gould, 244&lt;/ref&gt;  The landscape has ruins and a bridge that look like a Roman setting, but the cloudy sky and other aspects suggest a Venetian landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Michelangelo, lazaro, per pala sebastiano del piombo.gif|thumb|Drawing of Lazarus and attendants by [[Michelangelo]], which Sebastiano used for the painting, [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=716129&amp;partId=1 British Museum page]; M&amp;S, 25&lt;/ref&gt;]]
===In Rome===
In 1516 Cardinal [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]], then [[Archbishop of Narbonne]] and later Pope Clement VII (r. 1523–24), commissioned a ''Raising of Lazarus'' from Sebastiano in competition with [[Raphael]]'s late masterpiece the ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'', commissioned earlier that year.  The original declared intention was for both paintings to go to Narbonne Cathedral, which it is unlikely the cardinal ever visited.  It seems likely that the idea for what inevitably became a contest was suggested by Michelangelo,&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny, 238; Langmuir, 150&lt;/ref&gt; who the previous year had enlisted Sebastiano as "as a kind of deputy for him in painting", with the specific intention of contesting Raphael's primacy in painting in Rome, Michelangelo himself having returned to his backlog of promised projects in sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 111&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a friend of Sebastiano, he was eager to show up his bitter rival Raphael.  The cardinal fell in with this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Lucco&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vasari]], who knew both artists in later years, described the collaboration by saying that the picture was made "''sotto ordine e disegno in alcune parti''" of Michelangelo, rather vague phrasing that has been much discussed.  One translation could be "under the direction and in certain parts to the designs" of Michelangelo, but this and other possibilities leave room for a wide range of interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;  Sebastiano intended to charge for the painting based on the number of figures in it, a common way of valuing paintings at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Compositional drawings for the figures of Lazarus and his two attendants were supplied by Michelangelo.  In addition to the drawing in the [[British Museum]] illustrated here, there are other drawings by Michelangelo there and in [[Bayonne]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=716128&amp;partId=1 British Museum; the other main drawing]&lt;/ref&gt; all of Lazarus and the two men supporting him, except for one of a foot, perhaps relating to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 243–244&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern imaging techniques show that a different figure of Lazarus exists in the underdrawing, which was apparently changed to match one of Michelangelo's drawings (illustrated below) while painting was in progress, perhaps when Michelangelo visited Rome in January 1518.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  A drawing by Sebastiano seems to contain a sketch for this figure as well as one for the Saint Peter in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Frankfurt there is a drawing by Sebastiano of the figure of Martha, which is close to the painted figure.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 23; Gould, 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of more drawings by Michelangelo, now lost, for at least the figure of Christ, has been postulated by some scholars. In addition, there are a number of letters between the artists and others which record the progress of the commission. These reflect that Michelangelo was away from Rome during the period of painting, and would only have seen the half-finished work when he made a visit in January 1518.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 243–244; M&amp;S, 28–33&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular [[Leonardo Sellaio]] was a trusted assistant to Michelangelo, who remained in Rome reporting on progress.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 26; M&amp;S, 28, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Although completed by the start of 1519,&lt;ref&gt;Lucco; Freedburg, 113&lt;/ref&gt; the completed painting was apparently only exhibited to a wider public in the Vatican in late December 1519 and then again in the following April, before being sent to [[Narbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 245; Jones &amp; Penny, 238&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second exhibition, from 12 April 1520, it was shown together with Raphael's ''Transfiguration''.  Raphael had died on April 6th, and his ''Transfiguration'' came straight from being displayed by his body as it lay in state in his studio.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 243; Jones &amp; Penny, 238&lt;/ref&gt;  In the event, as described by [[Vasari]], both paintings were praised, but the Raphael much preferred, and only the Sebastiano was sent to Narbonne.&lt;ref&gt;Lucco; [http://members.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariSebastianoPiombo.html Vasari, "Life of Sebastiano"]: "These altarpieces, when finished, were publicly exhibited together in the Consistory, and were vastly extolled, both the one and the other; and although the works of Raffaello had no equals in their perfect grace and beauty, nevertheless the labours of Sebastiano were also praised by all without exception."&lt;/ref&gt;

===France and England===
[[File:Cathédrale Saint-Just de Narbonne - Chapelle Saint-Martin.jpg|thumb|The copy now in Narbonne Cathedral.  The original plinth of the frame can be seen below the painting.]]
[[File:Cathédrale Saint-Just de Narbonne - Chapelle Saint-Martin (cropped).jpg|thumb|Enlarged detail from above; the 16th-century base of the frame, copied in the new London frame.]] 
In 1722, the Regent of France, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], persuaded the Narbonne authorities to let him have the painting for the [[Orleans Collection]] in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 243–245&lt;/ref&gt; which was soon effectively open to the public in the magnificent setting of the [[Palais-Royal]], the Paris seat of the Dukes of Orléans.  He died the following year, and the replica replacement promised as part of the purchase was eventually sent around 1750; it was probably by [[Charles-André van Loo]] and still hangs in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;NGBT, 29; Gould, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The making of the frames had been a cause of argument between Raphael and Sebastiano.  Perhaps as a tactic to prevent a public side-by-side display in Rome, Raphael wanted the frames made on arrival in France, but Sebastiano insisted they be made in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Sebastiano evidently prevailed, as below the replica in Narbonne the altar still has part of a "sophisticated" frame in gold on blue that carries above the two [[festoon]]s the Medici ''[[Heraldic badge|impresa]]'' of a diamond ring with feathers rising through it, and the motto ''SEMPER'' ("always"), and is presumed to be from Rome.  This is now treated as a [[predella]] or shelf below the frame of the copy.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 26; Von Teuffel, Christa Gardner. "Sebastiano Del Piombo, Raphael and Narbonne: New Evidence", ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', vol. 126, no. 981, 1984, pp. 765–766., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/881800 JSTOR], gives fuller details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably in 1771, Sebastiano's painting was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred from wooden panel to canvas]] and some of the pigments have as a result lost their brightness, most notably the red of Christ's robe, which has turned pink.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 150–151; Gould, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

No doubt because it soon left Rome for the artistic backwater of Narbonne, the earliest print of the painting was remarkably late, in an illustrated account of the Orleans Collection, published in 1786 on the eve of its dispersal.  This was by R. De Launay, and in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was sold in 1792, included in a [[Orleans_Collection#Dispersal_in_London|block purchase of the Orleans Collection]].  It came to London in 1793 and was eventually acquired by the English consortium set up to disperse the collection.  In one of the auction sales dedicated to the collection beginning on 26 December 1798 ''The Raising of Lazarus'' was bought by the [[London]] banker [[John Julius Angerstein]], apparently at the urging of Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 245–246&lt;/ref&gt; The price was very high at 3,500 guineas.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 28–39&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of its importance it was catalogued as No. 1 in Angerstein's catalogue, and when the Angerstein collection was bought by the British government in 1824 for the foundation of the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] the canvas was now catalogued as NG1,&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 29&lt;/ref&gt; making it officially the first painting to enter the National Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, 242–245&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, for their exhibition of Michelangelo and Sebastiano, the National Gallery gave the painting a new frame, with the bottom copying the original element still in Narbonne Cathedral.  This is in blue and gold, with a [[cartouche]] and Medici devices, and there are two gilded and decorated classical columns at the sides, with an elaborate pediment above.  It is thought possible that the original frame was designed by Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 22 "The Frame..."; [http://theartnewspaper.com/comment/reviews/exhibitions/sebastiano-s-debt-to-michelangelo-made-clear-in-london-show/ "Sebastiano's debt to Michelangelo made clear in London show"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407143953/http://theartnewspaper.com/comment/reviews/exhibitions/sebastiano-s-debt-to-michelangelo-made-clear-in-london-show/ |date=2017-04-07 }} by Donald Lee, 16 March 2017, ''The Art Newspaper'', with photo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration history==
Despite its large size, the painting was originally painted on [[panel painting|wood panels]].  The wood used cannot now be identified, but it seems that, like Raphael's ''Transfiguration'', the panel used a number of vertical boards, where a Venetian painting would be more likely to use horizontal ones.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1770s there was a large campaign of restoration of the paintings in the Orleans Collection, which included transferring this and many others [[Transfer of panel paintings|from panel to canvas]].  According to the National Gallery's detailed account of the restoration history and current condition of the painting: "There can be little doubt that this drastic and dangerous intervention was totally unnecessary".  Much damage to the painting seems to have resulted, and the connoisseur and art theorist [[Richard Payne Knight]] wrote that "those who have only seen it since that fatal operation ... can form but very imperfect notions of what it was before".&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s the artist [[Benjamin West]], the painting's "most vocal admirer", is recorded as restoring and repainting damaged areas on Lazarus' right leg.  It was re-varnished in 1834, 1852, and 1867, and cleaned and re-varnished in 1881, after which a sheet of glass was added to protect it from London's air.  After the painting was evacuated in 1939 to [[Penrhyn Castle]] to protect it from the risk of German bombing in World War II, losses of paint from flaking were noticed, and various attempts in the following years to stabilize the situation failed.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 29&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus (cropped5).jpg|thumb|The central figures]]

In 1958 a major re-structuring of the support was done, aimed at reducing the presence of glue in several layers of canvas underneath the paint.  These layers were contracting, causing the paint to lift and flake. It was thought that there were four canvas layers, of which it was planned to remove three. However, as the work was carried out the "alarming discovery" was made that the layer nearest to the paint was actually not canvas but sheets of paper, badly decayed and partly separated from the ground to the paint.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan was changed to add layers of warm wax-resin in which an inert synthetic textile was fixed, before attaching to a composite board and paper honeycomb solid support. This method would be unlikely to be used today, but did stabilize the flaking.  By 2009 it was tending to flex when the painting is moved, so this is now avoided as far as possible.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

After the new support was added much old varnish was removed, and limited retouching performed.  The extensive work, and condition of the painting, allowed the taking of an unusually large number of paint samples, which have now been re-examined using the more advanced scientific techniques available in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;  This has allowed a good idea of the many complex mixtures of pigments used.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 33–44&lt;/ref&gt;

With the equipment available in 2009, full examination with imaging techniques that allow [[underpainting]] to be seen was not possible.  It was thought that this might shed more light on any contribution by Michelangelo to the underpainting, as it has for the Viterbo ''Pietà'', Sebastiano's first major collaboration with Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;NGTB, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017, imaging had indeed revealed that the present figure of Lazarus, based on Michelangelo's drawing, lay over a different figure, presumably designed by Sebastiano.&lt;ref&gt;M&amp;S, 24, 25, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Translocal Institute for Contemporary Art''' is a transnational research centre based in Budapest that is focused on East European art and ecology and operates across the fields of art history, contemporary art and ecological thought.

It was founded by Drs. [[Maja and Reuben Fowkes]] in 2013, growing out of a long-standing curatorial and research collaboration as translocal.org.

Dedicated to promoting research in the fields of art and ecology and East European art history, Translocal projects involve collaborations with universities and art spaces both in Central Europe and across the continent.

== activities ==

The programs of Translocal Institute include an Experimental Reading Room involving both a series of [[Anthropocene]] Response lectures by prominent theorists and Reading Group seminars dealing with Art and the Anthropocene.http://translocal.org/readingroom/index.html

The River School was based on engaging with the Danube as a transforming natural environment through a series of workshops, symposia, exhibitions and excursions to urban and natural wilderness.

'''W Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture''' ('''W Architecture''') is an international [[architecture]] and [[landscape architecture]] firm based in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. Founded in 1999 by Barbara E. Wilks, the firm is primarily known for its design of major waterfront reclamation projects and collaborative repurposing of public spaces. W Architecture has received substantial coverage in the media for the Edge Park in [[Brooklyn|Williamsburg, Brooklyn]]; a redesign of the West Harlem waterfront; restoration of St. Patrick's Island in [[Calgary]]; and the recent Plaza 33 [[Madison Square Garden]] adjacency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-oasis-in-midtowns-mayhem-1440583200|title=An Oasis in Midtown’s Mayhem|last=Zarate|first=Mozes|date=2015-08-26|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.w-architecture.com/projects/|title=W Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture {{!}} Projects|website=www.w-architecture.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calgarysun.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/03/11/pathways-amphitheatre-and-picnic-areas-in-plans-for-revamped-st-patricks-island|title=Pathways, amphitheatre and picnic areas in plans for revamped St. Patrick's Island|website=Calgary Sun|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
W Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture was formed as a [[Limited liability company|Limited Liability Corporation]] in 1999 by Barbara E. Wilks, who remains founder and principal of the firm. Wilks, a fellow in both the [[American Institute of Architects]] (FAIA) and the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (FASLA),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=W Architecture and Landscape Architecture|title=Reclaiming Waterfronts|date=2016-05-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XsaHTNXAp8|accessdate=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have started the company "to create a design-oriented, multidisciplinary practice focused on urban issues," and to "realign nature and the city.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oroeditions.com/book/structuring-confluence|title=Structuring Confluence {{!}} ORO Editions|website=www.oroeditions.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, W Architecture's projects have increasingly moved toward larger collaborations spanning multiple municipal agencies such as [[New York City Economic Development Corporation|NYCEDC]] and other neighborhood revitalization organizations or economic development councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.w-architecture.com/studio/overview|title=W Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture {{!}} Studio {{!}} Overview|website=www.w-architecture.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

In the 2015 ''Now Urbanism: The Future City is Here'' W Architecture is described as being part of a "new kind of urban activism and urban design," willing to "stimulate social action for sustainable urban design and therefore cooler cities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Now Urbanism: The Future City is Here|last=Hou|first=Jeffrey|last2=Benjamin|first2=Spencer|last3=Way|first3=Thaisa|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=0415717868|location=|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's site plans display a preference for the reintroduction of natural ecological systems rather than ad hoc botanical features. The designs tend to emphasize the resiliency of local flora previously displaced by manmade, commercial manipulation of municipal waterways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Consistent characteristics throughout the firm's portfolio are the utilization of reclaimed local materials, streets and walks that turn into greenways, sloped planes, as well as long angular overlays and subtle dimensional transitioning to introduce water, botanical, and recreational features. Not all the firm's projects are waterfront revitalizations, however, Wilks said, speaking at the 2013 reSITE conference in Prague, she enjoys this kind of work because it's "where natural systems come together with manmade, human systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/76819577|title=reSITE 2013. Small talk: Barbara Wilks • Founder • W Architecture and Landscape Architecture • New York|website=Vimeo|access-date=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilks has also integrated a research component into the firm's projects regarding the advantages of bringing back wetland areas to the New York City coastline. She has advocated for the reintroduction of these areas as a means to buffer storm surge, especially after damages caused by [[Hurricane Sandy]], and to increase access to waterfront areas for people and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=W Architecture and Landscape Architecture|title=Reclaiming Waterfronts|date=2016-05-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XsaHTNXAp8|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Projects ==

=== The Edge Park in Williamsburg ===
New zoning laws passed in accordance with Bloomberg's claiming of the river as "the sixth borough" opened the way for multiple waterfront parks in New York City such as The Edge Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/118192-blog-city-reclaim-its-waterfront-assets-sixth-borough/|title=City Reclaims Waterfront as 'Sixth Borough'|website=WNYC|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating an increase in density and need for waterfront access, the park was deemed a mixed-use site along the East River and completed in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landezine.com/index.php/2011/11/the-edge-park-landscape-architecture/|title=The Edge Park by W-Architecture «  Landscape Architecture Works {{!}} Landezine|website=www.landezine.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilks, the park allows "the city grid and the river's ecosystem to converge, mingle, and clash..." To this end, W Architecture utilized several of its signature elements including: a street that becomes a pedestrian greenway; deep pier structures that make the area seem more like land than traditional piers; a garage area covered by a sloping lawn; and stone that allows for rising and falling waterlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shapedscape.com/projects/the-edge-waterfront-park-design-by-w-architecture-and-landscape-architecture-brooklyn-new-york-city|title=The Edge Park|last=Shapedscape|website=www.shapedscape.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldlandscapearchitect.com/the-edge-park-brooklyn-usa-w-architecture/#.Vzs9WBUrLOZ|title=The Edge Park {{!}} Brooklyn USA {{!}} W Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture -|date=2012-02-07|website=World Landscape Architecture {{!}} Landscape Blog &amp; Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St. Patrick's Island ===
A restoration of the previously existing island park in the Bow River between the East Village and Bridgeland, in Calgary, Alberta, St. Patrick's Island was a collaborative project by W Architecture and Denver-based Civitas.&lt;ref name="calgarysun.com"/&gt; Though already established as a park in the late 19th century, the island had been degrading and was seen by the city as an underused area that had fallen into disrepair. In 2010 Calgary Municipal Land Corporation began an effort to re-establish the park to its current usable area of 31 hectares. Completed in July 2015, the park now features a number of elements that have both made it more usable to the public and have restored its channels and biodiversity. Features include: a "seasonal breach" for wading onto a gravel bar; a sloped grassy knoll which serves as s viewing area for movies, performances, and sledding in the winter; a riparian wetland with a boardwalk across it; amphitheater and water features; and a 23-meter sculpture entitled "Bloom." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Parks/Pages/Locations/Downtown-parks/St.-Patrick's-Island-Park.aspx|title=St. Patrick's Island Park|last=Parks|date=2015-07-23|website=www.calgary.ca|language=en-CAN|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Harlem Piers Park ===

As a major early component of a larger waterfront master plan undertaken for West Harlem, West Harlem Piers Park was completed in the Fall of 2008. The result of efforts by 40 neighborhood groups and coalitions, the park linked the coastline between Riverside Park and Riverbank State Park. As master planners for the project, W Architecture converted a narrow strip of land, essentially a 69,000 sq. ft. parking lot that cut off the community of West Harlem from the waterfront, into a 105,526 sq. ft. park. It features granite benches, sloped lawn areas, repurposed cobblestone in paved areas, and various water access features for kayaking, fishing, and general recreation. As a result of the design a substantial increase in land permeability was achieved and accommodations for fluctuating runoff and storm surges have allowed the park to sustain dramatic weather events since its completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landezine.com/index.php/2014/12/the-west-harlem-piers-park-by-w-architecture/|title=The West Harlem Piers Park by W Architecture «  Landscape Architecture Works {{!}} Landezine|website=www.landezine.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urbanomnibus.net/2009/06/mts-casts-shadow-on-west-harlem-piers-park/|title=MTS casts shadow on West Harlem Piers Park|last=Bose|first=Shumi|date=2009-06-04|website=Urban Omnibus|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4487">[[File:Efrenk Krieger gesamt.jpg|thumb|Setting of the relief]]
The '''Warrior relief of Efrenk''' is a [[rock relief]] from the Greco-Roman period, probably the 2nd century AD, located by the Lamos river (modern day [[Limonlu Çayı|Limonlu]]) in [[Cilicia]], southern [[Turkey]].

== Location ==
[[File:Efrenk Krieger Relief.jpg|thumb|vertical|Warrior relief]]
The relief is about two kilometres north of [[Sömek, Silifke|Sömek]] in the [[Silifke]] district of [[Mersin Province]], about 30 km northeast of the city of Silifke and 20 km north of [[Kızkalesi]], the ancient [[Korykos]]. It is carved into a northwest-facing cliff-face beside a steep path leading down to the Lamos. A ford at this spot connected the ancient settlement of Efrenk on the hill south of the relief with Veyselli on the other side of the Lamos. The route continued on to the settlement at the mouth of the Lamos, [[Antiochia Lamotis]] (now [[Limonlu, Mersin|Limonlu]]). After passing the relief, the route led south past Sömek towards [[Canbazlı]] and [[Olba (ancient city)|Olba]], as well as Korykos and [[Elaiussa Sebaste]] on the Mediterranean coast. The river Lamos is often treated as the border between the ancient regions of Rough Cilicia (''Kilikia Tracheia'') in the west and Flat Cilicia (''Kilikia Pedias'') in the east.

The [[Athena relief of Sömek]] is roughly 600 m to the southeast.

== Description ==
[[File:Efrenk Krieger Schrift.jpg|thumb|vertical|inscription]]
The relief is carved into a vertical cliff-face about 5 m above street level. It is 1.9 m high and depicts a warrior, surrounded by a [[naiskos]]. The legs are badly damaged; the right leg supports his weight, while the left leg hangs free. His raised right arm holds up a spear. On his left side he wears a sword, with his left hand on the grip. He is dressed in a short, belted [[chiton]], with clearly carved drapery. There are traces of white paint on the relief in several spaces - between the head and the right arm, for instance, there are traces of red paint. Paint very rarely survives on Cilician cliff reliefs.

On the left [[pilaster]] there is an inscription at about chest height, which has been resolved as an 8 line inscription:
{{columns
| col1 = {{quote|{{lang-grc|῾Ός δ’ ἂν βά-&lt;br&gt;
λη ἤ ἀ[φ]αι-&lt;br&gt;
ρήση τὸ [ἡ-]&lt;br&gt;
ρῶιον, βά-&lt;br&gt;
λοι αύτ[ον]&lt;br&gt;
ὁ ῾Ήλιος&lt;br&gt;
καὶ ἡ Σελή-&lt;br&gt;
ν[η].}}}}
| col2 = {{quote|{{lang-en|May [[Helios]] and [[Selene]] attack anyone who attacks or diminishes the Heroon.}}}}
}}
[[Josef Keil]] and [[Adolf Wilhelm (philologist)|Adolf Wilhelm]] report the illegible traces of an "actual funerary inscription in the background on the left and right sides of the figure's head." The letter forms date the inscription to the middle of the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], while similarities in posture and clothing led [[Serra Durugönül]] to date the relief to the second century AD when she studied the Cilician cliff reliefs in the 1980s.

== Research history ==
The first short description (with an incomplete reading of the inscription) was published by Edward L. Hicks in 1891 in his ''Inscriptions from Western Cilicia''. The ancient historians Keil and Wilhelm travelled Cilicia in 1891 and 1925, publishing an account in 1931, ''Denkmäler aus dem Rauhen Kilikien'' (Monuments of Rough Cilicia), in which the relief of Efrenk is described with a fuller reading of the inscription. In 1989 Serra Durugönül completed a dissertation, ''Die Felsreliefs im Rauhen Kilikien'' (The Cliff-reliefs of Rough Cilicia), which also discusses the warrior relief.

'''''When Will You Marry?''''' ({{lang-fr|Quand te maries-tu ?}}, {{lang-ty|Nafea faa ipoipo}}) is an oil painting from 1892 by the French [[Post-Impressionist]] artist [[Paul Gauguin]]. On loan to the [[Kunstmuseum Basel|Kunstmuseum]] in [[Basel]], Switzerland for nearly a half-century, it was sold privately by the family of [[Rudolf Staechelin]] to [[Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani|Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad Al-Thani]], in February 2015 for close to US $210 million (£155 million), [[List of most expensive paintings|one of the highest prices ever paid for a work of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/arts/design/gauguin-painting-is-said-to-fetch-nearly-300-million.html|title=Gauguin Painting Is Said to Fetch Nearly $300 Million|last1=Reyburn|first1=Scott|last2=Carvajal|first2=Doreen|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31183733 |title=Gauguin painting breaks sale record at nearly $300m |accessdate=7 February 2015 |publisher=BBC News |date=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cascone|first1=Sarah|title=Does Qatar's $300 Million Paul Gauguin Acquisition Hide A Dark Secret?|url=http://news.artnet.com/market/does-qatars-300-million-paul-gauguin-acquisition-hide-a-dark-secret-246607|website=news.artnet.com|publisher=[[artnet]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WE1EuSmB|archivedate=10 February 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was on exhibition at the [[Beyeler Foundation|Fondation Beyeler]], [[Riehen]], until 28 June 2015.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Gauguin at Fondation Beyeler|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vernissagetv/paul-gauguin-at-fondation_b_6640578.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gauguin travelled to [[Tahiti]] for the first time in 1891. His hope was to find "an edenic paradise where he could create pure, [[tribal art|'primitive' art]]",&lt;ref name="GI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.galleryintell.com/artex/nafea-fas-ipoipo-will-marry-paul-gauguin/ | title=Nafea fas ipoipo (When will you marry) by Paul Gauguin | work=galleryIntell | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the [[primitivism|primitivist]] faux works being turned out by painters in [[France]]. Upon arrival, he found that Tahiti was not as he imagined it: it had been colonised in the 18th century, and at least two-thirds of the indigenous people of the island had been killed by diseases brought by Europeans.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graves|first1=Jen|title=You May Be Infected Already|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/you-may-be-infected-already/Content?oid=12587203|website=thestranger.com|publisher=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WCGlQDkJ|archivedate=8 February 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Primitive" culture had been wiped out. Despite this, he painted many pictures of native women: nude, dressed in traditional Tahitian clothes, and dressed in Western-style dresses, as is the rear figure in ''When Will You Marry?''.

[[File:Gauguin - Kauerndes Mädchen von Tahiti - 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Full-scale working study, charcoal and pastel, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]

The front and middle ground are built up in areas of green, yellow and blue. A traditionally dressed young woman has settled on the threshold between the front and middle ground. Richard Field suggests the white ''[[tiare]]'' flower behind her left ear indicates she is seeking a husband.&lt;ref name = Field&gt;Field pp. 132-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Stuckey&gt;Stuckey pp. 263-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Maurer&gt;Maurer {{Google books|wf_PoXKhggkC|title=The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: The Thought and Art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin|page=147|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The custom is alluded to in a 1914 letter from [[Rupert Brooke]] to [[Cathleen Nesbitt]]. According to Brooke, the flower worn at the left ear meant the wearer had found a sweetheart. Brooke spent some months in the South Seas 1913-14 and took a native lover in Tahiti.&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Potter|first1=Caroline|title=This Side of Paradise: Rupert Brooke and the South Seas|url=http://asketchofthepast.com/2014/08/08/this-side-of-paradise-rupert-brooke-and-the-south-seas/|website=asketchofthepast.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WEsBYLnl|archivedate=10 February 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Behind her a second figure in a high-necked Western-style dress sits erectly. Field thought her gesture derives from Buddhist art.&lt;ref name = Field/&gt; Naomi E. Maurer subsequently identified it as a  ''[[mudra]]'' denoting threatening or warning.&lt;ref name= "Maurer"/&gt; The front woman stretches herself, her facial features stylized and simplified. Field thought her pose had a Japanese precedent, Charles F. Stuckey suggests Delacroix's ''[[Women of Algiers]]''.&lt;ref name= Stuckey/&gt;{{efn|Stuckey says Gauguin was evidently fascinated by the pose and, beside the full-scale working drawing, incorporated it in ''Where Are You Going?'' (W 478 and W 501), two watercolors, an oil sketch (W 445) as well as a sketchbook study.

}} The rear female figure is flush with the yellow-blue area. Her face is painted with individual features and represents the centre of the image. The pink colour of her dress is clearly distinct from the other colours. At the bottom right is the inscription "NAFEA Faa ipoipo" (''When will you marry''). Gauguin commonly inscribed his paintings in [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] at this time: he was fascinated by the language, though never advanced beyond its rudiments.&lt;ref name= "Maurer"/&gt;

Art historian [[Nancy Mowll Mathews]] wrote that Gauguin "portrayed the [Tahitian] natives as living only to sing and to make love. That's how he got the money from his friends and raised the public's interest in his adventure. But, of course, he knew the truth, which was that Tahiti was an unremarkable island with an international, westernised community".&lt;ref name="7feb3"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/07/paul-gauguins-when-will-you-marry-becomes-most-expensive-artwork-ever | title=Paul Gauguin's When Will You Marry? becomes most expensive artwork ever | work=The Guardian | date=7 February 2015 | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings of Tahitians, including ''When Will You Marry?'', were met with relative indifference when Gauguin returned to France, his 1893 [[Durand-Ruel]] exhibition only a limited success generating some favourable reviews but little by way of sales. Gauguin placed this painting on [[consignment]] at the exhibition at a price of 1,500 francs, the highest price he assigned and shared by only one other painting, but had no takers.&lt;ref name= Stuckey/&gt; Staechelin eventually purchased it at the ''Maison Moos'' gallery in Geneva in 1917.

A pencil sketch of the painting's central figure was uncovered and authenticated in a 2017 episode of ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/2017/gauguin-sketch-dismissed-as-a-fake-is-valued-at-200-000-after-fake-or-fortune-investigation/ Gauguin sketch dismissed as a fake is valued at £200,000 after ''Fake or Fortune?'' investigation], ''Antiques Trade Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's International Art Club''', briefly known as the '''Paris International Art Club''', was founded in Paris in 1900. The club was intended to "promote contacts between women artists of all nations and to arrange exhibitions of their work",&lt;ref name=geddes/&gt; and until it dissolved in 1976 it provided a way for women to exhibit their art work. The first exhibition of the club was held in Paris in 1900,&lt;ref name=greenan/&gt; and another at the [[Grafton Galleries]] in London in the same year. Members of the club included [[Elizabeth Frink]], [[Gwen John]] and [[Orovida Pissarro]].&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt;

==History==
The Paris International Art Club was founded in Paris in 1900, and changed its name to the Women's International Art Club in the same year. The first exhibition of the club was held at the Grafton Galleries in [[Bond Street]], London, in 1900, and was followed by a second show at the same gallery in March and April 1901. Annual exhibitions were held in London until the club dissolved in 1976. Some smaller exhibitions were also held in other parts of Britain and overseas. The membership of the club was international, and there were sections in France, Greece, Holland, Italy and the United States.

The club is thought to have dissolved in 1976,&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt;&lt;ref name=speck/&gt; but held an exhibition at [[Greenwich]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=wiac1977/&gt;

==Exhibitors==

The early annual exhibitions were held at the Grafton Galleries. Later the [[Goupil Gallery]] was used, and then the galleries of the [[Royal Society of British Artists]]. Initially only members of the club could participate in the exhibitions; the club had a limit of 150 members. From 1921, non-members could, for a fee, exhibit one picture each. These exhibitions helped to make up for the lack of opportunity for women to exhibit at mainstream venues such as the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name=kristen/&gt;

[[Eileen Agar]], [[Anthea Alley]], [[Gwen Barnard]], [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]], [[Elinor Bellingham-Smith]], [[Ithell Colquhoun]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Elisabeth Frink]], [[Gwen John]], [[Stanisława de Karłowska]], Dame [[Laura Knight]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Orovida Pissarro]], [[Anne Redpath]] and Dame [[Ethel Walker]] were among those who exhibited.&lt;ref name=greenan/&gt;&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt;&lt;ref name=speck/&gt;&lt;ref name=artbiogs/&gt; A full list of exhibitors from 1900 to 1966 was published in 1981.&lt;ref name=costello/&gt;

[[File:Juengling vom Magdalensberg.jpg|thumb|upright|Copy in the collection of the [[Landesmuseum Kärnten]] at Magdalensberg]]
The '''Youth of Magdalensberg''' was an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[bronze]] [[statue]] dating to the first century B.C., missing since approximately 1810 and now presumed lost, that was discovered in 1502 at the [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]n mountain [[Magdalensberg]], once a major late Celtic and early Roman city of [[Noricum]]. It is known today primarily from a sixteenth-century [[Molding (process)|cast]] now held at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]] (Inventory # VI 1), which until 1986 was mistakenly regarded as the original.

Until the twentieth century, the statue was also known as the ''Youth of Helenenberg''&lt;ref&gt;Werner Fantur, ''Kärnten im Mosaik der Erde''. Verlag Carinthia, Klagenfurt 1974, pp. 47–52 Chapter "Der Jüngling vom Helenenberg"&lt;/ref&gt; from the old name for Magdalensberg.&lt;ref&gt;Gernot Piccottini, ''Die besten Skulpturen der Austria Romana'', in Wolbert Ebner (Ed.), ''Das ist Kärnten'', 5. Aufl. Klagenfurt 2003, pp. 18–19. {{ISBN|3-85391-214-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth is the only ancient full-size bronze statue known from the [[Eastern Alps|Eastern Alpine region]] and therefore is of great significance in Austria.

== Description ==
The bronze statue shows a naked [[Ephebos | youth]] standing still, of about life size (1.85 metres high, 6'1"). In its [[contrapposto]] stance, the right leg is load-bearing, while the left is free, barely touching the ground with its toes. The left arm hangs free, the right hand is held out at shoulder height. The head is turned slightly to the right, following the gesture of the right hand.

An inscription is incised on the right thigh:&lt;ref name="cil4815"&gt;{{CIL|3|4815}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''A[ulus] Poblicius D[ecimi] l[ibertus] Antio[cus]''
:''Ti[berius] Barbius Q[uinti] P[ublii] l[ibertus] Tiber[inus or -ianus]''
:(A[ulus] Poblicus Antio[chus], fr[eedman] of D[ecimus]; Ti[berius] Barbius Tiber[inus or ianus], fr[eedman] of Q[uintus] P[ublius].)
This is the dedication of two freedmen, who were probably active in the [[City on the Magdalensberg]] as merchants.

A gilt round shield found together with the Youth, which is now lost, bore this inscription:&lt;ref name="cil4815"/&gt;
:''M. Gallicinus Vindili f[ilius] L[ucius] Barb[ius] L[ucii] l[ibertus] Philoterus pr[ocurator] / Craxsantus / Barbi[i] P[ublii] s[ervus].''
:(M[arcus] Gallicinus, son of Vindilus; L[ucius] Barb[ius] Philoterus, fr[eedman] of L[ucius]; Craxsantus, s[lave] of Barbi[us] P[ublius])
The donors of the shield, therefore were a free Celt, a freedman of the North Italian ''Gens Barbia'' and local Celtic slave of the same family. One of the two donors of the Youth itself was also from this family.

== Significance ==
An identification as the image of a god cannot be made on the basis of the statue itself or the inscription. Therefore, there are a variety of interpretations. These range from athlete, through torchbearer (''Lychnophoros''), to various divinites. The round shield offers no further help.

Recent interpretations see the statue as the cult statue of a Celtic [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] from the sanctuary on the mountaintop, or as a priest of [[Noreia (goddess)|Noreia]], or as part of a statue group dedicated to Noreia, or as a statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] which stood in the town's [[Forum (Roman)|forum]].

== Classification ==
The statue is an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] work of Roman idealised sculpture and was made in the first half of the first century BC. Its model was the Greek sculptures of the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Probably it is a copy of a work from the school of [[Polykleitos]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto H. Urban: ''Der lange Weg zur Geschichte. Die Urgeschichte Österreichs.'' (= Österreichische Geschichte bis 15. v. Chr.). Ueberreuter Verlag, Wien 2003, p. 364, {{ISBN|3-8000-3969-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance ==
The statue was found in 1502 by a farmer beside the river on a terrace south of the mountaintop. It came into the possession of [[Matthäus Lang von Wellenburg]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gurk|Bishop of Gurk]] and a [[Humanism|humanist]] soon afterward. He took it with him to [[Salzburg]] in 1519 when he became [[Archbishop of Salzburg]]. Until the 1980s it was assumed that the statue had come from Salzburg to [[Vienna]] in 1806 following the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]]. However, investigations of the casting technique and scientific analysis of the metal in 1986 led to the realisation that the statue in Vienna is a cast made in the sixteenth century.

The fate of the original is not known with certainty. As documents of the [[Salzburg cathedral chapter]] reveal, it came into the possession of Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1551, after which a cast had been made, which remained in Salzburg and came to Vienna in 1806. The original was moved to [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], where it is attested in the gardens of the [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]] in 1662 and 1786. From the beginning of the nineteenth century, the location of the original statue is unknown.

Two illustrations of the original are known. The first comes from [[Peter Apian]] and Bartholemew Amand's ''Inscriptiones Sacrosanctae Vetustatis'' of 1534, the other from a [[fresco]] of [[Hans Bocksberger der Ältere]] in the chapel aisle of the [[Landshut Residence]] from 1542.
