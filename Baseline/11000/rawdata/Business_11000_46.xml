      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14760">{{Insolvency}}
The '''anti-deprivation rule''' (also known as '''fraud upon the bankruptcy law''') is a principle applied by the courts in [[common law]] jurisdictions (other than the [[United States]]){{efn|which has its own statutory rules barring ''[[ipso facto]]'' clauses in the event of bankruptcy}} in which, according to [[George Mellish|Mellish LJ]] in ''[[Re Jeavons, ex parte Mackay]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1873) LR 8 Ch App 643&lt;/ref&gt; "a person cannot make it a part of his [[contract]] that, in the event of [[bankruptcy]], he is then to get some additional advantage which prevents the property being distributed under the bankruptcy laws." [[William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley|Wood VC]] had earlier observed{{efn|relying on {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Higinbotham v Holme|link=|reporter=ER|year=1812|num=249|volume=34|firstpage=451|parallelcite=19 Ves Jun 88|date=6 May 1812|courtname=|juris=}}}} that "the law is too clearly settled to admit of a shadow of doubt that no person possessed of property can reserve that property to himself until he shall become bankrupt, and then provide that, in the event of his becoming bankrupt, it shall pass to another and not to his creditors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Whitmore v Mason|link=|reporter=ER|year=1861|num=960|volume=70|firstpage=1031|pinpoint=|parallelcite=2 J&amp;H 204|date=18 November 1861|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==General scheme==
It arises from the general principle (known as the "rule against repugnancy" in [[property law]]) that a grantor may not derogate from his own grant by giving an absolute interest in an asset and then providing for it to be clawed back otherwise than for fair value in stated eventualities, including (but not limited to) bankruptcy and winding up.{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=218}} This is considered to consist of several branches:

{{Tree list}}
* {{Tree list/final branch}} General principle
** Anti-deprivation rule
*** "Contracting out" rule{{sfn|Worthington|2010|p=32}}
*** {{Tree list/final branch}} "Insolvency-triggered deprivation" rule{{sfn|Worthington|2010|p=33}}
** {{Tree list/final branch}} ''[[Pari passu]]'' rule{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=218}}
{{Tree list/end}}

''[[Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc]]'' observed that the general principle consists of two subrules {{emdash}} the anti-deprivation rule and the ''[[pari passu]]'' rule, which are addressed to different mischiefs&lt;ref name=Belmont&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Belmont Park Investments PTY Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd &amp; Anor|link=Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd|court=UKSC|year=2011|num=38|parallelcite= [2012] 1 AC 383|pinpoint=par. 1|date=27 July 2011|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{emdash}} and held that, in borderline cases, a commercially sensible transaction entered into in good faith should not be held to infringe the first rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Belmont Park'', par. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the two rules was expanded upon later by [[Andrew Longmore|Longmore LJ]] in ''[[Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc]]'':&lt;ref name=Lomas&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc]] |court=EWCA |year=2012 |num=419 |date={{date|2012-04-03}}|courtname=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
96. The relationship between the anti-deprivation principle and the ''pari passu'' rule is both dependant and autonomous. The former is concerned with contractual arrangements which have the effect of depriving the bankrupt estate of property which would otherwise have formed part of it. The ''pari passu'' rule governs the distribution of assets within the estate following the event of bankruptcy. It therefore invalidates arrangements under which a creditor receives more than his proper share of the available assets or where ... debts due to the company on liquidation were to be dealt with other than in accordance with the statutory regime.&lt;ref&gt;''Lomas'', at para 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 2012, the Chancery Division, in assessing the [[Administration (British football)#Football creditors rule|football creditors rule]], held that it was valid and did not violate either the anti-deprivation rule or the ''pari passu'' rule. In his judgment, [[David Richards (judge)|Richards J]], relying on ''Belmont Park'', declared:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pari passu rule on insolvency clarified and limited|url = http://www.linklaters.com/pdfs/mkt/london/Football_creditor_rule.pdf|publisher = [[Linklaters]]|date = 29 May 2012}}, discussing {{cite BAILII|litigants=  HM Revenue and Customs v The Football League Ltd &amp; Anor|link=|court=EWHC|division=Ch|year=2012|num=1372|parallelcite=|para=73{{endash}}104|date=25 May 2012|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* the anti-deprivation rule applies from the commencement of [[Administration (law)|administration]]
:* the ''pari passu'' principle comes into play only if the purpose of the insolvency procedure is to effect a distribution
:* if a transaction has the effect of depriving a company of an asset in order to distribute it among some only of the creditors otherwise eligible to participate in a distribution, it offends both principles
:* if the deprivation occurs on the company going into administration, only the anti-deprivation principle will be engaged

===Aspects of the rule===

With respect to the anti-deprivation rule, [[Nicholas Patten|Patten LJ]] has observed that "the individual bankrupt or insolvent company may not contract at any time, either before or after the making of the bankruptcy or winding-up order, for its property subsisting at that date to be disposed of or dealt with otherwise than in accordance with the statute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd &amp; Anor|link=|court=EWHC|division=Ch|year=2009|num=1912|parallelcite= [2010] Ch 347 |pinpoint=par. 113|date=28 July 2009|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that this rule can therefore be subdivided into two branches: the "insolvency-triggered deprivation" rule looks to disposals, and the "contracting out" rule to dealings.{{sfn|Worthington|2011|p=27}} These subrules target two distinct strategies that a debtor might pursue:{{sfn|Worthington|2011|p=27}}

#it could favour a nominated  party on insolvency could either provide for a specific insolvency-triggered deprivation of its assets in favour of that party (being assets that would otherwise be available for distribution on the debtor’s insolvency), or
#it could agree to more attractive contractual set-offs or netting arrangements, thus avoiding the distribution rules that would otherwise apply to the debtor’s property.

All these anti-avoidance rules are, however, subject to the very large exception that creditors remain able to jump up the priority queue, through the creation of a [[security interest]].

===Scope of application===
Certain types of arrangements are not considered to offend the rule:

:* limited and determinable interests and licences{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=220}}
:* preemption provisions in [[articles of association]]{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=223}}
:* provision for termination on winding up of interest annexed to membership status{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=223}}

Other types are normally considered to offend:

:* provision for divestment of ownership of an asset on winding up{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=225}}
:* vesting clauses in building contracts (which vest the builder's materials in the building's owner upon the builder's liquidation){{sfn|Goode|2011|p=226}}
:* sale with provision for retransfer on winding up (where the seller did not reserve title until payment){{sfn|Goode|2011|p=226}}
:* increase in a company's contractual obligation on winding up{{sfn|Goode|2011|p=226}}

==Contracting out==
This case arises infrequently, but it did so notably in ''[[British Eagle International Air Lines Ltd v Compaigne Nationale Air France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1975] 1 WLR 758&lt;/ref&gt; Several principles arise from it:{{sfn|Worthington|2010|pp=32{{endash}}33}}

#It is irrelevant that the parties did not intend to achieve an insolvency advantage, or that the arrangement is long-standing, or has always represented the relationship between the parties, or is a static arrangement involving no insolvency trigger which changes the arrangement between the parties. 
#It is crucial that the company is in insolvency proceedings, and that it has assets that need to be dealt with under those proceedings. What is then important is the effect of the impugned arrangement on the treatment of the insolvent’s assets on its insolvency.
#If the impugned arrangement does not determine the distribution of the insolvent’s assets, but defines the very asset which is the subject of the insolvency proceedings, then the transaction is generally safe.

In ''Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc''&lt;ref name=Lomas /&gt; it was argued that certain provisions in standard form [[ISDA Master Agreement]] might offend against the rule; specifically that if an Event of Default (as defined) suspended the right of the Defaulting Party to receive payment indefinitely, then that would mean that if the Non-Defaulting Party went into [[liquidation]], the operating effect of the provision was to deprive the company's creditors of assets as a consequence of it going into liquidation.  However the Court of Appeal considered the principles outlined in ''Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd'',&lt;ref name=Belmont /&gt; and held that "If this is the touchstone then it is difficult to see how Section 2(a)(iii) of the Master Agreement can be said to offend against the anti-deprivation principle. ... There is no suggestion that it was formulated in order to avoid the effect of any insolvency law or to give the non-defaulting party a greater or disproportionate return as a creditor of the bankrupt estate."&lt;ref&gt;''Lomas'', at paragraph 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insolvency deprivation==
This subrule has been described by [[Henry Cotton (judge)|Cotton LJ]] as holding that "there cannot be a valid contract that a man's property shall remain his until his bankruptcy, and on the happening of that event shall go over to someone else, and be taken away from his creditors."&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Jay, In re Harrison'' (1880) 14 Ch D 19, at 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered to be a true anti-deprivation rule,{{sfn|Worthington|2010|p=33}} and several issues arise from it:{{sfn|Worthington|2010|pp=33{{endash}}35}}

#It is legitimate for courts to intervene on the grounds of public policy, even in areas primarily governed by statute.
#If the arrangement breaches the insolvency-deprivation rule, then it is void.
#the party’s insolvency must trigger the deprivation. The rule does not catch arrangements which prevent property ever reaching the insolvent’s hands{{efn|Such as with effective [[retention of title]] agreements, [[Quistclose trust]]s, or [[purchase money security interest]]s.}} Equally, deprivations caused by some other event – any other event – are not touched by this rule{{efn|In particular, deprivations caused by pre-insolvency disposal of assets, or by deprivation or forfeiture clauses that are not triggered by the party’s own insolvency, are all untouched by the insolvency-deprivation rule, as in ''Newitt'' (deprivation triggered by default)&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Newitt, re Garrud'' (1880) 16 Ch D 522&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Detmold'' (deprivation triggered by alienation).&lt;ref&gt;''In re Detmold'' (1889) 40 Ch D 585&lt;/ref&gt;}}
#The rule only concerns arrangements entered into by the insolvent.
#It is irrelevant that the asset being deprived was acquired by way of gift rather than for valuable consideration.
#As in the "contracting out" cases, it is irrelevant that the provision was "always a term of the contract", rather than a post-acquisition initiative that effected a deprivation triggered by insolvency. 

The Canadian courts have extended this further, declaring that termination clauses that are triggered where non-payment of obligations is indirectly caused by the debtor’s insolvency should be deemed to have been caused by the insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Beware Contractual Provisions triggered (even indirectly) by a Party’s Insolvency|author = Anthony Alexander|url = http://www.canadianappeals.com/2013/03/06/the-second-opinion-beware-contractual-provisions-triggered-by-a-partys-insolvency/|date = 2013-06-06|publisher = [[McCarthy Tétrault]]|accessdate = 2013-11-04}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Aircell Communications Inc. v.

'''Blue Coat Systems''' was a company that provided hardware, software, and services designed for cybersecurity and network management. In 2016, it was acquired by and folded into [[Symantec]].

The company was known as '''CacheFlow''' until 2002.

The company had "a broad security portfolio including hardware, software and services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2894743/cloud-security/blue-coat-systems-gets-flipped-for-2-4-billion.html | last=Greene | first=Tim | title=Blue Coat Systems gets flipped for $2.4 billion | website=Network World | date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was best known for web gateway appliances that scan internet traffic for security threats, authenticate users and manage encrypted traffic, as well as products to monitor and filter employee internet activity.&lt;ref name=syriauses/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-10/bain-capital-buys-blue-coat-for-2-4-billion-from-thoma-bravo | last=Willmer | first=Sabrina | last2=Banerjee | first2=Devin | title=Bain to Buy Blue Coat for $2.4 Billion From Thoma Bravo | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also produced consumer products, such as parental control software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2347737,00.asp | last=Rubenking | first=Neil J. | title=K9 Web Protection 4.0 | work=[[PC Magazine]] | date=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's products were initially sold to [[internet service providers]], but later products were intended for large companies.&lt;ref name=CAIALevelI/&gt;

==History==
In March 1996, the company was founded as CacheFlow, Inc. in [[Redmond, Washington]] by Michael Malcolm, a computer scientist and professor at the [[University of Waterloo]], Joe Pruskowski, and Doug Crow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/1996/12/02/story8.html | title=Cacheflow lands $5 million to build Internet hardware | first=M. Sharon | last=Baker | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=December 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company initially raised $1 million in [[seed money]] from a dozen [[angel investor]]s.&lt;ref name=CAIALevelI/&gt;&lt;ref name=gale&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-magazines/blue-coat-systems-inc | title=Blue Coat Systems | encyclopedia=International Directory of Company Histories | publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] | date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's goal was to develop appliances that would increase website speed by storing frequently accessed web data in the [[Cache (computing)|cache]].&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=lifecycle&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB951172706627083368 | title=CacheFlow: The Life Cycle Of a Venture-Capital Deal | first=Suzanne | last=McGee | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=February 22, 2000}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neweconomy&gt;{{cite book | last=Bodde | first=D.L. | title=The Intentional Entrepreneur: Bringing Technology and Engineering to the Real New Economy | publisher=M.E.

In October 1996, [[Benchmark Capital]] purchased 25% of the company for $2.8 million, equivalent to a price of 87.5 cents per share.&lt;ref name=CAIALevelI/&gt; By February 1997, the company had raised $5.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/1997/02/17/daily13.html | title=CacheFlow gains $5.1 million in venture capital | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=February 19, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997, [[U.S. Venture Partners]] acquired 17% of the company for $6 million.&lt;ref name=CAIALevelI/&gt;

In 1997, the company moved its headquarters to [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name=everything&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/0131/064.html | title=First, Change Everything | first=Chana R. | last=Schoenberger | work=[[Forbes]] | date=January 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1998, the company released its first product, the CacheFlow 1000. It cached website objects that users were likely to use repeatedly, to increase load speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 | title=Hardware software combination speeds posting to desktop | work=[[Network World]] | date=January 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1999, the CacheOS operating system was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Q8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 | title=Stat-ups Tout A Better Web | first1=Carolyn Duffy | last1=Marsan | first2=Deni | last2=Connor | work=[[Network World]] | date=October 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 1998, the company released the CacheFlow 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA83 | title=CacheFlow 100 release retains active caching capabilities | first=David | last=Pendery | work=[[Infoworld]] | date=April 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1998, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company made its first sales, earning just $809,000 over three months, and investors started pushing for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO).&lt;ref name=lifecycle/&gt;&lt;ref name=neweconomy/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAIALevelI/&gt;

In March 1999, Technology Crossover Ventures invested $8.7 million for 7% of the company, equivalent to a price of $4.575 per share.&lt;ref name=CAIALevelI&gt;{{cite book | last=Association | first=C. | last2=Anson | first2=M.J.P. | title=CAIA Level I: An Introduction to Core Topics in Alternative Investments | publisher=Wiley | series=Wiley Finance | isbn=978-0-470-55724-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hqgyll9MgkcC&amp;pg=PA415 | year=2009 | page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, the company released the CacheFlow 500, with a list price of $9,995.&lt;ref name=road&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AagRWVFS0rYC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154 | title=Road to the Internet | first=Jeffrey G. | last=Wit | work=[[PC Magazine]] | date=September 21, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competitive review of caching appliances in ''PC Magazine'' gave the CacheFlow 500 Editor's Choice. The editor said it had "excellent performance", a "plug-and-go" setup, and "good management tools. The review noted that its "most noteworthy features" were its DNS caching and object pipelining techniques, which allowed page data to be delivered in parallel, rather than sequential, streams.&lt;ref name=road/&gt;

In early November 1999, [[Marc Andreessen]] invested $3.1 million in shares, at a price of $11.04 per share.&lt;ref name=CAIALevelI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/1999/11/01/daily19.html | title=Andreessen invests in CacheFlow | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=November 3, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 1999, during the peak of the [[dot-com bubble]], the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]], raising $132 million. Shares rose fivefold on its first day of trading. However, the company was not profitable and its product was unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB943030720218948896 | title=CacheFlow Shares Surge More Than Fivefold in Debut | first=Khanh T.L. | last=Tran | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=November 22, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the company had $3.6 million in revenue and $6.6 million in losses in the prior 3 months.&lt;ref name=CAIALevelI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/cacheflow-jumps-fivefold-following-ipo/ | title=CacheFlow jumps fivefold following IPO | first=DAWN | last=KAWAMOTO | work=[[CNet]] | date=November 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ipo-report-cacheflow-soars-more-than-400-percent-in-strong-ipo-day | title=CacheFlow soars more than 400 percent in strong IPO day | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=November 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/1999/11/19/mu4.html | title=Caching in on IPO-mania | first=Nicole | last=Koffey | work=[[Forbes]] | date=November 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had initially hoped to price is shares at $11-13 each and raise $50 million but due to strong demand, it priced its shares at $26 each. One month later, they traded as high as $182 each.&lt;ref name=everything/&gt;

In 1999, [[board of directors]] member Andrew Rachleff of [[Benchmark Capital]], an investor, brought in [[Brian NeSmith]], who had just sold his company, [[Ipsilon Networks]], to [[Nokia]] for $120 million, as chief executive officer.&lt;ref name=everything/&gt;

In 2000, it introduced the CacheFlow Server Accelerator product family, which offloads content delivery tasks from web servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/cacheflow-launches-new-server-family/28421 | title=CacheFlow launches new server family | first=Cindy | last=Steinman | work=IT World Canada | date=October 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests by ''[[Network World]]'' found the Server Accelerator 725 increased website load speed eight-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 | title=CacheFlow Revs up Server-Side Web Cache | first1=Betsy | last1=Yocom | first2=Uwe | last2=Bilger | first3=Kevin | last3=Brown | work=[[Network World]] | date=April 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CacheFlow Client Accelerator 600 product family was also introduced in 2000. It was the company's first product family for corporate networks, caching Web or multimedia content directly on the corporate network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.itworld.com/article/2782936/networking/cacheflow-devices-aim-at-reducing-wan-costs.html | title=CacheFlow devices aim at reducing WAN costs | newspaper=[[International Data Group]] | date=January 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenues grew from $7 million in 1998, to $29 million in 1999 and $97 million in 2001. It already had 25% of the overall market for caching and 35% of the caching appliance market &lt;ref name=gale/&gt; and was still not profitable.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;

In March 2000, the company integrated its products with those of [[Akamai Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/03/28/technology/akamai/ | title=Akamai, CacheFlow team | first=Michele | last=Masterson | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=March 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, the company updated CacheFlow OS to cache multimedia content, including RealNetworks' RealSystem, Microsoft's Windows Media and Apple's Quicktime formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 | title=CacheFlow adds multimedia features | last=Jacobs | first=April | work=[[Network World]] | date=May 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2000, the company acquired Springbank Networks, an internet device company, for $180 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/business/company-news-cacheflow-buys-springbank-for-180-million.html | title=COMPANY NEWS; CACHEFLOW BUYS SPRINGBANK FOR $180 MILLION | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB960301974136315981 | title=CacheFlow Buys Springback For $180 Million in Stock | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=June 6, 2000}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, the company acquired Entera, a digital content streaming company, for $440 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/eastbay/stories/2000/12/18/daily5.html | title=Entera buyout complete | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=December 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.informationweek.com/cacheflow-agrees-to-buy-entera/d/d-id/1009293 | title=CacheFlow Agrees To Buy Entera | work=[[Information Week]] | date=October 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, new features specifically for streaming media were introduced under the name "cIQ".&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2582330/it-outsourcing/loudcloud--cacheflow-enhance-hosting-performance.html | last=Evans | first=James | title=Loudcloud, CacheFlow enhance hosting performance | work=[[Computerworld]] | date=May 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/cacheflow-drives-intelligence-to-the-edge-with-content-delivery-offering/30124 | title=CacheFlow drives intelligence to the edge with content delivery offering | work=[[International Data Group]] | date=March 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2001, the company was renamed to Blue Coat Systems to focus on security appliances and simultaneously released the SG800. The appliance sat behind corporate firewalls to filter website traffic for [[Computer virus|viruses]], [[Computer worm|worms]] and other [[malware|harmful software]]. It had a custom operating system called Security Gateway and provided many of its security features through partners, like Symantec and Trend Micro.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=networkworld&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT7 | title=CacheFlow Becomes Blue Coat | first=Jennifer | last=Mears | work=[[Network World]] | date=August 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/SG800-Inspects-Port-80-Web-Traffic | title=SG800 Inspects Port 80 Web Traffic | first=Cameron | last=Sturdevant | work=[[eWeek]] | date=September 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company lost 97% of its value from October 2000 to March 2001 as the [[dot-com bubble]] burst. The company continued to lose money.&lt;ref name=networkworld/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/ipo-update-cacheflow-rockets-up-427-percent/ | title=IPO Update: CacheFlow rockets up 427 percent | work=[[CNET]] | date=November 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;By 2002, several competing internet caching companies had abandoned the market, due to slow adoption of caching technology and most of CacheFlow's revenues came from its IT security products.&lt;ref name=networkworld/&gt;

In April 2002, the company launched fifth version of its operating system. The Security Gateway 600/6000 Series was the company's newest product family. It had a range of security features, such as authentication, internet use policies, virus scanning, content filtering, and bandwidth restrictions for streaming video applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://business.highbeam.com/4113/article-1G1-84734523/cacheflow-security-gateway-aint-your-pappy-cache |  title=Cacheflow security gateway aint' your pappy's cache | last=MacVittie | first=Lori | work=Network Computing | date=April 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2002, the company started adding IT security features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240047110/CacheFlow-wears-a-new-coat | title=CacheFlow wears a new coat | work=[[Computer Weekly]] | date=August 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in August 2002, the company changed its name to Blue Coat Systems. The new name was intended to evoke the image of a police officer or guard.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; It then focusing on internet security appliances.&lt;ref name=neweconomy/&gt;&lt;ref name=networkworld/&gt; Its products were primarily used to control, monitor and secure internet use by employees. For example, a company could limit employee access to online gaming and video streaming, as well as scan attachments for viruses. 

The shift in focus was followed by smaller losses and revenues at first&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=neweconomy/&gt; and eventually company growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/60-second-business-break/ci_27684731/biz-break-blue-coat-systems-sells-2-4b | title=Biz Break: Blue Coat Systems sells for $2.4B as security sector stays hot | last=Owens | first=Jeremy C. | work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] | date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losses in 2002 after the rename were $247 million, about half of the prior year's losses.

By 2003, the company had 250 employees and $150 million in annual revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/blue-coat-surf-control-to-security/ | first=Bob | last=Tarzey | title=Blue Coat, from Surf Control to Riding the Security Wave | website=Infosecurity Magazine | date=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, 3 new products were introduced for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with 50, 100 or 250 users in bundles with [[Websense]];  and [[Secure Computing]], although the Websense partnership was later at least partially dismantled and the two vendors were "slinging mud at each other" in the VAR community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.crn.com/news/security/187900128/blue-coat-websense-battle-for-partners.htm/ | title=Blue Coat, Websense Battle for Partners | first=Kevin | last=McLaughlin | work=[[CRN (magazine)|CRN]] | date=May 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/18829870/blue-coat-eyes-small-biz.htm | title=Blue Coat eyes small biz | last=Savage | first=Marcia | work=[[CRN (magazine)|CRN]] | date=March 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a second generation of the ProxySG product family, which added security features for instant messaging. A review in ''[[eWeek]]'' said the new ProxySG line was effective and easy to deploy, but the ongoing maintenance fees were expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eweek.com/it-management/blue-coat-internet-appliance-fits-snugly | title=Blue Coat Internet Appliance Fits Snugly | last=Sturdevant | first=Cameron | work=[[eWeek]] | date=September 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, the company acquired Cerberian, a URL filtering company, for $17.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Blue-Coat-to-Buy-URL-Filtering-Company | title=Blue Coat to Buy URL Filtering Company  | first=Dennis | last=Fisher | work=[[eWeek]] | date=July 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.scmagazine.com/blue-coat-buys-cerberian/article/549472/ | title=Blue Coat Buys Cerberian | last=Ilett | first=Dan | work=[[Haymarket Media Group]] | date=July 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the company introduced an anti-spyware appliance called Spyware Interceptor and the following year it announced upcoming WAN optimization products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2300896/infrastructure-management/blue-coat-systems-adds-client-side-acceleration.html | title=Blue Coat Systems adds client-side acceleration | first=Denise | last=Dubie | work=[[Network World]] | date=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by SSL-VPN security appliances to secure remote connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2307509/lan-wan/blue-coat-ssl-vpn-protects-data-on-remote-machines.html | last=Greene | first=Tim | title=Blue Coat SSL VPN protects data on remote machines | work=[[Network World]] | date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the company was profitable for the first time.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;

In 2006, the company introduced a free web-tool, [[K9 Web Protection]], that can monitor internet traffic, block certain websites, identify phishing scams. In a November 2008 review, ''[[PC World]]'' gave it 4.25 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Plastiras | first=Elias | url=https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/review/blue_coat_systems/k9_web_protection/221312/ | title=Blue Coat Systems K9 Web Protection | work=[[PC World]] | date=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by repressive regimes==
Blue Coat devices are what is known as a "dual-use" technology, because they can be used both to defend corporate networks and by governments to censor and monitor the public's internet traffic.&lt;ref name=monitor&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eweek.com/security/blue-coat-appliances-used-by-governments-to-monitor-censor-web-traffic | title=Blue Coat Appliances Used by Governments to Monitor, Censor Web Traffic | first=Robert | last=Lemos | work=[[eWeek]] | date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appliances can see some types of encrypted traffic,&lt;ref name=nakashima&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/report-web-monitoring-devices-made-by-us-firm-blue-coat-detected-in-iran-sudan/2013/07/08/09877ad6-e7cf-11e2-a301-ea5a8116d211_story.html | title=Report: Web Monitoring Devices Made by U.S. Firm Blue Coat Detected in Iran, Sudan | first=Ellen | last=Nakashima | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; block websites or record website traffic.&lt;ref name=syriauses/&gt;

In October 2011, the U.S. government examined claims made by [[Telecomix]], a [[hacktivist]] group, that [[Syria]] was using Blue Coat Systems products for [[internet censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/technology-15437696 | title=US probes Syria's use of Internet blocking equipment | work=[[BBC News]] | date=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sari | last=Horwitz | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/syria-using-american-software-to-censor-internet-experts-say/2011/10/22/gIQA5mPr7L_story.html | title=Syria using American software to censor Internet, experts say | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/blue-coat-syria-iran-spying-software/ | title=U.S. company allegedly caught aiding Syria and Iran in censorship efforts | first=Curt | last=Hopkins | work=[[The Daily Dot]] | date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telecomix released 54GB of log data alleged to have been taken from 7 Blue Coat web gateway appliances that depict search terms, including "[[Israel]]" and "[[Proxy server|proxy]]", that were blocked in the country using the appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.information-age.com/channels/security-and-continuity/news/1663973/blue-coat-denies-sale-to-syrian-censors.thtml | title=Blue Coat denies sale to Syrian censors | work=Information Age | date=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company later acknowledged that its systems were being used in Syria, but asserted the equipment was sold to intermediaries in [[Dubai]] for use by an [[Iraq]]i governmental agency.&lt;ref name=syriauses/&gt;

Despite the systems consistently sending "heartbeat" pings directly back to Blue Coat, the company claimed not to be monitoring the logs to identify from which country an appliance is communicating.&lt;ref name=syriauses/&gt; Blue Coat announced that it would halt providing updates, support and other services for systems operating in Syria.&lt;ref name=syriauses/&gt; In April 2013, the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] announced a $2.8 million civil settlement with Computerlinks FZCO, a Dubai reseller, for violations of the [[Export Administration Regulations]] related to the transfer to Syria of Blue Coat products.&lt;ref name=nakashima/&gt;

'''Canary Wharf''' is a [[commercial district|commercial]] [[Business estate|estate]] on the [[Isle of Dogs]] in [[London]], in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]. It is one of the main [[financial centres]] of the [[United Kingdom]], along with the [[City of London]], and contains many of Europe's tallest buildings, including the [[List of tallest buildings in the UK|second-tallest in the UK]], [[One Canada Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8526857.stm|title=Heron Tower becomes tallest building in The City|accessdate=11 November 2010|publisher=BBC News|date= 21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?countryID=133 |title=United Kingdom list of tallest buildings |work=SkyscraperPage.com |date= |accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canary Wharf is {{convert|97|acre|abbr=off}} and contains around {{convert|16000000|sqft|m2}} of office and retail space.  It comprises many open areas, including [[Canada Square]], [[Cabot Square]] and [[Westferry Circus]].  Together with [[Heron Quays]], [[West India Quay]] and [[Wood Wharf]], it forms the Canary Wharf Estate.

==History==
[[File:Isle of dogs 1899.jpg|thumb|The Canary Wharf area in 1899 showing West India Docks and the Isle of Dogs]]

Canary Wharf is located on the [[West India Docks]] on the [[Isle of Dogs]].

;West India Dock Company
From 1802 to the late 1980s, the Canary Wharf Estate was a part of [[Millwall]], [[Limehouse]] and [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] and was one of the busiest docks in the world. After the 1960s, the port industry began to decline, leading to all the docks being closed by 1980.&lt;ref name=Port&gt;[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConFactFile.83/West-India-Docks.html ''West India Docks (1803–1980) ''] (Port Cities) accessed 22 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canarywharf.co.uk/mainFrm1.asp?strSelectedArea=History|title=History|accessdate=11 November 2010|publisher=Canary Wharf Group|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623070018/http://www.canarywharf.co.uk/mainFrm1.asp?strSelectedArea=History|archivedate=23 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; West India Docks was primarily developed by [[Robert Milligan]] (c. 1746–1809) who set up the West India Dock Company.

;Port of London Authority 
West India Dock was by this time owned by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909. Canary Wharf itself takes its name from No. 32 berth of the West Wood Quay of the Import Dock. This was built in 1936 for Fruit Lines Ltd, a subsidiary of [[Fred. Olsen &amp; Co.|Fred Olsen Lines]] for the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Canary Islands]] fruit trade. The Canary islands were so named after the large dogs found there by the Spanish (Gran Canaria from Canine) and as it is located on the Isle of Dogs, the quay and warehouse were given the name Canary Wharf.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46497 ''The West India Docks: The buildings: warehouses'', Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and [[Isle of Dogs]] (1994), pp. 284–300]. Retrieved 22 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

;London Docklands Development Corporation
After the docks closed in 1980, the British Government adopted policies to stimulate redevelopment of the area, including the creation of the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] (LDDC) in 1981 and the granting of [[Urban Enterprise Zone]] status to the Isle of Dogs in 1982.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The Canary Wharf of today began when [[Michael von Clemm]], former chairman of [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] (CSFB), came up with the idea to convert Canary Wharf into a [[back office]]. Further discussions with [[G Ware Travelstead]] led to proposals for a new business district and included the LDDC developing a cheap light metro scheme, called the [[Docklands Light Railway]] to make use a large amount of redundant railway infrastructure and to improve access. 

The project was sold to the Canadian company [[Olympia &amp; York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/tranmon2.html#Era |title=The Development of Transport in London Docklands – Part I: The Chronological Story |at=A New Era: the Coming of Canary Wharf |work=LDDC history |date=17 July 1987 |accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construction began in 1988, master-planned by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] with [[Yorke Rosenberg Mardall]] as their UK advisors, and subsequently by Koetter Kim. The first buildings were completed in 1991, including [[1 Canada Square]], which became the UK's tallest building at the time and a symbol of the regeneration of Docklands. By the time it opened, the London commercial property market had collapsed, and Olympia and York Canary Wharf Limited filed for bankruptcy in May 1992.

Initially, the City of London saw Canary Wharf as an existential threat. It modified its planning laws to expand the provision of new offices in the City of London, for example, creating offices above railway stations (Blackfriars) and roads ([[125 London Wall|Alban Gate]]). The resulting oversupply of office space contributed to the failure of the Canary Wharf project.

;Canary Wharf Group
In Oct. 1995, an international consortium that included investors such as [[Alwaleed]], bought control for $1.2 billion.  [[Paul Reichmann]] was named chairman, and Canary Wharf went public in 1999.&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Khan |first1=Riz |title=Alwaleed, Businessman Billionaire Prince |date=2005 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=9780060850302 |page=120-121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new company was called Canary Wharf Limited, and later became [[Canary Wharf Group]].

In 1997, some residents living on the Isle of Dogs launched a lawsuit against Canary Wharf Ltd for private nuisance because the tower interfered with TV signals. The residents lost the case.&lt;ref name="hunter01"&gt;The court found against the appellants (Hunter and others) as private nuisance legislation generally concerns "emanations" from land, not interference with such emanations. [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm "Hunter and Others v. Canary Wharf Ltd./Hunter and Others v. London Docklands Corporation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310185844/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm |date=10 March 2012 }} [[House of Lords]] Session 1996–97. Retrieved on 23 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery in the property market generally, coupled with continuing demand for large floorplate Grade A office space, slowly improved the level of interest. A critical event in the recovery was the much-delayed start of work on the [[Jubilee Line Extension]], which the government wanted ready for the [[Millennium]] celebrations.

In March 2004, Canary Wharf Group plc. was taken over by a consortium of investors, backed by its largest shareholder Glick Family Investments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/glick-family-in-late-move-over-canary-wharf-battle-537306.html |title=Glick family in late move over Canary Wharf battle |date=2 January 2011 |work=The Independent |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102231635/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/glick-family-in-late-move-over-canary-wharf-battle-537306.html |archivedate=2 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and led by [[Morgan Stanley]] using a vehicle named Songbird Estates plc.

== Areas == 

;Canada Square
[[Canada Square]] is one of the central squares at Canary Wharf.  It is a large open space with grass, except during the winter when it is coverted into an ice rink.  The square is named after Canada, because the original developers of modern Canary Wharf, Olympia &amp; York, wanted to reflect their heritage.  Underneath the square is Canada Place shopping mall.

;Westferry Circus
[[Westferry Circus]] is on the west side of Canary Wharf. It is a garden at ground level, and below is a roundabout allowing traffic to flow through.  The garden is enclosed by bespoke hand-crafted ornamental railings and entrance gates by artist Giuseppe Lund. The area has a long history, dating back to 1812, when the Poplar and Greenwich Roads Company operated a horse ferry between [[Greenwich]] and the Isle of Dogs. It operated on the West Ferry and East Ferry Roads, which the names survived. Westferry Circus was chosen as the name for the roundabout and park by virtue of its proximity to Westferry Road.

;Cabot Square
[[Cabot Square]] is one of the biggest squares at Canary Wharf, with a large fountain at the centre. The inner perimeter has additional fountains covered by trees. The square has large cirular glass ventilation holes to allow gases to escape from the underneath car park. The square is named after [[John Cabot]] and his son Sebastian, who were Italian explorers who settled in England in 1484.

;Churchill Place
Churchill Place is an area on the east side of Canary Wharf.  It is named after [[Winston Churchill]].

;Columbus Courtyard
A small square on the west side of Canary Wharf. Named after [[Christopher Columbus]] who was the Italian navigator who discovered America. The first phase of Canary Wharf was completed in 1992, 500 years after Columbus' discovery and was a tribute to his achievements.

;Chancellor Passage
A passage way south of Cabot Square.  Named after [[Richard Chancellor]] who sailed with Sir John Willoughby from Greenwich on their voyage through the White Sea to Moscow.

;Wren Landing
Small area north of Cabot Square. Leads to North Dock footbridge towards Port East. Named after British architect [[Christopher Wren]].

== Transport  ==
The Canary Wharf developers played a pro-active role in improving transport links, which they recognised as essential to the success of the project.

Initially two transport routes were proposed: one being an extension to Bank and the other an express route connecting Greenwich with [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]] ('Canaryloo'). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Underground: How the Tube shaped London|last=Bownes|first=David|last2=Green|first2=Oliver|last3=Mullins|first3=Sam|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2012|isbn=978-1-846-14462-2|location=80 Strand, London|pages=231-249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1985, they proposed extension of the [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR) to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], and upgrading of frequencies and capacity. The DLR now serves four stations in the area: [[West India Quay station|West India Quay]], [[Canary Wharf DLR station|Canary Wharf]], [[Heron Quays station|Heron Quays]] and [[South Quay DLR station]]s with two additional stations located close by just beyond the district, [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] and [[Blackwall DLR station]]s. 

In 1988, they proposed construction of a second rail line to Docklands, which ultimately became the [[Jubilee Line Extension]]. After the Jubilee Extension opened in 1999, Canary Wharf began to actively promote [[Crossrail]], as a new station on Crossrail's [[Elizabeth line]] will serve the area. It was due to be open in December 2018, but has been delayed until Autumn 2019.

;Aviation
[[File:London City Airport at end of runway.jpg|thumb|London City Airport runway with Canary Wharf and the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]] in the background.]]
[[London City Airport]] in [[Silvertown]] is linked to both Canary Wharf and the City of London via the [[Canary Wharf DLR station|Docklands Light Railway]], and an interchange to the [[London Underground]]. [[London City Airport]] [[Canary Wharf DLR station|DLR station]] is situated immediately adjacent to the terminal building, with enclosed access to and from the elevated platforms. The Vanguard [[helipad]] serves a parcel service by [[helicopter]] to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Richard.

;London Buses
Canary Wharf is served by several [[London Buses]] routes, including route [[London Buses route 135|135]] connecting the estate with [[Old Street]] and [[Crossharbour DLR station|Crossharbour]] and the 24 hours route [[London Buses route 277|277]] to [[Highbury]] via [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[Hackney Central]], [[Dalston]] from Crosshabour via [[Millwall]] and also the ''D'' prefix network serving the [[London Docklands]] with the [[London Buses route D3|D3]] running between [[Bethnal Green]] and [[Leamouth]] via [[Wapping]] and [[London Buses route D6|D7]] between [[Mile End]] and [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] while the [[London Buses route D8|D8]] from Crossharbour to [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] via [[Bromley-by-Bow]] and the [[List of night buses in London|night route]] N550 between [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Canning Town]] and has been since its beginning, which has been vital in the continuing development of the estate.

;Docklands Light Railway
[[File:DLR unit 109 at Heron Quays.JPG|thumb|A train arriving at [[Heron Quays DLR station]].]]

The [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR) is an automated [[light metro]] system that has three stations in Canary Wharf. [[Heron Quays DLR station|Heron Quays Station]], one of the first stations to be built in the Canary Wharf Estate, was first opened in 1987. The station has two platforms in use, is in [[Travelcard Zone 2]], and is on the [[Lewisham]] branch, between Canary Wharf and [[South Quay]]. The station was moved 200 metres south (to fit inside the new buildings) and a longer platform was built at this new site to accommodate three-unit trains planned as part of the DLR Capacity Enhancement; the station re-opened on 18 December 2002.

While [[Canary Wharf DLR station|Canary Wharf Station]] had been part of the original DLR plans, but the station was not ready when the DLR opened in August 1987. It was originally planned that the station would be similar to the original station at [[Heron Quays]], with 2 small platforms either side of the tracks. The station is located on the DLR between Heron Quays station and the [[West India Quay station]], in [[Travelcard Zone 2]].

;London Underground
[[File:CanaryWharfTubeA.JPG|thumb|The interior of Canary Wharf tube station.]]
{{main article|Canary Wharf tube station}}

[[Canary Wharf tube station|Canary Wharf Underground station]] is a 2 platform station designed by Norman Foster and opened in 1999 as part of the [[Jubilee Line Extension]] from Charing Cross to Stratford. Canary Wharf station has increasingly become one of the busiest stations on the network, serving the ever-expanding Canary Wharf business district.

The station was used as a location for some scenes of [[Danny Boyle]]'s 2002 film ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and its sequel ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'', which was mostly based in Canary Wharf.

;National Rail
{{main article|Canary Wharf railway station}}
[[File:Canary Wharf railway station - August 2016.jpg|thumb|The outer layer of Canary Wharf Crossrail station.]] 
Canary Wharf railway station began construction in May 2009 and will be completed in 2017 (due to officially begin operating in 2018) as part of the £15 billion [[Crossrail]] project. The station will be served by the Elizabeth line and will have 2 platforms and will be in [[Travelcard Zone 2]].

;London River Services
{{main article|Canary Wharf Pier}}
The Canary Wharf Pier is a [[London River Services]] pier on the River Thames located to the west of Canary Wharf, close to Narrow Street, Limehouse.

;Cycling
[[Cycle Superhighway CS3]] between [[Tower Gateway]] and [[Barking, London|Barking]] passes to the north of Canary Wharf near [[Westferry station]] and the [[National Cycle Route]] passes to the west on the [[Thames Path]].

==Gaming==
Canary Wharf has been reported since 2017 as part of the [[Pokémon Go]] [[augmented reality]] game to being the home for the most wanted Pokémon gyms in London including [[Canary Wharf DLR station]] and Montgomery Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacoapartments.com/blog/10-things-you-didn-t-know-about-canary-wharf/|title=10 things you didn’t know about Canary Wharf|website=SACO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canary Wharf Group]] published an official Pokémon map for PokéStop's and Pokémon Gyms, the managing director for retail Camille Waxer said in 2016 that Pokémon Go has serious potential to attract new audiences to the area, particularly food and drink outlets are seeing an increase in footfall. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bisnow.com/London/news/office/canary-wharf-welcomes-pokmon-go-players-with-map-and-prizes-63666#ath&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles DeLano Hine''' (March 15, 1867 – Feb. 13, 1927) was an American civil engineer, lawyer, railway official, and Colonel in the United States Army. He receives academic credit for studying organizations as a separate field, rather than a "smaller sister of sociology.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehouda Shenhav]]. "[http://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/yshenhav/files/2013/07/From-Chaos-to-Systems.pdf From Chaos to Systems: The Engineering Foundations of Organization Theory, 1879-1932]," in: ''Administrative Science Quarterly,'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Dec., 1995), pp. 564-565&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;C.D.L. Hine in ''[[Engineering Magazine]].'' Vol. 42 (1912), p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bent of Tau Beta Pi.'' Vol. 8 (1913), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haridimos Tsoukas, Christian Knudsen (2005). ''The Oxford Handbook of Organization Theory.'' p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early and family life==
Born in [[Vienna, Virginia]] to former Union veteran Capt. [[Orrin E. Hine]] and his wife Alma, Hine graduated from [[United States Military Academy]], West Point in 1891, and served as a lieutenant in the 6th United States Infantry. He later graduated from [[Cincinnati Law School]].&lt;ref name="Hine 1909 F"&gt;Hine (1909, Foreword)&lt;/ref&gt; He married Helen Underwood on March 27, 1915.

==Career==
Leaving the Army to enter railway service, Hine worked as freight brakeman, switchman, yardmaster, emergency conductor, chief clerk to superintendent, and [[Trainmaster (occupation)|trainmaster]]. When the [[Spanish–American War]] began in 1898 he quit railway service and participated in the Santiago campaign as a major of volunteers. After the war he re-entered railway work, rising to trainmaster and later general superintendent. Subsequently, he did special railway work in various staff positions for both large and small railways in the United States, Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name="Hine 1909 F"/&gt;

Hine inspected safety appliances for the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]. In 1907 Hine assisted in the revising the business methods of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] at Washington, D.C. Then he was appointed bankruptcy receiver of the [[Northern Virginia trolleys|Washington, Arlington &amp; Falls Church Electric Railway]].

In 1910, Hine became temporary special representative of [[President Taft]], planning ways to improve the organization and methods of the executive departments of the United States government. Meantime, in July, 1908, he had become special representative of Mr. [[Julius Kruttschnitt]], director of maintenance and operation of the Harriman Lines, and had entered on a study of the needs of the operating organization of those railways and of the means that should be adopted to meet those needs. This report led most of the Harriman Lines to adopt the unit system of organization.

On January 15, 1912, Major Hine became vice-president and general manager of the [[Southern Pacific Lines]] in Mexico and the Arizona Eastern, responsible for about 1,600 miles of railway.&lt;ref name="Hine 1909 F"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], on August 5, 1917, Hine (then living in New York City) was drafted to serve as Colonel of Infantry for New York's National Guard. Hisunit was sent overseas, and participated at [[St. Mihiel]] before the war ended and he was honorably discharged on January 10, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Abstracts of World War I Military Service p. 273, for Charles DeLano Hine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Hine died in Manhattan in 1927. After a funeral at [[Saint Thomas Church (Manhattan)|St. Thomas Episcopal Church]] in which pall bearers included the President of the [[Lackawanna Railroad]], [[Orlando Harriman Jr.]] and various distinguished military officers,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/cdhine.htm&lt;/ref&gt; he was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, and his widow awarded a pension based on his military service.

==Publications==

=== ''Modern Organization: An Exposition of the Unit System,'' 1912 ===
In the 1912 article "The unit system on the Harriman Lines" in the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' Hine wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Organization has been termed a smaller sister of sociology, the science of human nature. Industrial organization, including that of transportation and commerce, reflects and typifies in a greater or less degree the sociological development of a people."&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Magazine, Vol. 42. Jan. 1912: 481-487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His series of articles were republished in the 1912 book, entitled "Modern Organization: An Exposition of the Unit System." In this work Hine also stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The greatest present need is an antidote for the unwillingness of men to profit by the previous experience of others. It would be amusing, were it not so expensive, to watch the gropings of many corporation officers for methods to test efficiency. Ignorant of fundamental principles, intolerant of outside suggestions, unable to detect the analogy in other undertakings, they repeat the expensive experiments of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Charles DeLano Hine. (1912) cited in: Robert Scudder Denham. ''The A-B-C of Cost Engineering.'' Denham Cost-Finding Company, 1919. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1913 review in the ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' stated that Hines was "a firm believer in the personal equation in industry, commerce and all departments of business. Basing his argument to a great extent upon the successful operation of the unit system as applied on the so-called "Harriman lines" he goes step by step through the ideal method of management and operation to what he considers the practical solution of the difficulties which he encounters."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Accountancy,'' Vol. 15 (1913). p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chicago Options Associates''' ('''COA''') is a finance company in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] which specializes in trading [[option (finance)|option]]s and [[futures contract]]s. It was founded in 1987 by '''Oliver R. W. Pergams''' and '''Michael E. Davis'''. In 1994 Davis was its [[chief executive officer]], hiring then-graduate student [[Jimmy Wales]] as research director; Wales served in this position until 1998.

The company and Davis were the subject of [[litigation]] resulting from a 2007 [[Illinois Supreme Court]] decision. In ''Dowling v. Chicago Options Associates'', plaintiff Brian Dowling successfully sued the company (and Davis), winning a judgement of [[United states dollar|US$]]817,830.45 from both defendants. Davis tried to shield his [[assets]] by transferring funds to a law firm, DLA Piper, which had assisted him in buying a home in [[Florida]]. During this [[Misrepresentation|representation]], Davis paid a [[retainer agreement|retainer]] of $100,000 to DLA Piper; Dowling maintained that he was owed this money. Although the [[Circuit court#United States|circuit]] and appellate courts agreed with Dowling, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed and found with DLA Piper. The [[Illinois State Bar Association]] and [[Chicago Bar Association]] filed ''[[amicus curiae]]'' briefs in the case, favoring the law firm's position. This decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was the first time the concept of "advance payment retainer" was recognized in the state, and the court codified its ruling into a 2009 regulation affecting legal practice in Illinois.

The original case was between plaintiff Brian Dowling and defendants Chicago Options Associates and Michael E. Davis,&lt;ref name="bodenstein"&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Chicago Bar Association|journal=CBA Record|date=November 2007|volume=21|page=26|title=In this Issue: Retainers in Illinois After Dowling: Yours, Mine or Ours|first=Ira|last= Bodenstein|author2=Vipin R. Gandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Dowling won a judgement of $817,830.45 from the defendants.&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt; After the court entered its judgement against him, Davis then tried to shield his assets from the plaintiff&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt; using his attorney-client relationship with the law firm of DLA Piper to assist him in buying a home in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt; As part of this arrangement, Davis transferred funds into a trust account controlled by DLA Piper.&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt; At that time, as stated in the contract between DLA Piper and Davis, the law firm was allocated $100,000 of those funds as its retainer;&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt; the funds were used to pay day-to-day company expenses.&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt;

When Dowling's attorneys learned about the retainer to DLA Piper they asked the court to order the return of the retainer to the plaintiff,&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt; and the circuit court ruled in favor of Dowling.&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt; On appeal, the decision was upheld.&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt; The Illinois Supreme Court reversed the circuit-court decision, ruling that the retainer was the property of DLA Piper and not Dowling.&lt;ref name="bodenstein" /&gt;

Both the [[Illinois State Bar Association]] and [[Chicago Bar Association]] filed ''[[amicus curiae]]'' briefs in the case favoring the law firm's position.&lt;ref name="gunnarsson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher= Chicago Bar Association|journal=CBA Record|date=November 2006|volume=20|page=34|title=Murphy's Law|first=Terrence M.|last=Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case dealt with the concept of an [[advance payment]] retainer, a fee given to an attorney for later services to a client.&lt;ref name="gunnarsson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="maville" /&gt; An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets as soon as it was paid, regardless of subsequent events.&lt;ref name="maville" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Chicago Bar Association|journal=CBA Record|date=September 2013|volume=27|page=45|title=Ethics Extra|first=Steven A.|last=Miner, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Chicago Bar Association|journal=CBA Record|date=June 2011|volume=25|page=44|title=Legal Ethics: There is More to a Fee Dispute Than the Rules|first=John|last=Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the security retainer.&lt;ref name="gunnarsson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=43–45; Section: 321|title=Defending Drinking Drivers, Second Edition, Volume 1|first=John A. |last=Tarantino|author2= Walter J.

The '''chief risk officer''' ('''CRO''') or '''chief risk management officer''' ('''CRMO''') of a firm or [[corporation]] is the executive accountable for enabling the efficient and effective governance of significant risks, and related opportunities, to a business and its various segments. Risks are commonly categorized as strategic, reputational, operational, financial, or compliance-related. CROs are accountable to the Executive Committee and The Board for enabling the business to balance risk and reward.  In more complex organizations, they are generally responsible for coordinating the organization's [[Enterprise Risk Management]] (ERM) approach. The CRO is responsible for assessing and mitigating significant competitive, regulatory, and technological threats to a firm's capital and earnings. The CRO roles and responsibilities vary depending on the size of the organization and industry. The CRO works to ensure that the firm is compliant with government regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, and reviews factors that could negatively affect investments. Typically, the CRO is responsible for the firm's risk management operations, including managing, identifying, evaluating, reporting  and overseeing the firm's risks externally and internally  to the organization and works diligently with senior management such as Chief Executive officer and Chief Financial Officer.

The role of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is becoming increasing important in financial, investment, and insurance sectors. According to Watson, the majority of CROs agreed that having only exceptional analytical skill is not sufficient. The most successful CROs are able to combine these skills with highly developed commercial, strategic, leadership and communication skill to be able to drive change and make a difference in an organization. CROs typically have post graduate education with over 20 years of experience in accounting, economics, legal or actuarial backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chief-risk-officer-cro.asp|title=Chief Risk Officer - CRO|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2011-06-26|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.towerswatson.com/en/Insights/IC-Types/Ad-hoc-Point-of-View/Insights/2014/Insights-The-role-of-the-Chief-Risk-Officer-in-the-spotlight|title=Insights: The role of the Chief Risk Officer in the spotlight|website=Willis Towers Watson|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A business may find a risk acceptable; however, the company as a whole may not. CROs need to balance risks with financial, investment, insurance, personnel and inventory decisions to obtain an optimum level for stakeholders. According to a study by Morgan McKinley, a successful CRO must be able to deal with complexity and ambiguity, and understand the bigger picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.morganmckinley.com.au/article/whitepaper-how-progress-and-be-successful-chief-risk-officer-role|title=Whitepaper: How to progress and be successful in a Chief Risk Officer role|work=Morgan McKinley Australia|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-AUM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Lam]], a noted risk professional, is credited as the first person to coin the term. Lam is the first person to hold that position at [[GE]] Capital in 1993. The position became more common after the [[Basel Accord]], the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], the [[Turnbull Report]].

A main priority for the CRO is to ensure that the organization is in full compliance with applicable regulations and to analyze all risk related issues. They may also be required to work alongside other senior executives such as with a [[chief compliance officer]]. They may deal with topics regarding insurance, [[internal auditing]], corporate investigations, [[fraud]], and [[information security]]. The responsibilities and requirements to become a chief risk officer vary depending on the size of the organization and the industry, however most CRO's typically have a masters-degree level of education and 10 to 20 years of business-related experience, with actuarial, accounting, economics, and legal backgrounds common. There are many different pathways to become a CRO but most organizations prefer to promote their own employees to the position internally.

== Roles of a CRO ==

A chief risk officer (CRO) is relatively considered a newer position in the board of directors. When comparing the function of a CRO to the rest of the officers, we find that there is a relationship with every other role. In other words, for a process in any department in a firm to be completed it has to be discussed with a CRO to clear it of potential risks. In general, the CRO has many crucial tasks to look for in any organization to better serve its needs and mitigate its risk. According to the Enterprise Risk Management Initiative, CROs need to find a way to balance risks and inventory decisions to obtain an optimum level for stakeholders and maintain a positive reputation regarding the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://erm.ncsu.edu/library/article/role-risk-officer|title=Role of the Chief Risk Officer - ERM - Enterprise Risk Management Initiative {{!}} North Carolina State Poole College of Management|website=erm.ncsu.edu|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the job description of CRO there is more in depth, there are some general tasks which every CRO has to be familiar with, such as, understanding the concept of [[Enterprise risk management|Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)]].

A Chief risk officer must identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor and report every aspect of the risk function of new implementations of the firm. This Task is important when translating business requirements of the firm into business/reporting and system specifications. Also, the CRO's assistance is necessary when it comes to new developments. Risk Chiefs must be leaders in developing and improving management reporting as well as providing user training for in-house developed systems.  In addition to developing policies and frameworks, the CRO is responsible for training and supervision of employees. Another important task is managing the development of new risk policies and procedures and participating in local and global discussions to enhance security processes and standards.&lt;ref&gt;Managing Risks: A New Framework, Retrieved 2 December 2017, https://hbr.org/2012/06/managing-risks-a-new-framework&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The role of the CRO is still evolving as the scope of task is constantly changing. The increasing regulatory and legislative requirements of organizational compliance makes the CRO to one of the most important member of the management team. To be able to view risk in the context of the whole company and to organize different risk functions and task through the different entities of the organization, is inevitable to the success of any structural planning.&lt;ref&gt;ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT, Part Three: The role of the chief risk officer (CRO), ASHRM JOURNAL 2005  VOL.25 NO.4, PDF, Retrieved 2 December 2017, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jhrm.5600250407/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related Positions of a CRO ==
The title of a CRO is a fairly new position in a company that is continually evolving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chief-risk-officer-cro.asp|title=Chief Risk Officer - CRO|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2011-06-26|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility of a CRO can be supported by the CEO or CFO. However, having an independent position to mitigate risks close to the executive board is a real asset for the company. Although the title of CRO is fairly new, job titles such as CFOs and CEOs also have functions of a CRO. Related positions of a CRO include CEO, CFO, Chief Risk Management Officer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/Chief-risk-officer-CRO|title=What is chief risk officer (CRO)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchCompliance|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk Manager and Capital Manager. Although these related positions don't necessarily replace a CRO, they do hold job functions that are similar to those of a CRO.

Some names can be cited as examples of Chief Risk Officer. This new position is found in many different industries. The major one is in the financial sector. For instance, Craig Broderick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/who-we-are/leadership/management-committee/craig-w-broderick.html|title=Goldman Sachs {{!}} Management Committee - Craig W.

Companies in other industries have hired CROs in order to become more competitive. For example, Stefano Rettore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adm.com/our-company/senior-leadership/stefano-rettore|title=Stefano Rettore {{!}} ADM|date=2017-12-12|website=ADM|language=en-us|others=ADM|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the CRO of Archer Daniels Midland while being a member of the executive board. Vijay Patil&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://powersportsfinance.com/yamaha-captive-expands-operations-nationwide-pilots-pre-owned-program/|title=Yamaha Expands Nationwide, Pilots Pre-owned|date=2016-03-14|work=PowerSports Finance|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; has more than ten years of experience in this function and is the CRO of Yamaha.

== Industry Backgrounds ==
On August 1993, James Lam became the first worldwide CRO at GE Capital.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} He is called the inventor of the ERM model. As a CRO, Lam's responsibilities were to mitigate the risks of the company. He managed the credit risks, market risk, risk transfer and hedge risk. In 1995, a few company executives started to hire CROs in their organizations. But the demand was still low in the CRO position. In 2002, the US government released a new law which influenced the CRO industry significantly. The Sarbanes Oxley Act which gets popular with 2004 says that directors or executive are more severe against counterfeit of financial corporate information.&lt;ref&gt;“”The evolving role of the CRO – Eiu” by Economist Intelligence Unit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cf.rims.org"&gt;“A View from the Top: The Growing Role of the Chief Risk Officer” by William Atkinson
http://cf.rims.org/Magazine/PrintTemplate.cfm?AID=3470&lt;/ref&gt; By hiring CROs, companies have started to protect the executives more. Ten years later, 2005, almost all big companies that were making sales over a billion dollar hired a CRO in their enterprise. These companies were almost in a difficult environment and that's why they began to recognize the importance of a CRO. Another boost for the CRO role was the financial crisis in 2008. Many companies became bankruptcy and many jobs were destroyed. After these events, more and more CROs were hired. With the increase in regulation in the economy, the position of the CRO is gaining more importance. The worldwide globalization is also increasing the importance of CROs. As of 2017,{{Vague|date=December 2017}} there are more than 1000 CROs worldwide. Most of them come from the financial service, energy or commodity industry. In the future, the importance of the CRO will be measured by the complexity of the compliance risk.&lt;ref&gt;“Enterprise-wide risk management and the role of the chief risk officer” by James Lam https://erm.ncsu.edu/library/article/role-risk-officer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cf.rims.org"/&gt;

== Characteristics/Qualifications ==
The characteristics and/or qualifications of a Chief Risk Officer is dependent on the industry and the type of the business they are working in. For example, if the CRO were involved in the finance industry, a postgraduate education along with 10+ years of experience in accounting, economics, internal audit, risk management, strategic planning, or actuarial backgrounds would typically be a common characteristic along with many years in the banking sector.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, E. R. (2005, May 01). Role of the Chief Risk Officer. Retrieved December 02, 2017, from https://erm.ncsu.edu/library/article/role-risk-officer&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Job Profile: Chief Risk Officer. (n.d.). Retrieved December 02, 2017, from http://www.master-of-finance.org/job-profiles/chief-risk-officer/&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with their extensive knowledge of the rules and regulations in finance, they usually would have held a position in the first/mid-level management up to senior executive for their past qualification in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Lam, James. (2013). 19. In Enterprise Risk Management (pp. 342-343). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Having to understand the compliance with government regulations such as Sarbanes Oxley of 2002, it is common for CRO's to have also held a Chief Financial Officer position prior to becoming a Chief Risk Officer. With their quantitative background in math, finance, and accounting - making the change to risk management would be a familiar experience.&lt;ref&gt;Part Three: The role of the chief risk officer (CRO). (2009, July 23). Retrieved December 10, 2017, from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jhrm.5600250407/pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in the technology, retail, healthcare, or finance industry - the qualities of a typical Chief Risk Officer are very similar throughout the industries. Their financial expertise will aid in creating reporting procedures that will monitoring any critical risks an organization may encounter.

== Salary ==
Firstly, the salary range for a Chief Risk Officer has a wide variety, it is also dependent of the company and status the specific CRO achieved.

The average pay for a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) with Regulatory Compliance skills is  about  $162,274 per year. Those Risk Officers who work for banks earn slightly more at $180,970. Nevertheless, those managing risks for private corporations produce a higher average salary of $216,000 annually.[https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Chief_Risk_Officer_(CRO)/Salary]

Chief Risk Officers have the opportunity of landing in the bottom tenth percentile with a decent salary of $72,750. However, CROs with years of effectiveness and successful developments often pass the quarter million mark annually, so there is no earnings limit.[https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/chief-risk-officer-salary-SRCH_KO0,18.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;][http://www.master-of-finance.org/job-profiles/chief-risk-officer/ &lt;nowiki&gt;[3]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

== ERM Process And The CRO ==

=== Enterprise Risk Management ===

Enterprise Risk Management, ERM, is a fairly new process of managing risk within a company. Although ERM has yet to be widely accepted as an industry standard since there are various definitions as to what ERM exactly is, more recognition and acceptance of ERM has been shown. There are seminars dedicated to ERM explaining the process and providing examples of applications while also discussing advances in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework. (n.d.). Retrieved December 01,2017,
From https://www.coso.org/pages/erm-integratedframework.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Papers on ERM are also beginning to appear in journals and books which are starting to be published. Some universities are even starting to offer courses regarding ERM and the process.

=== Definitions of ERM ===

A definition provided by the committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2004 defines ERM as a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be with its appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Risk Management Committee of Casualty Actuarial Society. “Overview of Enterprise Risk Management.” Casualty Actuarial Society, Summer 2003, pp. 99-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition provided by the International Organization of Standardization (ISO 3100) defines ERM as coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk.&lt;ref&gt;Lam, J. (2013). Enterprise risk management: from incentives to controls. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to James Lam, the definition of ERM is a value added function can be described as the inclusive and cohesive framework for managing key risks in order to achieve business goals, mitigate unexpected earnings unpredictability, and increase firm value to reduce risk which is a variable that can cause deviation from an expected outcome.

=== The Benefits of ERM ===
According to James Lam, author of the book “Enterprise Risk Management,” there are several primary benefits of using ERM; 1) enhanced organizational effectiveness, 2) increased efficiency in terms of risk reporting, 3) improved business performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enterprise Risk Management|last=Lam|first=James|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-41361-6|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=53–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational effectiveness helps address special and specific risks by creating the top-down coordination needed to form an integrated team suited to handle both independent risks and interdependencies between risks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More-over, ERM has been said to increased risk management awareness allowing for more efficient operational and strategic decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liebenberg|first=A. P.|date=2003|title=The Determinants of Enterprise Risk Management: Evidence From the Appointment of Chief Risk Officers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1098-1616.00019/full|journal=Risk Management and Insurance Review|volume=|pages=37–52|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through the appointment of a chief risk officer and the establishment of an enterprise risk function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Risk reporting assists both the chief risk officer of an organization and the board of governors in identifying key risk factors that may prove detrimental to the company in both the present and the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, ERM enables senior management to identify, measure, and limit to acceptable levels the net exposures faced by the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nocco|first=B. W.|date=2006|title=Enterprise Risk Management: Theory and Practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6622.2006.00106.x/full|journal=Journal of Applied Corporate Finance|volume=|pages=8–20|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to create risk transparency allows a firm to better hedge against those particular risks or avoid them all together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Better business performance is yet another benefit of using ERM. Companies that adopt an ERM approach have seen improvements in areas requiring key management decisions from capitol allocations to product development and pricing to mergers and acquisitions. As a result, this leads to the benefits and improvements gained from utilizing an ERM approach can be seen in the form of loss reduction, improved shareholder value, decreased earning volatility, and an increase in the firms’ earnings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Chief Risk Officer ===

The ERM model implies the leadership by an individual who is responsible for the development and implication of an ERM strategy and assists the senior management in terms of risk management. In order to do this a CRO sets up a risk management framework and policies based on the ERM strategy. Furthermore, he implements reports and risk indicators to communicate the risk culture throughout the firm. These reports assist the CRO in creating a risk profile. He is communicating the firms risk profile to the key stakeholders such as the CEO, the board of directors and business partners. The optimizing of the risk portfolio is another assigned task by the ERM. He advises for firm projects from a risk management point of view and uses regulations and risk transfer strategies in order to mitigate the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Risk Management: From Incentives to Controls, by James Lam (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The importance of the CRO ===

ERM vs Silo

ERM: An ERM requires an integrated risk organization what normally means, that a centralized risk management unit has to report to the CEO and the board of directors. The Chief risk officer in an ERM is responsible for knowing and gathering information over all the different aspects within an organization. He takes a portfolio view of all types of risks within the company. In an ERM approach the use of insurance and alternative risk transfer products is only considered if the risk seemed undesirable or unwanted to the management. Integration of risk management in the whole company's business process becomes necessary. The ERM optimizes business performance by influencing different aspects like pricing and resource allocation. There are three major benefits connected to the use of the ERM approach and the CRO as liaison: Due to the fact that a CRO and an integrated team can better manage individual risks and interdependencies between these risks, the use of an ERM leads to an increased organizational effectiveness. Apart from this fact, a better risk reporting can be reached by prioritizing the content of risk reporting that should go to the different instances like the senior management or the board of directors. A side effect of this information prioritizing is a much better transparency throughout the whole organization. Last but not least you can also reach a better overall business performance in the company. This is only possible if the risk management team uses an ERM approach and supports key management decisions like pricing, product development or Mergers and Acquisition. Given the support, there will be several benefits like increased earnings and improved shareholder value. An ERM can combine and integrate several risk silos into a firm-wide risk portfolio and can consider aspects as volatility and correlation of all risk exposures. This can lead to a maximization of the diversification's benefits.

SILO: Under a Silo approach, risk transfer strategies are executed under a transactional or individual risk level. As an example insurance can be mentioned, which transfers out operational risk. Risk assessment and quantification processes are not integrated. Value-at-risk models are used to quantify the market risk and credit default models are used to estimate credit risk. Both specific models could be used independently, still: that it is not the case in the Silo approach. There are different effects that can be caused by this less integrative model: Over-hedging and far too much insurance cover can be a result of not incorporating all the different kinds of risk and their wide diversification. Another characteristic of the Silo approach is the continuous fighting of one crisis after another without having an integrative concept or a specific individual that can be held responsible. No one specifically takes responsibility for aspects like the overall risk reporting or other risk-related unit supplies. Further more there is another aspect that shows a weakness of this model: Having different organizational units to address every specific risk that then first has to be segmented in the company definitely speaks for a less effective technique. In the Silo approach the different business units use various methodologies to track counterparty risks. This can become a problem, if you look at the total counterparty exposure: it can get too great to be managed by all the different business units.

Risk Champion:

After a near miss or an actual crisis managers are often alarmed and focus more on all aspect of risk during the ongoing inspection. They are looking at aspects like the compliance risk and they are reinforcing important roles for the board. All these actions often lead to the naming of a risk champion who is then responsible for developing and establishing an ERM approach. In many companies the risk champion is becoming more and more a formal senior management position: the CRO. One of the important function of a risk champion that should be mentioned is his/her support to legitimize the implementation of the risk management itself. Apart from this fact he also helps the institution follow its objectives and better site it for the future. Further more he is also responsible for communicating its benefits. Normally a risk champion should have the different characteristics like skills, knowledge and leadership qualities, necessary to handle all the different specific aspects that can occur in the process of risk management. Other aspects that should be mentioned considering the responsibilities of a risk champion is his duty to intervene in instances where risk management efforts are actually disabled. This can be caused by the management itself or a lack of institutional skills. Additional he also provides support to the whole risk management process if a problematic, complicated risk occurs. In this case he can use the multiple participant approach. Assisting the risk owner, but not assuming his or her role to help find a solution for his/her problem is also one of the many duties a risk champion has to face. In some studies the risk champion is described as some kind of troubleshooter who alleviates risk related problems. After all you can summarize that the risk champion hast to be integrated into the company's ERM approach and by this contribute to the institution's goals and objectives.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is an act of 2002. In response to various financial scandals, the U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This act also can be called Sarbox or Sox. First of all, Sarbanes-Oxley sought to enhance the integrity of corporate financial reporting and better regulate the accounting profession. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies for every company which is registered by SEC; therefore, international companies are included as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/laws-regulations/sarbanes-oxley-act-891|title=SEC Looking for Chief Risk Officer - Radical Compliance|last=|first=|date=2017-11-16|work=Radical Compliance|access-date=2017-12-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it regulates and set standards for companies to protect shareholders and the public from accounting errors as well as generates more transparency between reporting and the markets.

Thus, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act enhanced corporate financial reports and made several reforms in the accounting profession. Enhancements occurred in the financial statements; therefore, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a company's executive chief officer and chief financial officer to clarify the precision of its financial reports. Moreover, to ensure the mentioned accuracy of financial reports, internal controls are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarbanes-oxley-act.biz/SarbanesOxleySection1107.htm|title=Sarbanes Oxley Act Section 1107|last=Lekatis|first=George|website=www.sarbanes-oxley-act.biz|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, each financial report required an internal control report to prevent fraud. Furthermore, the CRO has to be aware of everything occurring in his company on a daily basis, but he must also be current on all of the requirements from the SEC. In addition, the CRO restrains corporate risk by managing compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radicalcompliance.com/2017/11/16/sec-chief-risk-officer/|title=SEC Looking for Chief Risk Officer - Radical Compliance|date=2017-11-16|work=Radical Compliance|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Why is a CRO so important in financial institutions?

There is a report of having a CRO from 93% of all financial institutions that have more complex operations. A few institutions also established a chief compliance officer position. Integrating risk and finance can lead to getting more successful results and achieving strategic goals. Due to the fact that by using both: CRO and CFO, both skill sets are brought together. This can lead to the fact that the CFO's pressure is relieved and he can focus more on helping organizations direct their activities and find new opportunities to growth. The CEO of Zions Bancorporation, Harris Simmons once wrote that there would be an „uncontested need for an independent risk management in large banking organizations“. But in his opinion “covered companies should be allowed a measure of flexibility in determining how such an organization should be structured”. According to Thomas Stanton, author of „Why Some Firms Thrive and Others Fail“, one of the differences between a company that was successful and another one that was not successful during the financial crisis, was their „application of a constructive dialogue“. On the one hand there were the employees who were responsible for making money by selling products and financial services and on the other hand there were the ones responsible for limiting risks.
Due to the fact that bank regulators have actually encouraged banks now for a longer time to adopt an enterprise risk management approach, the need of a CRO to manage risk across the whole organization has increased. You can see a close coordination between Finance and Risk Management if you take a look at how a risk model is developed. Data of the risk model are often “created by finance” and their outcomes exert influence on the financial reporting. Here you can clearly see the interdependencies. Its no longer the case that risk and finance can be seen independent. The integration between finance and risk platforms may also relax different aspects like calculation or the integration of Data. After all it can be said, that the banking industry would rarely need this systematic approach today if it would have employed more chief risk officers before the financial crisis began.

===Components of ERM===

COSO, a Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, uses the concept of Enterprise Risk Management for the first time. In this context, they published in 2004 the Enterprise Risk Management—Integrated Framework.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coso.org/Pages/aboutus.aspx ''COSO - About us.''] Retrieved 2017-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past years the complexity of risk has changed, and new risks have emerged why COSO published in 2017 the updated framework of ERM.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coso.org/Pages/erm.aspx ''COSO – Guidance on Enterprise Risk Management.''] Retrieved 2017-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt; This framework includes five interrelated components which are found in the most ERM frameworks.

'''Governance and Culture''' establishes organizational processes and defines desired cultures to measure and manage risk across the company. The result is a top-down risk management.

'''Strategy and Objective-Setting''' formulates business objectives which put strategy into practice. The business objectives are a basis for identifying, assessing, and responding to risk. Also, Strategy and Objective-Setting analyzes business context, defines risk appetite and evaluates alternative strategies.

'''Performance''' identifies, assesses severity, and prioritizes risks which may impact the achievement of strategy and business objectives. Later, the company selects risk responses and develops a portfolio view. In the last step, the results are reported to key risk stakeholders.

'''Review and Revision''' consider how well the enterprise risk management components are functioning over time. Also, it reviews risk and performance, and, if necessary, improves the company and their risk management.
 
'''Information, Communication, and Reporting.''' To communicate risk information and create reports on risk, culture, and performance to the company's key stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;''COSO: Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and Performance'' [https://www.coso.org/Documents/2017-COSO-ERM-Integrating-with-Strategy-and-Performance-Executive-Summary.pdf.] PDF. Retrieved 2017-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lam, James: ''Components of ERM.'' In: ''Enterprise Risk Management: From Incentives to Controls.'' Second Edition. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2014. P. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation of the ERM Model ==
'''Corporate governance'''

The Sarbanes Oxley Act, which was created in 2002 to prevent corporate fraud, was the reason for the rise of the importance of corporate governance. Hence the ERM requires that the following management responsibilities be assigned: to define a firm's “risk profile”; this means it is required to evaluate the firm's willingness to take risks and threats and the possible outcomes. This is important to determine proper investment asset allocation. Also, to ensure firm has necessary risk management skills. Risk management skills involves the risk management process which consists of 5 steps: risk assessment, risk analysis, risk treatment, risk acceptance, and risk communication. Thirdly, to establish the organization's structure with all roles and responsibilities. This involves assigning different enterprise risk management roles throughout the organization, and establishing a clear hierarchy structure.

Risk management integration also plays an important role in corporate governance. This means identifying the degree of harm derived from a certain threat or risk and balancing the costs and benefits of the possible methods to eliminate or reduce the risk.  It is crucial to establish risk assessment and audit processes to avoid corruption within a corporation's risk management process. There must be auditor's who authorize the decisions of the risk managers before they are implemented.

Setting the risk culture of the firm starting at the top: The CEO is an important step in corporate governance. Establishing a hierarchy chart for the company's risk management roles is a critical step to ensure clear communication of the tasks and duties in the ERM process. It is also important to create an ongoing employee training program; a strong employee training program means there is less employee mistakes therefore less money wasted within the corporation, and this could also avoid big issues such as bankruptcy or bad company reputation.

'''Management''''' ''

Using the concept of Line vs Staff Positions in the Firm ERM means that in certain situations the line managers should seek advice from the staff beneath them. Using the Line Vs Staff concept does the following: aligns the production process with the corporate  risk policy, incorporates expected losses and cost of risk capital  into production pricing and the hurdle rate, and creates an efficient and transparent risk review  process to give production managers better  understanding of acceptable risks.

This should help reduce the volatility of the company's earnings, thus enhancing shareholder value. With an organized approach to risk, a firm can better manage its risks and returns to make more informed decisions about capital and investments.

'''Portfolio management'''

ERM requires that management act as a portfolio fund manager who identifies the firm's risk profile which is essentially a representation at a given point of time of an organization's overall exposure to risks.  ERM also requires that management set risk limits within a range of risks. When risk taking is authorized''', '''risk limits are bounds placed on that risk-taking decision.

ERM produces diversification benefits for the company. Diversification benefit arises when two processes are not completely dependent on each other, and a bad (good) outcome for one process does not necessarily mean a bad (good) outcome for the other. Dependency and diversification are opposite sides of the same coin; when the strength of a dependency is increased, the level of diversification benefit is reduced.

=== Risk Transfer ===

One part of the ERM Model is Risk Transfer. Per the terms and conditions the CRO must decide to spread the risk to an external party or to retain the risks. If he spreads the risk then it moves to an external party, but it can also go to a subsidiary. In general, the companies transfer risk by purchasing different kinds of insurance. The three favorite types of insurance are workers' compensation, general liability, and property / casualty insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Lam, J. (2013). 2nd Edition - Enterprise risk management: from incentives to controls. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stakeholders Management ===

Stakeholders are all individuals or groups of people who are in contact with the company. As the need for information grows in importance, management must respond to better risk visibility for the stakeholder groups. These include employees, customers, supporters, offerers, business partners, creditors and other stakeholders. Stakeholder managers provide useful information about the risk situation and financial position to stakeholders so that they can make the right investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stakeholders Management (Skills &amp; Tools) - https://www.cleverism.com/skills-and-tools/stakeholder-management/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
The chief risk officer (CRO) is a senior executive officer that reports to the CEO and/or the board of directors. The CRO manages the risk management department and provides information to help mitigate internal and external risk factors of the company and ensures that the company is in compliance with government regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426611003104?via%3Dihub|title=Risk management, corporate governance, and bank performance in the financial crisis.

While heading the risk management department the CRO is allowed freedom to control and mitigate risk when it does not require a large demand. When the potential for risk is large, the CRO must report to the CEO and/or the board of directors for future action. Although the CRO's job is to minimize the potential risk in the company, risk as a factor cannot not be eliminated fully from a company.

The introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley act (SOX) has promoted the need and adaptation of the CRO role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/workshops/orgs-markets/past/pdf/Dobbin.pdf|title=The Chief Risk Officer as Trojan Horse {{!}} |website=chicagobooth.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main priority of the CRO is to ensure that the company complies with SOX to ensure they are following government regulations. SOX introduced new legal regulations that becomes legal and compliance risk(s) for companies. With the introduction of SOX, the corporate officers could be held liable for failure to produce accurate financial reports and standings in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/soa2002.pdf|title= PUBLIC LAW 107–204—JULY 30, 2002 {{!}} |website=sec.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRO's job is to help the company become compliant with government regulations, transparent, and help mitigate risk for the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17381">'''Demarketing''' may be considered “unselling” or “marketing in reverse”, which includes general and selective demarketing.&lt;ref name="Kotler1" /&gt;

Although the concept of demarketing lacks a precise theoretical definition, it refers to an attempt by the firm to discourage all or some of its customers from making purchases either temporarily or permanently. Since the initial interests in the subject area of how to market strategically in times of shortages began, different viewpoints have been offered as to how the firm should pursue demarketing.&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Q. Dadzie, Georgia State University, Demarketing strategy in shortage marketing environment,JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE · FEBRUARY 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of Demarketing==
While there are many definitions of demarketing—the common thread is the intent to decrease demand.

Businessdictionary.com defines demarketing as: Efforts aimed at discouraging (not destroying) the demand for a product which (1) a firm cannot supply in large-enough quantities, or (2) does not want to supply in a certain region where the high costs of distribution or promotion allow only a too little profit margin. Common demarketing strategies include higher prices, scaled-down advertising, and product redesign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/demarketing.html#ixzz3n5fazLTm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Websters dictionary, demarketing is “The use of advertising to decrease demand for a product that is in short supply.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demarketing&lt;/ref&gt;

A few other definitions include one from [http://dictionaryreference.com DictionaryReference.com]: “Advertising that urges the public to limit the consumption of a product, as at a time of shortage.”&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demarketing&lt;/ref&gt;

The All Business dictionary defines demarketing as: Marketers attempt to reduce the demand for a product when the demand for the product is greater than the manufacturer’s ability to produce it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-demarketing-4966214-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While demarketing may seem relatively new, it has in fact been around for decades.
In 1971 Phillip Kotler and Sidney Levy introduced the expression “demarketing” in a Harvard Business Review article titled “Demarketing, Yes, Demarketing.”&lt;ref name="Kotler2"/&gt;

Later in 1973, another article appeared in the [[Journal of Marketing]] by Phillip Kotler.  Here, Dr. Kotler elaborated on the “current demand level” and the “desired demand level” in the context of marketing. There is “underdemand, adequate demand, and overdemand.” Each demand situation requires different marketing approaches and corresponding tasks. Specifically, where there is overdemand, the marketing task is to reduce demand by “demarketing.” While demarketing reduces the demand without impugning the product, “countermarketing” seeks to destroy the demand for a product that is “unwholesome” on its face, such as “vice” products. Kotler also used the term “unsell” which “may also be viewed as an effort to sell something else.” Ahead of his time, Kotler observed “unselling (or demarketing) has as much social justification in a democracy as does selling.”&lt;ref name="Kotler1" /&gt;

Kotler also seemed to have anticipated the rise of “[[behavioral economics]]” when he observed in 1973 that “Efforts to turn off demand can profitably draw on certain concepts and theories in psychology” specifically, deconditioning, habit extinction theory, and learning and reinforcement theory.&lt;ref name="Kotler1" /&gt;

In 2011, Dr. Kotler teamed up with R. Craig Lefebvre to write Design Thinking, Demarketing and Behavioral Economics: Fostering Interdisciplinary Growth in Social Marketing. “As the growing number of governments, businesses and private funding sources focus on conditions of consumer excess, we see the social marketing paradigm expanding to accommodate this cultural shift to an Age of Demarketing.”&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1" /&gt;

==Reasons for Demarketing==
According to Lefebvre and Kotler (2011) “Demarketing can be viewed as blending all 4Ps of the [[marketing mix]] and also aiming for policy changes to nudge and sustain healthier and more socially responsible behavioral choices… (and) deeper understanding of the people we wish to serve, the environments in which they make choices, the market research we conduct and the programs we implement.”&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1" /&gt;

Mikl ́os-Thal and Juanjuan (2011) proposed that sellers use demarketing to strategically manage buyers’ quality perceptions. They observed that consistent with ostensible demarketing, Cialdini (1985) suggests a psychological tendency for humans to want things that are less available. Amaldoss and Jain (2005) show that limited availability satisfies consumers’ need for uniqueness, and Stock and Balachander (2005) demonstrate that scarcity can signal high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Mikl ́os-Thal, J. and Zhang Juanjuan (2011). Strategic Demarketing. University of California, San Diego, Faculty Seminars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the invent of demarketing in the 1970s, many different strategies for implementing demarketing have evolved.  Traditionally in marketing - which seeks to grow the consumer base and increase the demand for a product or service - the [[4 p's|4 P’s]] are [[Product (business)|product]], price, place/distribution and promotion.  The logic then follows that demarketing would adapt this structure to serve the opposite purpose of reducing the consumer base and discouraging demand for a product and service.  Instead of increasing availability of a product or service, a demarketing strategy would be to actually restrict availability.  Furthermore, demarketing would seek to increase availability of the alternatives and highlight the downside of the product or service, therefore making it less attractive to consumers.  To demarket in the pricing arena, the taxes or price might increase with the purpose of shrinking the demand.  Advertising can be minimized or eliminated.  The placement of a product/service or the size of the consumption space can be strategically changed to reduce the likelihood of consumption.  Another strategy would be to promote behavior that does not require the product or service being demarketed.&lt;ref&gt;Shiu, E. L. (2009). Demarketing tobacco through governmental policies – The 4Ps revisited. Journal of Business Research, 62, 269-278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demarketing strategies may differ when being used by a [[private firm]] versus a government entity.  Social marketing strategies have been widely implemented to demarket products or services that are perceived to be harmful or costly to society.  Traditional marketing principles also apply to [[social marketing]], which is used to advance or depress a social idea, cause or behavior.  Instead of talking about products, social marketing makes a proposition.  Instead of discussing placement of a service or product, it deals with accessibility to those services or products.  In place of promotion social marketing uses social communication to spread ideas.  Rather than price, the costs of involvement are highlighted by social marketing in ways that support their marketing or demarketing message.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie, K. P. (2009). Social marketing: A pathway to consumption reduction? Journal of Business Research, 62, 260-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demarketing activities discourage [[demand]]. This stands in sharp contrast to the objectives of marketing: create utility and enhance exchanges. In their provocative article "Demarketing, Yes, Demarketing," Kotler and Levy (1971) distinguish three types of demarketing situations.

===General demarketing===
General demarketing occurs when a seller shrinks the level of total demand. Suppliers of electricity and water use advertisements and publicity campaigns during periods of excess demand.&lt;ref name="Kotler2" /&gt;

===Selective demarketing===
Selective demarketing occurs when a company discourages demand from certain classes of consumers. Adult communities demarket properties to families with children, and producers of goods with a snob appeal avoid low-image retailers.&lt;ref name="Kotler2" /&gt;

===Ostensible demarketing===
Ostensible demarketing occurs when a seller creates an artificial or perceived shortage to whet consumer appetites. Limited distribution of goods may induce consumers to stockpile these “hard-to-get" items.&lt;ref name="Kotler2" /&gt;

Although Kotler and Levy (1971) emphasized the need for careful research into these phenomena, little effort has been devoted to the formal study of demarketing by marketers. This is not surprising, as marketers are trained to build demand rather than destroy it.

==Strategies==

===Price discriminating demarketing=== 
Salop (1977), Chiang and Spatt (1982), Narasimhan (1984), and Gerstner and Holthausen (1986) have shown that price discriminating firms may create transaction costs deliberately to discourage consumers from seeking the lowest price. Busy consumers pay higher prices, whereas those with small transaction costs pay lower prices. For example, some retailers hold "3-hour sales" from 8 to 11 Saturday morning. Consumers who get to the store before 11:00 am pay lower prices but incur the inconvenience of early morning shopping. Busy consumers who want a time-convenient product may pay a higher price for that product, so a firm may make the more convenient product more expensive.

===Bait and switch demarketing=== 
The bait-and-switch demarketing strategy is when a firm advertises one product in such a way that the intention is not that the consumers buy that product, but that they buy a more profitable product in its place. Gerstner and Hess (1990) and Chu, Gerstner and Hess (1992) studied disparagement of products in sales presentations or in point of-purchase displays that are designed to discourage consumers from buying featured brands. These practices, however, might be illegal.

===Stock outage demarketing===
Another known demarketing strategy is stock outage demarketing, where a firm actually plans a stock outage. Stock outages frustrate consumers, but stores often offer rain checks that guarantee delivery at a future date. Nevertheless, Hess and Gerstner (1987) showed that stores might profit from planned stock outages with rain checks because customers may visit the stores twice and buy complementary products on each visit. Balachander and Farquhar (1991) showed that deliberate stock outages help stores charge higher prices and earn higher profits. The possibility of a stock outage in one store makes customers more eager to buy when the other store has the product in stock.

===Crowding costs demarketing===
Crowding cost demarketing is a strategy implemented on “Black Friday” when crowds will deter many consumers from purchasing a product at a lower price.&lt;ref name="Gerstner" /&gt; Retail stores, hotels, and airlines have limited capacities. A low price usually attracts large numbers of shoppers, so customers must hunt for space in crowded parking lots and stand in long checkout lines. Businesses may deliberately accept capacity constraints, recognizing that some customers would trade the higher prices for reduced crowding. Gerstner (1986) derived symmetric equilibrium prices and crowding costs in such markets.

===Differentiation Demarketing=== 
On the other hand, there has been growing scholarly interest in issues that can be construed as demarketing. There are numerous specific strategies for demarketing that would fall within the 4 P’s definitions, although the demarketing terminology is not used. Eitan Gerstner, James Hess and Wujin Chu discuss a few of them in their 1993 article, “Demarketing as a Differentiation Strategy”. The differentiation strategy means that a firm might use a “nuisance factor” that actually drives consumers away from them, and into the arms of their competitors in order to keep their prices elevated. This can also be used to avoid a price war with that competitor.&lt;ref name="Gerstner" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Healthcare===
An example of demarketing in action is the demarketing of healthcare consumption that occurred in Canada in the 1990s.  Canada’s social healthcare system was under stress from overuse or inefficient use.  In order to combat these issues, Dr. Gurprit Kindra, from the University of Ottawa made strategic suggestions in an article he wrote in 1995.  Kindra suggested that some co-payments and user fees be applied to discourage consumption.  He also proposed that a system geared toward more managed care would reduce the number of services being accessed if patients were required to get a referral from a primary point of contact before seeing other specialties.  Among his other suggestions were health promotion and education for the general public that would encourage less utilization of the healthcare services and reducing the convenience to patients by restricting access to free or deeply discounted services like Canada’s publicly subsidized urgent care facilities and instead make available privatized fast-lane services for those consumers who are willing to pay more.&lt;ref&gt;Kindra, G. S. (1995, Summer). Demarketing Inappropriate Healthcare Consumption: Canada's prized health care system suffers from chronic overuse. Journal of Healthcare Marketing, 15(2), 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borkowski, N. M. (1994, Winter). Demarketing of Health Services. Journal of Healthcare Marketing, 14(4), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper Reduction===
Promoting the use of paperless products at home and in the office to save the trees, is an example of demarketing paper products. Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin, and other states are now issuing electronic vehicle titles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcentv.com/story/23947884/tx-dept-of-motor-vehicles-launches-first-paperless-vehicle-title-system&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Conservation===
Due to the severe drought, the State of California has been restricting water usage, while providing tax rebates for installing synthetic turf. An average home that converts to artificial grass saves about 22,000 gallons of water per year.&lt;ref&gt;The Orange County Register, April 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon Footprint===
Imposing tight regulations on coal by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and promoting the use of natural gas at power plants to reduce carbon emissions will accelerate the decline of coal for electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;Getty Images The Hill, Timothy Cama - 06/11/14 06:00 AM EDT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junk Food===
Promoting high fiber, organic, and healthy products against food and beverages with [[saturated fat]], [[high fructose corn syrup]], and artificial ingredients helps to prevent [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], and other diseases.

===Cigarettes as a “Vice” Product=== 
While demarketing may be employed to decrease demand, countermarketing seeks to destroy demand. Strategies include promoting [[anti-smoking]]/health themes, taxes on tobacco products, imposing mandatory warning labels, decreasing advertising spaces, increasing pricing, and restricting the consumption space in favor of [[nicotine patches]], Nicorette gum,  and Nicorette lozenges.

==Unintended Outcomes==
Research points to behavioral reactions to anti-drug ads that go in the opposite direction from that which was intended. In other words, a boomerang effect occurs where greater levels of exposure to anti-drug campaign results in potentially increased use of drugs. The thinking is that anti-drug publicity may convey the idea that “everyone’s doing it.”
 
In addition, it is possible that the ads had an unintended positive impact on perceptions towards drugs by portraying “benefits” associated with using, an association possibly strengthened by repeated exposure to messages and images suggesting the "good-times" people have while on drugs. Beliefs and behaviors of youths were also affected by perceptions regarding older peers.
 
Further, ABC News reported findings in 2008 that the federal government’s effort to keep youngsters from using drugs “is unlikely to have had favorable effects on youths.” State government efforts have also come under criticism. A December, 2008, article in Science Daily about an effort by the state of Montana states: “An independent review investigating the effectiveness of a publicly funded graphic anti-methamphetamine advertising campaign has found that the campaign has been associated with many negative outcomes.” &lt;ref&gt;Who is Winning the War on Drugs?

'''Detroit Media Partnership, L.P.''' manages the business operations - including production, advertising and circulation - for the two leading [[Detroit]] newspapers: ''[[The Detroit News]]'' and ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''.  Detroit Media Partnership also handles Detroit-area circulation for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[Investor's Business Daily]]'', and ''[[Financial Times]]''.

Its headquarters are in [[Downtown Detroit]].&lt;ref name=contact&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.detroitmedia.com/contact-us| title=Contact Us| publisher=Detroit Media Partnership| accessdate=2014-05-16| quote="Mailing Address: Detroit Media Partnership; 615 W.

==History==
Detroit Media Partnership is the result of a 100-year [[joint operating agreement]] between the ''Detroit Free Press'' and ''The Detroit News''.  In 1987, the newspapers entered into the agreement, combining business operations while maintaining separate editorial staffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Austin|first1=Dan|title=Detroit News Building|url=http://historicdetroit.org/building/detroit-news-building/|website=historicdetroit.org|publisher=Historic Detroit|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two papers also began to publish joint Saturday and Sunday editions, though the editorial content of each remained separate. At the time, the ''Detroit Free Press'' was the 10th highest circulation paper in the [[United States]], and the combined ''Detroit News'' and ''Free Press'' was the country's fourth-largest Sunday paper.

Originally called the Detroit Newspaper Agency, the company was reorganized and renamed after [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] sold ''The Detroit News'' to [[MediaNews Group]], and purchased the ''Detroit Free Press'' from [[Knight Ridder]]. Each paper now publishes separate editions Monday through Saturday, with the Detroit Free Press publishing the Sunday newspaper.

In February 2014, the Partnership announced all three units would occupy six floors in both the old and new sections of former [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building|Detroit Branch Building]] of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]].  The partnership anticipated completing the move before September and expected to place a sign on the exterior.&lt;ref name=move&gt;{{cite web| title=Free Press, News moving to new home in core of downtown Detroit| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20140219/BUSINESS06/302190176/detroit-free-press-building-moves-federal-reserve| last1=Zaniewski| first1=Ann| last2=Gallagher| first2=John| work=Detroit Free Press| date=20 February 2014| accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aguilar&gt;{{cite news| title=Detroit News, Free Press, DMP will occupy 6 floors in old Federal Reserve building| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140423/BIZ03/304230078| last=Aguilar| first=Louis| work=The Detroit News| date=23 April 2014| accessdate=2014-05-16| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425194807/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140423/BIZ03/304230078| archivedate=25 April 2014| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edgar William Brandt''' (1880–1960) was a [[France|French]] [[ironwork]]er, prolific weapons designer and head of a company that designed 60mm, 81mm and 120mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] that were very widely copied throughout and subsequent to World War II. He also invented discarding-[[sabot]] [[artillery]] shells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ian V. Hogg, |title=German Secret Weapons of the Second World War: The Missiles, Rockets, Weapons and New Technology of the Third Reich (Greenhill Military Paperbacks) |publisher=Greenhill Books |location=London |year= |isbn=1-85367-510-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed substantially through his development of [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] rifle grenades to the development of effective HEAT-warhead weapons for infantry anti-tank use.

In 1902, Brandt set up the business ''établissements Brandt'', where he produced ironwork and light armaments; this was based at 76 rue Michel-Ange in [[Paris]].

His company was nationalised in 1936, and subsequently it purchased several engineering companies including the ''société Mécanique Industrielle de Précision (MIP)'' at [[Tulle]] in 1938. The same year, Brandt opened a major facility at [[La Ferté-Saint-Aubin]] which became the company's headquarters.

In 1956 [[Hotchkiss et Cie]] merged with établissements Brandt to form the Hotchkiss-Brandt company, which ten years later merged with [[Thomson-CSF|Thomson]] and became ''Thomson-Brandt Armements''. After further evolutions, the company is now called [[TDA Armements SAS]] and is a part of the [[Thales Group]].

He also was a very fine artist. He made things out of metal like his very fine Firescreen he created for a fireplace.

== Products ==
Some of the products designed and built by Brandt's company and its successors include:

* [[Brandt 60 mm LR Gun-mortar]]
* [[Brandt Mle CM60A1]] 60 mm gun-mortar
* [[Brandt Mle 27/31]] 81 mm mortar

L|publisher=UOL|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- == Histórico do processo eletrônico no Brasil ==
=== Primeira fase: o início ===
O processo eletrônico no sentido amplo, ou seja, o uso do computador no processo, remonta há décadas,&lt;ref name="RPE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.processoeletronico.com.br/page003.aspx|title=Breve Retrospecto do Processo Civil|publisher=Revista de Processo Eletrônico|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sendo possível identificar algumas iniciativas embrionárias em vários Tribunais do País, as quais foram evoluindo, com o uso posterior de outros sistemas e aplicativos, bem como novas linguagens.
Já no sentido estrito não é mais recente a primeira aparição do uso do audio como elemento de autos, inclusive remontando há séculos,&lt;ref name="RJMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aplicacao.mp.mg.gov.br/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/263/novas%20perspectivas%20uso%20taquigrafia_Santos.pdf?sequence=1|title=Diálogo Multidisciplinar|publisher=Revista Jurídica do Ministério Público, Vol. 6|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; caracterizando uma forma eletrônica de armazenamento principal de atos processuais.

=== Segunda fase: a evidência ===
A fase de maior evidência do ''processo eletrônico'' se iniciou em 2006,&lt;ref name="RD2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://direito2.com/tjgo/2008/jun/20/lenar-destaca-projudi-como-renovacao-para-o-judiciario|title=Lenar destaca Projudi como renovação para o Judiciário|author=TJGO|date=20/06/2008|publisher=Revista Direito2|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; com o lançamento do projeto [[PROJUDI]], de iniciativa do órgão oficial [[CNJ]]. A partir de então, crescentemente, os Tribunais passaram a apresentar uma maior movimentação de fluxo de informações ao público externo, bem como trabalhos internos, voltados ao desenvolvimento deste ramo da administração, sobretudo a partir do uso do respectivo sistema, com todas as suas implementações (aplicativos) em todo o país, passando pelas fases de teste, produção e uso estável.

=== A fase atual ===
No momento atual, coexistem diversos sistemas e aplicativos de processos em diversos tribunais. O [[CNJ]]&lt;ref name="CNJPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br|title=Página Principal|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; vem apresentando o novo projeto [[PJe]], aquele que vem obtendo mais evidência no trânsito de informações e mais ocorrências nas pesquisas relacionadas à atividade atual desta área. O material obtido acerca do projeto afirma ser o mesmo uma soma de esforços e utilizações de vários sistemas já testados no âmbito das Justiças Federal e do Trabalho. Ao mesmo momento, percebe-se a a existência do projeto [[Slapsoftware]], uma iniciativa não governamental de processo eletrônico, que, segundo o material obtido, afirma ser o primeiro sistema a seguir o paradigma de [[software livre]], não contradiz o projeto oficial, propondo uma união de esforços, submetendo-se às determinações do [[CNJ]] quanto ao Judiciário, e até mesmo propondo a fusão com o [[PJe]]. Por outro lado, alguns aplicativos também são desenvolvidos por empresas privadas, autoras de alguns dos sistemas e aplicativos já citados. Aqui se deve registrar uma diferença de paradigma, a saber. O projeto do organismo governamental segue a política que vem buscando, desde o início, de condicionar o uso dos aplicativos desenvolvidos aos processos que têm os autos armazenados em meio eletrônico, ou seja, o processo eletrônico em sentido estrito. Já o [[Slapsoftware]] permite o uso dos mesmos aplicativos para ambas as formas de armazenamento, bem como um modelo misto de participação pública e privada, ou seja, atividades como especificação e parametrização de aplicativos, bem como a distribuição e suporte por parte de empresas privadas.

=== Poder judiciário ===
Desde 2009, os sistemas e aplicativos no [[Poder Judiciário]], sobretudo os que gerenciam o [[processo judicial]] devem respeitar determinações e recomendações do [[CNJ]].&lt;ref name="CNJCPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br/sgt/consulta_publica_classes.php|title=Sistema de Gestão de Tabelas Processuais Unificadas|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tais [[norma]]s dizem respeito, entre as principais questões, à [[classificação]] de processos e atos para fins [[Estatística|estatísticos]], ou seja, com objetivo de [[controle]] de produtividade, definição de meios de atuação para correções de distorções e diagnósticos em geral das demandas e suas causas. Entre os mecanismos mediatos de classificação está a '''numeração única'''.&lt;ref name="CNJNU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnj.jus.br/programas-de-a-a-z/eficiencia-modernizacao-e-transparencia/pj-numeracao-unica|title=Numeração Única|author=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|publisher=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poderes executivo e legislativo===
É menor o número de informações sobre o desenvolvimento de sistemas processuais neste [[Órgão público|órgãos]], bem como para os processos [[Processo administrativo|administrativos]] e [[Processo legislativo|legislativos]], entretanto, se percebe, a partir de uma minuciosa pesquisa, uma demanda reprimida em relação ao uso de tais sistemas para uma abrangência maior de processos. Embora se trate do mesmo tema, vez por outra tais sistemas vêm sendo referidos como elementos autônomos.&lt;ref name="JNPAE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/18959/processo-administrativo-eletrônico|title=Processo Administrativo Eletrônico|author=Correa, D. B. R|date=01/07/2010|publisher=Jus Navigandi|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== O processo eletrônico e a empresa privada ==
A [[iniciativa privada]] participa, com expressiva presença, no mercado destinado ao desenvolvimento de sistemas para processos, tanto os que possuem os autos eletrônicos como aqueles que, no modelo tradicional, são manuseados em papel e registrados e acompanhados pelo sistema.

== Nomes primitivos do processo eletrônico ==
=== Processo virtual ===
O primeiro nome dado ao ''processo eletrônico'' foi  ''processo virtual''. Processo virtual, conceito de [[direito processual civil]],&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comentários ao Código de Processo Civil, Atualizado por Sérgio Bermudes|last=Pontes de Miranda|first=Francisco Cavalcanti|volume=1|pagess=692,1872|publisher=Forense}}&lt;/ref&gt; relativo ao tema específico da formação do processo, da [[Ação (direito)|ação]] e da [[lide]], é aquele processo '''eventual''', aquele que pode vir a ser processo ou, enfim, o processo que não existe, senão numa construção hipotética. A conveniência do uso deste nome, decorrente da [[metáfora]] da "navegação virtual", como ato de usar a [[rede mundial de computadores]] logo passou a ser revista e tal denominação foi abandonada. Ainda hoje, entretanto, algumas poucas ocorrências desta expressão são encontradas como denotativas do armazenamento de [[autos]] em [[arquivos]].

=== Processo digital ===
[[Digital]], uma contraposição a analógico (relógio digital é aquele possui marcações discretas e informa os dados por [[dígito]]s, que são, em última instância, resultante de operações binárias, ao contrário do analógico que marca continuamente). A difusão do computator e da metáfora da "era digital" como a era dos [[bits]] entratanto, acabou por cunhar esta expressão como uma alternativa para o ''processo eletrônico'', como já explanado anteriormente na enumeração dos ''sistemas'' e ''aplicativos''.
--&gt;

== Law ==
In Brazil, since 2006, there is a law dealing about the electronic process,&lt;ref name="LTR"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ltreditora.com.br/comentarios-a-lei-do-processo-eletronico.html|title=Comentários à Lei do Processo Eletrônico|last=Chaves Júnior|first=José Eduardo de Resende|publisher=LTR|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it's the Law nº 11419 of 2006, without which there would not be the possibility of the phenomenon in its strict sense, that is the substitution of paper as primary source of information. This law is also important to kill the polemic about the validity of non-traditional communications means in legal procedures enrolled by former rules.

The '''Ethisphere Institute''' is a [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]-based organization that defines and measures corporate ethical standards, recognizes companies that excel, and promotes best practices in [[business ethics|corporate ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethisphere.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=Ethisphere Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company publishes ''Ethisphere Magazine'' and announces its World's Most Ethical Companies awards once a year. The company also offers verification services for corporate ethics under such names as "Ethics Inside Certification" and "Compliance Leader Verification". It hosts the Global Ethics Summit every March in [[New York City]] and manages a community of compliance, ethics and legal professionals known as BELA, the Business Ethics Leadership Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiPietro|first1=Ben|title=What Matters More: Focusing on Rules or Creating Ethical Culture?|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2016/03/15/what-matters-more-following-rules-or-creating-ethical-culture/|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== History==
The Executive Chairman of Ethisphere, Alex Brigham, created the institute in 2007, as part of Corpedia, a compliance training company. In 2010, Corpedia was sold but Ethisphere's ownership was retained by Brigham. Tim Erblich is Ethisphere's  CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ethisphere.com/who-we-are/leadership/|website=Ethisphere|publisher=Ethisphere |title=Who We Are}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 Slate article, raised the issue of the difficult balance between granting ethics awards while operating as a for-profit business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2010/03/its_all_good.html |title=It's All Good |publisher=slate.com |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Ethisphere's framework for measuring standards is known as the Ethics Quotient (EQ). In 2016, the EQ consists of over 160 questions in 5 major categories. Companies are measured not only absolutely but also in relation to others in their industry. The EQ is updated annually and informed by a Methodology Advisory Panel whose members are publicly listed.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32770">'''Fund governance''' refers to a system of checks and balances and work performed by the governing body (board) of an [[investment fund]] to ensure that the fund is operated in the best interests of the fund and its investors.&lt;ref name="SEC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.htm|title=Investment Company Governance|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=16 January 2006 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of fund governance is to uphold the regulatory principles commonly known as the four pillars of investor protection that are typically promulgated through the investment fund regulation applicable in the jurisdiction of the fund.&lt;ref name="Shadab"/&gt; These principles vary by jurisdiction and in the US, the [[Investment Company Act of 1940|1940 Act]] generally ensure that: (i) The investment fund will be managed in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives, (ii) The assets of the investment fund will be kept safe, (iii) When investors redeem they will get their pro rata share of the investment fund’s assets, (iv) The investment fund will be managed for the benefit of the fund’s shareholders and not its service providers.&lt;ref name="SEC2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1999/spch279.htm|title=Maintaining the Pillars of Protection in the New Millennium|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 May 1999 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund governance structures==
===Offshore investment funds===
Offshore investment funds are typically formed as companies in the [[Cayman Islands]] (85%).&lt;ref name="MourantOzannes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mourantozannes.com/media/452717/the-cayman-islands-a-guide-for-hedge-fund-managers.pdf|title=The Cayman Islands: A Guide for Hedge Fund Managers|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=April 2014 |publisher=[[Mourant Ozannes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ELTOMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eltoma-global.com/en/jurisdictions/cayman-islands/hedge-fund.html|title=Hedge Fund|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=April 2014 |publisher=[[Eltoma Global]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; When an investment fund is formed as a company, its governing body is its board of directors. In this context, fund governance is commonly referred to as “fund directorships” or “independent director services”.&lt;ref name="Hedgeweek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2013/06/04/185273/independent-directors-considerations-and-queries|title=Independent Directors: Considerations and Queries|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=27 January 2014 |work=[[Hedge Week]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offshore funds are commonly structured as a “[[Master-feeder|feeder]]” funds that will generally invest all monies received directly into a “[[Master-feeder|master]]” fund.&lt;ref name="HF Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.dmsoffshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/HFLR-Reprint-04_11_13-How-Can-Hedge-Fund-Managers-Use-Advisory-Committees-to-Manage-Conflicts-of-Interest-and-Mitigate-Operational-Risks-Part-1-and.pdf|title=How Can Hedge Fund Managers Use Advisory Committees to Manage Conflicts of Interest and Mitigate Operational Risks? (Part One of Two)|volume=6|issue=5|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=11 April 2011 |work=[[Hedge Fund Law Report]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Onshore investment funds===
Onshore investment fund are typically formed as [[limited partnership|limited partnerships (LPs)]] in the United States, most commonly in [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name="SSRN"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2265663|title=Are Hedge Funds Registered in Delaware Different?|date=December 2014 |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds typically serve as the “master” fund to the offshore feeder fund.&lt;ref name="HF Law"/&gt;  The governing body (board) of the LP is its [[General partnership|general partner (GP)]] which is usually under the sole control and direction of the investment manager or fund sponsor. This structure is increasingly being challenged by institutional investors&lt;ref name="Gerald Kerner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hflawreport.com/issue/296|title=Indemnification Stanley Druckenmiller's Counsel Provides a Tutorial for Negotiating Exculpation, Indemnification, Redemption, Withdrawal and Amendment Provisions in Hedge Fund Governing Documents|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=5 February 2014 |work=[[Hedge Fund Law Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Druckenmiller"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-28/druckenmiller-lawyer-takes-on-hedge-funds-over-contracts|title=Druckenmiller Lawyer Takes On Hedge Funds Over Contracts|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=28 January 2014 |work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other stakeholders  to implement more independent governance and investor friendly mechanisms typically in the form of [[advisory boards]] or independent GPs or managing members.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bna.com/hedge-fund-governance-and-sec-enforcement-proceedings/|title=Hedge Fund Governance and SEC Enforcement Proceedings|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 October 2013 |publisher=Bloomberg BNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit trusts===
Investment funds can also be formed as unit trusts with a board of trustees as its governing body.&lt;ref name="Unit Trust"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/uit.htm|title=Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 October 2013 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of governance==
The role of fund governance comprises both [[fiduciary duties]] and responsibilities owed by the governing body (board).&lt;ref name="Shadab"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2234482|author=Shadab, Houman B.|title=Hedge Fund Governance|date=19 November 2013 |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fiduciary duties are prescribed by the applicable laws of the fund’s jurisdiction and are inviolable. Responsibilities are prescribed through contractual terms in the various fund documents.&lt;ref name="SEC1"/&gt; Fund governance responsibilities can vary widely between investment funds because fund documents are commonly negotiated between fund stakeholders based on their various (often competing) requirements and objectives. Although the objective of fund governance is investor protection, fiduciary duties typically require the board to act in the best interest of a fund taken as whole and not any particular investor.&lt;ref name="SEC2"/&gt;

==Key differences between fund governance and corporate governance==
Fund governance is often conflated with corporate governance. Although some principles and practices appear similar, there are important differences.&lt;ref name="AIMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/4898EC23-66AA-4065-8EAD6137DEBC8126|title=Corporate governance challenges for hedge fund boards|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=March 2014 |publisher=[[Alternative Investment Management Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notably:

===Legal structure===
Not all funds are formed as corporations and the legal form of the fund structure does not remove the need for sound fund governance.&lt;ref name="SEC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEC2"/&gt;

===Employees===
Unlike corporations, investment funds typically don't have any employees to manage or lead.&lt;ref name="AIMA"/&gt; Corporate directors have more authority and a more complex set of duties to execute, such as approving major corporate investment and financial policies, monitoring diverse accounting systems, and selecting and terminating top corporate executives. Compared to hedge funds, the regulatory and competitive issues facing each company are highly idiosyncratic.&lt;ref name="Clifford"&gt;{{Citation|author=Clifford, Christopher|date=2014|title=Hedge Fund Boards|publisher=University of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment funds operate by appointing service providers under service agreements with the fund and each service provider is governed by its own governing body independently of the fund.&lt;ref name="AIMA"/&gt;  This means that fund directors do not have any authority to direct the affairs of the service providers to the fund other than under the contractual responsibilities outlined in the service agreement.  Day-to-day managerial responsibilities are typically delegated to the investment manager and fund administrator. Compared to large corporations, hedge funds are relatively homogenous, and the duties of their directors are relatively limited and standardized. These factors should reduce the required time investment and increase the scalability of the director's human capital such that it can be employed efficiently across many funds.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

===Investors===
Corporations offer their shares publicly and widely typically with no qualification requirements.  Funds offer their shares privately on a restricted basis to sophisticated investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sophisticatedinvestor.asp Investopedia "Sophisticated Investor"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategy===
Corporations don’t have a rulebook (like an [[offering circular|offering memorandum]]) or delegated structure so corporate directors are responsible for formulating and implementing strategy to ensure the success of the corporation.  Corporate directors have a dual role of adviser and monitor, but this is not the case in a fund. Fund directors typically serve as a monitor since the fund is usually formed to pursue the investment objective defined by the investment manager as negotiated and agreed in the fund documents by its various stakeholders.  Fund directors will typically not have any responsibility for the investment strategy as the investment manager is not an employee of the fund unlike the CEO in a corporation.  Thus, “the advisory role of hedge fund directors is limited when compared to that of corporate directors.  For example, hedge fund directors do not advise the manager on portfolio strategy or security selection.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

==Growth of the professional fund governance firm==
Fund governance became a major fund servicing industry following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]] “spurred (by) several media reports arguing that professional directors must be too busy to provide the appropriate level of monitoring for their clients.”&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Consequently, many fund governance firms proliferated in response to perceived demand for independent directors for hedge funds and the low barriers to entry evident in the industry. A ‘[[gold rush]]’ mentality developed worldwide after articles by the Financial Times&lt;ref name = "FT 20112011a"&gt;{{cite news| title= Cayman directors sit on hundreds of boards|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/913e31b6-114a-11e1-a95c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3fxldNH3L |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=FT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the New York Times&lt;ref name = "DealbookNY01072012b"&gt;{{cite news| title= Serving on Many Boards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/02/business/dealbook/serving-on-many-boards.html|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=DealBook}}&lt;/ref&gt; sensationalized fund directors in the Cayman Islands as having ‘hundreds’ of directorships.&lt;ref name = "FT 20112011b"&gt;{{cite news| title= Less is more for Cayman ‘jumbo-directors’|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0ef083c8-1157-11e1-a95c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3fxldNH3L |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=FT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "DealbookNY01072012"&gt;{{cite news| title= In Caymans, It’s Simple to Fill a Hedge Fund Board|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/in-caymans-its-simple-to-fill-a-hedge-fund-board/?_r=0 |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DealbookNY01072012b"/&gt; Serving as a fund director was portrayed as a [[sinecure]]  because anyone, anywhere in the world, could serve as a director on a Cayman Islands mutual fund (the FT articles were later critiqued by the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'').&lt;ref name="CJR"&gt;{{Citation|author=Chittum, Ryan|date=11 November 2011|title=FT Style Undermines A Good Investigation|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this critical media scrutiny, the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]] implemented a number of reforms under the [[Cayman Islands Directors Registration and Licensing Law, 2014|Director Registration and Licensing Law, 2014]] which required all directors of Cayman Islands regulated mutual funds to become regulated.  As of 31 May 2015, the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]] reported that there were 8,879 directors on Cayman Islands funds of which only 422 were based in the Cayman Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimoney.com.ky/ Cayman Islands Monetary Authority "CIMA"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional firms vs. proprietors==
Fund governance providers range from limited-resourced, proprietorships of part-time directors (or so-called ‘boutique’ firms) to fully resourced professional services firms of full-time directors, “organized similarly to large law or accounting firms”.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; In many parts of the world, serving as a fund director remains a [[cottage industry]]  where proponents argue that fund governance is different from the other services provided to the fund and not adaptable to the professional firm approach.  This mindset appears to be supported by the law in several jurisdictions that mandate that only “natural persons” provide director services.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Opponents  of the proprietor approach argue that boards should not be “dominated by part-timers at a time when they need to be vigilant about avoiding future crises”&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; and that professional funds “would never buy legal services or management advice from people only willing to spare a few hours a month”.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

Professional fund governance firms are also referred to as Board Service Providers (BSPs).&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://intranet.law.ox.ac.uk/ckfinder/userfiles/files/66_Stan_L_Rev_1051_BainbridgeHenderson.pdf|title=BOARDS-R-US: Reconceptualizing Corporate Boards|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=16 July 2015 |work=[[Stanford Law Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents argue that directors are independent service providers to a fund equivalent to its auditors, administrators and attorneys, all of whom use a professional firm approach and the same professional standards and expectations should also apply to fund governance.&lt;ref name="hedgeweek2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/12/19/215050/split-boards-favoured-fund-governance-intensifies|title=Split boards favoured as fund governance intensifies|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=19 December 2014 |work=Hedge Week }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.K. all professional investment funds are required by law to appoint a BSP as an Authorised Corporate Director.  In the United States of America, BSPs are not required by law, but the SEC does “require funds to explicitly authorize the independent directors to hire employees and to retain advisers and experts necessary to carry out their duties”&lt;ref name = "SECIV"&gt;{{cite article| title= Part IV Securities and Exchange Commission|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.pdf |accessdate=15 July 2015|work=SEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-financial crisis and several spectacular fund governance failures, there has been much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the [[Stanford Law Review]], [[University of Kentucky]] and [[University of Cambridge]] among many others.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, and for good reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"/&gt;

Empirical and anecdotal evidence from other fund services providers such as legal, administration and audit also supports the professional firm approach and it continues to dominate the professional fund industry. As such professional fund governance firms have the “economies of scale to attract the best board members, introduce more rigorous training programs and develop the best proprietary knowledge”&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21612147-case-outsourcing-company-boards-replacing-board|title=Replacing the board|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=16 Aug 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  plus economies of scale and scope allow firms to increase quality and/or lower cost by finding efficiencies in production, spreading fixed costs across a larger asset base and investing in technology.&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"/&gt; Independent researchers further argue that BSPs bring “collective expertise, from the ability to process huge quantities of information to specialist advice”&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1"/&gt; use the power of technology for business intelligence, process management and information access to make fast and accurate decisions.

==Notable fund governance scandals and failures==
===Bear Stearns===
The Bear Stearns case is widely regarded as the seminal case of legal counsel conflicts among hedge fund directors.  Investors in the funds lost approximately $1.6 billion and “the two supposedly independent directors appointed by Walkers to serve Cioffi’s two hedge funds were Scott Lennon and Michelle Wilson-Clarke”&lt;ref name="CohanNYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/the-other-offshore-disaster/|title=The Other Offshore Disaster|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=24 June 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; were found by the Cayman Islands court to be conflicted as they were employees of an affiliate of [[Walkers (law firm)|Walkers]].   In his judgment the Chief Justice of the Cayman Islands said “For reasons which I need not elaborate now (but would be prepared to if asked), I am led to an irresistible impression that the manner of the conduct of the directors, trustee and the lawyers advising them” — all Walkers employees — “over the resolutions for winding up was clandestine and suspicious and was certainly in breach of the strict prohibition — against such a resolution being taken during the pendancy of the investors’ petition for the removal of the directors."&lt;ref name="CohanNYTimes"/&gt;

===Sark Lark===
During the 1980s, Sark was notorious for the emergence of the so-called “nominee director” practice&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/25/offshore-secrets-sark-lark-britons|title=The 'Sark Lark' Britons scattered around the world|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=25 November 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |last1=Leigh|first1=David|last2=Frayman|first2=Harold|last3=Ball|first3=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. where the director is in name only and does not exercise his judgment independently but rather acts like an automaton under the control of another person.  
The most infamous example was in 1999, when Guinness world record holder and Sark resident Phil Crowshaw was found to have singlehandedly held 3,378 directorships registered in Sark, 1,312 registered directorships in England and more than 2,000 directorships registered in Dublin and Isle of Man.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/doors-open-to-reveal-secret-world-of-britains-offshore-tax-havens-1185984.html|title=Doors open to reveal secret world of Britain's offshore tax havens|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=20 November 1998 |work=[[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later disqualified as a director by courts in Guernsey and the U.K. yet he was only one of “a group of residents who between them held directorships of thousands of companies scattered far and wide”.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;  These individuals were engaged in “the totally unacceptable practice of renting out their names as company directors without any real knowledge of what the companies are up to.”&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;  
In response [[Jack Straw]], the [[Home Secretary]] commissioned Andrew Edwards, former UK Treasury director to investigate these practices among Britain’s offshore dependencies.&lt;ref name="Independent2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/stamping-out-the-sark-lark-1102707.html|title=Stamping out the Sark Lark|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=27 June 1999 |work=[[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265705/4109.pdf|title=Review of Financial Regulation in the Crown Dependencies|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=November 1998 |publisher=The Stationery Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the Edwards report called for various reforms including that “Guernsey, Alderney and Sark should introduce a system of licensing and registering directors and bring in a code of conduct governing the standards expected from directors and trustees.”  The Edwards report “also called for a limit to be set on the number of directorships held by individuals, suggesting a ceiling of five trading companies or 30 asset-holding (fund) companies”.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; The Sark Lark ignited the debate about director capacity and the backlash against independent directors in offshore jurisdictions.  It was the genesis of the now discredited notion that caps on directorships would improve director performance or the number of directorships held is a proxy for director performance.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20451176|title=Tax evasion flourishing with help from UK firms|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=25 November 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several jurisdictions arbitrarily introduced caps on director capacity based on the Edwards report. However, as recently as November, 2012, BBC reported that the Sark Lark was still thriving.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20495222|title=Cable to review 'sham' company directors|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=26 November 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weavering Capital===
{{see also|Grey Wolf (film)#Weavering Capital}}
The Weavering case was widely regarded as the seminal case on hedge fund directors’ duties and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/weavering-capital-boss-magnus-peterson-guilty-fraud|title=Weavering Capital boss found guilty of forgery and fraud|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=19 January 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |last1=Bowers|first1=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund Limited was listed on the [[Irish Stock Exchange]] and its directors Stefan Peterson and Hans Ekstrom were considered independent and in good standing under the Irish Stock Exchange standards. However, they were later found guilty by a Cayman Islands Court of being negligent in carrying out their fiduciary duties, and were held liable for US $111 million in damages.&lt;ref name="Mondaq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/caymanislands/x/375498/Commodities+Derivatives+Stock+Exchanges/Cayman+Court+Of+Appeal+Reverses+US111+Million+Judgment+Against|title=Cayman Court Of Appeal Reverses US$111 Million Judgment Against Weavering Directors|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=18 February 2015 |publisher=Mondaq }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was reversed on appeal and currently pending appeal to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The Weavering Capital Scandal became notorious because the Managing Director of the UK Management Company, Magnus Peterson, was jailed for 13 years on 8 counts of Fraud in 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/11365885/Weavering-hedge-fund-founder-Magnus-Peterson-jailed-for-13-years-over-fraud.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the discovery that he had illegally used investors money to fund personal projects such as the ''[[Grey Wolf (Film)]]''.

==Fund governance standards==
===Reputational capital===
Successful fund governance firms have been criticized by their competitors in ‘boutique’ firms for having too many directorships or being “rubber stamp” directors.  However, independent empirical research has consistently revealed these allegations as counterfactual. Some studies&lt;ref name="Masulis"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Are All Inside Directors the Same|date=4 September 2012|publisher=SSRN|ssrn = 1108036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jof"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X13000470|title=Are All Inside Directors the Same|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=4 February 2013|journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=109|pages=63–82|doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.02.004|last1=Field|first1=Laura|last2=Lowry|first2=Michelle|last3=Mkrtchyan|first3=Anahit}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used the number of directorships held by a director as a proxy for the reputational capital of the director - arguing that reputational incentives are particularly pronounced for professional hedge fund directors, and that directors who sit on more boards and the boards of better performing funds should be of higher quality. Thus, hiring a director who can be credibly perceived as being more independent could provide valuable certification for the fund.&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt; Busy professional directors are more common among funds that derive higher benefits from external certification and monitoring, and their departure from the board is associated with outflows of investor capital. This result is inconsistent with directors serving as uninformative (or most nefariously, pro-management) rubber-stamps and inconsistent with the theory that funds prefer rubber-stamp directors who face more time constraints, making them too busy to monitor the manager.&lt;ref name="AIMAgovernance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/C511D286-70DE-4849-9A75AA28A66354A7|title=How to run offshore management companies and funds with substance and corporate governance|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=1 September 2013|publisher=Alternative Investment Management Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting shares===
An inordinate amount of scrutiny has been placed on issue of board capacity and composition to improve board performance, but those factors may become irrelevant to boards acting in the best interests of investors if the voting shares are held by the manager.&lt;ref name="Schroders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/C511D286-70DE-4849-9A75AA28A66354A7|title=Investment and Corporate Governace: Schroders' Policy|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Schroders}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a serious conflict arises with the manager the degree to which the board can effectively act in the best interests of the fund can be neutralized in these circumstances. The voting shares give the manager complete discretion over the appointment and removal of directors; therefore controlling board composition and the ability to veto any of its decisions.  If the investment manager is dissatisfied with any decision, he can simply exercise his right to remove the director(s) and replace them with someone more amendable to the manager’s wishes.&lt;ref name="AIMAgovernance"/&gt;

===Composition===
The board requires has the right mix of skills, talent and capacity to function effectively.  Proprietors and boutique firms by definition have limited resources and – by design – do not invest the time or money required to deliver the full range of resources provided by professional firms.&lt;ref name="CFA Asset Manager"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/contributed/Pages/asset_manager_code_of_professional_conduct.aspx|title=Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 July 2015|publisher=[[CFA Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the large fund governance firms become more dominant, it has become common for proprietors and other boutique firms to band together, pooling their resources to create a larger ‘virtual’  or ‘pseudo’ professional firm to offer greater scale and selection to compete with the large professional firms. These alliances are commonly marketed as ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards.&lt;ref name="MFA 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.managedfunds.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Final_2009_complete.pdf|title=Sound Practices for Hedge Fund Managers|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 July 2015|publisher=Managed Funds Associations}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these loose arrangements often lack the operating discipline and reputational investment of their large professional firm counterparts.&lt;ref name="HFSB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfsb.org/sites/10377/files/hedge_fund_standards_-_as_at_february_2012.pdf|title=The Hedge Fund Standards|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 August 2012|publisher=Hedge Fund Standards Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the arrangements create co-dependency for business referrals and actually create higher complexity and potential for conflicts of interests since and they are entered into primarily for commercial reasons, and not to act in the best interests of the fund.  It is not uncommon for these arrangements to result in a high level of duplication and dysfunction.&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;

===Split or mixed boards===
All directors owe the same [[fiduciary duties]] and directors each have [[joint and several liability]] so in reality ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards is a marketing aphorism and distinction without a difference.  Independent research&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt; has found that professional firms of quality directors have large reputational investment with high incentive to perform well and consistently outperform proprietorships.  This research found that “directors from a top ten firm are almost twice as likely as directors from smaller firms to obtain a new directorship.”&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;  This implies that directors are even more likely to be hired when their firm has a larger client base, and thus more reputational capital to protect. The single firm focus is counterfactual to the risk analysis. Unquestionably the area of greatest risk within any fund is within its investment portfolio.  Enormous authority over the fund affairs is often entrusted to the investment manager as a single individual, from a single firm, yet it would be universally accepted to be counterproductive and inefficient to appoint another manager from a different firm to manage the same portfolio at the same time, or another auditor from different firm to audit the same fund at the same time.  It is not obvious, other than the aforementioned marketing reason, why any one believes that appointing directors from different firms is an effective mechanism for eliciting independent judgment and deliberation than those doing the deciding work for a (single) firm instead.&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt;&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;

===Lead director===
Boards are small organizations but like all organizations they need effective leadership to succeed.  The SEC recommends fund boards to appoint a lead director and it has become an industry leading practice for many fund boards to appoint a lead director to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the board.  The lead director may schedule, set and prioritize board meeting agendas and make sure the board receives reports from management on essential matters.&lt;ref name="SECic-262520"/&gt;  The lead director may also be the chief contact for the board’s counsel or the fund's auditors (or other service providers).  If the lead director is an independent director, he or she may represent the other independent directors in discussions with the fund management. SEC also recommends directors employ staff.&lt;ref name=StandfordLaw/&gt;&lt;ref name="SECic-262520"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.pdf|title=Investment Company Governance; Final Rule|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 August 2014 |publisher=Securities Exchange Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Futoshi Matsunaga'''|松永 太|Matsunaga Futoshi|extra=born April 28, 1961}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[serial killer]] who both [[fraud|defrauded]] and tortured his victims in what is publicly known as the '''Kitakyūshū Serial Murder Incident''' ({{lang|ja|北九州連続殺人事件}}). He was convicted of six counts of murder and one count of manslaughter between 1996 and 1998 and sentenced to die by hanging. He murdered his victims with an accomplice, [[Junko Ogata]], who received a life sentence.

His crimes were so atrocious that most [[mass media]] were not willing to report the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.rkb.ne.jp/rkb_news/archives/000813.html|script-title=ja:夏樹静子が見た北九州監禁殺人裁判|language=Japanese|publisher=[[RKB Mainichi Broadcasting]]|date=2005-06-13|accessdate=2008-06-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jnocnews.jp/news/show.aspx?id=9191|script-title=zh:中国媒体未能报道的日本杀人案背后|language=Chinese|publisher=JNOC NEWS|year=2005|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Japan Times]]'' reported that prosecutors said "[the case] is without comparison in the criminal history of our country".&lt;ref name="weekly"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/weekly/news/nn2005/nn20050312a5.htm |title=Pair accused of slaying 7 face gallows |publisher=The Japan Times WEEKLY |date=2005-03-12 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several writers, including [[Ryūzō Saki]], published the details of the crimes.

== Early life ==
[[File:Kokura Jp night.jpg|thumb|right|Kokura Kita-ku]]
Matsunaga was born in [[Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyūshū|Kokurakita Ward]] of the city of [[Kitakyūshū]] in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], and grew up in [[Yanagawa, Fukuoka|Yanagawa]]. He received good grades in school and had a charming personality, but tended to exhibit disciplinary problems. He was transferred to another high school after engaging in a relationship with a junior high school girl. He married at 19 and had a son.

Despite being married, Matsunaga was involved with at least ten mistresses. In October 1982, during his marriage, he became involved with [[Junko Ogata]], one of his former schoolmates from Yanagawa. In 1984, Matsunaga promised to marry Junko, but her mother, Shizumi Ogata, did not approve of the relationship because of Matsunaga's abuse of her daughter. Matsunaga [[rape]]d Shizumi as a result. In 1985, Matsunaga convinced Junko that her family hated her because of a [[suicide]] attempt and persuaded her to move in with him.&lt;ref name=japantimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050929a1.html |title=Pair to hang for seven murders |publisher=The Japan Times |date=2005-08-29 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

That same year, Matsunaga also purchased a building in which he could operate a [[futon]] business. Afterwards, he began to electrically shock employees on the third floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyushu.yomiuri.co.jp/news-spe/kankin/yami/ka_yami_001.htm |script-title=ja:脅しの“原点”電気責め、松永被告２０代から |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date=2002-09-19 |accessdate=2008-03-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201001934/http://kyushu.yomiuri.co.jp/news-spe/kankin/yami/ka_yami_001.htm |archivedate=2008-02-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would sometimes suddenly shout towards other men, saying things like, "There is a spirit behind you! It is sucking away your fortune!" He also made references to religious terms like ''[[saṃsāra]]'' and ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="k"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyushu.yomiuri.co.jp/news-spe/20080615-2906435/yami/ka_yami_007.htm |script-title=ja:松永被告「奇妙な顔」、宗教的言動で支配 |language=Japanese |publisher=Yomiuri Shimbun |date=2002-09-25 |accessdate=2008-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924041050/http://kyushu.yomiuri.co.jp/news-spe/20080615-2906435/yami/ka_yami_007.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, Matsunaga had stolen 180 million [[yen]] (about US$2.2 million) through fraud or [[blackmail]].&lt;ref name="k"/&gt; He and Junko evaded police capture and were put on Japan's [[most wanted list]].

== Murders ==

Matsunaga lived in a condominium in Kokurakita-ku. His first victim was a married woman with three children. In April 1993, he convinced her to leave her husband and run away with him, telling the woman that Junko was his sister. One of her children died under mysterious circumstances in September 1993. Her two other children went to live with their father and grandfather the following month. During their relationship, Matsunaga defrauded the woman for 11.8 million yen (about US$145,510). She died mysteriously in March 1994, and the police were unable to prove that Matsunaga had killed the woman or her child.&lt;ref name="monster"&gt;{{cite web | author= | script-title=ja:一家惨殺 | publisher=MONSTER | language=Japanese | url=http://www8.ocn.ne.jp/~moonston/ikka.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Matsunaga began victimizing Kumio Toraya and his daughter. Kumio had previously confided to Matsunaga about his previous criminal history; Matsunaga used this information to blackmail Kumio. Kumio and his daughter were held captive in Matsunaga's room inside the condominium. Matsunaga tortured Kumio with electric shocks, forced him to eat his own [[feces]], and forced his daughter to bite her father.&lt;ref name="monster" /&gt; Kumio died as a result of this abuse on February 26, 1996.  Matsunaga convinced Kumio's daughter that she had murdered her father.&lt;ref name="monster" /&gt; He told Junko and the girl to dispose of the remains, which were thrown into the sea near the [[Kunisaki Peninsula]] after being pulverized.

Soon after, Matsunaga found another target in a female acquaintance of Kumio. He convinced the woman that he was a graduate of [[Kyoto University]] and promised to marry her. Instead, he defrauded her of 5.6 million yen (about US$69,066). As before, the woman and her daughter were confined to Matsunaga's room. The woman escaped by jumping from the second floor to the ground in March 1997. She was put into the care of a mental hospital and her daughter was released.

The following month, Ogata left for work and did not return. Matsunaga contacted her family, threatening them and blackmailing Shizumi over the 1985 rape. Matsunaga then faked his own suicide, prompting Ogata to return, whereupon she was subjected to continued abuse. He also raped Ogata's married sister, Rieko. Ogata's family gave 63 million yen (about US$777,116) to Matsunaga, after which he held them captive and psychologically controlled them in ways similar to the methods of cult-leader [[Shoko Asahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mm-labo.com/ambookreview/asin2007/4413041208.html|script-title=ja:なぜ家族は殺し合ったのか|language=Japanese|publisher=Mitsuharu Matsumoto Laboratory|date=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 1997, Matsunaga coerced Junko to shock her 61-year-old father, Takashige, to the point of death. When Shizumi's mental state began to deteriorate, Matsunaga commanded Rieko and her husband, Kazuya, to strangle her on January 20, 1998. Several weeks later, he commanded Kazuya to strangle Rieko while their 10-year-old daughter, Aya, held her down. Matsunaga and Ogata then confined Kazuya to a bathroom, where he starved to death on April 13, 1998. Matsunaga then forced Junko and Aya to kill Rieko's 5-year-old son, Yuki.

During the trial, Kumio's daughter testified that Matsunaga and Ogata had tortured Aya with electricity. Ogata denied this testimony, saying the girl's recollections might have been inaccurate because of guilty feelings about committing her first murder. Kumio's daughter strangled Aya on June 7, 1998.

Matsunaga and Ogata dismembered and boiled their victims' remains in pots. The other residents of the condominium heard strange noises and smelled the stench. The victims' remains were finally disposed of in washrooms or put out to sea. The condominium was renovated after the murders. Matsunaga blamed the murders on Ogata, who, with their two children, were the only survivors in her family.

In July 2000, Matsunaga convinced another woman to go away with him, lured by the prospect of marriage. In August 2001, she gave her twin children to him and Ogata. Matsunaga and Ogata then convinced the woman to give them 20 million yen (about US$246,580), telling her that they would need the money to bring up her children.

== Arrest and trial ==
Kumio's daughter, who was being held captive, escaped from Matsunaga on January 30, 2002, but Matsunaga found the girl on February 15, 2002, and took her back into captivity. He then tortured the girl with electric shocks.&lt;ref name="weekly"/&gt;

On March 6, 2002, the girl escaped from Matsunaga again, and reported the crimes to the police. She was 17 years old. The police arrested Matsunaga and Ogata the next day when they tried to retrieve the girl. The twins and the couple's two children were taken into police protection.

The media initially reported only that Matsunaga and Ogata had held their victims captive, similar to the case of [[Fusako Sano]], but eventually the media revealed the details of the murders Matsunaga and Ogata had committed.

The pair were charged with Aya's murder on September 18, 2002; Takashige's murder on October 12, 2002; Shizumi's murder on December 6, 2002; Yuki's murder on January 11, 2003; Kumio's murder on February 3, 2003; Rieko's murder on February 25, 2003; and Kazuya's murder on May 30, 2003.

No murder charges were brought against Kumio's daughter. Ogata calmly confessed to her part in the murders, but Matsunaga professed his own innocence. He insisted that the women had fabricated their stories about him. The Japanese police never recovered any human remains and found no physical evidence, so they relied primarily upon the testimonies of Kumio's and Ogata's daughters during the police investigation.

On September 28, 2005, a district court in Fukuoka sentenced Matsunaga and Ogata to die by hanging.&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt; The court tried six cases, but considered that Matsunaga and Ogata had not killed Takashige directly, but had only injured him by electric shocks which later resulted in his death.

The pair appealed the verdict. On September 26, 2007, the Fukuoka High Court upheld Matsunaga's original sentence, but Ogata's sentence was changed from death to life imprisonment because Matsunaga had exerted control over Ogata to force her to kill the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/LEAD%3A+Man's+death+sentence+upheld,+woman's+reduced+to+life+in+murders.-a0172103450 |title=Man's death sentence upheld, woman's reduced to life in murders|agency=[[Kyodo News]]|date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">'''Gibson Burrell''' (born 1948) is a British [[sociologist]] and [[organizational theorist]], and Professor of Organisation Theory at [[University of Leicester]]. He became known as writer of the 1979 book ''Sociological Paradigms and Organizational Analysis'' with [[Gareth Morgan (author)|Gareth Morgan]],&lt;ref name="MW03"&gt;[[Morgen Witzel]] (2003) ''Fifty key figures in management''. p.232-239&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognized for establishing a ''critical'' ''management'' school at the University of Leicester.&lt;ref&gt;Don Antunes, Howard Thomas (2007). "The Competitive (Dis)Advantages of European Business Schools", ''Long Range Planning,'' Volume 40, Issue 3, pp. 382-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Burrell studied sociology at the [[University of Leicester]], where in 1974 he also completed his M.Phil. In 1980 he received his PhD at the [[University of Manchester]].

Burrell started his academic career as researcher at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In the late 1970s he was appointed Lecturer in the Department of Behaviour in Organizations at the [[University of Lancaster]]. In the mid-1980s he was appointed Professor of Organizational Behaviour at the [[University of Warwick]]. In 2002 he was appointed Professor of Organisation Theory at University of Leicester, where he headed its School of Management from 2002 to 2007. This was a radical hire by the Vice Chancellor, Sir Bob Burgess. Over the next few years, Gibson presided over the creation of a distinctive, radical and creative school. From nowhere, Leicester began to be talked about as one of the most exciting schools in Europe. Leicester was certainly one of the most interesting management schools during the noughties. According to the Carter / Mueller Dean index, Burrell ranks as the best Dean in the UK over the last two decades.

Burrell is co-editor of the international, interdisciplinary journal ''Organization'', together with [[Linda Smircich]], Marta Calàs, and Mike Reed.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;[http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/oso/public/content/oho_business/9780199275250/oxfordhb-9780199275250-chapter-23.html The Oxford Handbook of Organization Theory], At Home from Mars to Somalia: ''Recounting Organization Studies'' (Marta B. Calás, Linda Smircich)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Burrell was elected an Academician for the Social Sciences (AcSS), and in 2014, with Gareth Morgan, he was awarded the Academy of Management Trailblazer Award for his contributions to organization and management theory.

'''Harry Henry''' (11 March 1916 – 22 November 2008) was born in London on 11 March 1916, as the elder son of an accountant, who died in 1924. His mother brought up and provided for her two sons by working as a dressmaker. Henry was one of Britain's [[market research]] pioneers whose contributions to its acceptance and understanding won him an international reputation. He was the last survivor of the 23 founders of the Market Research Society (MRS), which he helped establish in 1947, and which now has 8,000 members in 50 countries. He married Mary Anstey, daughter of [[Vera Anstey]], in 1938. She died in 1989, a year after they had celebrated their golden wedding anniversary.

In publishing, he was Marketing Director of the Thomson Organisation for nine years, where he also became a Deputy Managing Director. His influence was significant in pulling an old-fashioned conservative industry towards the appreciation and practice of marketing in newspapers and magazines, a benefit inherited by radio and television. He was the first to use the computer in a market research study. In 1988, he received the Market Research Society's rarely awarded Gold Medal. In 2004, he received the [[Advertising Association]]'s prestigious Mackintosh Medal, awarded for outstanding personal and public service to the industry (in this case, only the third time in the previous fifteen years, and also in recognition of forty years as chairman of its Advertising Statistics Committee).

==Education==
He attended two primary schools, one in Finchley and the other in Hackney and at the age of eleven was transferred to Upton House London County Council Central School, in Homerton. This type of school, an early experiment in state secondary education, had just been created for students up to the age of sixteen, who would otherwise be leaving school at fourteen, to extend their general education with the addition of some commercial subjects. He obtained the London Matriculation with Honours, and was awarded a Wedgewood Scholarship to City of London College in 1932. In 1934, he was awarded a [[Bursary]] that enabled him to enter the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), where he read Economics, with Statistics as a subsidiary subject.

In those days, the LSE had less than 3,000 students. Henry served as Senior Treasurer of the Students' Union, Editor of the [[Clare Market Review]], the Union's official magazine (after having edited and largely written Felix, an extremely unofficial one), Chairman of the Social Committee, Chairman of the Literary Society, Business Manager of the Review of Economic Studies (an academic journal), and Vice-Chairman of the Labour Society.

Towards the end of this, he was involved in a libel action arising from an article he wrote in the [[University of London]] [[University of London Union|Union]] Magazine, pointing out that the [[gerrymandering]] involved in the election of the M.P. for London University gave control to the commercial correspondence colleges, whose interests were commercial rather than academic. Pressure from the judge ([[in chambers]]) led to a reluctant withdrawal, but there were no damages and he was convinced that Higher Authority had organised a cover-up.

He obtained a [[B.S.|B.Sc.]] (Economics) in 1937, which qualified him for his first job. Colman Prentis &amp; Varley, a relatively new and extremely small advertising agency, having gained two minor advertising accounts from [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (just beginning to make a presence felt in the UK, under the name of Thomas Hedley) learnt that it would need a market research department. They went to LSE to find somebody to fill this role, in the mistaken belief that what was required was a [[statistician]]. Henry was appointed to this post in 1938, and began to learn about market research, largely by experiment. He supplemented this as the London correspondent of the [[Boston Globe]], providing a weekly column on the various social and other activities of the family of [[Joseph Kennedy]], the then US [[ambassador]] to London.

==War==
The outbreak of war terminated these apprenticeships, and he was called up in 1940. After training in the ranks of the [[Royal Artillery]], he was commissioned in 1941, and served as a regimental officer in various anti-aircraft batteries until 1943, when he transferred to the newly formed statistical branch of the Army as a [[Staff Officer]]. He was eventually posted to the Headquarters staff of Montgomery's [[21st Army Group]], where he played a modest part in the preparations for the invasion of Europe and in subsequent operations in France, Belgium and Germany.

During the latter part of this period, he found the opportunity to use his market research skills in surveys of radio listening among the troops in that theatre of war, and was also responsible for the introduction of a number of what would later be referred to as Information Systems. One of these involved the production of a weekly abstract of administrative statistics for circulation throughout the theatre, and another, the devising and operating of 'TOCCI' (Theatre Officers Central Card Index), a system making use of [[Hollerith]] punched-card equipment to facilitate and speed up the [[demobilisation]] of officers.

==Post war==
Henry was demobilised with the rank of Major in 1946. He returned to Colman Prentis &amp; Varley, which had begun to move into the big league, first as Market Research Manager and shortly thereafter as Director and General Manager of Market Information Services Ltd, a subsidiary company that he created from scratch. By the time he left Market Information Services in 1954, it had grown into one of the top ten research companies in the country. These years were a period of rapid expansion in the field of market research as a whole, and he took his part in the development of many of the procedures which subsequently came into common use.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Market Research Society===
He was one of the 23 people who, in 1946, founded the Market Research Society, and played a major role both in the development of research techniques and in the promotion of market research as a tool of [[management]]. His particular interest in the media of communication was stimulated by the fact that he was responsible for the planning, conduct and production from 1947 to 1953 of the Hulton Readership Surveys, which were the predecessors of what became the National Readership Surveys. In this same area, he was responsible for the Hulton Tables of Advertisement Attention Value (1949), the development of the first system for using punched-card equipment to compute net press coverage (1949), and the first national surveys of readership among farmers (1947), among retailers (1948) and among children (1950). He was also Editor and joint author of The Rural Market (1948) and Patterns of British Life (1950).

===McCann-Erickson Advertising===
In 1954, he joined [[McCann-Erickson]] Advertising Ltd. as Director of Research, and there built up a very sizeable research department, more closely integrated with the overall workings of the agency than was usual in those days. In particular, it became agency policy to persuade clients (particularly new clients) that full-scale research into their markets would result in more effective advertising. In 1959, he launched Marplan Ltd., a subsidiary company, which developed along these lines into what was one of the leading market research agencies in Great Britain. He organised the establishment of sister Marplan companies in Belgium, France and Germany, and was Chairman of the McCann-Erickson European Research Committee, while continuing as a senior member of the board of McCann-Erickson Ltd.

===Revolution in research===
During the mid-1950s, he had come to the conclusion that the existing techniques of market research, though adequate to the measurement of consumer behaviour, could not offer a reliable framework for marketing decisions. This led to the publication of his 1958 book, ''Motivation Research: Its Practice and Uses'', the first on the subject to be published in Europe. In this book, he drew on his experience to produce a practical guide to the rigorous scientific use of indirect techniques to produce insights which, he argued, could not be validly or even reliably derived from direct questioning or discussion.

===The Thomson Organisation===
In 1961, he was invited to join the Board of [[Thomson Organization|The Thomson Organisation Ltd]], then principally (apart from its ownership of Scottish Television) the publisher of the [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] and a raft of regional newspapers, as Director of Marketing, bringing marketing into newspaper publishing for the first time.

In 1962, he established the annual Thomson Medals and Awards for Advertising Research, which, by stimulating fresh thinking on media research problems, were responsible over the following ten years for the formulation and dissemination of a number of fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of advertising. Also in 1962, he took advantage of the relaxation by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] of the rigidity of Soviet rule to mount an unprecedented promotion exercise for the recently launched Sunday Times Colour Magazine, which did not immediately return satisfactory advertising revenue. This involved hiring a Tupulev 114 from [[Aeroflot]] in which to fly a plane-load of British business tycoons for the week-end, to meet and talk to their opposite numbers in Moscow.

In 1965, after successfully tendering for the contract from Post Office Telecommunications for the introduction into the UK of '[[yellow pages]]' telephone directories, he set up and was the first Chairman of Thomson Yellow Pages Ltd.
In 1968, he and Mick Shields (of [[Associated Newspapers]]) were asked by Cecil King, then Chairman of the Newspaper Publishers' Association, to examine the practicability of the introduction into the Association of a marketing function as a means of improving the efficiency of the national newspaper industry and of enabling it better to withstand competition. This led to the establishment of a consortium, the 'NPA Marketing Executive' (which he chaired) and the recruitment of some specialist staff, but which petered out because, as he observed then and at intervals over the next thirty years, the national newspaper publishers would always prefer to hang separately than to hang together. But what might be regarded as its successor was launched in 2002 as the Newspaper Marketing Agency. He left the Thomson Organisation in 1970, setting up his own consultancy in 1971.

===Admap===
As Consultant Editor and subsequently as Editor-in-Chief of Admap, he consolidated that publication's reputation for intellectual stringency and authority, which sets it aside from the generality of newsy, even gossipy, advertising periodicals. In 1983, he joined Mike Waterson in setting up a modest venture to launch the quarterly Food &amp; Drink Forecast. This developed rapidly, and had grown by 1998 into Information Sciences Ltd and become one of the world's largest private sector suppliers of economic information through its operating arm NTC Research Ltd, and one of the world's major publisher of advertising and media knowledge via Admap, many other trade journals and books, and the [http://www.warc.com World Advertising Research Center].

==Impact on the field of marketing==
His whole career was marked by innovation. He was the first to use a computer [[LEO computer|LEO]], the first UK computer dedicated to business use) to analyse market research data (1959) and the first to do so in a readership survey (for the Western Mail in 1961). He carried out the first national study of public attitudes towards advertising (1954), the first survey of the poster audience (1948), the first readership survey among retailers (1948), the first national readership survey among children(1950), and the first qualitative study of regional newspaper readership (1963). In 1956, he acted as technical consultant to the first Italian national readership survey.

Not surprisingly, he has been much in demand by industry and academic bodies. He was at various times (and sometimes simultaneously) Visiting Professor of Marketing at the University of Bradford and the [[Cranfield School of Management|Cranfield Institute of Technology]] (now University), and Professor of Marketing and Media Policy at the International Management Centres. He was for twelve years Chairman of the Marketing Communication Research Centre, an ongoing operation funded by a number of major marketing companies which was founded in Bradford in 1972, and subsequently moved to Cranfield when he did. He had chaired the technical sub-committee of the National Readership Survey, and the Research Committees of the Regional Newspaper Advertising Bureau and of British Posters, and was for forty years Chairman of the Research Committee of the Advertising Association. He was a Governor of the [http://www.hatads.org.uk History of Advertising Trust], and a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Advertising History and the International Journal of Advertising.

==Publications==
As a by-product of his business and academic activities, and in various managerial capacities, he wrote and lectured extensively, in a number of countries, on management, marketing, research and related topics.
Books published in earlier years, include ''Patterns of British Life'' (1948) and ''The Rural Market'' (1950).

His first book, written when he was 21 years old, ''The Insurance Man and his Trade'' (1938), in the 'Fact' library published monthly by Raymond Postgate (1/- cloth board, 6d. paper covers), suggested that burial insurance was 'the grossest form of systematic exploitation ever practised in this country'

A selection of his papers up to 1971 having been published in that year under the title of ''Perspectives in Management, Marketing and Research''.

Later publications included ''Behind the Headlines: Readings in the Economics of the Press'' (1978) and ''The Dynamics of the British Press, 1961 to 1984'' (1986) and he edited the massive Proceedings of the four International Readership Research Symposia of 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1988 (published as ''Readership Research: Theory and Practice'').

'''Herman Christian Salling''' (born 20 November 1919 in [[Aarhus]]; died 8 May 2006) was a Danish merchant and director. He was a pioneer in the department store and retail business in Denmark. 

Herman Salling was the son of local merchant Ferdinand Salling (1880 - 1953) who founded the [[Salling (department store)|Salling]] department store in 1906 in Aarhus. Herman inherited and became director of the Salling department store in 1953. He evolved the business and also started [[føtex]] in 1960, the first real [[supermarket]] in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsg.dk/da/Hvem_er_vi/Historie/Pages/historie.aspx Dansk Supermarket History(in Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt; With Danish shipping businessman [[A.P. Møller]], he founded [[Dansk Supermarked A/S]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maersk-mckinney-moller-owner-of-the-worlds-largestcontainershipping-company-7648152.html The Independent's obituary for Maersk McKinney Moller]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1970, as part of the Dansk Supermarket Group, Herman Salling launched [[Bilka]], the very first [[hypermarket]] in Denmark. Bilka is located in [[Tilst]], a western suburb of Aarhus.

== The Salling funds ==
A memorial fund for Herman's father Ferdinand Salling was established in 1957 and in 1964 Herman Salling established his own fund. The two funds are collectively known as ''"Salling Fondene"'' (The Salling Funds) and supports selected local cultural projects in Aarhus financially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sallingfondene.dk/ Salling Fondene] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of many donations went to the establishment of "Hermans" in 2013, a cultural venue in [[Tivoli Friheden]], named after Herman Salling himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tivoli Friheden: [http://friheden.dk/hermans/ Hermans]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hong Kong Science Park''', in short named '''HKSTP''', is a [[science park]] in [[Hong Kong]], located in [[Pak Shek Kok]], [[New Territories]], on the boundary of [[Sha Tin District]] and [[Tai Po District]]. It is also next to the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] in [[Ma Liu Shui]] and is on the [[Tolo Harbour]] waterfront.

It is an infrastructure that provides a knowledge-based and campus-like environment of 330,000 square metres marketed for high-technology enterprises. It is designed to accommodate companies of all sizes and stages of development and to promote interaction and innovation at both local and global level.

The park is administered by the [[Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation]], a statutory body established in 2001.

The '''invisible balance''' or '''balance of trade on services''' is that part of the [[balance of trade]] that refers to services and other products that do not result in the transfer of physical objects. Examples include consulting services, shipping services, tourism, and patent license revenues. This figure is usually generated by [[tertiary industry]]. The term 'invisible balance' is especially common in the United Kingdom.

For countries that rely on service exports or on tourism, the invisible balance is particularly important. For instance the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia receive significant international income from financial services, while Japan and Germany rely more on exports of manufactured goods.

==Types of invisibles==

Invisibles are both international payments for services (as opposed to goods), as well as movements of money without exchange for goods or services. These invisibles are called 'transfer payments' or 'remittances' and may include money sent from one country to another by an individual, business, government or non-governmental organisations ([[NGO]]) &amp;ndash; often charities.

An individual remittance may include money sent to a relative overseas. Business transfers may include profits sent by a foreign subsidiary to a parent company or money invested by a business in a foreign country. Bank loans to foreign countries are also included in this category, as are license fees paid for the use of patents and trademarks. Government transfers may involve loans made or official aid given to foreign countries, while transfers made by NGO's include money designated for charitable work within foreign countries, respectively.

==Balance of payments and invisibles==
In many countries a useful distinction is drawn between the [[balance of trade]] and the [[balance of payments]].  'Balance of trade' refers to the trade of both tangible (physical) objects as well as the trade in services &amp;ndash; collectively known as exports and imports (in other words, 'visibles plus services') &amp;ndash; while the 'balance of payments' also includes transfers of Capital in the form of loans, investments in shares or direct investment in projects.

A nation may have a visibles balance surplus but this can be offset by a larger deficit in the invisibles balance (creating a Balance of Trade deficit overall) – if, for example, there are large payments made to foreign businesses for invisibles such as shipping or tourism. On the other hand, a Visibles Balance deficit can be offset by a strong surplus on the invisibles balance if, for example, foreign aid is being provided.

In a similar way, a nation may also have a surplus 'balance of trade' because it exports more than it imports but a negative (or deficit) 'balance of payments' because, it has a much greater shortfall in transfers of capital. And, just as easily, a deficit in the 'balance of trade' may be offset by a larger surplus in capital transfers from overseas to produce a balance of payments surplus overall.

==Balance of payments problems and the invisible balance==
Problems with a country's balance of trade (or balance of payments) are often associated with an inappropriate valuation of its currency, its country's foreign exchange rate.

If a country's exchange rate is too high, its exports will become uncompetitive as buyers in foreign countries require more of their own currency to pay for them. In the meantime, it also becomes cheaper for the citizens of the country to buy goods from overseas,as opposed to buying locally produced goods), because an overvalued currency makes foreign products less expensive.

The simultaneous decline in currency inflows from decreased exports and the rise in outflows, due to increased imports, sends the balance of trade into deficit, which then needs to be paid for by a transfer of funds in some form, either invisible transfers (aid, etc.) or capital flows (loans, etc.). However, relying on funds like that to support a trade deficit, is unsustainable, and the country may eventually  require its currency to be devalued.

If, on the other hand, a currency is undervalued, its exports will become cheaper and therefore more competitive internationally. At the same time, imports will also become more costly, stimulating the production of domestic substitutes to replace them. That will result in a growth of currency flowing into the country and a decline in currency flowing out of it, resulting in an improvement in the country's balance of trade.

Because a nation's exchange rate has a big impact on its 'balance of trade' and its 'balance of payments', many economists favour freely [[floating exchange rate]]s over the older, fixed (or pegged) rates of foreign currency exchange. Floating exchange rates allow more regular adjustments in exchange rates to occur, allowing the greater opportunity for international payments to maintain equilibrium.

'''José María Aguirre Gonzalo''' (12 August 1897 – 7 April 1988) was a Basque civil engineer, businessman and banker.
He played a leading role in the development of the Spanish economy during the reign of [[Caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]] that followed the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39).

==Early years (1897–1927)==

José María Aguirre Gonzalo was born in [[San Sebastián]] on 12 August 1897.{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}
He studied Civil Engineering at the Escuela Técnica Superior (Higher Technical School) in Madrid.{{sfn|Baleren Bakaikoa|2009}}
He graduated in 1921. He would later teach accounting and business organization at this school.
He then took some courses in Law.
He began work with the Otamendi brothers on the [[Madrid Metro]], which by 1919 had opened almost {{convert|4|km}} between the Sol and Cuatro Caminos stations.{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}

==Pre-war years (1927–39)== 

In 1927 Aguirre and his friend Alejandro San Román founded the  Agromán construction company.
Aguirre was chairman, managing director and then honorary chairman of this company.
In its early years Agromán obtained major contracts in public works and buildings, and was involved in some important projects in the 1930s including the [[University City of Madrid]] (Ciudad Universitaria de Madrid) and the Castellana rail link.{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}
In 1934 [[Manuel Sánchez Arcas]] (1897–1970) and [[Eduardo Torroja]] (1899–1961) founded the ''Instituto Técnico de la Construcción y Edificación'' (ITCE, Technical Institute of Construction and Building).{{sfn|Manuel Sánchez Arcas – epdlp}}
Other founding members were Aguirre Gonzalo, the architect [[Modesto López Otero]] (1885–1962) and the engineer [[Alfonso Peña Boeuf]] (1888–1966). 
The ITCE was a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and applying technical innovations in engineering civil structures.{{sfn|Camprubí|2014|p=17}}

During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] Aguirre had difficulties with the authorities and was imprisoned.{{sfn|Baleren Bakaikoa|2009}}

==Post-war career (1939–88)==

After the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39) Agromán, with [[Dragados]], became the leading construction company in Spain.
Aguirre played a central role in the economic development of the country, and founded or promoted major companies in a range of business sectors.{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}
He was an adviser to the [[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]] railway company and the [[Compañía Sevillana de Electricidad]], and president of the Ribagorzana hydroelectric company,  [[Acerinox]] steel company and Siemens España engineering company.
He was also a director and shareholder of the newspapers ''[[El Diario Vasco]]'' and ''Informaciones''.{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}
He became president or member of the board of over fifty companies, and was one of the most visible and influential businessmen of the time.{{sfn|Cabrera|Reguillo|2007|p=91}}
In common with other business leaders of the time, he had an authoritarian style and little interest in human relations concepts.{{sfn|Guillén|1994|p=202}}

Aguirre was a ''procurador'' in [[Francisco Franco]]'s Cortes from 1961 to 1976, first as a representative of the Association of Civil Engineers, and then as a direct appointee by Franco.{{sfn|Lamata|1970}}
Aguirre denied having any political ambition, despite his seat in parliament, and turned down an offer by Franco to become Minister of Housing.{{sfn|Cabrera|Reguillo|2007|p=108}}
He chaired the transport committee of the Spanish Plan for Economic and Social Development, and was a member of the national economic council.{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}
In the 1970s Franco named him vice-president of the highly political Fundamental Laws commission.{{sfn|Cabrera|Reguillo|2007|p=109}}
Aguirre was also a member of various international organizations including the European Concrete Committee, the Spanish committee of the [[World Energy Council]] and the [[European Cultural Foundation]].{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}

Aguirre was involved in banking from 1941.{{sfn|José María Aguirre Gonzalo – Biografías y Vidas}}
He became chairman of the Banco Guipuzcoano in 1956, and held this position until his death in April 1988, when he was replaced by his son, also named José María Aguirre González, who had been a director of the bank for five years.{{sfn|J. F.|2010}}
He was also chairman of the Banco de Desarrollo Económico y Social (Bank of Economic and Social Development).{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}
He was director and then vice-president of the [[Banco Español de Crédito]] (Banesto).{{sfn|Baleren Bakaikoa|2009}}
He was appointed chairman of this bank in September 1970.{{sfn|Lamata|1970}}
Immediately after becoming chairman he initiated weekly luncheon meetings of the heads of the seven major banks.
Monetary authorities were also invited to attend.{{sfn|Tortella|García Ruiz|2013|p=133–134}}
By the 1980s the major banks in Spain were short of capital.
Aguirre believed in specialization and opposed rationalization of the industry through mergers and acquisitions.{{sfn|Tortella|García Ruiz|2013|p=152}}
He resigned from Banesto in 1983.{{sfn|José María Aguirre Gonzalo – Biografías y Vidas}}

Aguirre participated in creation of the Colegio de Ingenieros de Caminos (College of Civil Engineers), of which he was the first president, and the Colegio Universitario de Estudios Financieros (University College of Financial Studies) (CUNEF).{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}
He died of a heart attack on 7 April 1988 in the Clínica Ruber in Madrid at the age of 90.{{sfn|Sánchez Calvo|2015}}

==Education==
Growing up, Zeltner wanted to study [[veterinary medicine]], but ended up doing an internship at [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] which later merged with [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] to form his current employer [[UBS]]. &lt;ref name="UBS Seen Winning as Wealth Management Emulates Pimco"&gt;{{cite web|title=UBS Seen Winning|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-16/ubs-seen-winning-as-wealth-management-emulates-pimco|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeltner holds a diploma in Business Administration from the College of Higher Vocational Education in [[Bern]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is a graduate of the Advanced Management Program at [[Harvard Business School]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==

===Career progression in UBS===
Zeltner joined the Corporate Client division of the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBC) in 1987.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Between 1987 and 1998, Zeltner occupied numerous roles at [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBC) within the Private and Corporate Client division in [[Bern]], [[New York City]], and [[Zurich]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Amongst other roles, Zeltner was Credit Risk Officer for Corporate and Institutional clients.

Following the merger of SBC with the [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] (SBG/UBS) to become [[UBS]] in 1998, Zeltner was appointed as head of Portfolio Management for Risk Transformation and Capital Management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 2005 to 2007 he occupied the position of [[CEO]] at UBS Deutschland, [[Frankfurt]]. In November 2007, he was appointed as Head of Wealth Management North, East &amp; Central Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From February 2009 to January 2012 he was co-CEO of Wealth Management and Swiss Bank.&lt;ref name="Follow Jürg Zeltner"/&gt;

He was the President of [[UBS]] Wealth Management from November 2014 to December 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 14 December 2017, UBS announced that Zeltner will step down from GEB at the end of the year. He has retired from the firm as of 2018. The Board of Directors has appointed [[Martin Blessing]], former President of Human Resources &amp; Corporate Banking and President of UBS Switzerland, to succeed him as President Wealth Management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/ubs-wealth-chief-zeltner-is-said-to-be-close-to-stepping-down|title=UBS Wealth Chief to Be Replaced in Reshuffle|date=2017-12-13|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business strategy===
On 17 November 2011, UBS held their annual Investor Day in New York. Jürg Zeltner gave a presentation on the UBS Wealth Management Division in which he outlined how the business is positioned in the financial markets and in view of future growth. He pointed out that [[UBS]]'s strategy is centered around its wealth management business.&lt;ref name="UBS Wealth Management Euromoney" /&gt;

In February 2015, Jürg Zeltner was awarded second position among the ten best global private banking CEOs of 2015 and he revealed the strategies behind the [[Wealth Management]] division.&lt;ref name="Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey 2015: Best Global Private Banking CEOs" /&gt; According to him, there has been a shift from asset gathering and product manufacturing to clients advisory and, with the markets moving so rapidly, portfolio diversification. According to Zeltner the focus of wealth management must be on advising clients on how to position their portfolio and on carrying research on asset allocation and on investment management. With regard to the move of the [[Swiss National Bank]] to unpeg the [[Swiss franc]] from the [[euro]], he affirmed that "the sharp fall in the Swiss [[stock market|equity markets]] and the currency turmoil highlight the importance of [[Diversification (finance)|portfolio diversification]]. Anyone who follows this principle and holds securities in all the world's major markets, hedging their currency risks, is financially better equipped to cope with this decision, giving [[UBS]] the opportunity to demonstrate to clients why they need us."&lt;ref name="UBS Wealth Management Euromoney"&gt;{{cite web|title=UBS Turns a Corner: Future Looks Bright for Swiss Bank |url=https://www.euromoney.com/Article/3421655/UBS-WM-chief-says-tougher-times-for-advisory-model.html|publisher=Euromoney|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, his work to improve private banking is appreciated even by his competitor. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/follow_ubs/juerg_zeltner/2016/2/11/zeltner-s-zeal-for-private-banking.html|title=Zeltner's Zeal for Private Banking|website=global|language=en|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities and functions===

'''Michael Diekmann''' (born December 23, 1954) was the CEO of [[Allianz]] in between 2003 and 2015. He is regarded as one of the finest CEOs in Europe.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;[http://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/michael-diekmann European CEO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauer, Ulrike. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/allianz-names-new-chief-executive-1412253138 "Allianz CEO Michael Diekmann to Step Down"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 2 October 2015. Accessed 10 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Diekmann knew early that the family construction business would go to his twin brother, who was more interested in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;James Wilson (September 7, 2008), [https://www.ft.com/content/4c6019d8-7d00-11dd-8d59-000077b07658 Chief with a taste for adventure] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he earned his degree from Goettingen University, where he studied law and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.wsj.com/person/D/michael-diekmann/1020 Education]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Diekmann began his career with [[Allianz]] in 1988 after becoming frustrated with his own business, a publishing house that focused on travel guides.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, James. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4c6019d8-7d00-11dd-8d59-000077b07658.html#axzz3twV4evmL "Chief with a taste for adventure"], ''Financial Times'', 7 September 2008. Accessed 10 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, he later worked in [[Australia]] and the [[United States]], where he successfully revamped the [[Fireman's Fund Insurance Company]], the Allianz subsidiary there.&lt;ref&gt;Carter Doughherty (July 20, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-allianz.2254449.html A European Allianz becomes less German] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he moved to [[Singapore]] to run Allianz's Asia-Pacific business front.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; 

As CEO, Diekmann steered Allianz through a difficult period at the start of the century, moving it from a low point in profitability to a bumper year in 2013 with an operating profit of €10.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Ross (October 2, 2014), [https://www.ft.com/content/a7175db0-4a30-11e4-8de3-00144feab7de Michael Diekmann to step down as Allianz chief] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership, the insurer also converted its legal form, then [[Aktiengesellschaft]], or German joint-stock company, to [[Societas Europaea]] (SE) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Carter Doughherty (July 20, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-allianz.2254449.html A European Allianz becomes less German] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, Allianz had grown to become the world’s second-biggest investor after [[BlackRock]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Gould (August 1, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/allianz-ceo/allianz-to-stick-with-old-guard-as-ceo-contract-ends-idUSL6N0Q64WV20140801 Allianz to stick with old guard as CEO contract ends] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Diekmann weathered a hailstorm of criticism about the sagging performance at the firm’s asset manager, [[Pimco]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Gould (August 1, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/allianz-ceo/allianz-to-stick-with-old-guard-as-ceo-contract-ends-idUSL6N0Q64WV20140801 Allianz to stick with old guard as CEO contract ends] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diekmann's total compensation from 2010 was around one hundred and five million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.forbes.com/profile/michael-diekmann/3285 Forbes]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2014, it was announced that Diekmann, would step down the following year after he turned 60, which is traditionally the age limit for board members at Allianz.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Ross (October 2, 2014), [https://www.ft.com/content/a7175db0-4a30-11e4-8de3-00144feab7de Michael Diekmann to step down as Allianz chief] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, investors widely expected him to stay in his role for a further one to two years.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Gould (October 2, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/wall-st-eases-as-oil-prices-general-electric-fall-idUSKBN1F51GC Allianz CEO Diekmann to step aside for Baete in May] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammad Al Duaij''' (born 1980) is a Kuwaiti business man and entrepreneur. He became the chief executive officer of [[Alea Global Group]] in 2008.

He studied accounting and finance at Leeds University and graduated in 2002 and began his career by joining the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]] as part of the Asian projects funding team. From 2004 to 2008 he worked as financial analyst&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://relationshipscience.com/person/mohammad-al-duaij-112481710|title=Former Financial Analyst|last=|first=|date=|website=Relationship Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and investment manager at Global Investment House in Kuwait&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icvgroup.org/speaker/mohammad-al-duaij/|title=Mohammad Al Duaij|last=|first=|date=|website=ICV|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Today, Alea Global Group is a conglomerate with a globe-spanning network of direct investments in real estate and private equity, commodities trading, and offers financial and investment advisory services.

In 2015 he became partner at Italian R &amp; P Consulting.

'''Obeya''' or '''Oobeya''' (from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] 大部屋 "large room" or "war room") refers to a form of project management used in Asian companies (including [[Toyota]]) and is a component of [[lean manufacturing]] and in particular the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Fara|title=In a Word, Toyota Drives for Innovation|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/45195/word-toyota-drives-innovation|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Fast Company|date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogies have been drawn between an obeya and the bridge of a ship, a war room and even a brain.&lt;ref&gt;Jusko, J., [http://www.industryweek.com/print/lean-six-sigma/obeya-brain-lean-enterprise Obeya: The Brain of the Lean Enterprise], ''Industry Week'', 30 September 2016, accessed 4 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

During the product and process development, all individuals involved in managerial planning meet in a "great room" to speed communication and decision-making. This is intended to reduce "departmental thinking" and improve on methods like email and social networking. The ''Obeya'' can be understood as a team spirit improvement tool at an administrative level.

Conceptually akin to traditional “war rooms,” an ''Obeya'' will contain visually engaging charts and graphs depicting such information as program timing, milestones and progress-to-date and countermeasures to existing technical or scheduling issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capsule summaries of Key Lean Concepts B|url=http://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/NewsArticleDocuments/Capsule%20summaries%20of%20Key%20Lean%20Concepts%20B.doc|publisher=lean.org|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Toyota]], vehicle development is possible in significantly less than 20 months; by comparison, the average for other car makers is 36 months.{{fact|date=August 2015}}

After graduating from [[Moscow State University]] with a degree in physics, Deripaska became a metals broker specialized in trading aluminium before expanding into energy, machinery, financial services and agribusiness. In 2000, Deripaska founded Rusal, the result of a partnership between Sibirsky Aluminium and [[Roman Abramovich]]'s [[Millhouse Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106443818395367800|title=Aluminum Shake-Up May Loom in Russia|last=Whalen|first=Jeanne|date=25 September 2003|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2 June 2017|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Rusal merged with SUAL Group and Glencore International AG to form UC Rusal, with Deripaska as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/aluminium-russia-merger-idUSL2713534620070327|title=RUSAL, SUAL, Glencore complete aluminium merger|date=27 March 2007|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was once [[List of Russian billionaires|Russia's richest man]], worth $28 billion, but lost a substantial part of his fortune amid the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007–08 financial crisis]]. As of August 2018, his wealth was estimated by ''[[Forbes]]'' at $3.3 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; 

Deripaska is also known for his connection to American political consultant [[Paul Manafort]], who has been convicted on charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failure to report foreign bank accounts, which stemmed from [[Robert Mueller]]'s [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|investigation]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]]. Deripaska employed Manafort from at least 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Peter|title=Trump's new right-hand man has history of controversial clients and deals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the founder of Volnoe Delo foundation, he is reported to have donated more than $250 million to mostly educational causes. He was married to Polina Yumasheva, step-granddaughter of former Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and daughter of [[Valentin Yumashev]], Yeltsin's son-in-law and close advisor. According to some media reports, they were divorced in 2018.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.rambler.ru/other/40543183-zheny-izvestnyh-lyudey-zarabatyvayut-na-restoranah-i-galereyah/|title=Жёны известных людей зарабатывают на ресторанах и галереях|work=Рамблер/новости|access-date=15 August 2018|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska was also granted [[Cypriot citizenship]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="guardian02032018"/&gt;

==Education and early career==

===Early life===
Deripaska was born in [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dzerzhinsk]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and grew up in [[Ust-Labinsk]], [[Krasnodar Krai]]. His parents were from [[Kuban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Олигарх Дерипаска участвовал в приеме парада Кубанского казачьего войска|url=http://yasnonews.ru/news/politika/oligarkh_deripaska_uchastvoval_v_prieme_parada_kubanskogo_kazachego_voyska/|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=Yasno|date=22 April 2017|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska grew up on the family's small farm, where from the age of 5 or 6, he learned how to live off the land from his grandparents,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deripaska Rebound From Near-Crash Stares Down Potanin|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-21/deripaska-rebounding-from-near-disaster-stares-down-potanin-as-metals-soar|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=13 January 2016|first=Stephanie|last=Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; who primarily raised him after his widowed mother, an engineer, had to leave to find work.&lt;ref name="globeandmail2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reguly|first1=Eric|title=At home with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/careers-leadership/at-home-with-russian-oligarch-oleg-deripaska/article573998/?page=all|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|date=11 February 2011|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska credits his grandparents for teaching him the discipline of hard work along with farming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both his grandfathers fought in the [[Second World War]]; one was killed in battle and buried in a mass grave in [[Austria]], the other returned to Russia after the war ended.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=PROFILE: 'We're waiting for the aluminium industry to do its homework,' Deripaska says |url=http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3250360/Search/PROFILE-Were-waiting-for-the-aluminium-industry-to-do-its.html?PageId=196010&amp;Keywords=deripaska&amp;OrderType=1&amp;PageMove=2#axzz3sPgcUxAJ |publisher=metalbulletin.com |accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deripaska's first job was at the Ust-Labinsk plant where his mother worked. At age 11, he became an electrician's apprentice doing maintenance on electrical motors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Deripaska acquired a passion for reading; his favorite authors were [[Mayne Reid]] and [[Jack London]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Today, Basic Element's headquarters contain walls of books, reflecting Deripaska's lifelong love of reading.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His talent for math allowed him to enroll at the physics faculty of Moscow State University in 1985.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One year into his studies, he was conscripted into the armed forces and served in the Soviet army's Strategic Missile Forces&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the [[Transbaikal Military District|Trans-Baikal area]], Siberia, from 1986–1989.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Education ===
In 1993, Deripaska graduated with honors in physics from [[Moscow State University]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Element – History|url=http://www.basel.ru/en/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] greatly eliminated academic funding and made it impossible for him to continue his studies as a [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were no stipends or grants for students either. "We had no money. It was an urgent and practical question every day. How do I earn money to buy food and keep studying?" he recalls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1996, he earned a master's degree from the [[Plekhanov Russian University of Economics|Plekhanov University of Economics]].&lt;ref name="globeandmail2011"/&gt;

===Early career===
At the age of 25, teaming up with fellow physicists, engineers and rocket scientists, Deripaska set up his first metal trading company, VTK. He adopted a systematic, scientific approach to [[commodity trading]]. "I represented companies that were buying and selling raw materials", Deripaska said.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Deripaska undertook export arbitrage, buying metal at low Russian prices and selling it abroad at significantly higher international market prices. Deripaska traded primarily through the Baltic state of [[Estonia]] as the Russian system of export licenses was in disarray.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "I started my business at an unusual moment in history. The country in which I was born raised had disappeared, although the new country was not fully formed. The first one gave me an excellent education; the second one gave me the chance of success", Deripaska recalled in an interview with ''[[Metal Bulletin]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He used nearly all his arbitrage and trading profits to acquire his initial package of shares in the [[Sayanogorsk]] Aluminium Smelter in [[Southern Siberia]].&lt;ref name="FACTBOX: Who is Oleg Deripaska"&gt;{{Cite news|title=FACTBOX: Who is Oleg Deripaska?|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-deripaska-profile-idUSTRE51L1IH20090222|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 1994, Deripaska bought vouchers and shares in Sayanogorsk, and accumulated a 20% stake in the factory, becoming the biggest individual shareholder after the Russian State—to the annoyance of the plant's Communist-era bosses.

In 1994, Deripaska became director general of the plant at the age of 26.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1997, he founded Sibirsky (Siberian) Aluminium Group, which in 2000 merged with [[Roman Abramovich]]'s [[Millhouse Capital]] to create RUSAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=RUSAL battle set for British court|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2012/news/world/07/07/rusal-battle-set-for-british-court-2/|work=Stabroek News|date=7 July 2012|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, businesses led by Deripaska increased their stake in those companies under common management to 75% by acquiring half of the interest managed by Millhouse Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB955986247819859000|title=Russia's Aluminum Barons Form Cartel to Control 10% of Output|author=Jeanne Whalen|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 January 2016|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the consolidation of RUSAL's ownership by companies related to Deripaska was completed with the acquisition of the remaining 25% equity interest in RUSAL managed by Millhouse Capital.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106443818395367800|title=Aluminum Shake-Up May Loom in Russia|author=Jeanne Whalen|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 January 2016|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business growth===
[[RUSAL]] went on to become the largest aluminium producer in the world, until the [[China Hongqiao Group]] surpassed it in 2015. In 2010, under Deripaska's leadership, Rusal became the first Russian company to be listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Beyond metals, which remain at the core of his diversified industrial holding, Deripaska has acquired stakes in a wide range of companies in various sectors, including energy, manufacturing, commercial vehicles, auto components, financial and insurance services,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sberbank of Russia: Basic Element, Sberbank and Changi Airports International sign Memorandum of Understanding for Airport Business Partnership|url= http://data.sberbank.ru/en/press_center/all/index.php?id114=11014378|website=data.sberbank.ru|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; leasing businesses, construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Строительство|url=http://www.basel.ru/building-realty/Construction/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318192513/http://www.basel.ru/building-realty/construction/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 March 2015|website=www.basel.ru|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; aviation, and agriculture.

Basic Element built several Olympic facilities for [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], including the Coastal Olympic Village, Imeretisnkiy sea port, Doubler of Kurortny Avenue in Sochi, renovation of the Sochi International Airport.

==Later business career==

===Basic Element===
Deripaska is the sole owner and Chairman of Supervisory Board of [[Basic Element (company)|Basic Element]], a diversified investment group established in 1997 which has been managing his investments in the following six sectors: [[Energy (society)|energy]], metals and mining, machinery, [[financial services]], agriculture, construction, and aviation.

=== Metals and mining ===

====RUSAL====
[[Rusal|United Company RUSAL]] is the world's second largest aluminium company. It was the largest until it was overtaken by [[China Hongqiao Group]] in 2015. UC RUSAL accounts for almost 7% of the world's primary aluminium output and 7% of the world's alumina production. The company employs over 63 000 in 20 countries on five continents.

In order to ensure a stable supply of alumina to its smelters, several mergers and acquisitions were accomplished by RUSAL under Deripaska's guidance. At the beginning of the 2000s, RUSAL acquired bauxite mines in [[Guinea]], a country with the world's largest bauxite reserves. Subsequently, RUSAL acquired a stake in an alumina refinery in [[Australia]]. At Deripaska's behest, in 2007, RUSAL, [[SUAL Group]], one of the world's top 10 aluminum producers; and [[Glencore|Glencore International AG]], the Swiss natural resources group, merged their assets to form United Company RUSAL, the world's largest aluminum and alumina producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-deripaska-profile-idUSTRE51L1IH20090222|title=FACTBOX: Who is Oleg Deripaska?|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=14 January 2016|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the merger with [[Glencore]], bauxite and alumina assets in [[Jamaica]], Italy and Ireland were added to RUSAL's portfolio. These transactions converted RUSAL from a company with few supplies of the raw material bauxite into a vertically integrated corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Без партнеров|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2004/10/18/bez-partnerov|publisher=vedomosti.ru|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Deripaska invested significantly in the operational improvement of smelters inside Russia. He said, "We consolidated the industry, and located bauxites that do not exist in Russia. We established the company that became the leader of industry in less than twelve years. But to become the number one alumimium producer in the world, we had to improve our operations practice. To apply the best practices in the world, we looked at Toyota, which had utilized a precise, deep and well thought-through process for almost thirty years of operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusal.ru/upload/uf/573/PROSPECTUS.pdf|title=United Company RUSAL Limited|publisher=RUSAL|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska himself has been an active supporter Japanese production efficiencies made popular by the "[[The Toyota Way|Toyota Way]]." RUSAL smelters have adopted the concept of ''[[kaizen]]'', which means continuous improvement and involves training workers in standardized production techniques. "It's important to change both the company’s mind set and reporting lines," Deripaska said. "Instead of top-down management, you should understand everything is in the hands of your operator and empower that operator to drive efficiencies and improvements directly on the factory floor."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Under Deripaska's leadership, RUSAL constructed and commissioned Khakas aluminium smelter outside of Sayanogorsk in Russian Siberia. The Khakas facility was the first aluminium smelter built in post-Soviet Russia (since 1985). The smelter, with an annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, is currently one of the most technologically advanced in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/oct/22/theobserver.observerbusiness9|title=Simon Caulkin: The world's most modern plant - and it's in Siberia|last=Caulkin|first=Simon|date=22 October 2006|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The company also undertook large-scale modernization projects at a number of its facilities, including the Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk aluminium smelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HKUST IAS - UC RUSAL President's Forum|url=http://ias.ust.hk/ucrusal/2010/transcript.html|publisher=ias.ust.hk|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the financial crisis, Deripaska returned in 2009 to RUSAL as CEO to lead the company through the debt restructuring process. "I worked 16-hour days. We were in default, although none of the parties involved wanted to call it default." As part of contingency measures, Deripaska cut costs at RUSAL by 25% in 2009. By December 2009, Deripaska reached a final agreement with over 70 Russian and international lenders to refinance US$17 billion of debt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2017, Rusal issued two [[Eurobond]]s to finance its debts. The first one, worth $600 million, was issued in February&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://aluminiuminsider.com/rusal-prices-initial-eurobond |title=Rusal Prices Initial Eurobond |date=30 January 2017|work=Aluminium Insider| accessdate =2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, followed by the second one in April, worth $500 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.ft.com/content/1084218c-2cdc-355b-a52f-7887fb4aea59|title=Rusal profit amid rebound in aluminium prices|work =Financial Times |accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in February, plans were announced to sell 10 billion yuan worth of seven-year onshore bonds to finance purchases in China. This made Rusal the first foreign company to offer [[panda bonds]] on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2069488/aluminium-giant-rusal-plans-10-billion-yuan-panda-bond-issue|title=Rusal plans 10 billion yuan panda bond issue in Shanghai|work=South China Morning Post|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also agreed on a pre-export finance mechanism with international lenders worth $1.7 billion for debt refinancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aluminiuminsider.com/rusal-negotiates-us1-7-bn-pxf-debt-facility |title=Rusal Negotiates US$1.7 BN PXF Debt Facility |date=26 May 2017|work=Aluminium Insider|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Deripaska was awarded the "Aluminium Industry Ambassador Award" in the ''[[Metal Bulletin]]'' Awards for Excellence for his "great influence within the global aluminium industry and the wider market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners of Metal Bulletin's awards for aluminium excellence 2013|url=http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3256866/Search/Winners-of-Metal-Bulletins-awards-for-aluminium-excellence.html|work=[[Metal Bulletin]]|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska stepped down from RUSAL in May 2018 the day after seven board members and the chief executive resigned. The move was part of an effort to get U.S. sanctions removed from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanctioned Tycoon Deripaska Resigns as Director of His Firm Rusal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/25/business/25reuters-usa-russia-sanctions-rusal.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 May 2018|access-date=27 May 2018|agency=Reuters|last1=Devitt|first1=Polina|last2=Voronova|first2=Tatiana|last3=Korsunskaya|first3=Darya|last4=Lowe|first4=Christian|editor-last=Anantharaman|editor-first=Muralikumar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The G8 leaders discussed the recommendations during the summit in Japan on 7–9 July 2008. The process was coordinated by the [[World Economic Forum]] in collaboration with the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/ghg/index.htm|title=World Economic Forum; Climate Change; CEO Climate Policy Recommendations to G8 Leaders|publisher=World Economic Forum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213183842/http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/ghg/index.htm|archivedate=13 December 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.basel.ru/en/media/news/200807/news_07_07_2008/ Expert magazine; "Zero Waste"; interview] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska actively advocates cutting the global carbon footprint and calls for the creation of an enforcement mechanism with consequences for countries that do not reduce carbon-intensive emissions, such as those produced by coal-fired powerplants.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b72f19fe-7432-11e5-a129-3fcc4f641d98.html|title=Deripaska warns about competitive risks from Paris climate deal|last=Sanderson|first=Henry|date=18 October 2015|work=Financial Times|accessdate=13 January 2016|last2=Clark|first2=Pilita|issn=0307-1766}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also remains a strong advocate of a legally binding climate change deal, but has publicly voiced concern about the potential competitive impact of a [[Paris climate agreement]] and also about the absence of binding measures to curb each country's emissions in the near future.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; "Everyone is in favour; we just need to have more or less fair regulation. There shouldn't be any pockets where people can cheat the system. People shouldn't agree on something that creates another Kyoto protocol that creates nice polished statements", he told the ''Financial Times'' in January 2016.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Other activities===

In February 2014, Deripaska financed the construction of makeshift kennels to house stray dogs that had been abandoned by construction workers after completing work on the [[Sochi Olympic Stadium|Sochi Olympic Village]]. Officials said the number of strays exceeded 2,000 and the animals presented a risk of [[rabies]], so they contracted out their extermination. Many of these dogs were saved and more were re-homed in a global adoption program that Deripaska created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sochi-olympic-parks-condemned-stray-dogs-saved-by-russian-billionaire-9118727.html|title=Sochi Olympic Park's condemned stray dogs 'saved by Russian billionaire'|last=Withnall|first=Adam|date=10 February 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=10 February 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NIpi8tqF?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sochi-olympic-parks-condemned-stray-dogs-saved-by-russian-billionaire-9118727.html|archivedate=11 February 2014|deadurl=yes|location=London|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assisted FBI with Rescue of Levinson== 
Between mid-2008 and 2009, Deripaska helped the then-FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]] rescue a former FBI-agent [[Robert Levinson]], who disappeared in 2007 while working for the CIA in Iran. The then-FBI deputy director [[Andrew McCabe]] played key role in courting Deripaska. Agents secretly met Deripaska in hotels in Paris, Vienna, Budapest, Hungary, and Washington, convincing him to spend millions of his own dollars funding the FBI-supervised operation to Levinson. His participation was crucial, as he had close business ties in Iran, and because of economic sanctions imposed on Iran and other laws made it illegal for the FBI or any US citizen to spend any money in Iran. Deripaska's lawyer said he spent $25 million on a private search-and-rescue team that worked with Iranian contacts while monitored by the FBI.

Deripaska managed to arrange the release of Levinson, but the U.S. State Department, then under [[Hillary Clinton]], blocked a deal for Levinson's return from going through. Robyn Gritz, the retired agent who supervised the Levinson case in 2009, said: "We tried to turn over every stone we could to rescue Bob, but every time we started to get close, the State Department seemed to always get in the way". “We were told at one point that the terms of Levinson’s release had been agreed to by Iran and the U.S. and included a statement by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pointing a finger away from Iran. At the last minute, Secretary Clinton decided not to make the agreed-on statement.”

The operation was ended in 2011, because FBI officials were concerned that Deripaska's Iranian contacts couldn't deliver with all the U.S. infighting. The FBI rewarded Deripaska for his help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/387625-mueller-may-have-a-conflict-and-it-leads-directly-to-a-russian-oligarch |title=Mueller may have a conflict — and it leads directly to a Russian oligarch |publisher=''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' |first=John |last=Solomon |date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/world/middleeast/a-disappearing-american-spy-and-the-cia.html |title=A Disappearing Spy, and a Scandal at the C.I.A. |publisher=''The New York Times'' |first=Barry |last=Meier |date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FBI recruitment attempt ==
According to anonymous sources cited by the 1 September 2018 [[New York Times]]′s report, Deripaska was twice approached by the U.S. government officials, including [[Bruce Ohr]], as part of the U.S. government wider FBI–led recruitment effort to obtain informers in the circle close to [[Vladimir Putin]]: in September 2015 and in September 2016.&lt;ref name="nytflipoligarchs"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vogel |first1=Kenneth P. |last2=Rosenberg |first2=Matthew |title=Agents Tried to Flip Russian Oligarchs.

In September 2015, Ohr and Steele met with Deripaska to discuss "connections between Russian organized crime and Mr. Putin’s government, as well as other issues, according to a person familiar with the events." Deripaska laughed them off and did not agree to a second meeting.&lt;ref name="nytflipoligarchs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.zeit.de/news/2018-09/02/bericht-us-ermittler-wollten-oligarchen-deripaska-als-informanten-gewinnen-20180902-doc-18s9cd |title=Bericht: US-Ermittler wollten Oligarchen Deripaska als Informanten gewinnen |publisher=''[[Die Zeit]]'' |date=2 September 2018 |lang=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-us-investigators-probing-trump-sought-to-cultivate-russian-oligarchs/ |title=Report: US investigators probing Trump sought to cultivate Russian oligarchs |publisher=''[[The Times of Israel]]'' |date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, F.B.I. agents showed up unannounced at Deripaska's door in New York in September 2016.&lt;ref name="nytflipoligarchs" /&gt;

The attempts to turn Deripaska into an informant undertaken between 2014 and 2016 were unsuccessful, Deripaska notified the Russian authorities of the US efforts to recruit him.&lt;ref name="nytflipoligarchs" /&gt;

In September 2018, Russia's government accused the US of meddling in the country's affairs by attempting to recruit Russian citizens as agents for American security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/57cbf8e4-af6f-11e8-8d14-6f049d06439c |title=Russia says US spy agencies attempting to interfere in its affairs |publisher=''Financial Times'' {{subscription required}} |first=Henry |last=Foy |date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Cherney lawsuit===
[[Michael Cherney]] brought legal action against Deripaska in the [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|Commercial Court]] of the [[High Court]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-worlds-richest-russian-is-sued-for-3bn-in-london-437814.html|title=The world's richest Russian is sued for $3bn in London|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=25 February 2007|accessdate=14 May 2011|first=Andrew|last=Osborn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherney sought a declaration that he was the beneficial owner of 20% of [[RUSAL]] stock which, he claimed, Deripaska held in trust for him. The claim was denied. On 3 May 2007, Justice Langley ruled that Deripaska had not been properly [[service of process|served]], and that the court had no [[jurisdiction]] to try the claim as Deripaska did not live in England or Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2007/965.html|title=''Cherney v Deripaska'', 2007 EWHC 965 (Comm)|publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2008, Justice Christopher Clarke ruled that the case should be tried in England, although "the natural forum for this litigation is Russia", because, he held, "risks inherent in a trial in Russia...are sufficient to make England the forum in which the case can most suitably be tried in the interest of both parties and the ends of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2008/1530.html|title=''Cherney v Deripaska'', 2008 EWHC 1530 (Comm)|publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2008, he granted Deripaska leave to appeal. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales refused the appeal on 31 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/849.html|title=Deripaska v Cherney, 2009 EWCA Civ 849|publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- is refused the right word? Can't think of a better one right now --&gt;

At a June 2011 case management conference, the judge deferred a decision on whether Cherney would be allowed to give evidence by video link from Israel rather than appear in person. An outstanding arrest warrant issued by [[Interpol]] meant that the British would detain him if he travelled to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Jonny.

In an interview with ''The Telegraph'', Deripaska said he was one of the few who worked to clean up Russian industry and provided support to law enforcement agencies. However, in this early chaotic period paying protection money to criminal gangs was inescapable, as revealed in court testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Oleg Deripaska: Why I paid crime gangs for protection| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/9218657/Oleg-Deripaska-Why-I-paid-crime-gangs-for-protection.html|work=The Telegraph |accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Cherney terminated his UK lawsuit against Deripaska.&lt;ref name="Suit Against Russian Billionaire Is Dropped, WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444549204578022433469797910 |title=Suit Against Russian Billionaire Is Dropped|work=The Wall Street Journal|first1=Paul|last1=Sonne|first2=Alexander|last2=Kolyandr|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. investigation===
In 2015, Deripaska filed a lawsuit against [[Morgan Stanley]], accusing the bank of using [[insider information]] to [[short (finance)|short sell]] the businessman's $1.5 billion investment in shares of Magma in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Morgan Stanley to face Russian tycoon's insider trading claims |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/morgan-stanley-trial-idINL1N12S3RO20151101|website=Reuters India|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Deripaska's Veleron [[investment vehicle]] acquired stock in Canadian based [[Magna International]] through a $1.2 billion loan from [[BNP Paribas]], with Magna shares serving as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska sues Morgan Stanley|url=https://www.rt.com/business/320611-deripaska-rusal-bank-court/|website=RT International|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan Stanley was involved in the deal through a swap agreement with BNP Paribas where the US bank assumed the risks of the loan in return for a fixed payment from Paribas.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Morgan Stanley Defeats Russian Tycoon’s Short-Selling Claims|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-13/morgan-stanley-defeats-russian-tycoon-s-short-selling-claims-igy8py53|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=13 January 2016|first=Bob|last=Van Voris|first2=Erik|last2=Larson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Magna's stocks plummeted, hit by the global economic downturn. BNP issued a $93 million [[margin call]] to Veleron. Morgan Stanley, in turn, learned that Veleron was unlikely to meet the call and sold the stock short.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|title=UPDATE 1-Morgan Stanley cleared in Russian tycoon's insider trading lawsuit|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/morgan-stanley-trial-idUSL1N1382UF20151113|newspaper=Reuters|date=13 November 2015|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska claimed that Morgan Stanley abused its duties and engaged in unlawful [[insider trading]] that resulted in significant financial damage to Veleron, estimated at $15 million to $25 million.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; A New York jury determined in November 2015 that Morgan Stanley had "acquired inside information and traded on it despite a duty to keep it confidential and not trade on it," finding as well that Morgan Stanley did not have the intent to [[defraud]] Veleron. Veleron strongly disagreed with and said it would file an appeal.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;{{when|date=June 2016}}

In July 2006, whilst Deripaska was involved in a bid to buy the [[Daimler Chrysler]] Group, it was reported that the United States canceled his entry visa; the unnamed official declined to give a reason for the revoking of the visa. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that it could have been because Deripaska has been accused of having links to organized crime in Russia and cited as their sources two unnamed U.S. law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1143738620070511|title=U.S. revoked Deripaska visa – State Dep't official|first=Jim|last=Wolf|date=11 May 2007|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported on 27 August 2018 that the visa had been revoked on concerns Deripaska might attempt to launder money through real estate transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/politics/bruce-ohr-trump-justice-department.html|title=Bruce Ohr Fought Russian Organized Crime. Now He’s a Target of Trump.|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska had received a multiple-entry visa in 2005; a U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] spokesman refused to comment. Lobbying on his behalf had been done by former Senate Republican leader and 1996 presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]] and his Alston &amp; Bird law partners, Senate records show. Alston &amp; Bird was paid about US$260,000 in 2005 for work on "Department of State visa policies and procedures" tied to Deripaska.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

In 2009, Deripaska was again allowed entry and visited the United States twice. ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that according to two unnamed FBI administration officials, Deripaska had met with agents regarding a continuing criminal probe, the details of the probe were not known or reported. During Deripaska's visits, he met with leading management figures from investment banks [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]]. The Aluminum company that Deripaska heads, [[United Company RUSAL]], was in preparations for an initial public offering. The easing of Deripaska's visa issues which were an issue for possible investors helped to reassure bankers. The State Department has never said why it revoked his visa and refused to comment on his 2009 visits. The visits were arranged outside of the usual process as the U.S. continues to have concerns about Deripaska's business associations. Deripaska has repeatedly denied a connection to any organized crime and said business rivals have caused the visa to be revoked by smearing him. When interviewed by the BBC in July 2009, Deripaska said that the authorities in the United States had been attempting to blackmail him by revoking his visa and thus affecting possible investors in a negative way and thereby hoping to push Deripaska into cooperating with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125687000832717809 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Deripaska Accused U.S. of Blackmail | date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish investigation===

According to an article in ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', Deripaska and [[Iskander Makhmudov]] (head of UGMK) were asked by Spanish police to answer questions in relation to a money-laundering enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2010/03/21/mercados/23228430.html |title=Quiosco, El Mundo en ORBYT |work=El Mundo|location=Spain |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish state prosecutor's office subsequently confirmed Deripaska's interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1282571/Oligarch-friend-Peter-Mandelson-faces-cash-launder-quiz.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |work=Daily Mail | title=Oligarch friend of Mandelson faces cash launder quiz | date=30 May 2010 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Deripaska has been interrogated previously as a witness in Spain and England and by the FBI in cases of [[money laundering]], he has never been charged with any crimes in those probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125685578903317087 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=FBI Lets Barred Tycoon Visit U.S | first1=Evan | last1=Perez | first2=Gregory L. | last2=White | date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2010, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' published a story "Rusal: A lingering heat" exploring Deripaska's business relations with Sergei Popov and Anton Malevsky, alleged heads of Russian organized crime groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/70a1c458-09ff-11df-8b23-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1 |title=/ Comment / Analysis – Rusal: A lingering heat |work=Financial Times |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska has accused Michael Chernoy of using Malevsky and the [[Izmaylovskaya gang|Izmailovskaya syndicate]] to extort US$250&amp;nbsp;million from him as part of a protection racket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/clash-of-the-oligarchs-1753022.html|title=Clash of the oligarchs|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=20 July 2009|accessdate=14 May 2011|first=Donald|last=MacIntyre}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Deripaska has himself been accused of having similar links to Malevsky, who, with his brother Andrei, owned a 10% stake in Deripaska's company. Deripaska denies the claims.&lt;ref&gt;Swinford, Steven, "Peter Mandelson oligarch Oleg Deripaska linked to mafia boss", ''The Sunday Times'' (London), 26 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Spain's High Court sent the criminal cases against Deripaska to the Russian General Prosecutor's office because the root of the cases is Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.gazeta.ru/news/2011/11/25/a_3848274.shtml|title=Russian Tycoon Deripaska's case given to Russia's court by Spain|publisher=gazeta.ru|first=Darya|last=Ispolnova|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political relationships===
[[File:Vladimir Putin 19 March 2002-4.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Deripaska, 19 March 2002]]
====Vladimir Putin====
Deripaska is noted for his close ties with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]. Their relationship was visibly strained amidst Deripaska's financial struggles in 2009, but in a widely broadcast incident on Russian television, Putin visited a stalled cement factory owned by Deripaska and berated its management. He forced Deripaska to sign a contract promising to pay nearly $1 million in unpaid wages.&lt;ref name="globeandmail2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliphant|first1=Roland|title=Fifteen years of Vladimir Putin: in quotes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/11588182/Fifteen-years-of-Vladimir-Putin-in-quotes.html|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 May 2015|language=en}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Leda|title=ISIS beware: THIS is how hardman Russian President Vladimir Putin gets things DONE|url= http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/610552/ISIS-beware-THIS-is-how-hardman-Vladimir-Putin-gets-things-DONE|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=The Express| date=7 October 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship recovered, however, and Deripaska has been described as "Putin's favorite [[Business magnate|industrialist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcin|first1=Tim|title=Meet Oleg Deripaska, who allegedly worked with former Trump aide Paul Manafort to push Putin's views| url=http://www.newsweek.com/who-oleg-deripaska-paul-manafort-russian-putin-572157|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=Newsweek|date=22 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables]] from 2006 described Deripaska as "among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis" and "a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin's trips abroad".&lt;ref name="ap32217"&gt;{{cite news|last1= Horowitz| first1=Jeff|last2=Day|first2=Chad|title=AP findings on Trump associate's work for Russian oligarch|url=https://apnews.com/ba0027b4c29a4863b096d7216ee0ca58/ap-findings-trump-associates-work-russian-oligarch|accessdate=25 May 2017|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Tye Burt, who knows Deripaska and is the CEO of [[Kinross Gold]] said that, "I believe Russia recognizes Oleg's major role in building a renewed economic base in a broad range of domestic businesses and rejuvenating ailing companies and infrastructure."&lt;ref name="globeandmail2011"/&gt;

====Nathaniel Rothschild and Peter Mandelson====
Deripaska is a friend of [[Nathaniel Philip Rothschild|Nathaniel Rothschild]], a major investor in both [[Glencore]] and [[United Company RUSAL]]. Together Deripaska and Rothschild hosted [[George Osborne]] and [[Peter Mandelson]] on Deripaska's yacht in [[Corfu]] in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

It was reported that [[Peter Mandelson]] had maintained private contacts over several years with Oleg Deripaska&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4982163.ece|title=Lord Mandelson and Oleg Deripaska dined together 'a year before they met'|last=Robertson|first=David|date=21 October 2008|newspaper=The Times|location=UK|accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

News of the contacts sparked criticism because, as European Union Trade Commissioner, Mandelson had been responsible for decision to cut aluminium tariffs from 6 to 3%, a decision that had benefited Deripaska's Company [[RusAl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/371829.htm|title=UK Conservatives Linked to Deripaska|date=22 October 2008|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]] |accessdate= 23 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081126051311/http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/371829.htm|archivedate=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelson insisted that he had never discussed aluminium tariffs with Deripaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4932191.ece|title=Peter Mandelson dogged by his links to Russian oligarch|date=13 October 2008|newspaper=The Times|last2=Charter|first2=David|location=UK|accessdate=23 October 2008|first1=David|last1=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2008 the [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] claimed the "whole country" wanted "transparency" about Mandelson's previous meetings with Deripaska. In response, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said Mandelson's dealings with Deripaska had been "found to be above board".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7691678.stm|title=Tories seek Mandelson 'clarity'|date=26 October 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelson said that meeting business figures from "across the range" in emerging economies was part of his brief as EU Trade Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/28/peter-mandelson-oleg-deripaska-corfu|title=Mandelson silent on Deripaska|last=Parfitt|first=Tom|date=28 October 2008|newspaper=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2008, while Mandelson was on a ministerial visit to Moscow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/29/russia-mandelson|title=Mandelson hails thaw in relations with Moscow|last=Parfitt|first=Tom|date=29 October 2008|work =The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was alleged in the British press that [[Valery Pechyonkin|Valery Pechenkin]], the head of security at Deripaska's company Basic Element, had organised a swift entry visa for Mandelson when he turned up in [[Moscow]] to visit Deripaska in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23579423-details/Veteran+KGB+spy+revealed+as+Deripaska%27s+right-hand+man/article.do|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101053919/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23579423-details/Veteran+KGB+spy+revealed+as+Deripaska%27s+right-hand+man/article.do|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 November 2008|title=Veteran KGB spy revealed as Deripaska's right-hand man|date=29 October 2008|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|accessdate=30 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paul Manafort====
On 22 March 2017, the [[Associated Press]] published a report alleging that&amp;nbsp;[[Paul Manafort]], [[Donald Trump]]'s former presidential campaign manager, negotiated a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska to promote Russian interests in politics, business, and media coverage in Europe and the United States, starting in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a/Manafort's-plan-to-'greatly-benefit-the-Putin-Government|title=Trump campaign chief linked to Putin interests|last=HORWITZ and DAY|first=|date=22 March 2017|work=Associated Press|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402165112/https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a/Manafort's-plan-to-'greatly-benefit-the-Putin-Government|archive-date=2 April 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Deripaska and Manafort have confirmed to have worked together in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/know-paul-manafort-links-oleg-224806634.html|title=What We Know About Paul Manafort's Links to Oleg Deripaska and the Kremlin|accessdate=5 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected the contents of the AP story. Manafort argued that his work had been inaccurately presented, and that there was nothing “inappropriate or nefarious" about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/326170-russian-billionaire-i-didnt-aid-putin-with-manafort|title=Russian billionaire denies aiding Putin with Manafort|last=Hensch|first=Mark|date=28 March 2017|work=TheHill|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the allegations, on 28 March 2017, Deripaska published open letters in the print editions of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', in which he denied having signed a $10 million contract with Manafort in order to benefit the [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|Putin government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/russian-manafort-client-willing-to-speak-to-congress/2017/03/28/1add6c1a-13e9-11e7-bb16-269934184168_story.html|title=Russian Manafort client: Willing to speak to Congress|website=Washington Post| accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated his willingness to testify before the [[United States Congress]] to dispel these allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/russian-manafort-client-willing-to-speak-to-congress/2017/03/28/1add6c1a-13e9-11e7-bb16-269934184168_story.html|title=Russian Manafort client: Willing to speak to Congress|website=Washington Post|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-paul-manafort-ties-donald-trump-campaign-manager-us-congress-a7655291.html|title=Russian billionaire with ties to Trump’s ex-campaign manager says he is willing to testify before Congress|date=29 March 2017|work= The Independent|accessdate=5 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that the accusations fall "into the negative context of current US-Russian relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-paul-manafort-ties-donald-trump-campaign-manager-us-congress-a7655291.html|title=Russian billionaire with ties to Trump's ex-campaign manager says he is willing to testify before Congress|date=29 March 2017|work=The Independent|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Congressional sources cited by ''[[The New York Times]]'', lawmakers declined Deripaska's request, after it emerged that he had asked for immunity.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential campaign]], Manafort, via [[Kiev]]-based operative [[Konstantin Kilimnik]], offered to provide briefings on political developments to Deripaska, though there is no evidence that the briefings took place.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/manafort-offered-to-give-russian-billionaire-private-briefings-on-2016-campaign/2017/09/20/399bba1a-9d48-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html |date=20 September 2017 |title=Manafort offered to give Russian billionaire ‘private briefings’ on 2016 campaign |first=Tom |last=Hamburger |first2=Rosalind S. |last2=Helderman |first3=Carol D. |last3=Leonnig |first4=Adam |last4=Entous |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921003301/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/manafort-offered-to-give-russian-billionaire-private-briefings-on-2016-campaign/2017/09/20/399bba1a-9d48-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html |archive-date=21 September 2017 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[Politico]]'' |title=Manafort used Trump campaign account to email Ukrainian operative |first=Josh |last=Dawsey |date=20 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921003929/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/20/paul-manafort-trump-campaign-email-ukrainian-operative-242949 |archive-date=21 September 2017 |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/20/paul-manafort-trump-campaign-email-ukrainian-operative-242949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors such as these were seen as an attempt by Manafort to please an oligarch tied to Putin's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/emails-suggest-manafort-sought-approval-from-putin-ally-deripaska/541677 |title=Did Manafort Use Trump to Curry Favor With a Putin Ally?

==== Navalny video ====
In February 2018, [[Alexei Navalny]] published a video about a meeting between Deripaska and Deputy Prime Minister of Russia [[Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko]] on a yacht traveling near Norway. According to Navalny, Deripaska probably served as a middle man between the Russian government represented by Prikhodko and Paul Manafort during [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]].&lt;ref name="Rybka"/&gt; Prikhodko denied the allegations, accusing Navalny of "mixing the facts" about his "friend" Deripaska, [[Donald Trump]] and [[Paul Manafort]], while also voicing his wish to have talk with Navalny as a "man with a man".&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbc.ru/politics/09/02/2018/5a7dc6479a7947a4be81bebb|title=Вице-премьер Приходько заявил о желании ответить Навальному по-мужски|publisher=РБК|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=ru-RU|work=Meduza|title=Роскомнадзор потребовал от «Медиазоны» и «Радио Свобода» удалить фотографии из новости про Дерипаску, Приходько и Рыбку|url=https://meduza.io/news/2018/02/09/roskomnadzor-potreboval-ot-mediazony-udalit-fotografii-iz-novosti-pro-deripasku-prihodko-i-rybku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=10 February 2018|title=Вице-премьер Приходько хочет ответить Навальному по-мужски|url=https://ura.news/news/1052323171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after the video was published the [[Roskomnadzor]] added the video to the [[Federal List of Extremist Materials]], thus making accessing the video illegal for all Russian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=10 February 2018|language=ru-RU|work=Interfax.ru|title=Суд включил в реестр запрещенной информации фильм ФБК о Дерипаске и Приходько|url=http://www.interfax.ru/russia/599352}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ordered [[YouTube]] to remove seven videos and [[Instagram]] to take down 14 points that were cited in the investigation; neither YouTube nor Instagram had responded as of 12 February 2018. According to a Roskomnadzor representative who spoke to ''[[Vedomosti]]'', a "court injunction of this sort against content hosted on Instagram and YouTube is unprecedented for Russia". The ''New York Times'' noted that this may presage a "more aggressive approach by the Russian government" to control online activities.&lt;ref name="lux"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luxmoore|first1=Matthew|title=Russia Threatens to Block YouTube and Instagram, After Complaints From an Oligarch|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/world/europe/russia-youtube-instagram-navalny.html|accessdate=13 February 2018| work= New York Times|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported on 5 March 2018, that [[:uk:Настя Рибка|Anastasia Vashukevich]], a Belarusian national currently incarcerated in [[Bangkok]], claims to have over 16 hours of audio recordings she says could shed light on possible Russian interference in American elections. She is offering the recordings to American authorities in exchange for asylum, to avoid extradition to Belarus. Vashukevich claims to be close to Deripaska and asserts the recordings include him discussing the 2016 presidential election with associates Vashukevich did not name. "Deripaska had a plan about elections," ''The New York Times'' quoted Vashukevich as saying. She stated that some of the recorded conversations, which she asserts were made in August 2016, included three individuals who spoke fluent English and whom she believed were Americans. ''The New York Times'' reported that her claims might be easily dismissed were it not for the Navalny video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/world/asia/nastya-rybka-trump-putin.html|title=Escort Says Audio Recordings Show Russian Meddling in U.S. Election|first=Richard C.|last=Paddock|date=5 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on him and 23 other Russian nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20180406.aspx |title=Ukraine-/Russia-related Designations and Identification Update|author= |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |publisher= |accessdate=6 April 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://meduza.io/news/2018/04/06/ssha-vveli-sanktsii-protiv-36-rossiyskih-biznesmenov |title=США ввели санкции против семи российских олигархов и 17 чиновников из «кремлевского списка» |trans-title=The US imposed sanctions against seven Russian oligarchs and 17 officials from the "Kremlin list" |author= |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[Meduza]] |publisher= |accessdate=6 April 2018 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the statement from the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] it was stated that Deripaska "has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering". According to the US treasury statement there are allegations that Deripaska ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338 |title=Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity|author= |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |publisher= |accessdate=11 April 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Deripaska was married to Polina Yumasheva, the daughter of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s top adviser [[Valentin Yumashev]] and stepdaughter of Yeltsin's daughter [[Tatyana Yumasheva|Tatyana]]. While Yeltsin was president, Deripaska's close ties put him in Yeltsin's inner circle, dubbed "The Family".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/business/yourmoney/20oligarch.html|title=Out of Siberia, a Russian Way to Wealth|last=Kramer|first=Andrew E.|date=20 August 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2 June 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/7063201/Boris-Yeltsins-daughter-attacks-Vladimir-Putin.html|title=Boris Yeltsin's daughter attacks Vladimir Putin|last=Osborn|first=Andrew|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, several Russian media&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; reported that Deripaska and Yumasheva got divorced.

His favorite pets are dogs. At his home near Moscow, he has seven horses and six dogs.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In March 2018, it was reported that Deripaska had successfully purchased [[Cypriot citizenship]] in 2017 under Cyprus' "golden visa" that generates billions of revenue for the island nation. According to documents seen by ''[[The Guardian]]'', Deripaska's first attempt to become a citizen of a country in the EU was unsuccessful because of an preliminary inquiry into his activities in Belgium. The inquiry was dismissed in 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian02032018"/&gt;

The '''Porsche family''' is a prominent Austrian family of industrialists descending from the automotive pioneer [[Ferdinand Porsche]]. Its members have full ownership of the [[Porsche SE]] automobile company and majority voting rights over [[Volkswagen AG]], the biggest automaker in the world.

Ferdinand Porsche was born to a German-speaking family of [[Maffersdorf]], [[Bohemia]], son of Anton Porsche (1845-1908)  and Anna Ehrlich. The [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten German]] surname ''Porsche'' can be traced to the 18th century in the area of Reichenberg (now [[Liberec]]), Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;baptism of Joannes Josephus (Wenzel) Porsche on 16 July 1777 in Neuharzdorf,  Reichenberg parish, son of 
Antonius Porsche  ''Tibialifex'' (stocking-maker)  and of  M. Elisabeth.

&lt;/ref&gt; The surname originates with the German word ''[[:wikt:Bursche|Bursche]]'' ("boy, young man, apprentice, farmhand") and is on record in northern Bohemia in various spellings (''Porsch, Borsche, Borsch, Bursche, Bursch, Pursch, Pursche'', etc.) from the early 17th century.

==Definition of agency==
para 1.01, "Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (a 'principal') manifests assent to another person (an 'agent') that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests or otherwise consents so to act."

'''Ron S. Dembo''' is one of the world's leading authorities in [[risk management]], both as an academic and in business, having founded Algorithmics Inc. He is also the Founder and CEO of Zerofootprint, a [[cleantech]] software and services company.  He is the author of three books and numerous technical papers.

The Zerofootprint Foundation was founded in 2005 to engage communities everywhere in the battle against climate change. Its mission is to apply technology, design and risk management to the massive reduction of our environmental footprint.&lt;ref&gt;

It pursues causes that uphold values of sustainable development, risk management, research, and advocacy. The Foundation initiatives involve government (Federal, Provincial and Municipal), educators (universities, elementary and middle schools) and other not-for-profit organizations. Geographical and societal barriers do not limit its vision. Zerofootprint came in first place and won Gold in the Climate Change category at the [[Canadian Environment Awards]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

However, due the concerted effort put in by the DG CAA, Air Marshal (Rtd) Muhammad Yousaf, following projects were completed in the Civil Aviation Auuthority. The new Multan International Airport was inaugurated, [[Islamabad International Airport]] and the Hajj Lounge, Lahore were renovated, [[Quetta International Airport]] was established and expansion of the [[Faisalabad International Airport]] was initiated.

==Pakistan National Aviation Policy 2015==
He is responsible for the vision and development of the [[Pakistan National Aviation Policy 2015]], focusing on the reform and development of the aviation sector of Pakistan. Although a concerted campaign was started to show Aviation Policy as a game changer, it failed to bring any improvement in the aviation industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1489">[[image:VariableCostExample.jpg|thumb|right|500px|An example of an [[income statement]] using variable and absorption costing]]
'''Variable costing''' is a [[managerial accounting]] cost concept. Under this method, [[manufacturing overhead]] is incurred in the period that a product is produced. This addresses the issue of [[absorption costing]] that allows [[income]] to rise as [[Production (economics)|production]] rises. Under an absorption cost method, management can push forward costs to the next period when products are sold. This artificially inflates profits in the period of production by incurring less cost than would be incurred under a variable costing system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-biz.aum.edu/janheier/ABSORB2020.htm ABSORPTION VS VARIABLE COSTING LECTURE - BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS]&lt;/ref&gt; Variable costing is generally not used for external reporting purposes. Under the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], [[income statement]]s must use absorption costing to comply with [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]].

'''Variable costing''' is a costing method that includes only variable manufacturing costs—direct materials, direct labor, and variable manufacturing overhead—in unit product costs.&lt;ref&gt;Managerial Accounting: Ray H. Garrison, Eric W. Noreen, Peter C. Brewer, 14th edition, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PortraitCowie.png|thumb|right|William Clark Cowie.]]
'''William Clark Cowie''' (8 April 1849 in [[Friockheim]], [[Angus, Scotland|Forfarshire]]; – 14 September 1910 in [[Bad Nauheim]]) was a Scottish engineer, mariner, and businessman who helped establish [[North Borneo|British North Borneo]] and was Chairman of the [[North Borneo Chartered Company|British North Borneo Company]].&lt;ref name="cowie chairman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19091015-1.2.49?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=W.%20C.%20COWIE&amp;QT=w,c,cowie&amp;oref=article|title=NORTH BORNEO COMPANY.|work=[[The Straits Times]]|publisher=[[National Library Board, Singapore]]|date=15 October 1909|accessdate=11 May 2017|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Born on 8 April 1849, Cowie was the oldest of four children of the [[flax]] producer David Cowie (1825–1896) and Ann Cowie (1819–1906) in [[Scotland]], where his mother ancestors had lived for generations. His three siblings were Mary, Andson and Edward.&lt;ref name="genealogy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://keldine.ca/phpGedView/individual.php?pid=I2919|title=William Clark Cowie (I2919)|publisher=Kroll &amp; FitzGerald Family Tree|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFMPA1895"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepressb18950809-1.2.20?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=william%20clark%20cowie&amp;QT=william,clark,cowie&amp;oref=article|title=MR. W. CLARK COWIE.|work=The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser|publisher=National Library Board|date=9 August 1895|accessdate=11 May 2017|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moves to [[Arbroath]] on the Scottish east coast. His father was a director in the Wardmill Works of M.C. Thomson &amp; Co., and Cowie trained as an engineer.&lt;ref name="Cowie life"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19020130-1.2.58?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=Cowie%20engineer&amp;QT=cowie,engineer&amp;oref=article|title=MR. W. C. COWIE. (Romantic Tale of the Founder of B. N. B. Co.)|work=The Straits Times|publisher=National Library Board|date=30 January 1902|accessdate=21 May 2017|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received private lessons with the aim of following his grandfather, an engineer in one of the first mills in Scotland.&lt;ref name="SFMPA1895"/&gt;

Around 1873, Cowie married Flora Davidson. They had two children; Flora de Cruz (born 1874) and William Anson Edward Cowie de Cruz (born 1875).&lt;ref name="genealogy"/&gt; His wife died suddenly, aged 25, shortly after the birth of their second child. Cowie then married Amy Constance Pead, and they had two children; Muara Gladys (born 1888) and Andson Gordon (born 1891).&lt;ref name="genealogy"/&gt;

==Career until 1878==
[[File:W.C.Cowie and A.Cook-SultanOfSulu.png|thumb|right|Cowie with the Sultan of Sulu.]]
From April 1870, Cowie was hired as the chief engineer of ''Argyle'' under Captain Peter Orr and left Glasgow for Singapore on his 21st birthday.&lt;ref name="Cowie life"/&gt; He then began to lead life as an adventurer in the [[piracy|pirate]]-infested waters of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. His career as chief engineer for ''Argyle'' ended at the end of 1872 when he was hired by Carl Schomburgk as captain of the Far East, and was commissioned to break the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish]] naval blockade to deal with the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]], who ruled parts of the northern Borneo. His successful efforts forged a deep friendship with the Sultan of Sulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023151933|title=British North Borneo - An Account of its History, Resources and Native Tribes|author=Owen Rutter|work=Constable &amp; Company Ltd, London|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|year=1922|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,803760,00.html|title=BORNEO: Sunset on the Sulu Sea|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1 July 1946|accessdate=11 May 2017}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowie convinced the Sultan that to achieve a lasting success in overcoming the Spanish blockade he would need access to a safe harbour; from there he could wait until the shipping route to Sulu was free from Spanish warships. The Sultan permitted Cowie to build a port for his goods at [[Timbang Island]] in Sandakan, creating a British presence in [[Borneo]]. Cowie, along with two friends - Carl Schomburgk and John Dill Ross - founded the [[Labuan Trading Company]], whose main task was to evade the Spanish naval blockade and bring weapons, [[opium]], [[tobacco]] and goods to Sulu. No company ships were ever caught by the Spaniards.

==North Borneo Chartered Company==

[[File:BritishNorthBorneoCharteredCompany.png|thumb|Cowie with officials of the [[British North Borneo Company]].]]
In 1878, [[Baron von Overbeck]] and [[Alfred Dent]] approached Cowie knowing he has friendly with the Sultan of Sulu, asking for help in arranging land concessions in Borneo. Cowie agreed as he had plans to occupy territory as part of the [[British Empire]]. As the political situation was favourable to unilateral treaties, Cowie told the Sultan to leave the Spaniards to his country, helping foreign powers to take parts of the Sultan territory while expecting the Spanish would wish to avoid diplomatic involvement with the interests of other colonial powers. Cowie managed to get the Sultan to surrender his lands in north-eastern Borneo on 22 January 1878 for an annual payment of [[Pound sterling|£]]1,000; which was later given to Overbeck and Dent as they received the full power of government and territorial rights to the possessions in Borneo, including the islands. The rights from this treaty were then transferred to the newly-founded British North Borneo Company in 1881.

In March 1882, Cowie purchased a 40 year-concession for the exploitation of coal fields in [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] in Brunei and founded Cowie Brothers, based in Singapore. From Labuan, he rented a shipyard for 99 years from which he shipped his coal. On 12 July 1887, Cowie handed over his franchise rights to the British North Borneo Company and returned with his family to [[England]]. [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Charles Brooke]], who later acquired the mine, renamed it as "[[Brooketon Colliery|Brooketon]]" (today's Brooke Town).

In 1887, Cowie, together with Edmund Ernest Everett, was commissioned to conduct the company's business in Borneo. Due to the lack of transportation to move goods in the island, Cowie sought a concession to build a rail network from the [[West Coast Division]] to Sandakan. The company initially agreed and appointed Cowie as the Supervisory Board in 1894. In 1896 construction of the [[North Borneo Railway]] began but financial difficulties prevented the company fully connecting to northern Borneo; Cowie was unable to raise the necessary funds especially after company officials refused to borrow more money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/borneo.htm|title=The North Borneo Railway Project|author=Rob Dickinson|publisher=The International Steam Pages|accessdate=11 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328052920/http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/borneo.htm|archivedate=28 March 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, under the patronage of Cowie and his brother Andson, a dictionary for the [[Tausug language|Sulu]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] languages was created.&lt;ref&gt;Andson Cowie, William Clark Cowie: "English-Sulu-Malay Vocabulary: With Useful Sentences, Tables, Etc." Kessinger Publishing's Photocopy Edition, 1893&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appreciated for his extensive knowledge of the territory and the people of Borneo. He rose to the position of Director General in 1897. In [[North Borneo]] in 1898 he met with Mat Salleh to bring an indefinite solution of the so-called [[Mat Salleh Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes18981201-1.2.4?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=W.%20C.%20COWIE&amp;QT=w,c,cowie&amp;oref=article|title=FUTURE OF BORNEO.|work=The Straits Times|publisher=National Library Board|date=1 December 1898|accessdate=11 May 2017|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 1909, after the retirement of [[Charles Jessel]], he became Chairman of the Supervisory Board.&lt;ref name="cowie chairman"/&gt;

Toward the end of his life, Cowie suffered from [[heart disease]]. In July 1910, he travelled to [[German Empire|Germany]] to undergo surgery. After his condition worsened, Cowie died on 14 September 1910 in [[Bad Nauheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19100917-1.2.67?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=W.%20C.%20COWIE&amp;QT=w,c,cowie&amp;oref=article|title=THE LATE MR.

'''Workers' compensation''' is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue their employer for the [[tort]] of negligence. The trade-off between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as "the compensation bargain". One of the problems that the compensation bargain solved is the problem of employers becoming insolvent as a result of high damage awards. The system of collective liability was created to prevent that, and thus to ensure security of compensation to the workers. Individual immunity is the necessary corollary to collective liability.

While plans differ among jurisdictions, [[Provision (contracting)|provision]] can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of [[disability insurance]]), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of [[health insurance]]), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment.

General damage for [[pain and suffering]], and [[punitive damages]] for employer [[negligence]], are generally not available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case. These laws were first enacted in Europe and Oceania, with the United States following shortly thereafter.

== Origin and international comparison ==
Laws regarding workers compensation vary by country, but the Workers’ Accident Insurance system put into place by [[Otto von Bismarck]] in 1881 is often cited as a model for Europe and later the United States.&lt;ref name="tradeoff"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insurancejournal.com/blogs/academy-journal/2015/03/19/360273.htm|title=Workers' Compensation History: The Great Tradeoff!|date=2015-03-19|work=Insurance Journal|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statutory no-default compensation ===
Workers' compensation statutes are intended to eliminate the need for litigation and the limitations of common law remedies by having employees give up the potential for pain- and suffering-related awards, in exchange for not being required to prove [[tort]] (legal fault) on the part of their employer. The laws provide employees with monetary awards to cover loss of wages directly related to the accident as well as to compensate for permanent physical impairments and medical expenses.

The laws also provide benefits for dependents of those workers who are killed in work-related accidents or illnesses. Some laws also protect employers and fellow workers by limiting the amount an injured employee can recover from an employer and by eliminating the liability of co-workers in most accidents. US state statutes establish this framework for most employment. US federal statutes are limited to federal employees or to workers employed in some significant aspect of interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/workers_compensation|title=Workers' Compensation|last=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205074742/http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/workers_compensation|archivedate=5 February 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exclusive remedy provision states that workers compensation is the sole remedy available to injured workers, thus preventing employees from also making tort liability claims against their employers.

=== Common law remedies ===
In common law nations, the system was motivated by an "unholy trinity" of tort defenses available to employers, including contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and the fellow servant rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haupt|first=Mary Kati|date=2016|title=Workers' Compensation Law &amp; the Remedial Waiver|url=https://lawpublications.barry.edu/barrylrev/vol21/iss2/4/|journal=Barry Law Review|language=en|volume=21|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law imposes obligations on employers to provide a safe workplace, provide safe tools, give warnings of dangers, provide adequate co-worker assistance (fit, trained, suitable "fellow servants") so that the worker is not overburdened, and promulgate and enforce safe work rules.&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;J. Hood, B. Hardy, and L. Simpson. ''Workers' Compensation and Employee Protection Laws'' (St. Paul: West Academic Publishing, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims under the common law for worker injury are limited by three defenses afforded employers:

* The Fellow Servant Doctrine is that employer can be held harmless to the extent that injury was caused in whole or in part by a peer of the injured worker.
*Contributory negligence allows an employer to be held harmless to the extent that the injured employee failed to use adequate precautions required by ordinary prudence.
*Assumption of risk allows an employer to be held harmless to the extent the injured employee voluntarily accepted the risks associated with the work.&lt;ref name="hood" /&gt;

==By nation==

===Australia===
As Australia experienced a relatively influential [[Australian labour movement|labour movement]] in the late 19th and early 20th century, statutory compensation was implemented very early in Australia. Each territory has its own legislation and its own governing body.

A typical example is  [[WorkSafe Victoria|Work Safe Victoria]], which manages Victoria's workplace safety system. Its responsibilities include helping employees avoid workplace injuries occurring, enforcement of Victoria's occupational and safety laws, provision of reasonably priced workplace injury insurance for employers, assisting injured workers back into the workforce, and managing the workers' compensation scheme by ensuring the prompt delivery of appropriate services and adopting prudent financial practices.&lt;ref&gt;About WorkSafe Victoria – WorkSafe Victoria is the manager of Victoria's workplace safety system.

Broadly, the responsibilities of WorkSafe are the following:
    * help avoid workplace injuries occurring
    * enforce Victoria's occupational health and safety laws
    * provide reasonably priced workplace injury insurance for employers
    * help injured workers back into the workforce
    * manage the workers' compensation scheme by ensuring the prompt delivery of appropriate services and adopting prudent financial practices.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensation law in New South Wales has recently (2013) been overhauled by the state government. In a push to speed up the process of claims and to reduce the amount of claims, a threshold of 11% WPI (whole person impairment) was implemented.

Workers' compensation regulators for each of the states and territories are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcalawyers.com.au/australian-labour-law/ |title=Australian Labour Law |publisher=Henry Carus &amp; Associates |accessdate=8 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028052732/http://www.hcalawyers.com.au/australian-labour-law/ |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
The National Social Insurance Institute (in Portuguese, Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social – INSS) provides insurance for those who contribute. It is a public institution that aims to recognize and grant rights to its policyholders. The amount transferred by the INSS is used to replace the income of the worker taxpayer, when he or she loses the ability to work, due to sickness, disability, age, death, [[involuntary unemployment]], or even pregnancy and imprisonment. During the first 15 days the worker's salary is paid by the employer and after that by the INSS, as long as the inability to work lasts. Although the worker's income is guaranteed by the INSS, the employer is still responsible for any loss of working capacity, temporary or permanent, when found negligent or when its economic activity involves risk of accidents or developing labour related diseases.

===Canada===
Workers' compensation was Canada's first social program to be introduced as it was favoured by both workers' groups and employers hoping to avoid lawsuits. The system arose after an inquiry by Ontario Chief Justice [[William Ralph Meredith|William Meredith]] who outlined a system in which workers were to be compensated for workplace injuries, but must give up their right to sue their employers. It was introduced in the various provinces at different dates. Ontario was first in 1915, Manitoba in 1916, and British Columbia in 1917. It remains a provincial responsibility and thus the rules vary from province to province. In some provinces, such as Ontario's [[Workplace Safety and Insurance Board]], the program also has a preventative role ensuring workplace safety. In British Columbia, the occupational health and safety mandate (including the powers to make regulation, inspect and assess administrative penalties) is legislatively assigned to the Workers' Compensation Board of British Columbia [[WorkSafeBC]]. In most provinces the workers' compensation board or commission remains concerned solely with insurance. The workers' compensation insurance system in every province is funded by employers based on their payroll, industry sector and history of injuries (or lack thereof) in their workplace  (usually referred to as "experience rating").

The law paid indemnity to all private wage earners and apprentices, including those who work in the agricultural and horticultural sectors and marine industries, family helpers and students with work-related injuries, for up to 13 weeks. Workers who are totally disabled get continued benefits at 67 percent after 13 weeks, paid by the accident funds, financed entirely by employers.

The German compensation system has been taken as a model for many nations.

===Malaysia===
The Workmen's Compensation Act 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/natlex4.detail?p_lang=en&amp;p_isn=43905|title=Malaysia - Worker's Compensation Act, 1952 (Act 273).|author=|date=|website=www.ilo.org|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is modelled on the United Kingdom's [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906]]. Adopted before Malaysia's independence from the UK, it is now used only by non-Malaysian workers, since citizens are covered by the national social security scheme.

===Mexico===
{{main|Worker's compensation (Mexico)}}
The Mexican Constitution of 1917 defined the obligation of employers to pay for illnesses or accidents related to the workplace. It also defined social security as the institution to administer the right of workers, but only until 1943 was the Mexican Social Security Institute created ([http://www.imss.gob.mx/ IMSS]). Since then, IMSS manages the Work Risks Insurance in a vertically integrated fashion: registration of workers and firms, collection, classification of risks and events, and medical and rehabilitation services. A reform in 1997 defined that contributions are related to the experience of each employer. Public sector workers are covered by social security agencies with corporate and operative structures similar to those of IMSS.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], all companies that employ staff and in some cases others, must pay a levy to the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]], a [[Crown entity]], which administers New Zealand's universal [[No-fault insurance|no-fault]] accidental injury scheme. The scheme provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who have suffered personal injuries.

===United Kingdom===
Great Britain followed the German model. [[Joseph Chamberlain]], leader of the Liberal Unionist party and coalition with the Conservatives, designed a plan that was enacted under the Salisbury government in 1897. the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1897]] was a key domestic achievement. It served its social purpose at no cost to the government, since compensation was paid for by insurance which employers were required to take out. The system operated from 1897 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Hanes, ''The First British Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; It was expanded to include industrial diseases by the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906]] and replaced by a state compensation scheme under the [[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]]. Since 1976, this state scheme has been set out in the UK's Social Security Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W.J. Bartrip, ''Workmen's Compensation in Twentieth Century Britain: Law, History, and Social Policy'' (Gower, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Work related safety issues in the UK are supervised by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) who provide the framework by which employers and employees are able to comply with statutory rules and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/|title=HSE: Information about health and safety at work|author=|date=|website=www.hse.gov.uk|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318033425/http://www.hse.gov.uk/|archivedate=18 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the following, all employers are obliged to purchase compulsory Employer's Liability Insurance in accordance with the Employer's Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. The current minimum limit of indemnity required is £5,000,000 per occurrence. Market practice is to usually provide a minimum £10,000,000 with inner limits to £5,000,000 for certain risks, e.g. workers on oil rigs and acts of terrorism.

These employers do not require Employer's Liability Insurance:
* local authorities (other than [[Civil parish|parish councils]])
* joint boards or committees whose members include members of local authorities
* police authorities
* nationalised industries or their subsidiaries
* certain bodies which are financed out of public funds
* employers of crews on offshore installations, ships or hovercraft, if they are covered instead with a mutual insurance association of ship owners or ship owners and others
* a health service body or NHS Trust&lt;ref&gt;Industrial engineering projects: practice and procedures for capital, By Joint Development Board (Great Britain), pp. 142–43 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7K8pSs_Y8WAC&amp;lpg=PA142dq=Employers%20who%20do%20not%20require%20Employers%20Liability%20Compulsory%20Insurance%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Employees" are defined as anyone who has entered into or works under a contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer. The contract may be for manual labour, clerical work or otherwise, it may be written or verbal and it may be for full-time or part-time work.

These persons are not classed as employees and, therefore, are exempt:
* persons who are not employees (for example independent contractors who are not the employees of the person engaging them)
* people employed in any activity which is not a business (such as domestic servants)
* people who are related to the employer – husband, wife, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother sister, half-brother or half-sister
* people who are not normally resident in the United Kingdom and who are working there for fewer than 14 consecutive days.

Employees need to establish that their employer has a legal liability to pay compensation. This will principally be a breach of a statutory duty or under the tort of negligence. In the event that the employer is insolvent or no longer in existence, compensation can be sought directly from the insurer under the terms of the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010.

===United States===
{{Main|Workers' compensation (United States)}}
In the United States, some form of workers compensation is typically compulsory in most states (depending upon the features of the organization), with the notable exception of [[Texas]] as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.employers.com/resources/blog/2014/is-workers-compensation-insurance-required-in-all-states|title=Is Workers Compensation Insurance Required in all states|last=|first=|date=|website=www.employers.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124214945/https://www.employers.com/resources/blog/2014/is-workers-compensation-insurance-required-in-all-states|archive-date=2018-11-24|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of compulsory requirements, businesses may purchase insurance voluntarily, and in the United States policies typically include Part One for compulsory coverage and Part Two for non-compulsory coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irmi.com/term/insurance-definitions/workers-compensation-and-employers-liability-policy|title=Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Policy {{!}} Insurance Glossary Definition {{!}} IRMI.com|website=www.irmi.com|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1949, every state had enacted a workers' compensation program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eh.net/encyclopedia/workers-compensation/ eh.net Fishback] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619023347/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/workers-compensation/ |date=19 June 2017 }} Includes extended data tables.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, workers compensation claims are handled by [[Administrative law judge|administrative law judges]], who often act as [[Trier of fact|triers of fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B.|first=Torrey, David|date=2012|title=Master or Chancellor?

Workers compensation statutes which emerged in the early 1900s were struck down as unconstitutional until 1911 when Wisconsin passed a law was not struck down; by 1920, 42 states had passed workers compensation laws.&lt;ref name="tradeoff"/&gt;
