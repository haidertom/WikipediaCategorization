== Early life and education ==
Bakrie attended the [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] where he obtained a degree in electrical engineering in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/directory/whos_whol Who's Who]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Jakarta Post. Accessed 19 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Business career===
In 1972 Bakrie joined PT Bakrie &amp; Brothers Tbk known today as the [[Bakrie Group]], the conglomerate founded by his late father {{Interlanguage link multi|Achmad Bakrie|id}}, which prospered much like the rest of the Indonesian economy during the [[Soeharto]] presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/mud-flung-at-minister-in-wake-of-java-disaster/2006/06/22/1150845316233.html|author=Mark Forbes |title=Mud flung at minister in wake of Java disaster| date=23 June 2006|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bakrie Group conducts business in agriculture, real estate, trade, shipping, banking, insurance, media, manufacturing, construction, and mining.  Aburizal Bakrie, the eldest of four siblings was the chairman of the family enterprise from 1999 to 2004. In 1998 the [[Asian economic crisis]] challenged Bakrie's control of the conglomerate, from which he emerged victorious after a successful refinancing process in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.ibonweb.com/webarticle.asp?num=525 |title=Bakrie's Restructuring of Debts Completed|work=IBonWeb.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518001056/http://articles.ibonweb.com/webarticle.asp?num=525|archivedate=18 May 2006 |date=30 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public offices===
From 1991 to 1995 Bakrie served two consecutive terms as the President of the [[ASEAN]] Business Forum and two consecutive terms from 1994 to 2004 as the President of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (aka [[:id:Kadin|Kadin]]).&lt;ref name="minister"/&gt; As a member of the [[Golkar]] party Bakrie was running to become Golkar's candidate for the presidency in 2004.

====Coordinating Minister for Economy====
In 2004 Bakrie retired from [[:id:Bakrie &amp; Brothers|PT Bakrie &amp; Brothers Tbk]] before being named Coordinating Minister for Economy.&lt;ref name="minister"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacci.org.tw/CACCI%20Profile/2004%20Nov/Bakrie.pdf |title=Mr. Aburizal Bakrie now economic minister of Indonesia |author=CACCI Profile, 2004 |accessdate=15 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227200709/http://www.cacci.org.tw/CACCI%20Profile/2004%20Nov/Bakrie.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment by President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] was initially viewed with some reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3756870.stm |author=BBC News |date=20 October 2004 |title=Indonesian leader sets out goals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being named to the cabinet of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Bakrie set in motion a new government policy calling for a 3% reduction of Indonesians living in poverty, by reducing fuel subsidies in exchange for financial support to approximately 6 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government to Maintain Increased Fuel Prices |url=http://www.tempo.co.id/hg/nasional/2005/03/16/brk,20050316-03,uk.html |accessdate=17 April 2012 |newspaper=- TEMPO Interactive |date=16 March 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324022704/http://www.tempo.co.id/hg/nasional/2005/03/16/brk%2C20050316-03%2Cuk.html |archivedate=24 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakrie argued the government's need to gradually increase fuel prices to keep fuel subsidies from busting its budget, while bringing the cost of fuel closer to international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia Min: New Fuel Prices To Remain Below International Prices|url=http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.cambodia/2005-09/msg00205.html|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Dow Jones|date=29 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2005 and after two price hikes, the cost of fuel increased by 126%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia raises fuel prices by 126%|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/103aebc0-3219-11da-9c7f-00000e2511c8.html|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=1 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] rated the hike as an encouraging move to relieve immediate pressure on the country's fiscal position and external balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia's donors support latest fuel price hike, Bakrie|url=http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2005-10/1964829-indonesia-s-donors-support-latest-fuel-price-hike-bakrie-020.htm|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=AFX News|date=3 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a move to stem Indonesia's declining output of crude oil, Bakrie weighed in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exxon Claims Right To Run Cepu Oil|url=http://www.shana.ir/newsprint.aspx?lang=en&amp;newsid=71985|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Shana News|date=17 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102330/http://www.shana.ir/newsprint.aspx?lang=en&amp;newsid=71985|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to end a standoff between [[ExxonMobil Corporation]] and [[:id:PT Pertamina|PT Pertamina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia: ExxonMobil Cepu oil field to begin full production|url=http://www.energy-pedia.com/news/indonesia/exxonmobil-cepu-oil-field-to-begin-full-production|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=energy-pedia news|date=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies had been at odds for many years, following their dispute over operational and profit sharing issues in the [[:id:Blok Cepu|Cepu Block]] oil fields project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cepu Block|url=http://cepublock.com/about/eng/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501004057/http://cepublock.com/about/eng/|archivedate=1 May 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[OPEC]] member's biggest oil discovery on Java in decades. The previous year Bakrie pledged that the new government wanted to resolve the Cepu and other disputes involving international companies, in a show of its commitment to improving Indonesia's investment climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jakarta plans to resolve dispute over giant oilfield|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ff341a28-36aa-11d9-b856-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1omKwyLiE|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=15 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare====
After a reshuffling of the cabinet in 2005, Bakrie was appointed Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare. In May 2008 Bakrie announced the handout of $1.52 billion to nearly 19 million low income households as part of a direct cash relief program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balidiscovery.com/messages/printmessage.asp?Id=4528|title=Fuel prices to increase after May 23. Date and details of coming fuel hike await president's approval of fuel subsidy program.|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=Bali Post|date=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to cushion the blow of the fuel increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia to cut fuel subsidies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/business/worldbusiness/23iht-23indofuel.13168758.html|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chairman of Golkar party====
In 2009 Bakrie was elected as the Chairman of [[Golkar]] party at Golkar Party Congress in [[Pekanbaru]], [[Riau]], [[Indonesia]] after defeating [[Surya Paloh]], Yuddy Chrisnandi and [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]]. In May 2010, he successfully formed and was elected the leader of a majority parliamentary coalition with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's party.

===Sidoardjo mudflow disaster===
Bakrie's name has been mentioned in reference with the [[Sidoarjo mud flow]] that erupted on 29 May 2006 in [[Sidoarjo]], a regency of Eastern [[Java]], causing significant devastation to the environment and loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catastrophic Mud Eruption Had Natural Causes |author=Charles Choi |url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/mud-eruption-caused-by-earthquake-130722.htm |newspaper=[[Discovery News]] |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are divided over the cause that triggered the mud flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mud Eruption in Indonesia: Was Disaster Blamed On Drilling Activity Actually Caused By Quake? |author=LiveScience |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/mud-eruption-indonesia-disaster-drilling-quake_n_3634361.html |newspaper=[[Huffington Post]] |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One side is claiming it was a natural occurrence caused by a [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake|6.3-magnitude earthquake]] that occurred two days earlier near [[Yogyakarta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study starts debate over Indonesia volcano |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/study-starts-debate-over-indonesia-volcano/story-fn3dxix6-1226683627179 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the other side and government confirmed  the drilling practices of the [[PT Lapindo Brantas]], a company in which Bakrie's family was a controlling shareholder, triggered the mudflow. The media coverage as a result remains mixed.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |title=Indonesia's Teflon tycoon |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15278524 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although environmental groups urged Indonesia's government to revoke the drilling license of PT Lapindo Brantas for environmental mismanagement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shut Lapindo well, arrest management, government told |author=Arie Rukmantara |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/14/shut-lapindo-well-arrest-management-government-told.html |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]] |date=14 June 2006 |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010150605/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/14/shut-lapindo-well-arrest-management-government-told.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a three-year police investigation into the incident ended with the case being dropped. According to the ''[[Jakarta Globe]]'', [[Effendi Simbolon]], a legislator from the [[Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle|Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle PDI-P]] and deputy chairman of House of Representatives Commission VII, which oversees mines and energy affairs, said that "the criticism of Bakrie, whose family controls the company that is widely blamed for the disaster, was unwarranted, politicized and based largely on jealousy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politicians Defend Bakrie, Say Sidoarjo Victims Are Better Off |author=Fidelis E Satriastanti, Ezra Sihite &amp; Markus Junianto Sihaloho |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/nvironment/politicians-defend-bakrie-say-sidoarjo-victims-are-better-off/520981 |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Globe]] |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601232820/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/nvironment/politicians-defend-bakrie-say-sidoarjo-victims-are-better-off/520981 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 report indicated that for nearly seven years the mudflow had been wreaking havoc in the livelihoods of Porong residents in particular and on the Sidoarjo economy as a whole. The mudflow had also buried more than 600 hectares of land, displacing 39,700 people and submerging three subdistricts, 12 villages, 11,241 buildings and 362 hectares of rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mudflow Erupting After Seven Years |author=Hans David Tampubolong |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/05/mudflow-erupting-after-7-years.html |date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential elections 2014===
In the fall of 2010 media coverage started to indicate that Bakrie was seeking to become the [[Golkar Party]]'s presidential candidate in [[Indonesian presidential election, 2014|Indonesia's 2014 Presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/aburizal-in-2014-if-the-polls-are-right/398615 |author=Markus Junianto Sihaloho |title=Aburizal in 2014, if the Polls Are Right |date=29 September 2010 |work=The Jakarta Globe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922151120/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/aburizal-in-2014-if-the-polls-are-right/398615 |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_712180.html|author=AFP |title= Indonesian tycoon Aburizal Bakrie to run for president | date=12 September 2011|work=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Bakrie repeatedly expressed his desire to be nominated as Golkar's presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/politics/im-ready-for-2014-bakrie/499072 |author=JG |title=I'm Ready For 2014 |date=19 February 2012 |work=The Jakarta Globe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221055332/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/politics/im-ready-for-2014-bakrie/499072 |archivedate=21 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media reports also suggested the Golkar Party had already commenced its search for a [[running mate]] to team up with Bakrie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/78744/golkar-seeking-running-mate-for-aburizal-as-presidential-candidate|author=ANTARA |title= Golkar seeking running mate for Aburizal as presidential candidate | date=28 December 2011|work=[[Antara (news agency)|Antara]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing names like [[Hamengkubuwana X|Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwana X]] the current Governor of Yogyakarta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Golkar Party Yogyakarta branches declare Sultan as VP candidate |author=Slamet Susanto |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/24/golkar-party-yogyakarta-branches-declare-sultan-vp-candidate.html |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]] |date=24 June 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627061759/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/24/golkar-party-yogyakarta-branches-declare-sultan-vp-candidate.html |archivedate=27 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:id:Pramono Anung|Pramono Anung]] the Secretary General of the [[Indonesian Democratic Party]] and Deputy House Speaker, [[Dahlan Iskan]] the State Enterprises Minister, as well as [[:id:Edhie Baskoro Yudhoyono|Edhie Baskoro Yudhoyono]] the youngest son of Indonesia's current President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bakrie Considers Unlikely Pairing with SBY's Son |author=Ezra Sihite |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/politics/bakrie-considers-unlikely-pairing-with-sbys-son/525725 |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Globe]] |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625143723/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/politics/bakrie-considers-unlikely-pairing-with-sbys-son/525725 |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
{{Empty section|date=June 2018}}

==  Unsuccessful attempt to lynch Aleksei by Mexicans ==
Aleksei Makeev is known for his disdainful attitude towards other people. He believes that those around him are just looking for ways to “how to piss him off”. In [[Mexico]], however, his suspicions were reinforced by his belonging to [[Russia]]. Thus, his Mexican video blog has acquired a racist character: in most of his videos one can hear discriminatory remarks about the people of Mexico because of his suspicions of discrimination of his personality.

Mexicans didn't accept this attitude to themselves, so they decided to hold a blogger over [[lynching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://360tv.ru/news/tekst/kto-takoj-aleksej-makeev-i-pochemu-meksikancy-zahoteli-ego-ubit-112124/|title=Кто такой Алексей Макеев и почему мексиканцы захотели его убить|last=|first=|date=|work=Телеканал 360°|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.5-tv.ru/news/128947/|title=Скандально известного видеоблогера-дауншифтера Алексея Макеева, возможно, жестоко избили в Мексике|last=|first=|date=|work=Пятый канал|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://russian.rt.com/world/article/391646-kankun-rossiyanin-izbieniye-povedeniye|title=Мексиканская вендетта: в Канкуне россиянина избили из-за неадекватного поведения|last=|first=|date=|work=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=|first=|date=|year=|origyear=|title=Кто такой Алексей Макеев, которого в Мексике побила толпа местных жителей?|url=http://www.aif.ru/dontknows/actual/kto_takoy_aleksey_makeev_kotorogo_v_meksike_pobila_tolpa_mestnyh_zhiteley|format=|journal=Аргументы и факты|type=|series=|language=ru-RU|edition=|location=|publisher=|volume=|issue=|page=|pages=|at=|arxiv=|bibcode=|doi=|isbn=|issn=|pmid=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|quote=|ref=|via=|editor=|agency=|number=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inosmi.ru/social/20170522/239406520.html|title=Мексиканская толпа линчевала русского "нациста" в Канкуне|last=|first=|date=2017-05-22|work=ИноСМИ.ру|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2017-05-21/mat-rossiyskogo-blogera-nacista-izbitogo-do-polusmerti-v-meksike-dur-v-internete|title=Мать российского блогера-нациста, избитого до полусмерти в Мексике: Дурь в интернете - вот и все его преступление|last=|first=|date=2017-05-21|work=РЕН ТВ|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, on '''May 20, 2017''' a large number of people gathered near the house where Alextime rented his apartment. For some time the crowd didn't attempt to break through, confining itself to verbal skirmishes and throwing stones at the windows. The police also came to the scene, but later they left. The point of boiling was the moment when one of the Mexicans climbed onto the [[terrace (building)|terrace]] and tried to provoke the blogger, and he in turn, for self-defense, caused several knife strikes, in connection with which the man died on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2017-05-21/ubiystvo-meksikanca-rossiyskim-blogerom-zapechatleno-na-video-18|title=Убийство мексиканца российским блогером запечатлено на видео (18+)|last=|first=|date=2017-05-21|work=РЕН ТВ|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the crowd burst into Makeev's house and began brutally beating him. Later, the police arrived at the scene, stopping the mob law over Makeev, in connection with which he survived. Aleksei received a [[Traumatic brain injury|craniocerebral injury]] and was paralyzed, the doctors brought him into a state of [[artificial coma]].

After the incident, Makeev was prosecuted for his injuries, which led to the death of a nineteen-year-old Mexican. At the moment, an investigation is underway, Makeev is in the detention center of [[Cancún]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2017/06/03/odinochka/|title=Россиянин Макеев помещен в одиночную камеру в мексиканской тюрьме|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Lenta.ru]]|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2017-05-30/rossiyaninu-makeevu-predyavili-obvinenie-v-ubiystve-v-meksike|title=Россиянину Макееву предъявили обвинение в убийстве в Мексике|last=|first=|date=2017-05-30|work=РЕН ТВ|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11600">'''Bayesian search theory''' is the application of [[Bayesian statistics]] to the search for lost objects. It has been used several times to find lost sea vessels, for example the [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'']]. It also played a key role in the recovery of the flight recorders in the [[Air France Flight 447]] disaster of 2009.  Currently, it is being used to locate the remains of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/find-mh370-next-job-for-theory-used-to-show-existence-of-god|title = How an Eighteenth-Century Statistician Is Helping to Find MH370|last = AngusWhitley1|first = Angus Whitley|website = Bloomberg.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/mh370/12030483/MH370-search-narrowed-to-hot-spot-as-analysis-finds-plane-did-not-conduct-controlled-landing.html|title = MH370 search narrowed to 'hot-spot' as analysis finds plane did not conduct controlled landing|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-02/mh370-hunters-say-new-analysis-reaffirms-most-likely-wreck-site|title = MH370 Hunters Narrow Down Most Likely Site of Wreckage|last = AngusWhitley1|first = Angus Whitley|website = Bloomberg.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The usual procedure is as follows:
# Formulate as many reasonable hypotheses as possible about what may have happened to the object.
# For each hypothesis, construct a [[probability density function]] for the location of the object.
# Construct a function giving the probability of actually finding an object in location&amp;nbsp;X when searching there if it really is in location&amp;nbsp;X. In an ocean search, this is usually a function of water depth — in shallow water chances of finding an object are good if the search is in the right place. In deep water chances are reduced.
# Combine the above information coherently to produce an overall probability density map. (Usually this simply means multiplying the two functions together.) This gives the probability of finding the object by looking in location&amp;nbsp;X, for all possible locations&amp;nbsp;X. (This can be visualized as a [[contour map]] of probability.)
# Construct a search path which starts at the point of highest probability and 'scans' over high probability areas, then intermediate probabilities, and finally low probability areas.
# Revise all the probabilities continuously during the search. For example, if the hypotheses for location&amp;nbsp;X imply the likely disintegration of the object and the search at location&amp;nbsp;X has yielded no fragments, then the probability that the object is somewhere around there is greatly reduced (though not usually to zero) while the probabilities of its being at other locations is correspondingly increased. The revision process is done by applying [[Bayes' theorem]].

In other words, first search where it most probably will be found, then search where finding it is less probable, then search where the probability is even less (but still possible due to limitations on fuel, range, water currents, etc.), until insufficient hope of locating the object at acceptable cost remains.

The advantages of the Bayesian method are that all information available is used coherently (i.e., in a "leak-proof" manner) and the method automatically produces estimates of the cost for a given success probability. That is, even before the start of searching, one can say, hypothetically, "there is a 65% chance of finding it in a 5-day search. That probability will rise to 90% after a 10-day search and 97% after 15&amp;nbsp;days" or a similar statement. Thus the economic viability of the search can be estimated before committing resources to a search.

Apart from the [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'']], other vessels located by Bayesian search theory include the [[MV Derbyshire|MV&amp;nbsp;''Derbyshire'']], the largest British vessel ever lost at sea, and the [[SS Central America|SS&amp;nbsp;''Central America'']]. It also proved successful in the search for a lost [[hydrogen bomb]] following the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]] in Spain, and the recovery in the Atlantic Ocean of the crashed [[Air France Flight 447]].

Bayesian search theory is incorporated into the CASP (Computer Assisted Search Program) mission planning software used by the [[United States Coast Guard]] for [[search and rescue]]. This program was later adapted for inland search by adding terrain and ground cover factors for use by the [[United States Air Force]] and [[Civil Air Patrol]].

==Mathematics==

Suppose a grid square has a probability ''p'' of containing the wreck and that the probability of successfully detecting the wreck if it is there is ''q''. If the square is searched and no wreck is found, then, by Bayes' theorem, the revised probability of the wreck being in the square is given by

: &lt;math&gt;  p' = \frac{p(1-q)}{(1-p)+p(1-q)} = p \frac{1-q}{1-pq} &lt; p.&lt;/math&gt;
For every other grid square, if its prior probability is ''r'', its posterior probability is given by

: &lt;math&gt; r' = r \frac{1}{1- pq} &gt; r. &lt;/math&gt;

===USS ''Scorpion''===

In May 1968, the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[nuclear submarine]] [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'' (SSN-589)]] failed to arrive as expected at her home port of [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. The command officers of the U.S. Navy were nearly convinced that the vessel had been lost off the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]],  but an extensive search there failed to discover the remains of ''Scorpion''.

Then, a Navy deep-water expert, [[John Craven USN|John P. Craven]], suggested that ''Scorpion'' had sunk elsewhere. Craven organised a search southwest of the [[Azores]] based on a controversial approximate triangulation by [[hydrophone]]s. He was allocated only a single ship, [[USNS Mizar (AGOR-11)|''Mizar'']], and he took advice from a firm of consultant mathematicians in order to maximise his resources. A Bayesian search methodology was adopted. Experienced submarine commanders were interviewed to construct hypotheses about what could have caused the loss of ''Scorpion''.

The sea area was divided up into grid squares and a probability assigned to each square, under each of the hypotheses, to give a number of probability grids, one for each hypothesis. These were then added together to produce an overall probability grid. The probability attached to each square was then the probability that the wreck was in that square. A second grid was constructed with probabilities that represented the probability of successfully finding the wreck if that square were to be searched and the wreck were to be actually there. This was a known function of water depth. The result of combining this grid with the previous grid is a grid which gives the probability of finding the wreck in each grid square of the sea if it were to be searched.

At the end of October 1968, the Navy's oceanographic research ship, {{USNS|Mizar|AGOR-11|2}}, located sections of the hull of ''Scorpion'' on the seabed, about {{convert|740|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the [[Azores]],&lt;ref name=pshow&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 "Strange Devices That Found the Sunken Sub Scorpion."] ''Popular Science'', April 1969, pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; under more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} of water. This was after the Navy had released sound tapes from its underwater "[[SOSUS]]" listening system, which contained the sounds of the destruction of ''Scorpion''. The court of inquiry was subsequently reconvened and other vessels, including the [[bathyscaphe]] [[Bathyscaphe Trieste II|''Trieste II'']], were dispatched to the scene, collecting many pictures and other data.

Although Craven received much credit for locating the wreckage of ''Scorpion'', Gordon Hamilton, an acoustics expert who pioneered the use of [[hydroacoustics]] to pinpoint Polaris missile splashdown locations, was instrumental in defining a compact "search box" wherein the wreck was ultimately found. Hamilton had established a listening station in the Canary Islands that obtained a clear signal of what some scientists believe was the noise of the vessel's pressure hull imploding as she passed [[crush depth]]. A [[Naval Research Laboratory]] scientist named Chester "Buck" Buchanan, using a towed camera sled of his own design aboard ''Mizar'', finally located ''Scorpion''.&lt;ref name=pshow/&gt; The towed camera sled, which was fabricated by J. L. "Jac" Hamm of Naval Research Laboratory's Engineering Services Division, is housed in the [[National Museum of the United States Navy]]. Buchanan had located the wrecked hull of [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|''Thresher'']] in 1964 using this technique.

==Optimal distribution of search effort==

The classical book on this subject ''The Theory of Optimal Search'' ([[Operations Research Society of America]], 1975) by [[Lawrence D. Stone]] won the 1975 [[Lanchester Prize]] by the American Operations Research Society.

==Searching in boxes==

Assume that a stationary object is hidden in one of n boxes. For each box &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; there are three known parameters: the cost of a single
search at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;; the probability of finding the object by a single search at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; if it is at this location, &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;; and the probability that the object is at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;. A searcher looks for the object. They know the a priori probabilities at the beginning and update them by Bayes’ law after each (unsuccessful) attempt.
The problem of finding the object in minimal expected cost is a classical problem
solved by [[David Blackwell]]. Surprisingly, the optimal policy is easy to describe: at each stage look into the location which maximizes
&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_i a_i}{c_i}&lt;/math&gt;. This is actually a special case of [[Gittins index]].

'''Canadian [[Security (finance)|securities]] regulation''' is managed through laws and agencies established by Canada's 13 provincial and territorial governments. Each province and territory has a securities commission or equivalent authority and its own piece of provincial or territorial legislation.

Unlike any other major federation, Canada does not have a securities regulatory authority at the federal government level. Provincial governments began to establish regulatory agencies in 1912 (in Manitoba), and the Privy Council decided in Lymburn and Mayland, [1932] A.C. 318 that such legislation is authorized under the provincial property and civil rights power.

Notwithstanding the lack of a federal regulator, the majority of provincial security commissions operate under a [[passport system]], so that the approval of one commission essentially allows for registration in another province.  However, concerns with the system remain. For example, Ontario, Canada's largest capital market, does not participate in the Passport regime.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Securities Commission Notice 11–904&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns with the provincial system of securities regulation has led to repeated calls for a national securities system in Canada.  Currently, the Government of Canada is working towards establishing a national securities regulatory system that it says will provide:
* better and more consistent protection for investors across Canada;
* improved regulatory and criminal enforcement to better fight securities-related crime;
* new tools to better support the stability of the Canadian financial system;
* faster policy responses to emerging market trends;
* simpler processes for businesses, resulting in lower costs for investors; and
* more effective international representation and influence for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Fact Sheet on Proposed Canadian Securities Act, [http://www.fin.gc.ca/n10/data/10-051_2-eng.asp fin.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Structure of the Canadian Securities Regulatory System ==

Each province has its own securities regulator, which is either a self-funded commission or an entity funded within a larger government department. The securities regulator administers the province's securities act and, correspondingly, promulgates its own set of rules and regulations. The securities regulator relies on the work of two national self-regulatory organizations, the IIROC ([[Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada]]) and the MFDA ([[Mutual Fund Dealers Association]]) for most aspects of regulation of the organizations' member firms and their employees. Accountability for securities regulation extends from the securities regulator to the Minister responsible for securities regulation and, ultimately, the legislature, in each province.&lt;ref&gt;Expert Panel Final Report and Recommendations, [http://www.expertpanel.ca/eng/documents/Expert_Panel_Final_Report_And_Recommendations.pdf expertpanel.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest of the provincial regulators is the [[Ontario Securities Commission]]. Other significant provincial regulators are the [[British Columbia Securities Commission]], the [[Alberta Securities Commission]] and the [[Autorité des marchés financiers (Québec)]].

The provincial and territorial regulators work together to coordinate and harmonize regulation of the Canadian capital markets through the [[Canadian Securities Administrators]] (CSA). The major provincial securities regulators also participate in various international co-operative organizations and arrangements.

The CSA has focused its efforts on:
* developing uniform rules and guidelines for securities market participants;
* coordinating approval processes;
* developing national electronic systems through which regulatory filings can be made with and processed by all jurisdictions; and
* coordinating compliance and enforcement activities.

The most important CSA effort is the implementation of the passport system. Under the passport system, a market participant can obtain a decision from its principal regulator and, through a simple filing, have the same decision deemed to be issued under the legislation of all other participating jurisdictions, in essence providing a passport to undertake capital markets activity across Canada. The passport system covers prospectus filings, registration of securities firms and individuals, and certain types of discretionary exemptions. Ontario is recognized by the other jurisdictions as a principal jurisdiction for passport decisions but the Ontario Securities Commission has not adopted the passport rule itself. As a result, Ontario market participants have access to other jurisdictions through the passport system but participants from other jurisdictions do not have access to Ontario. Instead, the Ontario Securities Commission follows a "mutual reliance" policy in which it decides in each case whether to accept the decision of the principal regulator. Ontario says it supports the harmonization and improved coordination of securities regulation in Canada; however, it does not wish to participate in the passport system because it would prefer creation of a national securities regulator.

Public education on financial literacy, investment and financial decision making is a secondary focus of the provincial regulators. The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) set up the non-profit organization Investor Education Fund (IEF) for this sole purpose. Funded by the OSC but acting independently, IEF's primary goal is to provide Canadians with financial tools and information to improve financial literacy.

== Concerns with the Current Structure ==

On February 21, 2008, the Government of Canada appointed an Expert Panel on Securities Regulation to provide advice and recommendations on securities regulation in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada Appoints Expert Panel to Review Securities Regulation, [http://www.fin.gc.ca/n08/08-018-eng.asp fin.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 12, 2009, the Expert Panel on Securities Regulation released its final report, in which they highlighted several concerns with the current structure.&lt;ref&gt;Minister of Finance Welcomes Report on a Single Securities Regulator for Canada, [http://www.fin.gc.ca/n08/09-006-eng.asp fin.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the Panel was concerned that the fragmented structure, requiring decisions to be coordinated across up to 13 jurisdictions, makes it difficult for Canadian securities regulators to react quickly and decisively to capital market events. One illustration of this difficulty was the adoption in September 2008 by some of Canada's international counterparts, including the United States and United Kingdom, of restrictions of short-selling of certain stock as a temporary stability measure. The Canadian response lagged behind the coordinated efforts of the United States and the United Kingdom, and was not uniform across the provinces. A second illustration was the delay between the freezing of the non-bank Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) market in August 2007 and the release of a consultation paper by the Canadian Securities Administrators to seek input on a number of proposals that aim to prevent similar capital market failures in the future.&lt;ref&gt;For information on the non-Bank ABCP crisis in Canada, see Chant, John. "The ABCP Crisis in "The ABCP Crisis in Canada: The Implications for the Regulation of Financial Markets." Expert Panel on Securities Regulation (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;   The Panel found that the fragmented Canadian securities regulatory structure is prone to foster slow securities regulatory responses, which makes Canada vulnerable to market and reputational risks.

Second, the Panel expressed concern that the Canadian system of provincial mandates is incongruent with the national response required to address developments in capital markets that are increasingly national and international in scope. They found that one of the important lessons from the recent capital markets crisis throughout 2008-2009 is that systemic risk is increasingly presenting itself in capital markets rather than being solely confined to banking institutions.  The Panel reported that effectively addressing systemic risk requires the coordination and collaboration of all financial sector regulators in Canada. It also requires working effectively with international counterparts. The Panel did not believe that the multiple provincial and territorial securities regulators are able to work effectively as part of a national systemic risk management team, as structural challenges will likely compromise its ability to be proactive, collaborative, and generally effective in helping to address larger capital market issues on a timely basis. A delayed response, which is poorly managed by any one of the securities regulators, could have a detrimental impact on the integrity of Canada's capital markets as a whole.

Finally, the Panel reported that the current structure fundamentally misallocates resources, causing securities regulation to be less efficient and effective. Resources must be devoted to keep 13 separate securities regulators operating in Canada. This is inefficient since each jurisdiction dedicates a different level of resources to securities regulation, which causes the intensity of policy development, supervision, and enforcement activities to vary across Canada. In addition, most efforts are duplicative, which results in unnecessary costs, overstaffing, and delays. Canadians, in turn, are afforded different levels of investor protection depending on the jurisdiction in which they reside or invest. Second, market participants will continue to be burdened with undue compliance costs, even with the full implementation of the passport system. Market participants will still have to pay fees in up to 13 jurisdictions. They will still have to deal with the general inefficiencies associated with differences between provincial statutes and regulations, the ongoing use of local rules, and variations in the interpretation of national rules.

==Efforts to establish a single Canadian securities regulator==
{{Disputed section|date=January 2011}}
Over the past 45 years, the vast majority of studies by independent expert and academic analysts have come out in favour of establishing a Canadian securities regulator, beginning with the Porter Report in 1964 and the Kimber Report in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, Report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Finance (Ottawa: Queen's Printer, 1964) (Porter Report) and Ontario, Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Securities Legislation in Ontario (Toronto: Queen's Printer, 1965) (Kimber Report).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the most recent decade, the push for a national regulator has been particularly strong, with reports delivered from the Wise Persons Committee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wise-averties.ca/main_en.html Wise-adverties.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; the Crawford Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crawfordpanel.ca/ Crawfordpanel.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Expert Panel on Securities Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expertpanel.ca/eng/index.html Expertpanel.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most recent final report of the Expert Panel, the Panel made a series of recommendations, the most important being the establishment of a Canadian securities regulator to administer a single securities act for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Expert Panel Final Report, [http://www.expertpanel.ca/eng/documents/Expert_Panel_Final_Report_And_Recommendations.pdf expertpanel.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Expert Panel provided a recommended transition path to bring this about, with one key step being the creation of a transition and planning team to oversee the transition to a federal regulatory system.

On June 22, 2009, the Government of Canada acted on this recommendation and announced the launch of the Canadian Securities Transition Office to lead Canada's effort to establish a Canadian securities regulator.&lt;ref&gt;Minister of Finance Announces Launch of Canadian Securities Regulator Transition Office, [http://www.fin.gc.ca/n08/09-064-eng.asp fin.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Transition Office is mandated to lead all aspects of the transition, including the development of the proposed federal securities act and the accompanying regulations, collaborating with provinces and territories, and developing and implementing a transition plan for organizational and administrative matters.&lt;ref&gt;Mandate: Canadian Securities Regulator Transition Office [http://www.fin.gc.ca/n08/data/09-064_1-eng.asp fin.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Doug Hyndman is the Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the Transition Office, and Mr. Bryan Davies is the Vice-Chair.  Mr. Hyndman had been Chair of the British Columbia Securities Commission since 1987.  Mr. Davies has been Chair of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation since 2006 and continues in this part-time role.  Mr. Davies was previously the Chief Executive Officer and Superintendent of the Financial Services Commission of Ontario.

All Canadian jurisdictions have been invited and encouraged to join in the Government of Canada's effort, which will build on the existing infrastructure and expertise of the provincial and territorial securities regulators.  On October 15, 2009, the Government of Canada announced the appointment of an Advisory Committee of ten Participating Provinces and Territories to the Transition Office with representatives from Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.&lt;ref&gt;Minister of Finance Appoints Advisory Committee on Canadian Securities Regulator, [http://www.fin.gc.ca/n08/09-097-eng.asp fin.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Advisory Committee provides advice to the Transition Office on the transition to a Canadian securities regulator to ensure that each of the participating governments' interests are represented in the work of establishing a Canadian securities regulator.

To date, the Transition Office and the Government of Canada have completed two key steps in the transition to a Canadian securities regulator: on May 26, 2010, the Government of Canada tabled for information in the House of Commons the proposed Canadian securities act.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada Moves to Protect Canadian Investors, [http://www.fin.gc.ca/n10/10-051-eng.asp fin.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;   The proposed Act was built on provincial securities regulation and harmonizes existing legislation in the form of a single statute.  It benefits from the work of the Expert Panel on Securities Regulation and other reform efforts, and reflects domestic and international best practices.  It proposes significant improvements in terms of governance, adjudication, financial stability, and regulatory and criminal enforcement, and provides a wide scope of authority to regulate financial instruments and participants in capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;Backgrounder: A New Canadian Securities Regulatory Authority, [http://www.fin.gc.ca/n10/data/10-051_1-eng.asp fin.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2010, the Transition Office delivered its Transition Plan for the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authority to the Minister of Finance and the ministers responsible for securities regulation of the participating provinces and territories.&lt;ref&gt;Transition Plan for the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authority, [http://www.csto-btcvm.ca/en/transition-plan.aspx csto-btcvm.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent with releasing the proposed Canadian Securities Act, the Government of Canada referred the proposed Act to the Supreme Court of Canada for its opinion on the following question: Is the annexed proposed Canadian Securities Act within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada? The Supreme Court heard the reference on April 13 and 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Canada, [http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/case-dossier/cms-sgd/dock-regi-eng.aspx?cas=33718 scc-csc.gc.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614142729/http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/case-dossier/cms-sgd/dock-regi-eng.aspx?cas=33718 |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2011 the Supreme Court returned its decision&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://scc.lexum.org/en/2011/2011scc66/2011scc66.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202075359/http://scc.lexum.org/en/2011/2011scc66/2011scc66.html# |archive-date=2012-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the proposed Canadian Securities Act as drafted would not be valid under the general branch of the federal trade and commerce power under section 91(2) of the constitution. However, the court indicated that some aspects of the act could be valid under that power. It also noted that it had not been asked for its opinion on the extent of Parliament's legislative authority under other heads of federal power, including the interprovincial and international trade branch of section 91(2). The court concluded that a cooperative legislative approach through which the federal and provincial governments exercise their powers collaboratively would be possible.

Following the Supreme Court of Canada decision, the Government of Canada announced that it was exploring with provinces the possibility of working jointly to establish a common securities regulator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22475">'''Channel coordination''' (or '''supply chain coordination''') aims at improving [[supply chain]] performance by aligning the plans and the objectives of individual enterprises. It usually focuses on [[inventory]] management and [[Order (business)|ordering]] decisions in distributed inter-company settings. Channel coordination models may involve multi-echelon inventory theory, multiple decision makers, [[asymmetric information]], as well as recent paradigms of [[manufacturing]], such as [[mass customization]], short product life-cycles, [[outsourcing]] and [[delayed differentiation]]. The theoretical foundations of the coordination are based chiefly on the [[contract theory]]. The problem of channel coordination was first modeled and analyzed by Anantasubramania Kumar in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A.: ''Supply Contracts and Manufacturing Decisions'', Graduate School of Industrial Administration, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The decentralized decision making in supply chains leads to a [[Prisoner's dilemma|dilemma]] situation which results in a suboptimal overall performance called [[double marginalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Tirole, J.: ''The Theory of Industrial Organization''. MIT Press, 1988. ({{ISBN|0-262-20071-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, partners in permanent supply chains tend to extend the coordination of their decisions in order to improve the performance for all of the participants. Some practical realizations of this approach are [[Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment]] (CPFR), [[Vendor Managed Inventory]] (VMI) and [[Quick Response]] (QR).

The theory of channel coordination aims at supporting the performance optimization by developing arrangements for aligning the different objectives of the partners. These are called coordination mechanisms or schemes, which control the flows of '''information''', '''materials''' (or service) and '''financial assets''' along the chains. In general, a contracting scheme should consist of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;Li, X., Wang, Q.: Coordination Mechanisms of Supply Chain Systems. Invited Review. ''European Journal of Operational Research'', 179(1), pp. 1-16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''local planning methods''' which consider the constraints and objectives of the individual partners,
* an '''infrastructure''' and protocol for information sharing, and
* an '''incentive scheme''' for aligning the individual interests of the partners.

The appropriate planning methods are necessary for optimizing the behavior of the production. The second component should support the information visibility and transparency both within and among the partners and facilitates the realization of [[Real Time Enterprise|real-time enterprises]]. Finally, the third component should guarantee that the partners act upon to the common goals of the supply chain.

The general method for studying coordination consists of two steps. At first, one assumes a central decision maker with [[complete information]] who solves the problem. The result is a '''first-best''' solution which provides bound on the obtainable system-wide performance objective. In the second step one regards the decentralized problem and designs such a contract protocol that approaches or even achieves the performance of the first-best.

A [[contract]] is said to '''coordinate the channel''', if thereby the partners' optimal local decisions lead to optimal system-wide performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cachon, G.P.: [http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~cachon/pdf/scontracts2.pdf Supply Chain Coordination with Contracts]. In de Kok, A.G., Graves, S.C. (eds): ''Supply Chain Management: Design, Coordination and Cooperation. Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science'', 11, Elsevier, pp. 229-339, 2003. ({{ISBN|0-444-51328-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; Channel coordination is achievable in several simple models, but it is more difficult (or even impossible) in more realistic cases and in the practice. Therefore, the aim is often only the achievement of '''mutual benefit''' compared to the uncoordinated situation.

Another widely studied alternative direction for channel coordination is the application of some [[electronic negotiation|negotiation]] [[Communications protocol|protocols]].&lt;ref name="Stadtler"&gt;Stadtler, H.: A Framework for Collaborative Planning and State-of-the-Art. ''OR Spectrum'', 31, pp. 5-30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, M.: ''Supply Chain Coordination Mechanisms'' Springer, 2010. ({{ISBN|978-3-642-02832-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Such approaches apply iterative solution methods, where the partners exchange proposals and counter-proposals until an agreement is reached. For this reason, this approach is commonly referred to as '''collaborative planning'''. The negotiation protocols can be characterized according to the following criteria:

* The initial proposal is most frequently generated by the buyer company which is called '''upstream planning'''. By contrast, when the initiator is the supplier, it is referred to as '''downstream planning'''. In several cases there already exists an '''initial plan''' (e.g., using rolling schedules or frame plans). There are also some protocols where the initial plan is generated '''randomly'''.
* In order to guarantee finite runtime, the maximal number of rounds should be determined. In addition, the protocol should also specify the number of plans offered in each round. When the number of rounds or plans is high, the practical application necessitates fast local planner systems in order to quickly evaluate the proposals and generate counter-proposals.
* Generally, the negotiation protocols cannot provide optimality, and they require some special conditions to assure convergence.
* The counter-proposals usually define side-payments (compensations) between the companies in order to inspire the partner deviating from its previously proposed plan.

An also commonly used instrument for aligning plans of different decision makers is the application of some [[auction]] mechanisms. However, “auctions are most applicable in pure market interactions at the boundaries of a supply chain but not within a supply chain″,&lt;ref name="Stadtler"/&gt; therefore they are usually not considered as channel coordination approaches.

== Characteristics of coordination schemes ==

There are several classifications of channel coordination contracts, but they are not complete, and the considered classes are not disjoint.&lt;ref&gt;Tsay, A. A., Nahmias, S., Agrawal, N.: Modeling Supply Chain Contracts: A Review. In: [[Sridhar Tayur|Tayur, S.]], Ganeshan, R., Magazine, M. (eds.): ''Quantitative Models for Supply Chain Management. International Series in Operations Research and Management Science'', 17, Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 299-336, 1999. ({{ISBN|0-792-38344-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a complete classification, a set of aspects are enumerated below which generalizes the existing [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] by allowing classification along multiple viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Stadtler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egri, P.: [http://www.sztaki.hu/~egri/publications/thesis.pdf ''Coordination in production networks'']. PhD Thesis, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem characteristics===

====Horizon====
Most of the related models consider either '''one-period''' horizon or '''two-period horizon with forecast update'''.&lt;ref&gt;Sethi, S.P., Yan, H., Zhang, H.: ''Inventory and Supply Chain Management With Forecast Updates''. Springer, 2005. ({{ISBN|1-402-08123-5}} )&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, the production can be based on the preliminary [[forecasting|forecast]] with normal production mode or on the updated forecast with emergency production, which means shorter [[lead-time]], but higher cost. Besides, the horizon can consist of '''multiple periods''' and it can be even '''infinite'''. The practically most widespread approach is the '''rolling horizon planning''', i.e., updating and extending an existing plan in each period.

====Number of products====
Almost all contract-based models regard only one [[Product (business)|product]]. Some models study the special cases of [[substitute good|substitute]] or [[complementary good|complementary]] products. However, considering more products in the general case is necessary if technological or financial constraints—like capacity or budget limits—exist.

====Demand characteristic====
On one hand, the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] can be [[stochastic]] (uncertain) or deterministic. On the other hand, it can be considered static (constant over time) or dynamic (e.g., having [[seasonality]]).

====Risk treatment====
In most of the models the players are regarded to be [[risk neutral]]. This means that they intend to maximize their [[Expected value|expected]] profit (or minimize their expected costs). However, some studies regard [[risk averse]] players who want to find an acceptable [[trade-off]] considering both the expected value and the [[variance]] of the profit.

====Shortage treatment====
The models differ in their attitude towards [[stockouts]]. Most authors consider either backlogs, when the demand must be fulfilled later at the expense of providing lower price or [[lost sales]] which also includes some theoretical costs (e.g., loss of goodwill, loss of profit, etc.). Some models include a [[service level]] constraint, which limits the occurrence or quantity of expected stockouts. Even the 100% service level can be achieved with additional or emergency production (e.g., overtime, outsourcing) for higher costs.

====Parameters and variables====
This viewpoint shows the largest variations in the different models. The main decision variables are quantity-related (production quantity, order quantity, number of options, etc.), but sometimes prices are also decision variables. The parameters can be either constant or stochastic. The most common parameters are related to costs: fixed (ordering or [[changeover|setup]]) cost, production cost and inventory holding cost. These are optional; many models disregard fixed or inventory holding costs. There exist numerous other parameters: prices for the different contracts, [[salvage value]], shortage penalty, lead-time, etc.

====Basic model and solution technique====
Most of the one-period models apply the [[newsvendor]] model. On two-period horizon, this is extended with the possibility of two production modes. On a multiple period horizon the [[base-stock]], or in case of deterministic demand the [[Economic order quantity|EOQ]] models are the most widespread. In such cases the optimal solution can be determined with simple algebraic operations. These simple models usually completely disregard technological constraints; however, in real industrial cases resource capacity, inventory or budget constraints may be relevant. This necessitates more complex models, such as [[Linear programming|LP]], [[Mixed integer programming|MIP]], [[Stochastic programming|stochastic program]], and thus more powerful [[mathematical programming]] techniques may be required.

As for the optimization criteria, the most usual objectives are the '''[[profit maximization]]''' or '''cost minimization''', but other alternatives are also conceivable, e.g., throughput time minimization. Considering [[Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis|multiple criteria]] is not yet prevalent in the coordination literature.

===Decentralization characteristics===

====Number and role of the players====
The most often studied dilemmas involve the two players and call them '''customer''' and '''supplier''' (or buyer-seller). There are also extensions of this simple model: the multiple customers with [[correlated]] demand and the multiple suppliers with different production parameters. Multi-echelon extensions are also conceivable, however, sparse in the literature. When the coordination is within a supply chain (typically a customer-supplier relation), it is called '''vertical''', otherwise '''horizontal'''. An example for the latter is when different suppliers of the same customer coordinate their [[transportation]].

Sometimes the roles of the participants are also important. The most frequently considered companies are [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], [[retailers]], [[Distribution (business)|distributors]] or [[logistics|logistic]] companies.

====Relation of the players====
One of the most important characteristics of the coordination is the [[Economic power|power]] relations of the players. The power is influenced by several factors, such as possessed process [[know-how]], number of [[competitors]], ratio in the [[Economic Value Creation|value creation]], access to the market and financial resources.

The players can behave in a cooperative or [[Opportunism|opportunistic]] way. In the former case, they share a common goal and act like a team, while in the latter situation each player is interested only in its own goals. These two behaviors are usually present in a mixed form, since the opportunistic claims for profitability and growth are sustainable usually only with a certain cooperative attitude.

The relation can be temporary or permanent. In the temporary case usually one- or two-period models are applied, or even an auction mechanism. However, the coordination is even more important in permanent relations, where the planning is usually done in a rolling horizon manner. When coordinating a permanent supply relation, one has to consider the '''learning effect''', i.e., players intend to learn each other's private information and behavior.

====Goal of the coordination====
The simplest possible coordination is aimed only at aligning the (material) flows within the supply chain in order to gain executable plans and avoid shortages. In a more advanced form of coordination, the partners intend to improve supply chain performance by approaching or even achieving the optimal plan according to some criteria. Generally, a coordinated plan may incur losses for some of the players compared to the uncoordinated situation, which necessitates some kind of side-payment in order to provide a [[win-win game|win-win]] situation. In addition, even some sort of [[Fair division|fairness]] may be required, but it is not only hard to guarantee, but even to define.

Most of the coordination approaches requires that the goal should be achieved in an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] in order to exclude the possibility that an opportunistic player deviates from the coordinated plan.

====Information structure====
Some papers study the symmetric information case, when all of the players know exactly the same parameters. This approach is very convenient for [[profit sharing|cost and profit sharing]], since all players know the incurring system cost. The asymmetric case, when there is an information gap between the players is more realistic, but poses new challenges. The asymmetry typically concerns either the cost parameters, the capacities or the quantities like the demand forecast. The demand and the forecast are often considered to be [[Qualitative data|qualitative]], limited to only two possible values: high and low. In case of stochastic demand, the uncertainty of the forecasts can also be private information.

====Decision structure====
The [[decision making]] roles of the players depend on the specified decision variables. However, there is a more-or-less general classification in this aspect: '''forced''' and '''voluntary compliance'''. Under forced compliance the supplier is responsible for satisfying all orders of the customer, therefore it does not have the opportunity to decide about the production quantity. Under voluntary compliance, the supplier decides about the production quantity and it cannot be forced to fill an order. This latter is more complex analytically, but more realistic as well. Even so, several papers assume that the supplier decides about the price and then the customer decides the order quantity.

====Game theoretic model====
From the viewpoint of [[game theory]] the models can take [[cooperative game|cooperative]] or [[non-cooperative game|non-cooperative]] approaches. The cooperative approach studies, how the players form [[coalitions]] therefore these models are usually applied on the strategic level of network design. Other typical form of cooperative games involves some [[bargaining]] framework—e.g., the [[Nash bargaining game|Nash bargaining]] model—for agreeing upon the parameters of the applied contracts.

On the other hand, on the operational level, the non-cooperative approach is used. Usually the sequential [[Stackelberg game]] model is considered, where one of the players, the '''leader''' moves first and then the '''follower''' reacts. Both cases—the supplier or the customer as the Stackelberg leader—are widely studied in the literature. In case of [[information asymmetry]], a similar sequential model is used and it is called [[Principal–agent problem|principal–agent]] setting. The study of the long-term supply relationship can also be modeled as a [[repeated game]].

To sum up, a collaboration generally consists of a cooperative, followed by a non-cooperative game. However, most researches concentrate only on one of the phases.

====Involvement of a mediator====
Some coordination mechanisms require the existence of an independent, trusted third party. If such a mediator exists, the powerful theory of the market [[mechanism design]] can be applied for channel coordination. Although at first glance the involvement of a third party seems to be unrealistic, in the area of planning such mediators already exist as [[application service provider]]s.

== Contract types ==

There are many variants of the contracts, some widespread forms are
briefly described below. Besides, there exist several combinations
and customized approaches, too.

===Two-part tariff===
{{Main article|Two-part tariff}}
In this case the customer
pays not only for the purchased goods, but in addition a
fixed amount called [[franchise fee]] per order. This
is intended to compensate the supplier for his fixed setup
cost.

===Sales rebate===
This contract specifies two prices
and a quantity threshold. If the order size is below
the threshold, the customer pays the higher price, and
if it is above, she pays a lower price for the
units above the threshold.

===Quantity discount===
{{Main article|Discounts and allowances}}
Under quantity discount contract, the customer pays a wholesale price depending on the order quantity. This resembles to the sales rebate contract, but there is no threshold defined. The mechanism for specifying the contract can be complex.&lt;ref name=quantidisc-t&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Altintas | first1 = N. | last2 = Erhun | first2 = F. | last3 = Tayur | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1287/mnsc.1070.0829 | title = Quantity Discounts Under Demand Uncertainty | journal = Management Science | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 777–792| year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract has been applied in many situations, for example, in an international supply chain with fluctuating exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;Scheller-Wolf, A., Tayur, S.: Reducing international risk through quantity contracts. Carnegie Mellon University Graduate School of Industrial Administration Working Paper, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacity options===
While advance capacity purchase is popular in the supply chain practice, there are situations where a manufacturer prefers to delay its capacity purchase to have better information about the uncertain demand.&lt;ref name=capop&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erhun | first1 = F. | last2 = Keskinocak | first2 = P. | last3 = Tayur | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1080/07408170701744827 | title = Dynamic procurement in a capacitated supply chain facing uncertain demand | journal = IIE Transactions | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 733–748| year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buyback/return===
With these types of contracts the
supplier offers that it will buy back the remaining
[[obsolete]] inventory at a [[discounted]] price. This
supports the sharing of inventory risk between the
partners. A variation of this contract is the
'''backup agreement''', where the customer gives a
preliminary forecast and then makes an order less or
equal to the forecasted quantity. If the order is
less, it must also pay a proportional penalty for the
remaining obsolete inventory. Buyback agreements are
widespread in the newspaper, book, CD and fashion
industries.

===Quantity flexibility===
In this case the customer
gives a preliminary forecast and then it can give fixed
order in an interval around the forecast. Such contracts
are widespread in several markets, e.g., among the
suppliers of the European [[automotive industry]].

===Revenue sharing===
{{Main article|Revenue sharing}}
With revenue sharing the customer
pays not only for the purchased goods, but also shares a
given percentage of her [[revenue]] with the supplier. This
contract is successfully used in video cassette rental
and movie exhibition fields. It can be proved, that the
optimal revenue sharing and buyback contracts are
equivalent, i.e., they generate the same profits for the
partners.

===Options===
The [[Option (finance)|option]] contracts are originated from
the product and [[stock exchange]]. With an option contract,
the customer can give fixed orders in advance, as well
as buy rights to purchase more ([[call option]]) or return
([[put option]]) products later. The options can be bought at a
predefined '''option price''' and executed at the
'''execution price'''. This approach is a
generalization of some previous contract types.

===VMI contract===
This contract can be used when the buyer does not order, only communicates the forecasts and consumes from the inventory filled by the supplier. The VMI contract specifies that not only the consumed goods should be paid, but also the forecast imprecision, i.e., the difference between the estimated and realized demand. In this way, the buyer is inspired to increase the forecast quality, and the risk of market uncertainty is shared between the partners.

'''Christiana Carteaux Bannister''' (1819–1902) was a business entrepreneur, hairdresser, and abolitionist in New England. She was known professionally as '''Madame Carteaux'''.

== Biography ==
Christiana Carteaux Bannister was born '''Christiana Babcock''' in 1819 in [[North Kingstown, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="Rise &amp; Grind"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christiana Carteaux Bannister|url=http://www.riseandgrind.com/2011/03/10/christiana-carteaux-bannister/|work=Rise &amp; Grind|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was born to [[African American]] and [[Narragansett Indian]] parents. She was a descendant of [[slavery|enslaved]] Africans who worked the plantations of [[South County, Rhode Island]], during the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="RI HHofF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christiana Carteaux Bannister|url=http://www.riheritagehalloffame.org/inductees_detail.cfm?iid=466|publisher=Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young woman, she moved to [[Boston]] where she worked as a wigmaker and [[hairdresser]].&lt;ref name="RI HHofF" /&gt;

== Marriage ==
Her first marriage was to Desiline Carteaux, a clothes dealer. Her marriage to Carteaux, believed to be of Caribbean origin, did not last.&lt;ref name="RI HHofF" /&gt;

In 1853 Christiana and [[Edward Mitchell Bannister]] met when he applied for work as a barber in her Boston salon.&lt;ref name="Rise &amp; Grind" /&gt; Her second marriage was to Bannister on June 10, 1857, who became one of the most successful Black artists because of Christiana Carteaux Bannister's financial and emotional support. Edward contributed much of his success to Christiana for her critical eye and her business sense.&lt;ref name="Rise &amp; Grind" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RI HHofF" /&gt; In 1869 the Bannisters moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and Christiana continued her business as a hairdresser as well as her activism.&lt;ref name="RI HHofF" /&gt;

== Hairdressing business ==
As a young woman, Christiana moved from Rhode Island to Boston where she began her career as a wigmaker. She was professionally known as Madame Carteaux, Women's Hairdresser and Wigmaker.&lt;ref name="Jacobs p. 162"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Donald M.|title=Courage and Conscience: Black &amp; White Abolitionists in Boston|year=1993|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a successful business entrepreneur, and self-styled "hair doctress," generating income by hairdressing and selling her own hair products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Henry Louis|title=African American Lives|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1847 to 1871 Christiana Carteaux Bannister maintained several salons in Boston including Cambridge, Boston, and Winter Streets.&lt;ref name="Jacobs p. 162" /&gt; When Christiana Carteaux Bannister and Edward Bannister moved to Providence, she opened another salon in Providence.

== Abolitionists ==

In Boston, the Bannisters lived and worked with [[Lewis Hayden]] and participated in the Boston [[Underground Railroad]]. The Bannister hair salons became popular meeting places for African American and white [[abolitionists]].&lt;ref name="Rise &amp; Grind" /&gt;

== Other activism ==
During the Civil War, Christiana Carteaux Bannister was an advocate for equal pay for Black soldiers. In November 1864, she organized a fair sponsored by the Boston Colored Ladies Sanitary Commission to benefit the African American regiments, the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th]] and [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Massachusetts]] and the 5th Massachusetts Cavalry, who served for a year and a half without pay rather than accept less than the white soldiers were paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blatt|first=Martin H|title=Hope &amp; Glory: Essays on the Legacy of the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Regiment|year=2001|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Providence, she founded the Home for Aged Colored Women when she learned about the struggles of African American women who worked as domestics but were too old to work and often became homeless.&lt;ref name="Rise &amp; Grind" /&gt; The home moved from Transit St. to Dodge St. and was renamed Bannister House, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bannister House|url=http://www.bannisterhouse.org/history.htm|work=Bannister House, Inc.|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
In 1901, Edward suffered a [[heart attack]] while and church and died.&lt;ref name="Rise &amp; Grind" /&gt; Bannister died in 1902 and is buried in Edward Bannister's plot in the [[North Burial Ground]].&lt;ref name="RI HHofF" /&gt; A bronze bust of Bannister, based on a portrait of her painted by Edward Bannister, was dedicated at the Rhode Island State House in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christiana Carteaux Bannister|url=http://www.pabloeduardosculpture.com/christiana-carteaux-bannister/|work=Pablo Eduardo|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Instigator and promoter of the scientific section of the Festival dei Due Mondi (Festival of the Two Worlds) in Spoleto, SpoletoScienza, organized by the [[Fondazione Sigma-Tau]], which quickly established itself as one of the most important events dedicated to matters of science and epistemology of our times.
After having graduated with a degree in pharmaceutical chemistry and studied for some time under Professor Noris Siliprandi, Professor of [[Biochemistry]] at the University of [[Padua]], Cavazza soon made the decision to dedicate himself to entrepreneurial activities.
His entrepreneurial breakthrough into the pharmaceutical sector happened in the mid 1960s, thanks to the launch of [[Rekord B12]], which soon became one of the highest selling medicines in [[Italy]] and elsewhere. Its success originated from the discovery that [[vitamin B12]] develops an antiasthenic and antidepressant effect at high doses.
The medicine was also distinctively packaged in a particularly innovatively designed tube, which was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in [[New York City]].
An equally fundamental step in the history of [[Sigma-Tau]] group was the decision – resulting from the passion and determination of Claudio Cavazza – to dedicate significant resources to scientific research into the study of [[carnitine]], an endogenous substance of natural origin that is without side effects, which intervenes in the processes that allow cells to produce their own energy sources. The study of [[carnitine]] produced preparations of proven efficiency, able to correct [[metabolic defects]], whether congenital or acquired, in different clinical situations.
Over the years, [[Sigma-Tau]] group has broadened its presence in the international scene with branches not only in the major European countries of [[France]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]], but also in [[India]], and with two production plants in the [[United States]] and [[Spain]]. [[Sigma-Tau]] group has around 2,500 employees, 400 of whom are researchers involved in the most advanced sectors of national and worldwide research in which it reinvests 16% of its turnover.

== Roles ==
Claudio Cavazza was Chairman of Italian pharmaceutical industry association, [[Farmindustria]], from 1986 to 1992.
He was a member of the presiding committee of the Italian employers’ federation, [[Confindustria]], subsequently invited to join [[Confindustria]]’s technical education committee and the steering committee formed by the [[Confindustria]] Health Commission. In January 2008, Cavazza was made manager of the industrial innovation project “Nuove Tecnologie della Vita” (New life science technologies) within the Italian [[Ministry of Economic Development (Italy)|Ministry of Economic Development]]. He was a member of the board of [[EFPIA]] (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations), of which he was Vice President from 1992 to 1994. He was also member of the Council of [[IFPMA]] (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association).

== Recognition ==
Cavazza was appointed to the order of Knight of Labour in 1987. In 2005, the University of Genoa awarded him an [[honorary degree]] in [[Medicine]]. He was awarded an [[honorary degree]] in [[International Business Strategies]] from LUSTICO, the Free International University for International Studies of Ostia. In recognition of his commitment to research and development activities for rare diseases in the [[United States]], in 1995 the county of [[Maryland]] established the Claudio Cavazza Science Award. In June 2005 he was awarded the Pharma-Finance award for biotechnologies, and in December 2009 was given the title of meritorious member of the non-profit [[Italian association for fragile X syndrome (Associazione Italiana Sindrome X Fragile Onlus)]] for the commitment he has shown towards those affected by the syndrome.

== Commitment to culture ==
In 1986 Claudio Cavazza instigated the creation of the [[Fondazione Sigma-Tau]], intended to introduce the concepts of entirety and complexity of the humanities into entrepreneurial planning and medicine, in order to promote academic and cultural debate and encourage scientific progress.
Cavazza founded the [[Sigma-Tau]] publishing house in 1988, producing the scientific magazine ''Sfera'', an editorial project of 43 parts published between 1988 and 1995. Through its innovation it gained two awards, the Galileo in Italy in 1989, and the Prix Caméra in Paris in 1991.

== Involvement in activities in the public interest ==
Cavazza took part in numerous [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]] (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche – Italian National Research Council) consulting committees:
*National Committee for Chemical Sciences
*Scientific committee for the Preventive and Rehabilitative Medicine Project
*Scientific committee for the project on ageing
*Commission of the Target Project Biotechnology and Bioinstrumentation.
For the Italian [[Ministry of Research]] he has also participated in:
*National Drug Committee
*National Committee for Biology

He was Vice President of the committee of [[Aspen Institute Italia]], an institute that promotes collaboration and research at international level on the policies of development in large global areas.

==Overview==

=== Origin ===
Coakes and Smith (2007) define '''Communities of Innovation''' ('''CoI''') as a form of [[Communities of Practice]] that are dedicated to the support of [[innovation]]. They suggest that CoI can be formed from champions of innovation and their [[social network]] and that CoI are safe places for the creation and support of innovatory ideas.&lt;ref name="Coakes and Smith (2007)"/&gt; COI  are groups made up of motivated individuals working together towards a common goal, not because of orders from their superiors, but because they are convinced of their common cause.&lt;ref name="Grimaldi and Rogo (2009)"/&gt;

=== Development ===

==== Communities of Creation ====
Sawhney and Prandelli (2000) proposed the model of Communities of Creation as a new governance mechanism for managing knowledge found in different companies for the purpose of innovation. Intellectual property rights are considered to be owned by the entire community although the community is governed by a central firm which acts as the sponsor and defines the ground rules for participation. This model lies between the closed hierarchical model and the open market-based model.&lt;ref name="Sawhney and Prandelli (2000)"/&gt;

== Communities of Innovation compared to Communities of Practice ==
These are Communities that take total financial, administrative and operational control over the development of their communities. Democratically elected and answerable to the whole community. It is simply an extension of the community saving societies that have  existed for centuries. The prime objective is sustainable environmental and social development controlled by the skills and finance available. It provides employment, improves the future prospects for all participants and their children, and injects a sense of pride and achievement. Using locally available materials linked to new environmentally friendly cost effective construction materials will produce affordable housing, schools and roads.

== Examples of Communities of Innovation ==

=== The COI that developed Linux ===
Traditionally, the company is the most efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is job security, career advancement and recognition. Lee and Cole (2003) argue for a [[community structure]] for knowledge creation that crosses firms’ boundaries.&lt;ref name="Lee and Cole (2003)"&gt;Lee, G. K. and R. E. Cole. 2003. From a firm-based to a community-based model of knowledge creation: The case of the Linux Kernel development. Organization Science 14 (6) 633-649.&lt;/ref&gt; To substantiate their argument they put forth the case of how “thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the [[Internet]] to produce a knowledge-intensive, [[innovative]] product of high [[Quality (business)|quality]],” the [[Linux]] kernel (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;633). The Linux community has proved to be a very efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is value system, recognition and potential career advancement or hop. Lee and Cole (2003) argue that research on [[knowledge management]] has to date focused on [[hierarchy]] and therefore has not adequately addressed the mobilization of [[distributed knowledge]], knowledge that is dispersed among many people. They note that, as illustrated by the [[Linux]] case, “the advent of the Internet and [[Web-based technologies]] has enabled specialized communities to convene, interact, and share [[resources]] extensively via electronic interfaces,” even across firms’ boundaries (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;633). People are able to contribute effectively outside their working hours. [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] of the work (including [[feedback]]) is possible even when people are working from different locations. The [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] is therefore much larger and the [[critical mass]] of software engineers required to develop and maintain the Linux project was therefore achievable.

== Benefits of Community of Innovation ==

=== Organizational Ambidexterity ===

Successful COIs increase innovations within an organization. They therefore have the potential to contribute to [[organizational ambidexterity]], which refers to the organization’s dual capabilities of managing current business and being flexible and adaptable to meet future changes and demands.&lt;ref name="Raisch &amp; Birkinshaw (2008)"&gt;Raisch, S. and J. Birkinshaw. 2008. Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators. Journal of Management 34 (3) 375-409&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siedlung eisenheim.jpg|thumb|280px|The town of Siedlung Eisenheim in [[Oberhausen]], Germany]] 
A '''company town''' is a place where practically all stores and housing are owned by the one company that is also the main employer. Company towns are often planned with a suite of amenities such as stores, churches, schools, markets and recreation facilities. They are usually bigger than a [[model village]] ("model" in the sense of an ideal to be emulated).

The best examples of company towns have had high ideals; but many have been regarded as controlling or exploitative.  Others developed more or less in unplanned fashion, such as [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], United States, one of the oldest, which began as a [[LC&amp;N Co.]] mining camp and mine site nine miles (14.5 km) from the nearest outside road.

==Overview==

Traditional settings for company towns were where [[Resource extraction|extractive industries]] — [[History of coal miners|coal]], metal mines, [[lumberjacks|lumber]] — had established a monopoly franchise. [[Dam]] sites and war-industry camps founded other company towns. Since company stores often had a monopoly in company towns, it was possible to pay in [[scrip]] through a [[truck system]]. In the Soviet Union there were several cities of nuclear scientists (''atomics'') known as [[atomgrad]]; particularly in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] those were [[Pripyat]], [[Varash]], [[Yuzhnoukrainsk]] among others.

Typically, a company town is isolated from neighbors and centered on a large production factory, such as a lumber or steel mill or an automobile plant; and the citizens of the town either work in the factory, work in one of the smaller businesses, or is a family member of someone who does. The company may also donate a church building to a local congregation, operate parks, host cultural events such as concerts, and so on. If the owning company cuts back or goes out of business, the [[economics|economic]] effect on the company town is devastating, as people move to jobs elsewhere.

Company towns often become regular public cities and towns as they grow and attract other settlement, business enterprises, and public transportation and services infrastructure. Other times, a town may not officially be a company town, but it may be a town where the majority of citizens are employed by a single company, thus creating a similar situation to a company town (especially in regard to the town's economy). Further, such dependencies extend to neighborhoods and [[urban area|regions of larger cities]]. In each case, if the primary company falls on lean times, fails outright or the industry fades in importance (as with steam locomotive support rail yards and [[anthracite]] mining industries which depended on [[steam locomotive]]s spurring demands) the communities contract and lose [[property value]] and then [[declining population|population]] as people move to find work elsewhere, and the youth of the community bears the children of their generation in another demographic region.

==History==

===Paternalism===
[[File:Bayreuthburg01.JPG|thumb|280px|Company town ''[[Burg (Bayreuth)|Burg]]'' in [[Bayreuth]], Germany]]
{{main article|Welfare capitalism}}
[[Paternalism]], a subtle form of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], refers to the control of workers by their employers who sought to force middle-class ideals upon their working-class employees. Paternalism was considered by many nineteenth-century businessmen as a moral responsibility, or often a religious obligation, which would advance society whilst furthering their own business interests. Accordingly, the company town offered a unique opportunity to achieve such ends.

Although many prominent examples of company towns portray their founders as "capitalists with a conscience", for example, [[George Cadbury]]'s [[Bournville]], if viewed cynically, the company town was often an economically viable ploy to attract and retain workers. Additionally, for-profit shops within company towns were usually owned by the company, which were unavoidable to its isolated workers, thus resulting in a monopoly for the owners.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;Crawford&lt;/ref&gt;

Although economically successful, company towns sometimes failed politically due to a lack of elected officials and municipally owned services.&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;Garner, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, workers often had no say in local affairs and therefore, felt dictated to. Ultimately, this political climate caused resentment amongst workers and resulted in many residents eventually losing long-term affection for their towns; such was the case at Pullman.

===Pullman lesson===
Although many small company towns existed in mining areas of [[Pennsylvania]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], one of the largest, and most substantial early company towns in the United States was [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]], developed in the 1880s just outside the [[Chicago]] city limits. The town, entirely company-owned, provided housing, markets, a library, churches and entertainment for the 6,000 company employees and an equal number of dependents. Employees were required to live in Pullman, although cheaper rentals could be found in nearby communities.

The town operated successfully until the economic [[panic of 1893]], when demand for the company's products declined, and employee wages had to be lowered accordingly. Despite this, the company refused to lower rents in the town or the price of goods at its shops, thus resulting in the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894. A national commission formed to investigate the causes of the strikes found that Pullman's paternalism was partly to blame and labelled it "un-American".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Buder, ''Pullman: An Experiment in Industrial Order and Community Planning, 1880–1930''&lt;/ref&gt; The report condemned Pullman for refusing to negotiate and for the economic hardships he created for workers in the town of Pullman. "The aesthetic features are admired by visitors, but have little money value to employees, especially when they lack bread." The State of Illinois filed suit, and in 1898 the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] forced the Pullman Company to divest ownership in the town, which was annexed to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/p_pullman.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arthur Melville Pearson |date=January–February 2009|title=Utopia Derailed|journal=Archaeology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=46–49|issn=0003-8113 |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0901/abstracts/pullman.html|accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, government observers maintained that Pullman's principles were accurate, in that he provided his employees with a [[quality of life]] otherwise unattainable to them, but recognised that his excessive paternalism was inappropriate for a large-scale corporate economy and thus caused the town's downfall. Accordingly, government observers and social reformers alike saw the need for a balance between control and well-designed towns, concluding that a model company town would only succeed if independent professionals, acting as a buffer between employers and employees, took a role in conception, planning, and management of these towns.&lt;ref&gt;Fogelsong, R. 1986. ‘Planning the Capitalist City’. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691077053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Linda Carlson argues that the managers of corporate towns in the early 20th century believed they could avoid the mistakes made by George Pullman in the 1880s. She says they:
:wanted to create a better life for their employees: decent housing, good schools, and a "morally uplifting" society.  In return, they expected stable, hard-working employees who would eschew the evils of drink and, most important, not fall prey to the blandishments of union organizers.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Carlson, ''Company towns of the Pacific Northwest'' (U. of Washington Press, 2014)  p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Pullman Strike did not kill the concept of a company town but rather initiated a new chapter in their existence. Over the next thirty years, the old model of paternalism was abandoned in favour of new professionally designed company towns with architects, landscape architects, and planners translating "new concepts of industrial relations and social welfare into new physical forms". This suited capitalists of the day who were obviously keen to avoid the experiences of Pullman. The first real example of this occurred at [[Indian Hill-North Village, Massachusetts]], in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of American company towns===

By the 1920s, the need for company towns had declined significantly due to increased national affluence. Despite income inequalities and a relatively low standard of living conditions amongst factory laborers, the prosperity of the 1920s saw workers’ material well-being improve significantly. A strong post-war American economy meant installment buying was accessible to low-wage earners who could now purchase previously unattainable goods like automobiles and radios. Moreover, workers were no longer dependent on employers for healthcare and education.

By the 1920s the widespread nature of the automobile meant workers no longer needed to live near their work places and now had access to more employment opportunities. A combination of the freedom that came with private transport and the mass communication of radio saw the isolation of company towns lessen and the social basis of the company town become less necessary.

Furthermore, the accessibility of the working class to private transport also marked a step of equality as they had previously only been accessible to the wealthy. As access to surrounding municipalities increased, residents of company towns gained access to an increasing amount of government-funded public resources such as schools, libraries, and parks. Accordingly, there was no longer a need for the amenities of company towns which, prior to [[welfare capitalism]], had previously been unattainable to the working class.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt;

This new found freedom saw a change in the mindset of workers who began to look on welfare capitalism as demeaning rather than an incentive. Accordingly, many employees began to request additional pay in lieu of welfare programs. This was well received by some employers as the idea of ‘laissez-faire’ individualism, which promoted entrepreneurial virtues of hard-work being rewarded rather than direct charity, began to shape new-age paternalism.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt;

Modernization and the increase in material well-being had also lessened the perceived need for paternalism and moral reform. Consequently, the economic downturn of the early 1930s saw some businesses do away with employee welfare schemes to reduce costs. However, the Roosevelt Administration’s [[New Deal]] dealt the final blow to end American company towns by raising minimum wages, encouraging industrial self-governance, and pushing for the owners of company towns to “consider the question of plans for eventual employee ownership of homes”.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; To a lesser extent the New Deal also reduced the need for employee housing by transforming housing finance to a lower-interest, lower-deposit system making home ownership more accessible to the working class.

==Model company towns==
[[File:Port Sunlight.jpg|thumb|An example of houses at [[Port Sunlight]]]]
{{see also|Model village}}
During the late nineteenth century, model company towns materialised, as enlightened industrialists recognised that many poor workers were living in appalling conditions.&lt;ref name=parsons/&gt; These industrialists wished to combat the unsanitary and congested conditions common to working class districts in order to create better living conditions for workers.&lt;ref name="Garner_b"&gt;Garner, 1982, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; Model company towns such as [[Port Sunlight]] (1888) and [[Bournville]] (1895) were influential in regards to their building and planning innovation. The ideas generated from these model towns are regarded as having a significant influence on the [[Garden city movement|Garden City movement]].&lt;ref name="Garner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson&lt;/ref&gt;

The model company town is concerned with creating a productive and prosperous company. Enlightened industrialists believed this could be achieved by providing a healthier residential environment for their employees. Planning a model company town involved the fusion of new notions of house design and layout.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; The paternalism of the enlightened industrialist was exhibited in his desire to provide an environment for his employees that was aesthetically appealing and which included well-designed residences, parks, schools, libraries and meeting halls.&lt;ref name="Garner_a"&gt;Garner, 1992, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The industrialist also wished to contribute to his workers' well-being by providing social programs such as sporting events and functions.&lt;ref name="Garner_a" /&gt; This, however, highlights the power and immense control possessed by the company owner, who could shape the lifestyle and activities of his employees to serve his own interests and those of the company.&lt;ref name="Garner_b" /&gt;

Model villages for agricultural workers were founded in the early 19th century in the United Kingdom. The creation of model company towns was particularly evident in Britain during the latter half of the nineteenth century with the creation of [[Saltaire]] (1851), [[Bournville]], [[Port Sunlight]], [[Creswell, Derbyshire|Creswell]] and [[New Earswick]] (1901) and coincided with the housing-reform movement, which emphasized the improvement of housing for the working class.&lt;ref name=parsons/&gt; These model towns contrasted with the overcrowded conditions in British working-class districts, which were often characterized by congested housing, unsanitary conditions, and poor provision of open space and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell&lt;/ref&gt; Model company towns promoted the idea of orderly, planned town development as well as the notion of planning for the needs of the community in order to provide healthier living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model company towns in Britain===
Model company towns around the mid-nineteenth century, such as Copley (1849), near Halifax, and Saltaire (1853), close to Bradford, were differentiated by improved dwellings for workers which contrasted with working-class housing in other industrial villages and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, 1982, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; These model company towns prompted the creation of others, such as Port Sunlight, Bournville and Creswell, within an environment of reform.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Port Sunlight]] (1888) in Cheshire was established by William Hesketh Lever (later Lord Leverhulme) of Lever Brothers – a soap and tallow manufacturer. The earlier layout of this model company town was planned to suit the undulating topography of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Port Sunlight catered for the Lever Brothers employees through the provision of improved housing (cottages of varying designs and materials) and gardens, as well as social and community facilities, including an auditorium, a school, tennis courts and bowling greens.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;Cherry, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Port Sunlight combined the use of formal and informal planning elements, such as straight streets close to the town centre and curved streets in the residential areas. This combination of the formal and informal represented a new feature of British town planning.&lt;ref&gt;Hebblethwaite, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bournville]] (1895), near Birmingham, was established by the Cadbury brothers, George and Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim&lt;/ref&gt; George and Richard Cadbury chose to transfer the Cadbury factory to this new site in order to provide their employees with improved living conditions and a country environment that they could enjoy – a far cry from the busy, smoky city centre of Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The firm provided education in the form of a compulsory academic course, and workers were given the opportunity to complete commercial or technical training.&lt;ref name="Dellheim"&gt;Dellheim, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The Cadburys also encouraged their workers to get involved in the social life of Bournville through the provision of sports facilities and athletic and cultural clubs, as well as social events such as summer parties.&lt;ref name="Dellheim" /&gt; [[George Cadbury]], a Quaker, preached Christian values, such as respectability, thrift and sobriety, and sought to unify the Bournville community through rituals such as gift giving between employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also established work councils, such as the Women's Works Council, and supported trades unions.&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Bournville represented the union of industry and nature as the company town boasted the attractiveness of the countryside and low-density development defined by well-built and visually appealing dwellings.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dellheim, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Port Sunlight, Bournville catered for a mixed community, where residences were not restricted to the workforce only.&lt;ref name="Jackson_a"&gt;Jackson, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Bournville illustrated how, towards the end of the nineteenth century, low-density development was being punctuated along with the provision of open air, space and sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Bournville's gardens, parks, tree-lined streets, sense of spaciousness and country setting enhanced its aesthetic appeal and demonstrated George Cadbury's endeavour to provide workers with a healthy, beautiful and well-ventilated environment.&lt;ref name="Jackson_a" /&gt;

The Bolsover Company developed two exemplary mining communities in Derbyshire during the late nineteenth century, [[Bolsover]] (1891) and [[Creswell, Derbyshire|Creswell]] (1896). The Bolsover Company aimed to provide improved living conditions for the miners and their families in these model industrial villages. The houses at Creswell were built in concentric circles, and within these circles was a large open parkland and a bandstand.&lt;ref name="Gaskell"&gt;Gaskell, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the Bolsover Company aim to provide better housing, but they also wished to improve workers' moral fibre, believing that the provision of facilities and the promotion of workers' welfare would discourage drunkenness, gambling and bad language. The Bolsover Company provided facilities deemed beneficial for employees at both villages including clubhouses, bowling greens, cooperative society stores, cricket pitches and schools.&lt;ref name="Gaskell" /&gt; During the early years of these model industrial villages, the Bolsover Company organized various events intended to enhance community life, such as flower shows, lectures, sporting events, concerts, teas and dances.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial colonies in Catalonia, Spain==
[[File:Colònia Pons.jpg|thumb|Cal Pons, a textile company town, or ''industrial colony'', in [[Puig-reig]]]]
[[Catalonia]], a region located in North-Eastern Spain, has a high density of company towns, known locally as industrial colonies. They are especially concentrated in river basins along the [[Ter River|Ter]] and [[Llobregat]]. In [[Berguedà]], for example, within 20&amp;nbsp;km there are 14 colonies. The total number in Catalonia is around a hundred. These were small towns created around a factory, built in a rural area and, therefore, separate from any other population. They housed between 100 and 500 inhabitants, and in some cases around 1000 people.&lt;ref name="Serra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serra|first1=Rosa|title=Industrial colonies in Catalonia|journal=Catalan Historical Review|date=2011|volume=4|pages=101–120|doi=10.2436/20.1000.01.53|url=http://revistes.iec.cat/index.php/CHR/article/viewFile/54342/pdf_159|accessdate=27 April 2016|issn=2013-407X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These industrial colonies were a typical aspect of industrialization in Catalonia, specifically the second industrialization, which resulted in certain areas that were once purely rural becoming industrial. They were first created in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially from the 1870s onwards. The last colonies were created in the early years of the twentieth century. Thus, company towns in Catalonia have a history going back some 150 years, although in almost all cases the company that operated the colony has now shut down. The most common industry in these colonies was textiles. There are more than 75 textile colonies recorded; although there were also mining, metallurgy and agricultural colonies.&lt;ref name="Serra" /&gt;

Mostly these colonies (particularly the textile related ones) were constructed close to a river. This was because they used hydraulic power (waterwheels) to run the factory. One reason for this was that Catalonia was poor in coal and importing it was expensive. In addition, the Catalan rivers (with little volume but a very steep sloping run) provided free and almost inexhaustible energy, that was lacking only in times of drought.&lt;ref name="clua"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clua i Mercadal|first1=Jordi|title=Les colònies industrials al Berguedà: estudi d'una transformació econòmica i urbana|journal=Treballs de la Societat Catalana de Geografia|date=1992|volume=VII|pages=145–170|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/treballsscgeografia/article/viewFile/239840/322295|accessdate=3 May 2016|language=catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial colonies system began to collapse in the 1960s. The colonies gradually emptied of people even before the definitive industrial crisis, which worsened in 1978. In the 1980s and 1990s almost all the factories in these industrial colonies closed. From that moment on, many colonies became towns that were now independent of the company, others were abandoned and remain without inhabitants. Other factories were leased to smaller industries or now lie empty.&lt;ref name="Serra" /&gt;

Some of the more interesting colonies include: [[Colònia Güell]], in [[Santa Coloma de Cervelló]], which contains several modernist buildings, such as the crypt church built by [[Antoni Gaudí]]; [[L'Ametlla de Merola]], [[Puig-reig]], where centenary traditional cultural activities are held, such as the representation of [[Els Pastorets]]; the three colonies of [[Castellbell i el Vilar]]: [[La Bauma]], [[El Borràs]], [[El Burés]], with buildings of architectural interest; [[Cal Rosal]], between [[Berga]], [[Avià]] and [[Olvan]], which, in 1858, was the first colony in the era of building large colonies in the Llobregat; [[Cal Vidal]], Puig-reig, which houses the Museum of the Vidal Colony, an ideal visit for anyone wishing to learn what life was like in one of these industrial experiments.

[[File:A view over Kuusankoski.JPG|thumb|Former company town Kuusankoski in Finland]]
[[Kuusankoski]] in Finland, formerly also known as "the paper capital of Finland", is a prime example of the decline many company towns have had to deal with when the company itself struggles. The town relied on three paper mills owned by [[Kymmene Corporation]] from the 1870s until 2005 when two mills, Voikkaa and Kuusaa, were shut down, leaving only the Kymi mill operating. An estimated 5% of the local population had been employed by the two closed mills and Kymmene's decision left the town in socioeconomic chaos. Kuusankoski's independent status ended in 2009 when the town was consolidated into the regional capital, Kouvola.

The border town [[Oranjemund|Oranjemund, Namibia]] is a company town owned by [[De Beers|Namibian DeBeers (Namdeb).]] The town has a diamond mine that was established over 25 years ago and is still ongoing till this day. Residents of [[Oranjemund]] either work in the mine or for the company in offices based in the town. To enter the town, all people above 18 need permission to pass its gates and need to provide a residential, and reason for visiting. Due to this the town has no homeless people at all and can regulate people coming in and out of the town. A municipality has recently been introduced in Oranjemund and will start to fully operate in late 2016 meaning residents will soon start paying for Water and Electricity which has been a benefit to them. The town is staged and is busy readying itself to becoming open to the public.

[[File:Coalwood Company Store.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coalwood, West Virginia]] is a company town as portrayed in the movie ''[[October Sky]]''.]]
At their peak there were more than 2,500 company towns, housing 3% of the US population. The companies that ran the towns were primarily labor companies such as coal, steel, lumber and various war industries. Most of the people living in these towns were immigrants new to the country. This could cause issues among the populace since the manager of the town would be in charge of establishing the town's religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monuments to power|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17249000?story_id=17249000&amp;fsrc=rss|quote=At their height there were more than 2,500 such towns housing 3% of the population.|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate= 2010-10-19|date=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy Green, ''The Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy'' (2010) [https://www.amazon.com/Company-Town-Industrial-Satanic-American/dp/B004NSVFR2/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Segundo, Colorado]], was a company town where the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|CF&amp;I]] coal company housed its workers. It offered adequate housing and promoted upward mobility through its sponsorship of a YMCA Center, an elementary school, and some small businesses, as well as a [[company store]].  However, air pollution was a constant health threat, also the houses lacked indoor plumbing. As demand for metallurgical coke declined, the mine laid off workers, and Segundo's population declined.  After a major fire in 1929, CF&amp;I left town, and Segundo became practically a ghost town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weaver Glen D., Graham Ryan C. | year = 2008 | title = Segundo, Colorado | url = | journal = New Mexico Historical Review | volume = 83 | issue = 3| pages = 323–351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present-day United States, it is relatively rare for any place in which a single company owns all the property to be granted status as an [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] [[municipality]]. Rather, companies will normally prefer their wholly owned communities to remain unincorporated, as this permits administration of the community to be carried out by appointed company officers rather than elected officials. However, there are incorporated municipalities that are heavily dependent upon a single industry or organization and may be loosely considered a "company town", even though the company does not technically own the town.

'''Daniel Fernando Abugattás Majluf''' (born 14 April 1955 in [[Arequipa]]) is a [[Peru]]vian businessman and politician ([[Peruvian Nationalist Party|PNP]]). He has been a [[Congress of Peru|Congressman]] representing the constituency of [[Lima]] since 2006, and is the incumbent President of the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://elcomercio.pe/politica/947094/noticia-abugattas-garantiza-coordinacion-entre-legislativo-ejecutivo |title=Abugattas garantiza coordinación entre Legislativo y Ejecutivo |newspaper=El Comercio.pe |language=Spanish |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=5 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Abugattás studied law at the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú|Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]] in Lima. Subsequently, he pursued a master program in economic law at the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] in Xochimilco, Mexico, from 1980 to 1981. Moreover, in 1982, he took a specialization course in quality management at the Japanese [[Association for Overseas Technical Scholarship]] (AOTS) in Osaka. From 1980 to 1994, he worked as a procurator for Fabrica Moderna S.A. in Lima. From 1994 to 2006, he was the general director of [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]] Peru.

In 2006, he was elected as a congressman on the joint [[Union for Peru]] and [[Peruvian Nationalist Party]] list, representing the city of Lima. After the breakup of the alliance following the 2011 elections, Abugattás decided to sit with the Nationalists. From 2007 to 2011, he was a member of the political commission of the Nationalist Party. From 2010 to 2011, Abugattás was the spokesman of the Nationalist bench in Congress. After [[Ollanta Humala]] and his Nationalists-dominated [[Peru Wins]] alliance won the [[Peruvian general election, 2011|2011 general election]], in which Abugattás could defend his seat, he was elected President of the Congress.

==Biography==
Neeleman was born in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, and raised in [[Utah]], U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welling|first=Angie|title=JetBlue founder recalls stormy times|journal=[[Deseret News]]|date=August 25, 2007|volume=|issue=|pages=|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695204138/JetBlue-founder-recalls-stormy-times.html|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family of Dutch and American descent. He lived in Brazil until he was five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sellers|first=Patricia|title=The Next JetBlue: What's David Neeleman Doing Starting a New Airline in Brazil?

==Career==
He co-founded (with June Morris) [[Morris Air]], a low-fare charter airline, and from 1984 to 1988, he was the executive vice president of the company. In 1988 Neeleman assumed the helm of Morris Air as its president. In 1993, when Morris Air was acquired by [[Southwest Airlines]] for $130 million (Neeleman received $25 million from the sale), he worked for 5 months on their Executive Planning Committee.&lt;ref name="JetBlue Company Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/38/JetBlue-Airways-Corporation.html |title=JetBlue Airways Corporation - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on JetBlue Airways Corporation |publisher=Referenceforbusiness.com |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Southwest, Neeleman became the CEO of Open Skies, a [[touch screen]] airline reservation and check-in systems company, later acquired by  [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] in 1999. At the same time, he helped with another upstart airline, [[WestJet]]. JetBlue was incorporated in Delaware in August 1998 and officially founded in February 1999, under the name "NewAir" by Neeleman.&lt;ref name="jetblue.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jetblue.com/about/ourcompany/history/about_ourhistory.html |title=JetBlue |publisher=JetBlue |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the CEO of [[JetBlue Airways]], his 2002 salary was $200,000 with a bonus of $90,000. Neeleman donated his entire salary to the JetBlue Crewmember Crisis Fund, which was established for JetBlue employees who had fallen on hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1287/orsc.1060.0204 | last =Wade | first =James B.  |author2=O'Reilly III, Charles A. |author3=Pollock, Timothy G.    | title =Overpaid CEOs and Underpaid Managers:  Fairness and Executive Compensation  | journal =Organization Science  | volume =17  | issue =5  | page =527  | date =September–October 2006 | issn =1047-7039  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2007, David Neeleman was replaced by [[David Barger]] (born 1959) as CEO of JetBlue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schlangenstein |first=Mary |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aWMyjHAcF4h4&amp;refer=home |title=JetBlue Air Names Barger to Succeed Neeleman as Chief (Update9) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on May 21, 2008 he was replaced as chairman of the board by [[Joel Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=Shwiff |authorlink= |title=JetBlue Solidifies Succession Plan

On March 27, 2008 Neeleman officially announced plans to launch a new airline, [[Azul Brazilian Airlines|Azul]] (Portuguese for "blue"), a domestic carrier in [[Brazil]].  Azul will complete 2013 with over 5 Billion (BRL) in sales and currently stands as Brazil's third largest airline.

On October 30, 2013 Neeleman and his youngest brother Mark James Neeleman, a cofounder of  Azul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epocanegocios.globo.com/Revista/Common/0,,ERT22831-16642,00.html |title=Época NEGÓCIOS - EDT MATERIA IMPRIMIR - Há algo de novo no ar |publisher=Epocanegocios.globo.com |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced the launch of a new company, Vigzul, a home security and monitoring company.  Vigzul came from an idea of Mark Neeleman and was founded by David Allred, Brett Chambers and Neeleman serves as Chairman of the board and principal investor.

In June 2015, the Portuguese Government decided to sell the TAP Air Portugal Group, owner of the national air carrier, TAP Air Portugal, to the Gateway consortium with David Neeleman in partnership with Humberto Pedrosa who take control of 61% of the capital of the Portuguese carrier. TAP Air Portugal will maintain the country as the airline’s main hub for a minimum of 30 years.

The '''ease of doing business index''' is an index created by [[Simeon Djankov]] at the [[World Bank Group]]. The academic research for the report was done jointly with professors [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] and [[Andrei Shleifer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/ |title=Doing Business - Measuring Business Regulations - World Bank Group
 |publisher=Doing Business |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher rankings (a low numerical value) indicate better, usually simpler, regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights. [[Empirical research]] funded by the World Bank to justify their work show that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/ |title=Doing Business report series – World Bank Group |publisher=Doingbusiness.org |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Empirical research is needed to establish the optimal level of business regulation—for example, what the duration of court procedures should be and what the optimal degree of social protection is. The indicators compiled in the ''Doing Business'' project allow such research to take place. Since the start of the project in November 2001, more than 3,000 academic papers have used one or more indicators constructed in ''Doing Business'' and the related background papers by its authors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Annual-Reports/English/DB13-Chapters/Ease-of-doing-business-and-distance-to-frontier.pdf Ease of doing business], Page 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
The report is above all, a [[benchmarking|benchmark]] study of [[regulation]]. The survey consists of a questionnaire designed by the ''Doing Business'' team with the assistance of academic advisers. The questionnaire centers on a simple business case that ensures comparability across economies and over time. The survey also bases assumptions on the legal form of the business, size, location, and nature of its operations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/Methodology/Methodology-Note|title=Improvements made to methodology this year - Doing Business - World Bank Group|website=www.doingbusiness.org|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ease of doing business index is meant to measure regulations directly affecting businesses and does not directly measure more general conditions such as a nation's proximity to large markets, quality of infrastructure, inflation, or crime.

The next step of gathering data surveys of over 12,500 expert contributors (lawyers, accountants etc.) in 190 countries who deal with business regulations in their day-to-day work. These individuals interact with the ''Doing Business'' team in conference calls, written correspondence and visits by the global team. For the 2017 report, team members visited 34 economies to verify data and to recruit respondents. Data from the survey is subjected to several rounds of verification. The surveys are not a statistical sample, and the results are interpreted and cross-checked for consistency before being included in the report. Results are also validated with the relevant government before publication. Respondents fill out written surveys and provide references to the relevant laws, regulations and fees, based on standardized case scenarios with specific assumptions, such as the business being located in the largest business city of the [[economy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A nation's ranking on the index is based on the average of 10 subindices:
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/starting-a-business Starting a business] – Procedures, time, cost and minimum capital to open a new business
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/dealing-with-construction-permits Dealing with construction permits] – Procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/getting-electricity Getting electricity] – procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly constructed warehouse
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/registering-property Registering property] – Procedures, time and cost to register commercial real estate
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/getting-credit Getting credit] – Strength of legal rights index, depth of credit information index
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/protecting-investors Protecting investors] – Indices on the extent of disclosure, extent of director liability and ease of shareholder suits
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/paying-taxes Paying taxes] – Number of taxes paid, hours per year spent preparing tax returns and total tax payable as share of gross profit
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/trading-across-borders Trading across borders] – Number of documents, cost and time necessary to export and import
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/enforcing-contracts Enforcing contracts] – Procedures, time and cost to enforce a debt contract
*[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/resolving-insolvency Resolving insolvency] – The time, cost and recovery rate (%) under bankruptcy proceeding
The Doing Business project also offers information on following datasets:
* [http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/distance-to-frontier Distance to frontier] - Shows the distance of each economy to the "frontier," which represents the highest performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies included since each indicator was included in ''Doing Business''
* [http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship] - Measures entrepreneurial activity. The data is collected directly from 130 company registrars on the number of newly registered firms over the past seven years 
* [http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/good-practice Good practices] - Provide insights into how governments have improved the regulatory environment in the past in the areas measured by ''Doing Business''
* [http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/transparency Transparency in business regulation] - Data on the accessibility of regulatory information measures how easy it is to access fee schedules for 4 regulatory processes in the largest business city of an economy

For example, according to the ''Doing Business'' (DB) 2013 report, Canada ranked third on the first subindex "Starting a business" behind only New Zealand and Australia. In Canada there is 1 procedure required to start a business which takes on average 5 days to complete. The official cost is 0.4% of the [[gross national income]] per capita. There is no minimum capital requirement. By contrast, in [[Chad]] which ranked among the worst (181st out of 185) on this same subindex, there are 9 procedures required to start a business taking 62 days to complete. The official cost is 202% of the gross national income per capita. A minimum capital investment of 289.4% of the gross national income per capita is required.

While fewer and simpler regulations often imply higher rankings, this is not always the case. Protecting the rights of creditors and investors, as well as establishing or upgrading property and credit registries, may mean that more regulation is needed.

In most indicators, the case study refers to a small domestically-owned manufacturing company - hence the direct relevance of the indicators to foreign investors and large companies is limited. DB uses a simple averaging approach for weighting sub-indicators and calculating rankings. A detailed explanation of every indicator can be found through the DB website, and a .xls archive that simulates reforms.

Some [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]s regarding the rankings and main information presented have to be considered by every user of the report. Mainly:

* ''Doing Business'' does not measure all aspects of the business environment that matter to firm or investors, such as the macroeconomic conditions, or the level of employment, corruption, stability or [[poverty]], in every country.
* ''Doing Business'' does not consider the strengths and weakness neither of the [[global financial system]], nor the [[financial system]] of every country. It also doesn't consider the state of the finances of the government of every country.
* ''Doing Business'' does not cover all the regulation, or all the regulatory requirements. Other types of regulation such as financial market, environment, or [[intellectual property]] regulations that are relevant for the private sector are not considered.
The ''Doing Business'' report is not intended as a complete assessment of competitiveness or of the business environment of a country and should rather be considered as a proxy of the regulatory framework faced by the private sector in a country.

== History ==
The ''Doing Business'' report has its origins in a paper first published in the [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] by [[Simeon Djankov]], Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes and [[Andrei Shleifer]] called "The Regulation of Entry" in 2002.  The paper presented data on the regulation of entry of [[Start-up company|start-up firms]] in 85 countries covering the number of procedures, official time and official cost that a start-up must bear before it could operate legally. The main findings of the paper were that: "Countries with heavier regulation of entry have higher [[political corruption|corruption]] and larger unofficial economies, but no better quality of public or private goods. Countries with more democratic and limited governments have lighter regulation of entry." The paper became widely known because it provided quantitative evidence that entry regulation benefits politicians and [[bureaucrat]]s without adding value to the private sector, or granting any additional protection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simeon Djankov|Djankov, Simeon]], et al., "The Regulation of Entry", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol.CXVII February 2002, Issue I&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries have launched reforms to improve their rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/09/india-s-big-manufacturing-push|title=Time to make in India?|date=2014-09-25|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21631039-international-comparisons-are-popular-influentialand-sometimes-flawed-ranking-rankings|title=Ranking the rankings|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts are motivated to a great scope by the fact that the World Bank Group publishes the data, and hence coverage by the [[mass media|media]] and the private sector every year. Also, ''Doing Business'' highlights every year the successful reforms carried out by each country. Since The Regulation of Entry was published, [[Simeon Djankov]] and [[Andrei Shleifer]] have published eight other academic studies, one for each set of indicators covered by the report.

In 2013, ''Doing Business'' covered regulations measured from June 2011 through May 2012. Over the previous decade, the reports recorded nearly 2,000 regulatory reforms implemented by 180 economies.

* [[Poland]] was the global top improver in the past year. It enhanced the ease of doing business through four institutional or regulatory reforms, making it easier to register property, pay taxes, enforce contracts, and resolve insolvency.
* Worldwide, 108 economies implemented 201 regulatory reforms in 2011/12 making it easier to do business as measured by ''Doing Business''. Reform efforts globally have focused on making it easier to start a new business, increasing the efficiency of tax administration and facilitating trade across international borders. Of the 201 regulatory reforms recorded in the past year, 44% focused on these 3 policy areas alone.
* Singapore topped the global ranking on the ease of doing business for the seventh consecutive year, followed by Hong Kong SAR; [[New Zealand]]; the [[United States]]; and [[Denmark]]. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was a new entrant to the top 10.
In 2014 ''Doing Business'' covered regulations measured from June 2012 through May 2013 in 189 economies.

* [[Singapore]] is the first economy of the global ranking followed by Hong Kong SAR, New Zealand, the United States, Denmark, Malaysia, South Korea, Georgia, Norway, and the United Kingdom.
* For the first time data about Libya, Myanmar, San Marino, and South Sudan were collected.
*114 economies adopted 238 regulatory reforms in 2012/13  (the reforms increased of 18% compared to the previous year).
In 2015, ''Doing Business'' covered regulations measured from June 2013 through June 2014 in 189 economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2015|title=Doing Business 2015, World Bank. Published: October 29, 2014.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time this year, ''Doing Business'' collected data for 2 cities in 11 economies with more than 100 million inhabitants. These economies include: Bangladesh, Brazil, China, [[India]], Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, and the United States. The added city enables a sub-national comparison and benchmarking against other large cities.

==Research and influence==
More than 3,000 academic papers have used data from the index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/research |title=Doing Business and related research - World Bank Group
 |publisher=Doingbusiness.org |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of improving regulations on economic growth is claimed to be very strong. Moving from the worst one-fourth of nations to the best one-fourth implies a 2.3 percentage point increase in annual growth. Another 7,000 working papers in economics and social science departments use the data from the [[Doing Business report]]. The 2016 [[Nobel Prize]] Winner in Economics [[Oliver Hart (economist)]] is among the authors of such papers.

The various sub-components of the index in themselves provide concrete suggestions for improvement. Many of them may be relatively easy to implement and uncontroversial (except perhaps among corrupt officials who may gain from onerous regulations requiring bribes to bypass). As such, the index has influenced many nations to improve their regulations. Several have explicitly targeted to reach a minimum position on the index, for example the top 25 list.

Somewhat similar annual reports are the [[Indices of Economic Freedom]] and the [[Global Competitiveness Report]]. They, especially the later, look at many more factors that affect economic growth, like inflation and infrastructure. These factors may however be more subjective and diffuse since many are measured using surveys and they may be more difficult to change quickly compared to regulations.

A November 2017 [[EconTalk]] podcast explains the lasting influence in academia and policy circles of the [[Doing Business report]].

==''Doing Business'' Report==
The ''Doing Business'' Report (DB) is a report started by [[Simeon Djankov]] and elaborated by the [[World Bank Group]] since 2003 every year that is aimed to measure the costs to firms of business regulations in 190 countries. The study has become one of the flagship knowledge products of the World Bank Group in the field of [[private sector]] development, and is claimed to have motivated the design of several regulatory reforms in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. The study presents every year a detailed analysis of costs, requirements and procedures a specific type of [[private firm]] is subject in all countries, and then, creates [[ranking]]s for every country. The study is also backed up by broad [[communication]] efforts, and by creating rankings, the study spotlights countries and leaders that are promoting reforms.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank: "Doing Business 2010", World Bank Group, 2010, U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DB has been widely known and used by [[academic]]s, policy-makers, [[politician]]s, development experts, [[journalist]]s and the business community to highlight [[red tape]] and promote reforms. As stated by the [[Independent Evaluation Group|IEG]] study from the World Bank: &lt;blockquote&gt;“For country authorities, it sheds a bright, sometimes unflattering, light on regulatory aspects of their business climate. For business interests, it has helped to catalyze debates and dialogue about reform. For the World Bank Group, it demonstrates an ability to provide global knowledge, independent of resource transfer and [[conditionality]]. The annual exercise generates information that is relevant and useful.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the DB, regulation does matter for the development of the private sectors, and several reforms are suggested across the report in order to promote the development of the private sector and enable the business environment. Some highlighted findings of the DB are:
* Lower barriers to start-up are associated with a smaller [[informal sector]].
* Lower costs of entry encourage [[entrepreneurship]], enhance firm [[productivity]] and reduce corruption.
* Simple start-up translates into greater [[employment]] opportunities.

===Contents===
In 2017, the study contains quantitative measures of regulations for starting a [[business]], dealing with [[construction permit]]s, employing workers, registering property, getting credit, protecting [[investor]]s, [[tax]]es, [[Cross-border trade|trading across borders]], enforcing [[contract]]s, getting an electricity connection and closing a business. As stated in the introduction of the study, "A fundamental premise of DB is that [[economic activity]] requires good rules. These include rules that establish and clarify property rights and reduce the costs of resolving disputes, rules that increase the predictability of economic interactions and rules that provide contractual partners with core protections against abuse."

===Evaluation===
''Doing Business'' is a controversial study, with passionate critics and devoted fans. As recognized by the [[Independent Evaluation Group]] of the World Bank, some have questioned the reliability and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of its measurements while others doubt the relevance of the issues it addresses or fear it may unduly dominate countries reform agendas at the expense of more crucial development objectives. Attention given to the indicators may inadvertently signal that the World Bank Group values less burdensome business regulations more highly than its other strategies for [[poverty reduction]] and [[sustainable development]].

According to Snodgrass, several limitations are present in the DB studies and have to be kept in mind when using the study:

* The indicators and measures are referred to the costs, requirements and fees of doing business in the country's largest business city; thus conditions elsewhere within the country may differ.
* To achieve cross-country [[standardization]] respondents are asked to give estimates for a [[limited liability company]] of a specific size.{{vague|date=August 2014}} Costs for other forms and scales of businesses may differ.
* Transactions and fees to be cost out are very specifically defined. The costs of other types of transactions may differ.
* The cost estimates come from individuals identified as expert respondents. Sometimes the estimates give by such individual may differ with other experts and with public officials. If so, the responses are cross-checked for consistency.
* The estimates assume that a business knows what is required and does not waste time. Satisfying regulatory requirements will obviously take longer if the business lacks information or is unable to follow up promptly. A related point here is that DB may not understand "work-arounds", "facilitating fees", and "learning time" that speed or delay approvals and causes variation costs.

===Related studies===

Published now for twelve years, the DB has originated a growing body of [[research]] on how performance on DB indicators, and reforms generated by the reports, related to specific development desirable outcomes. As stated by the DB 2010, about "405 articles have been published in peer-reviewed [[academic journal]]s and about 1143 working papers are available through Google Scholar".

The DB has acknowledged the limitation of getting data from one city to give information and a ranking valid for all the country. Several regional and sub-national studies have been carried out using the Doing Business methodology to assess variations within countries and regions across different cities, including sub-national studies for countries like [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]] and regional studies for the [[Caribbean]], the Arab World, [[Bulgaria]] and other south eastern European countries. All studies are available from the DB website.

DB sometimes unintentionally has been widely used as a study to measure [[competitiveness]]. However, regulation rather than competitiveness is the main objective in the DB. Other studies that are also used to measure competitiveness and recognized as business enabling environment ranking systems are the [[Global Competitiveness Report|Global Competitiveness Index]], the [[Index of Economic Freedom]], and the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, Sonald, "Alternative Business Enabling Environment Rankings. A Review", USAID / Business Growth Initiative, USAID&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The ''Doing Business'' methodology regarding labor regulations was criticized by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] because it favored flexible employment regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ituc-csi.org/spip.php?article491 |title=ITUC-CSI-IGB – International Trade Union Confederation |publisher=Ituc-csi.org |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early reports, the easier it was to dismiss a worker for economic reasons in a country, the more its rankings improved. The Employing Workers index was revised in Doing Business 2008 to be in full compliance with the 188 [[International Labour Organization]] conventions. It has subsequently been removed from the rankings. The ITUC debuted the Global Rights Index in 2014 as a response to the ''Doing Business'' report.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Gausi (21 May 2014). [http://www.equaltimes.org/new-global-index-elevates-workers?lang=en New Global Index Elevates Workers' Rights over "Doing Business"]. ''Equal Times.'' Retrieved 30 May 2014; see also: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-wdewTPTKs&amp;feature=youtu.be ITUC Global Rights Index: The world's worst countries for workers].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the World Bank Group's Independent Evaluation Group, a semi-independent watchdog within the World Bank Group, published an evaluation of the ''Doing Business'' index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTOED/EXTDOIBUS/0,,contentMDK:21645387~pagePK:64829573~piPK:64829550~theSitePK:4663967,00.html |title=Doing Business – Doing Business: An Independent Evaluation |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report, ''[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTOED/EXTDOIBUS/0,,contentMDK:21645387~pagePK:64829573~piPK:64829550~theSitePK:4663967,00.html Doing Business: An Independent Evaluation]'', contained both praise and criticism of ''Doing Business''. The report recommended that the index be clearer about what is and is not measured, disclose changes to published data, recruit more informants, and simplify the Paying Taxes indicator.

In April 2009 the World Bank issued a note with revisions to the Employing Workers index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/employing-workers |title=EWI Revisions |publisher=Doingbusiness.org |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The note explained that scoring for the "Employing Workers" indicator would be updated in ''Doing Business 2010'' to give favorable scores for complying with relevant ILO conventions. The Employing Workers indicator was also removed as a guidepost for Country Policy and Institutional Assessments, which help determine resources provided to IDA countries.

A study commissioned by the Norwegian government alleges methodological weaknesses, an uncertainty in the ability of the indicators to capture the underlying business climate, and a general worry that many countries may find it easier to change their ranking in ''Doing Business'' than to change the underlying business environment.&lt;ref name="ifiwatchnet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifiwatchnet.org/sites/ifiwatchnet.org/files/Doing%20Business_ESOPanalysis.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726171432/http://ifiwatchnet.org/sites/ifiwatchnet.org/files/Doing%20Business_ESOPanalysis.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |title=Be careful when Doing Business |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, an independent panel appointed by the President of the World Bank and headed by Trevor Manuel of South Africa, issued a review expressing concern about the potential for the report and index to be misinterpreted, the narrowness of the indicators and information base, the data collection methodology, and the lack of peer review. It recommended that the report be retained, but that the aggregate rankings be removed and that a peer-review process be implemented (among other things). Regarding the topics of Paying Taxes and Employing Workers, it noted that "The latter has already been excluded from the report's rankings. While there is a persuasive case for paying attention to these aspects of doing business, the Bank will need to carefully consider the correct way to assess the regulation and legal environment of these areas if these indicators are to be retained."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbrpanel.org/sites/dbrpanel/files/doing-business-review-panel-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[http://doingbusiness.org/methodology Doing Business criteria]'' for measuring the time needed to complete a procedure were based on some simplified assumptions: "It is assumed that the minimum time required for each procedure is 1 day. Although procedures may take place simultaneously, they cannot start on the same day (that is, simultaneous procedures start on consecutive days)". These assumptions generated some criticisms especially by countries that were able to complete one or more procedures simultaneously and could therefore be penalized in the final rank.  World Bank claimed that the same criteria are applied to all economies and therefore would not produce biased results. In 2014 the possible biases in applying the DB time indicator were mathematically demonstrated in a scientific article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/ite/iteeco/140104.html |title=World Bank Doing Business Project and the statistical methods based on ranks: the paradox of the time indicator. |publisher=Rivista italiana di economia demografia e statistica, 2014, Volume LXVIII, Issue 1, ideas.repec.org|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared on the [[Rivista italiana di economia demografia e statistica]] (Italian Review of Economics, Demography and Statistics - RIEDS).  World Bank partially reviewed the criteria inserting a new assumption for telematics procedures: "each telematics procedure accounts for 0.5 day instead of one day (and telematics procedures can also take place simultaneously)".

== 2018 manipulation scandal ==

On 12 January 2018, [[Paul Romer]], the [[World Bank]]'s chief economist, announced that past releases of the index would be corrected and recalculated going back at least four years. Romer apologised to [[Chile]], saying that the former director of the group responsible for the index had repeatedly manipulated its methodology, unfairly penalising the country's rankings during the administration of left-wing President [[Michelle Bachelet]]. In response, Bachelet announced that Chile would formally request a complete investigation by the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chile slams World Bank for bias in competitiveness rankings|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-worldbank/chile-slams-world-bank-for-bias-in-competitiveness-rankings-idUSKBN1F20SN?il=0|work=Reuters|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zumbrun|first1=Josh|last2=Talley|first2=Ian|title=World Bank Unfairly Influenced Its Own Competitiveness Rankings|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-bank-unfairly-influenced-its-own-competitiveness-rankings-1515797620|work=Wall Street Journal|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ranking ==

The most recent rankings come from the "''Doing Business'' 2018" report. Ranking of economies was introduced in the "''Doing Business'' 2006" report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2018|title=Doing Business 2018 - Equal Opportunity for All - World Bank Group|website=www.doingbusiness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand has topped the ''Ease of Doing Business'' rankings in 2017 and 2018.

Singapore topped the ''Ease of Doing Business'' rankings in 2007–2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Tops World Bank Survey|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-04/singapore-tops-world-bank-survey-on-ease-of-doing-business-for-fifth-year.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on Singapore's experience, [[IDA International]] is collaborating with public agencies in several countries in the areas such as ICT strategy, national infocomm planning and solutions implementation that can help increase the ease of doing business.

'''Educational equity''', also referred to as '''equity in education''', is a measure of achievement, fairness, and opportunity in education. The study of education equity is often linked with the study of [[excellence and equity]].

Educational equity depends on two main factors. The first is [[Distributive justice|fairness]], which implies that factors specific to one's personal conditions should not interfere with the potential of academic success. The second important factor is [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]], which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/school/39989494.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ten Steps to Equity in Education|publisher=Oecd.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing importance of education equity is based on the premise that an individual’s level of education directly correlates to future [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Therefore, an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving. However, [[Educational inequality|inequity in education]] is challenging to avoid, and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing, race, gender or disability. Educational equity is also based in the historical context of the location, people and structure. History shapes the outcome of individuals within the education system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Savage Inequalities|last=Kozol|first=Jonathan|publisher=Broadway Books|year=1991|isbn=0770435688|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Equity vs. equality==
Often, the terms "equity" and "equality" are interchanged when referring to educational equity. Although similar, there can be important distinctions between the two.

=== Equity ===
Equity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and aims at compensating for these peoples misfortunes and disabilities to ensure that everyone can attain the same type of healthy lifestyle. Examples of this are: “When libraries offer literacy programs, when schools offer courses in English as a second language, and when foundations target scholarships to students from poor families, they operationalize a belief in equity of access as fairness and as justice”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/equalityequity|title=Equality and Equity of Access: What's the Difference?|publisher=Ala.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity recognizes this uneven playing field and aims to take extra measures by giving those who are in need more than others who are not. Equity aims at making sure that everyone's lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost of unequal distribution of access and goods. [[social justice educational leadership|Social justice leaders]] in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students.

=== Equality ===
The [[American Library Association]] defines equality as: “access to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all--a level playing field--is derived from the concept of fairness as uniform distribution, where everyone is entitled to the same level of access and can avail themselves if they so choose.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this definition of equality no one person has an unfair advantage. Everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility and are then free to do what they please with it. However, this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by.

==Socio-economic equity in education==
[[File:Education Equality.png|thumb|700px|center|Education equality on countries that are members of the OECD. The numbers correspond to the average difference of points in the results of the PISA test of a student from a high socio-economic level and a student from a low socio-economic level in their respective country. A higher number represents a more unequal education system whilst a smaller number indicates a more equal education system]]

===Income and class===
Income has always played an important role in shaping academic success. Those who come from a family of a higher [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower SES. Those who come from a higher SES can afford things like better tutors, rigorous [[SAT]]/[[ACT (test)|ACT]] prep classes, impressive summer programs, and so on. Parents generally feel more comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers (Levitsky). Parents of a higher SES are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their child's chances of acceptance, along with other extravagant measures. This creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier.

===Costs of education===
The extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a "level playing field" for all students not so level. High-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend [[selective schools]] that better prepare a student for later success. Because of this, low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified. In addition, neighborhoods generally [[Residential segregation|segregated]] by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools. For higher-quality schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they can't pay for. Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/education/poor-students-struggle-as-class-plays-a-greater-role-in-success.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Poor Students Struggle as Class Plays a Greater Role in Success|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracking===
Another contributor to the inequality in the education system is [[tracking (education)|tracking]]. Tracking sorts students into different classes or groups based on ability or future plans. The point of tracking is to create an environment in which the student's abilities match both the curriculum as well as the other student's in the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108013/chapters/What-Tracking-Is-and-How-to-Start-Dismantling-It.aspx|title=Chapter 2. What Tracking Is and How to Start Dismantling It|publisher=Ascd.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This separation, however, creates an inequality within itself. Starting at an extremely young age, the sorting of students mimics a hierarchy similar to what may form later in life. Students are both viewed and treated differently depending on which track they take. The quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and as a result, those of the lower track are disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc. In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement.

==Racial equity in education==
From a scientific point of view, the human species is a single species. Nevertheless, the term racial group is enshrined in legislation, and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official use.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atl.org.uk/Images/Race%20equality%20and%20education.pdf|format=PDF|title=Race equality and education : A practical resource for the school workforce : A resource written by Robin Richardson for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial equity in education means the assignment of students to [[State school|public schools]] and within schools without regard to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://educationnorthwest.org/equity-program/educational|title=Region X Equity Assistance Center - Education Northwest|publisher=Educationnorthwest.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational system and its response to racial concerns in education vary from country to country. Below are some examples of countries that have to deal with racial discrimination in education. 
* US Department of Education: The Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues a seminal report in 2013. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American public schools once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/eec/equity-excellence-commission-report.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Equity and Excellence Commission For Each and Every Child|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in this country and is tied up with the economic, political, social history of the peoples who are part of it. From the beginning of this nation, there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial, national origin, and language groups not from the dominant culture. Approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in the public schooling of girls and ethnic, racial, and language minority groups are still evolving.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/educationalequity/home|title=Equity In Elementary and Secondary Education: Race, Gender, and National Origin Issues: Home|publisher=Sitemaker.umich.edu|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Asia-Pacific Region: Globalization of the economy, increasingly diverse and interconnected populations, and rapid technological change are posing new and demanding challenges to individuals and societies alike. School systems are rethinking the knowledge and skills students need for success, and the educational strategies and systems required for all children to achieve them. Within the Asia-Pacific region, for example, [[Korea]], Shanghai-China, and Japan are examples of Asian education systems that have climbed the ladder to the top in both quality and equity indicators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/education/learning-world/equity-and-quality-education|title=Equity and Quality in Education|work=Asia Society|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* South Africa: A major task of South Africa's new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. During the apartheid era, which began when the National Party won control of Parliament in 1948 and ended with a negotiated settlement more than four decades later, the provision of education was racially unequal by design. Resources were lavished on schools serving white students while schools serving the black majority were systematically deprived of qualified teachers, physical resources and teaching aids such as textbook and stationery. The rationale for such inequity was a matter of public record.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED493386.pdf|format=PDF|title=Racial Equality in Education : How Far Has South Africa Come?|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education ===
Higher education plays a vital role in preparing students for the employment market and active citizenship both nationally and internationally. By embedding race equality in teaching and learning, institutions can ensure that they acknowledge the experiences and values of all students, including minority ethnic and international students. Universities Scotland first published the Race Equality Toolkit: learning and teaching in 2006 in response to strong demand from the universities in Scotland for guidance on meeting their statutory obligations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/raceequalitytoolkit/|title=Race Equality Toolkit|publisher=Universities-scotland.ac.uk|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equity in education==
Gender equity in practicality refers to both male and female concerns, yet most of the gender bias is against women in the developing world. Gender discrimination in education has been very evident and underlying problem in many countries, especially in [[Developing country|developing countries]] where cultural and societal stigma continue to hinder growth and prosperity for women. [[Global Campaign for Education]] (GCE) followed a survey called "Gender Discrimination in Violation of Rights of Women and Girls" states that one tenth of girls in primary school are 'unhappy' and this number increases to one fifth by the time they reach secondary schools. Some of the reasonings that girls provided include harassment, restorations to freedom, and an inherent lack of opportunities, compared to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acei.org/global-news/gender-discrimination-in-education.html|title=Gender Discrimination in Education|author=Anne|publisher=Acei.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) understands Education as a " fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights. It promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/right-to-education/|title=The Right to Education - Education - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Special Rapporteur Katarina Tomasevki developed the '4A' framework on the Right to Education. The '4A' framework encompasses availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability as fundamental to the institution of education. And yet girls in many underdeveloped countries are denied secondary education. 
Figure on the right shows the discrepancies in secondary education in the world. Countries such as [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Afghanistan]] face the highest of inequity when it comes to gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womanstats.org/substatics/Discrepancy%20in%20Secondary%20Education_2010tif_wmlogo3.png|format=PDF|title=Discrepancy in Secondary Education|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender-based inequity in education is not just a phenomenon in developing countries. A ''[[New York Times]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/magazine/02sex3-t.html?_r=0 |title=Teaching boys and girls separately|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlights how education systems, especially public school systems, tend to segregate. Boys and girls are often taught with different approaches, which programs children to think they are different and deserve different treatment. However, studies show that boys and girls learn differently, and therefore should be taught differently. Boys learn better when they keep moving, while girls learn better sitting in one place with silence. Therefore—in this reasoning—segregating the genders ''promotes'' gender equity in education, as both boys and girls have optimized learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/03/04/segregating-the-sexes/|title=Gender Differences: The Impact of Gender Stereotyping on School Environment - The Art of Manliness|work=The Art of Manliness|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of gender discrimination in education===
[[Voluntary Service Overseas|VSO]] is a leading independent international development organization that works towards eliminating poverty and one of the problems they tackle is gender inequity in education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsointernational.org/vso-today/index.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222023026/http://www.vsointernational.org/vso-today/index.asp |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  VSO published a paper that categorizes the obstacles (or causes) into:
* Community Level Obstacles: This category primarily relates to the bias displayed for education external to the school environment. This includes restraints due to poverty and child labour, socio-economic constraints, lack of parental involvement and community participation. Harmful practices like child marriage and predetermined gender roles are cultural hindrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-sustainable-development/gender-equality|title=Gender Equality - Education - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* School and Education System Level Obstacles: Lack of investment in quality education, inappropriate attitudes and behaviors, lack of female teachers as role models and lack of gender-friendly school environment are all factors that promote gender inequity in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsointernational.org/Images/VSO%20gender%20equality%20and%20education%20paper_tcm76-32443.pdf|format=PDF|title=Gender Equality  and Education|publisher=Vsointernational.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of gender discrimination on the economy===
Education is universally acknowledged as an essential human right because it highly impacts the socio-economic and cultural aspects of a country. Equity in education increases the work force of the nation, therefore increasing [[national income]], [[economic productivity]], and [gross domestic product]. It reduces fertility and [[infant mortality]], improves child health, increases life expectancy and increases standards of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp6532.pdf|format=PDF|title=Gender Effects of Education on Economic Development in Turkey|publisher=Ftp.iza.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are factors that allow [[economic stability]] and growth in the future. Above all, female education can increase output levels and allow countries to attain sustainable development. Equity in education of women also reduces the possibilities of trafficking and exploitation of women. UNESCO also refers gender equity as a major factor that allows for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungei.org/resources/files/Education_from_a_Gender_Equality_Perspective.pdf|format=PDF|title=EDUCATION FROM A GENDER  EQUALITY PERSPECTIVE |publisher=Ungei.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/gender-inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/gender-inequality|title=Gender inequality|work=The Economist|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an article published by ''The Economist'', which says:

"Looking at recently-published UN statistics on gender inequality in education, one observes that the overall picture has improved dramatically over the last decade, but progress has not been even (see chart). Although the developing world on average looks likely to hit the UN’s gender-inequality target, many parts of Africa are lagging behind. While progress is being made in sub-Saharan Africa in primary education, gender inequality is in fact widening among older children. The ratio of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 85 to 93 per 100 boys between 1999 and 2010, whereas it fell from 83 to 82 and from 67 to 63 at the secondary and tertiary levels."

== Reputable research centers and associations ==
*University of Pennsylvania: The [[Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education]] unites [[University of Pennsylvania]] scholars who do research on race, racism, racial climates, and important topics pertaining to equity in education. Center staff and affiliates collaborate on funded research projects, environmental assessment activities, and the production of research reports. Principally, the Center aims to publish cutting-edge implications for education policy and practice, with an explicit focus on improving equity in schools, colleges and universities, and social contexts that influence educational outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gse.upenn.edu/equity/content/mission-and-purpose Mission and Purpose | Center for the Study of Race &amp; Equity in Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Programs for Educational Opportunity, University of Michigan: 'Equity in Elementary and Secondary Education: Race, Gender, and National Origin Issues' is a site composed of article reviews and final papers from students enrolled in an courses at the [[University of Michigan]] School of Education focusing on equity and social justice issues in education starting the Fall of 2007. What follows is a work in progress, started by members of a class entitled "Equity in K–12 Public Education" held the Fall of 2007 and "Equity and [[Social Justice]] in Education: Race, Gender, National Origin, and Language Minority Issues in Schools" the Fall of 2008 at the University of Michigan School of Education. The site has timelines, reviews of articles on selected issues, and additional resources.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
*Equity and Quality in Education (Asia Society): [[Asia Society]] is the leading educational organization dedicated to promoting mutual understanding and strengthening partnerships among peoples, leaders and institutions of Asia and the United States in a global context. Across the fields of arts, business, culture, education, and policy, the Society provides insight, generates ideas, and promotes collaboration to address present challenges and create a shared future. The highest performing education systems are those that combine quality with equity. Equity in education means that personal or social circumstances such as gender, ethnic origin or family background, are not obstacles to achieving educational potential (definition of fairness) and that all individuals reach at least a basic minimum level of skills (definition of inclusion). In these education systems, the vast majority of students have the opportunity to attain high-level skills, regardless of their own personal and socio-economic circumstances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== Notable publications and reports ==
Providing opportunities for students to consider racial equality as well as matters of racism as part of their study will help them to develop confidence to engage with these concepts as part of future practice, thinking, and life skills. Race, social class, and gender as issues related to schooling have received major attention from educators and social scientists over the last two decades.

=== Race equality in education - a survey report by England ===
The local authorities in England gave a survey report '''Race equality in education''' in November 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/race-equality-education|title=Ofsted - Race equality in education|publisher=Ofsted.gov.uk|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report is based on visits by Her Majesty.s Inspectors (HMIs) and additional inspectors to 12 LEAs and 50 schools in England between summer term 2003 to spring term 2005. This report illustrates good practice on race equality in education in a sample of schools and local education authorities (LEAs) surveyed between the summer of 2003 and the spring of 2005. The survey focused on schools and LEAs that were involved effectively in race equality in education. Four areas were examined by inspectors: improving standards and achievement amongst groups of pupils, with reference to the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA); the incorporation of race equality concepts into the curriculum in schools; the handling and reporting of race-related incidents in schools; the work of schools and LEAs in improving links with local minority ethnic communities.

=== Race equality and education – by UK educational system ===
The [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]] (ATL) (ATL promotes and protects the interests of its members – teachers, lecturers, support staff and other education professionals) introduced a practical resource for the school workforce '''Race equality and education''' in the UK educational system. The publication sets out to examine the racial, religious or cultural terminology regularly used in today's society, in an attempt to combat prejudice based on colour, ethnicity, religion or culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

=== The equity and excellence commission - US education ===
At this decisive moment, the Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues this seminal report. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American [[State school|public schools]] once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Carol D. Lee described the rationale for a special theme issue, "Reconceptualizing Race and Ethnicity in Educational Research." The rationale includes the historical and contemporary ways that cultural differences have been positioned in educational research and the need for more nuanced and complex analyses of ethnicity and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edr.sagepub.com/content/32/5/3.short|title=Why We Need to Re-Think Race and Ethnicity in Educational Research|publisher=Edr.sagepub.com|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial equity in education: how far has South Africa come? ===
A major task of South Africa’s new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. This paper evaluates progress towards this goal using three distinct concepts: equal treatment, equal educational opportunity, and educational adequacy. The authors find that the country has succeeded in establishing racial equity defined as equal treatment, primarily through race-blind policies for allocating state funds for schools. Progress measured by the other two criteria, however, has been constrained by the legacy of apartheid, including poor facilities and lack of human capacity in schools serving black students, and by policies such as school fees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

=== Race in education: an argument for integrative analysis ===
Education literature tends to treat race, social class, and gender as separate issues. A review of a sample of education literature from four academic journals, spanning ten years, sought to determine how much these status groups were integrated. The study found little integration. The study then provided a research example on cooperative learning to illustrate how attention to only one status group oversimplifies the analysis of student behavior in school. From findings of studies integrating race and class, and race and gender, the study argues that attending only to race, in this example, oversimplifies behavior analysis and may help perpetuate gender and class biases. To determine to what extent race, social class, and gender are integrated in the education literature, the study examined a sample of literature published over a ten-year period and 30 articles focused primarily on race, or on school issues related directly to race, such as desegregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rer.sagepub.com/content/56/2/195.full.pdf+html|title=Sign In|publisher=Rer.sagepub.com|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and quality in education: supporting disadvantaged students and schools–from OECD ===
The report is by the [[OECD]] Education Directorate with support from the Asia Society as a background report for the first [[Asia Society]] Global Cities Network Symposium, Hong Kong, May 10–12, 2012. Asia Society is grateful for OECD's leadership in international [[benchmarking]] and for our ongoing partnership. Asia Society organized the Global Cities Education Network, a network of urban school systems in North America and Asia to focus on challenges and opportunities for improvement common to them, and to virtually all city education systems. This report presents the key recommendations of the OECD publication Equity and Quality in Education: Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools (2012a), which maps out policy levers that can help build high quality and equitable education systems, with a particular focus on North American and Asia-Pacific countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/files/oecd-0512report.pdf|format=PDF|title=Equity and Quality in Education :  Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools|publisher=Asiasociety.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges in educational equity==
The long-term social and economic consequences of having little education are more tangible now than ever before. Those without the skills to participate socially and economically in society generate higher costs of [[List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita|healthcare]], [[income support]], [[child welfare]] and [[social security]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Societal structure and costs===
While both [[basic education]] and higher education have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years, this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics. While the [[feminist movement]] has made great strides for women, other groups have not been as fortunate. Generally, [[social mobility]] has not increased, while [[economic inequality]] has.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; So, while more students are getting a basic education and even attending universities, a dramatic divide is present and many people are still being left behind.

===Increase migration and diversity===
As increased immigration causes problems in educational equity for some countries, poor [[social cohesion]] in other countries is also a major issue. In countries where continued migration causes an issue, the ever-changing social structure of different races makes it difficult to propose a long-term solution to educational equity. On the other hand, many countries with consistent levels of diversity experience long-standing issues of integrating [[minorities]]. Challenges for minorities and migrants are often exacerbated as these groups statistically struggle more in terms of both lower academic performance and lower [[socio-economic status]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[File:Wesner Zeitlhofer and Gürtler.jpg|thumb|Gürtler (right) with U.S. Ambassador [[Alexa Wesner]](left) and Hannah Zeitlhofer (center), the first woman to be promoted to rider at the [[Spanish Riding School]]]]
'''Elisabeth Gürtler-Mauthner''' (born 7 May 1950) is an [[Austria]]n businesswoman. She is [[managing director]] of the [[Hotel Sacher]], [[Vienna]]'s most famous [[hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacher.com/sacher/HotelSacherWien/hm_a/geschichte_en.jsp?strHMP=hm_a Hotel Sacher Wien : 5-Sterne Luxushotel in Wien : Traditionelles Hotel Wien]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wCfjZE0Y?url=http://www.sacher.com/sacher/HotelSacherWien/hm_a/geschichte_en.jsp?strHMP=hm_a |date=February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Vienna, Gürtler attended a [[Catholic]] ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' in her home town, took her ''[[Matura]]'' exams in 1968 and then studied [[economics]], graduating in 1972. In 1990, on the suicide of her ex-husband, Peter Gürtler, she took over the management of the Hotel Sacher, with 500 employees under her, as he had left the hotel to their two children, at that time still minors.

From 1995 until 2000 she was Vice-President of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber. From 2001 until 2007 she chaired the [[Vienna Opera Ball]]. In that capacity, in 2005, she introduced a [[smoking ban]] for the first time in the history of that event.

In 2007 Mrs. Gürtler became director of the [[Spanish Riding School]] in [[Vienna]].

She has two children, Georg and Alexandra. Her husband was actor [[Helmuth Lohner]]. The couple lived together for 19 years before marrying in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.oe24.at/leute/oesterreich/42-Gaeste-bei-Elisabeth-Guertler-So-war-die-Hochzeit/50566923&amp;ei=3iiYT7mzLqefiAKS3P3PDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CF0Q7gEwBw&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DElisabeth%2BGuertler%26hl%3Den%26lr%3Dlang_de%26as_qdr%3Dall%26tbs%3Dlr:lang_1de%26prmd%3Dimvnso "How Was the Wedding?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Helmuth Lohner died on 23 June 2015.
Her daughter, [[Alexandra Winkler]], is one of the owners of the Hotel Sacher.

'''Equitorial Trust Bank Plc. (ETB)''', commonly referred to as '''Equitorial Bank''', was a [[commercial bank]] in [[Nigeria]]. It was one of the twenty-six (26) commercial banks licensed by the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN), the country's banking regulator, in early 2011 before a merger with Sterling Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cenbank.org/Supervision/finstitutions.asp|title=Central Bank of Nigeria:: All Financial Institutions|website=www.cenbank.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
ETB is a large financial services provider in [[Nigeria]]. {{asof|January 2011}}, the bank maintained about one hundred (100) retail branches in various urban centers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qualisteam.com/Detailed/5898.html|title=Equitorial Trust Bank|website=www.qualisteam.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The bank was established in January 1990, as a limited liability company. In February the same year, it was granted a commercial banking license and in March 1990, it commenced banking operations. In 2006, ETB successfully merged with the former '''Devcom Bank'''. The bank is a national bank, which has most of its retail outlets located in [[Nigeria]]'s major urban centers.

In 2009, in an audit by the Central Bank of Nigeria, ETB was found to be under-capitalized and unsatisfactorily managed. Subsequent to those discoveries, CBN directed ETB to reduce company staff numbers to maintain profitability. 150 staff members, representing about 15% of the bank's work force were fired in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201003301145.html|title=Nigeria: Equitorial Trust Bank Fires 150 Staff|last=Komolafe|first=Babajide|date=2010-03-30|work=Vanguard (Lagos)|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETB was also added to a list of nine (9) Nigerian commercial banks that required the injection of new capital by the '''Asset Management Company of Nigeria''' (AMCON), a federal government agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102141302.html|title=Nigeria: Shareholders Optimistic of Better Days for Rescued Banks|last=Akanbi|first=Festus|date=2011-02-14|work=This Day (Lagos)|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102140312.html?viewall=1|title=Nigeria: Bad Loans Still Make Banks Uncomfortable|last=Durojaiye|first=Rotimi|date=2011-02-14|work=Daily Independent (Lagos)|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ETB was taken over by Sterling bank in a deal that was sealed on 11 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index.php/news/15618-sterling-bank-acquires-equitorial-trust-bank.html|title=The Nation Newspaper Nigeria - Read Latest Nigeria News|website=The Nation Nigeria|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
Prior to 2009, the shares of [[stock]] of the bank were privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102030309.html|title=Nigeria: Four Rescued Banks to Sign MoU On Re-Capitalisation|date=2011-02-03|work=Vanguard (Lagos)|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the intervention of the CBN and AMCON in 2009, a significant percentage of shareholding in ETB is owned by the [[Government of Nigeria|Federal Government of Nigeria]].

'''EQUASS (European Quality in Social Services)''' is an integrated sector-specific [[Quality management|quality]] certification system that certifies compliance of [[social services]] with European quality principles and criteria. EQUASS aims to enhance the [[social sector]] by engaging service providers in quality and continuous improvement and by guaranteeing service users quality of services throughout Europe.

EQUASS,&lt;ref&gt;EQUASS website, www.equass.be, accessed on 26/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; formerly called the European Quality in Rehabilitation Mark (EQRM) is an initiative of the [[European Platform for Rehabilitation|European Platform for Rehabilitation (EPR)]] &lt;ref&gt;European Platform for Rehabilitation website, http://www.epr.eu/, accessed on 26/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and its secretariat is based in [[Brussels]].

== History ==

In July 1995, the European Platform for Rehabilitation, then called the European Platform for Vocational Rehabilitation (EPVR),&lt;ref&gt;EPR Annual report 2002 [http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/annual_reports/EPR%20AR%202002.pdf] accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked its working group "Quality management and cost effectiveness" to study the launch of a "Quality Award for Vocational Rehabilitation"&lt;ref&gt;EPR Annual report 2001 [http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/annual_reports/EPR%20AR%202001.pdf] accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; for European institutes of vocational rehabilitation. 
The award would require an audit which, if successful, would show that the institute of vocational rehabilitation works in accordance with the standards of the platform. 
The certification system to be launched was mainly inspired by the [[Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities|CARF]] certification.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte van Lierop, May 2003, "Een europees kwaliteitskeurmerk voor re-integratiebedrijven", ''Maandblad Re-integratie''&lt;/ref&gt;
The European Platform for Rehabilitation enrolled a few of its members to implement the quality standard that was then named EQRM (European Quality in Rehabilitation Mark). The first awarding event took place in Rome in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/annual_reports/EPR%20AR%202003.pdf EPR Annual report 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;
The main values behind the quality mark were: 
* A [[Person-centred planning|client-focused]] approach of rehabilitation services
* An awareness of the rights of service users
* The involvement and [[empowerment]] of service users
* A systematic enhancement of [[quality of life]]
* [[Employee engagement|Motivation of staff]]
* Efficient business management practices
* Measuring and proving the service outcomes and results
* Services providers that are accountable for their actions and their use of [[Government spending|funds]]

In 2008,&lt;ref&gt;EQUASS NewsFlash, September 2008, Issue n°1 [http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/equass/newsflash/newsflash0908.pdf] accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the European Platform for Rehabilitation decided to create an additional quality assurance mark (EQUASS Assurance), alongside its EQRM mark (now renamed EQUASS Excellence).
In December 2008 the European Platform for Rehabilitation launched a two-year project, partially funded by the Progress programme of the [[European commission|European Commission]]. The aim of the project was to develop, with the collaboration of the major European stakeholders in social services, a European Quality Framework for Social Services of General interest (SSGI). The Framework would include quality principles and criteria for quality assurance validated for the whole sector, and operational performance indicators for measuring and benchmarking performance on the quality criteria in social services.&lt;ref&gt;Guus van Beek and Brigitte van Lierop, July - August 2009, "EQUASS: Europese kwaliteitscertificering in de sociale sector", ''Maandblad Re-integratie'', pages 12-15&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, the platform launched the results of the Common Quality Framework for SSGI,&lt;ref&gt;Common Quality Framework [http://cms.horus.be/files/99931/Newsletter/3-CEN-WSA-51-Common-Quality-Framework-SSGI.pdf], accessed on 28/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; including the certification of a few pilot sites in charge of testing the new quality system in various types of social services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epr.eu/index.php/equass/hidden-equass/24-hidden-equass/145-prometheus-project-newsletter Prometheus Project] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130918011716/http://www.epr.eu/index.php/equass/hidden-equass/24-hidden-equass/145-prometheus-project-newsletter |date=2013-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2012,&lt;ref&gt;EQUASS Annual Report 2012 [http://issuu.com/eprehab/docs/equass_annual_report_2012_final_eb3447696d3dd2] accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; EQUASS deployed its new quality standard, now available for all social service providers in Europe, and no longer limited to rehabilitation providers and other disability services providers. The new quality standard was then based on the results of the Common Quality Framework for SSGI, but also other quality standards, listed below.

== Main EQUASS characteristics ==

=== Compliance with the European quality requirements ===

Social services providers that meet the certification requirements for European Quality in Social Services have demonstrated their compliance with the following requirements:

- The Voluntary European Quality Framework for Social Services &lt;ref&gt;Social Protection Committee, October 2010, "A voluntary European Quality Framework for Social Services" [http://www.socialsecurity.fgov.be/eu/docs/agenda/26-27_10_10_spc_qf_document.pdf], accessed on 28/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the [http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=758&amp;langId=en Social Protection Committee] in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Karolina |last1=Krzystek |year=2012 |title=What is Quality in the Sector of Services Working with Homeless People? |journal=Homeless in Europe |pages=5–7 |url=https://www.feantsa.org/download/homeless_in_europe_spring_20121455348018833533690.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The Common Quality Framework for Social Services of General Interest &lt;ref&gt;Guus van Beek, "Common Quality Framework for Social Services of General Interest", June 2010, Brussels [http://cms.horus.be/files/99931/Newsletter/3-CEN-WSA-51-Common-Quality-Framework-SSGI.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (December 2010) in which 50 major stakeholders from various social services sectors agreed on the different components and pre-conditions of quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Guus |last1=van Beek |year=2012 |title=EQUASS: European Quality in Social Services and its Relevance for Homeless Services |journal=Homeless in Europe |pages=18–20 |url=https://www.feantsa.org/download/homeless_in_europe_spring_20121455348018833533690.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

- [[Vocational Education and Training]] institutions that fulfil the criteria for EQUASS also comply with the [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/lifelong_learning/c11108_en.htm European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for VET]&lt;ref&gt;European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for VET (now EQAVET): [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/lifelong_learning/c11108_en.htm], accessed on 28/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Council]] on 18 June 2009.

- The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (December 2006).

=== Principles of Quality ===

EQUASS is built on ten quality principles that reflect the wishes of its European stakeholders (funders, social partners, client representatives and advocacy groups),&lt;ref&gt;Guus Van Beek, December 2011, "Quality approaches in social services at the European Level" [http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/equass/EQUASS%202012/Paper_on%20_QUALITY_APPROACHES_IN%20SOCIAL_SERVICES.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; balancing business efficiency requirements, with a strong focus on protecting the rights of the clients, and a [[Person-centred planning|person-centred]] approach, while ensuring a professional development and training of the staff.

[[File:EQUASS Principles of Quality graph.jpg|thumb|Presentation of EQUASS Principles of Quality|framed|center]]

== EQUASS certification programmes ==

EQUASS certification offers a formal recognition of meeting the European quality requirements. EQUASS Assurance and EQUASS Excellence are based on the same Principles for Quality, with EQUASS Assurance being a stepping stone towards achieving the EQUASS Excellence level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jurij |last1=Švajger |date=June 2011 |title=Uvedba sistemov in orodij za obvladovanje kakovosti v zdravstveno organizacijo |trans-title=Introduction of quality systems and tools for quality management in a health organization |language=sl |journal=Slovensko združenje za kakovost in odličnost: Kakovost |url=http://szko.si/uploads/revija_kakovost/Q-2011-02.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality Assurance in Social Services (EQUASS Assurance) ===

EQUASS Assurance guarantees quality of service provision by certifying compliance with 50 criteria based on the ten Principles for Quality. It can be viewed as a fundamental requirement for operating social services, having a feasible threshold in terms of costs, efforts and resources required. An organisation that meets the EQUASS Assurance criteria is certified for a two-year period.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

=== Excellence in Social Services (EQUASS Excellence) ===

EQUASS Excellence is awarded to service providers that can demonstrate achievements and continuous improvement on all 50 criteria based on the ten Principles for Quality from three different perspectives: approach, deployment and results. An organisation that meets the EQUASS Excellence criteria is certified for a three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Guus |last1=van Beek |year=2012 |title=Qualidade e certificação - Qualificação dos serviços sociais |trans-title=Quality and certification - Qualification of social services |language=pt |journal=AFID Diferença Magazine |volume=10 |issue=16 |pages=10–4 |url=https://www.afid.pt/wp-content/uploads/afid_dif_16.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EQUASS stakeholders and supervision ==

EQUASS is supervised and supported by a network of external and internal stakeholders. The EQUASS Awarding Committee comprises key European actors in social services and EU politics.

=== EQUASS Awarding Committee ===

All awarding processes are supervised by the European Awarding Committee. The Committee includes many of the key European stakeholders in the sector such as service users, social partners, service providers, policy makers and funders:

In [[Norway]], EQUASS Assurance certification is one of several quality labels that allow a disability service provider or social firm to get funding from the [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration|Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV)]] in exchange for providing rehabilitation services.&lt;ref&gt;"EQUASS og erfaringene med kvalitetssikringsarbeidet til forhåndsgodkjente tiltaksbedrifter", Norwegian Ministry of Labour [http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ad/dok/nouer/2012/nou-2012-6/16/4.html?id=674741], accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of that endorsement, about 75% of the EQUASS Assurance certified organisations are located in Norway (as of 2013).

Founded in 1966 by French entrepreneurs, the '''Franco-Thai Chamber of Commerce (FTCC)''' is today one of the most dynamic European chambers in Thailand with over 315 members, with business interests in France and Thailand, and more than 60 events organized every year.

The FTCC is a non-profit organization affiliated to CCI France International, a strong network of 113 French bilateral Chambers in 83 Countries with 900 permanent staff and 27 000 members.

The FTCC offers a wide network, allowing entrepreneurs and companies to successfully approach the market and build longlasting trade relationships for efficient and fruitful business development. The Chamber is also working in collaboration with other trade-related French institutions such as the French Embassy, Economic and Commercial Department or the Foreign Trade Advisors (“''CCE''”).

The FTCC fourfold mission is:
* Serve its Member’s needs
* Promote bilateral trade between France and Thailand
* Help French companies &amp; entrepreneurs expand in Thailand
* Assist companies in their recruitment of French national

== Business Club ==

=== Events ===
With more than 50 events organized per year, the FTCC creates opportunities for companies to extend their professional network and to keep updated on the latest developments regarding the economy, legal issues, HR topics etc.

FTCC events are as varied as possible in order to address the needs of its different categories of Members. They range from monthly networking cocktails, Young Professional social evenings, seminars, committee workshops, special events (its prestigious Gala Dinner, "''Bonjour French Fair''", "''Bonjour Talents''": Brand&amp;Career Fair, etc.) to Business matchings ("''Forum Travailler Ensemble''") and Business delegations to neighboring countries.

=== Advocacy ===
The FTCC is active in defending the interests of its Members through its working Committees (Franco-Thai Relations, Human Resources, Legal Affairs, Luxury and Lifestyle, etc.). These allow Members from one sector to discuss issues of common interest. Position papers might be raised by the FTCC via a specific decision procedure or channeled to the European or International Investors' level in Thailand respectively through the EABC (European Association for Business and Commerce), the JFCCT (Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce in Thailand) or the BOT (Board of Trade) of which the FTCC is an active member. These institutions are well connected to the Thai authorities policy makers and key stakeholders.

For instance, the JFCCT represents 28 Thai-Foreign Chambers gathering 8,000 companies and the EABC represents 16 European trade organizations and currently features 9 working groups. To double this action, the FTCC's Franco-Thai relations committees regularly organizes high level meetings with Thai and French Officials (Board of Investment, Ministers, etc.) to voice the position of its Members.

== Business Support ==

=== Business Support to French companies (FR) ===
FTCC's Business Support department, in coordination with its wide network of partners in Thailand and in France, provides assistance to French companies in every step of their commercial development in Thailand:
* Market information and practical business advice (e.g. setting up a company in Thailand)
* Advice on imports &amp; exports: updated lists of French and Thai importers and exporters, Customs regulations, etc.
* Potential partners targeting (sales or sourcing) for prospecting French companies
* Trade missions (individual or collective) / business appointments arrangement
* Product/offer testing, commercial representation, participation to local [[trade fair]]s, adaptation of [[communication]] material to local context
* [[Domiciliation]] services (P.O. box and mail service, office space, …)
* Business Center (work station, conference room, language interpretation/ translation …)

=== HR Support ===
The FTCC in conjunction with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, offers a HR Support service. The FTCC assists French nationals in their job search through specific workshops, promotes French trainees for internships in Thailand, provides information on the local labor market and promotes job vacancies on the FTCC website. FTCC also provides HR related information, organizes workshops, and animates a dynamic HR Club for professionals wishing to debate on HR issues.

The FTCC Business Support (TH) department aims at helping Thai companies to develop business with France, in collaboration with French partners. This includes providing information (standards, regulations, distribution channels) to Thai companies aiming at developing exports or setting up company in France. The FTCC also provides assistance in organizing individual or collective trade mission, arranging programs of meetings in France, and organizing business study tours.

=== EU-funded Project ===
After the success of SCRIPT, the EU-funded project to certify Thai organic silk and Thai natural spa products and services, the FTCC has engaged in the new project called "''Policy Dialogues Support Facility (PDSF)''" to further advance Thailand's cooperation with the EU towards achievement of sustainable economic and social development goals and global integration.

The PDSF, started on 15 August 2013, will end on 15 February 2017. It is implemented by a consortium composed of GOPA Consultants, Development Solutions, Sustainable Development Association and the Franco-Thai Chamber of Commerce. The program of €3.75 million (THB 150 million) will provide support for activities of mutual benefit to Thailand and the European Union in areas such as trade and investment, higher education and science and technology, environment, climate change and good governance.

=== Promosalons ===
Since 1990, the FTCC, as a partner among the 56 offices of Promosalons around the world, has continuously assisted Thai exhibitors and visitors to attend French trade fairs. It promotes more than 10 fairs every year, in France and in Asia, covering various sectors ranging from food, fashion, home decoration, to heavy industries like composite material and environment. Promosalons has provided its services to an ever-growing number of 2,000 Thai visitors and exhibitors per year.

{{nihongo|'''Galápagos syndrome'''|ガラパゴス化|Garapagosu-ka|/ Galápagos effect}} is a term of Japanese origin, which refers to an isolated development branch of a globally available product. The term is used as an analogy to a part of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.  Darwin encountered in the [[Galápagos Islands]] isolated flora and fauna, which had undergone evolutionary changes independently from the mainland. This phenomenon was a key to the development of [[evolutionary theory]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Darwin stated that in the biological isolation species have evolved to develop different characteristics, allowing adaptation making them more viable in the local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles Darwin in Galapagos |publisher=Galapagos Islands |url = http://www.galapagosislands.com/galapagos-history/galapagos-charles-darwin.html|website = www.galapagosislands.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a development of goods "in relative isolation from the rest of the world because of a focus on the local market"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Because of "Galapagos syndrome," most of Japan’s cash machines are useless to foreigners|url = http://qz.com/411905/because-of-galapagos-syndrome-most-of-japans-cash-machines-are-useless-to-foreigners/|website = Quartz|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to similarly differing products.

The term "Galápagos syndrome" has been used as a [[metaphor]] outside the field of business jargon. The term "Galápagosization", referring to the process of the isolation of Japanese "Galápagos-thinking", links this process to the Japanese [[island mentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hugh Ashton "Japan’s Galapagos Effect" {{!}} ACCJ Journal (Journal of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan) on January 15, 2011|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/2013/10/07/galapagos/|website = ACCJ Journal, reproduced by kind permission of ACCJ at: Eurotechnology Japan KK|accessdate =2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is 'Galapagos-thinking' Japan back at its evolutionary dead end?|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2011/01/23/commentary/is-galapagos-thinking-japan-back-at-its-evolutionary-dead-end/#.VjevCK4vdE4|website = The Japan Times|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = island mentality - The Japan Times|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/island-mentality/|website = The Japan Times|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in Japan ==

=== Technology ===

==== Mobile phones ====
The term "Galápagos syndrome" was originally coined to refer to Japanese 3G [[mobile phones]], which had developed a large number of specialized [[Japanese mobile phone culture#Features|features]] that were widely adopted in the Japanese market, but were unsuccessful abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Jargon Watch |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/st_jw/ |quote=Galápagos syndrome n. The scourge of Japanese mobile companies, whose superadvanced 3G handsets won't work on foreign cell networks. It's named for the birds of the Galápagos, whose specialized beaks don't cut it on the mainland. |work=[[Wired magazine]] |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Devin Stewart]] |coauthors= |title=Slowing Japan's Galapagos Syndrome |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/devin-stewart/slowing-japans-galapagos_b_557446.html |quote='Galapagos syndrome', a phrase originally coined to describe Japanese cell phones that were so advanced they had little in common with devices used in the rest of the world, could potentially spread to other parts of society. Indeed signs suggest it is happening already. |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the original usage of the term was to describe highly advanced phones that were incompatible outside of Japanese networks, as the mobile phone industry underwent drastic changes globally, the term was used to emphasize the associated anxiety about how the development of Japanese mobile phones and those in the worldwide economy went along different paths. A derived term is {{nihongo|Gara-phone|ガラケー|gara-kei}}, blending with {{nihongo|"mobile phone"|携帯|keitai}}, used to refer to Japanese [[feature phone]]s, by contrast with newer [[smart phone]]s.
* "Japan's cellphones are like the endemic species that Darwin encountered on the Galápagos Islands—fantastically evolved and divergent from their mainland cousins—explains Takeshi Natsuno, professor at Tokyo's Keio University."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |first= Hiroko|last= Tabuchi|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Why Japan’s Cellphones Haven’t Gone Global  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/technology/20cell.html?em |quote=The Japanese have a name for their problem: Galápagos syndrome. Japan’s cellphones are like the endemic species that Darwin encountered on the Galápagos Islands—fantastically evolved and divergent from their mainland cousins—explains Takeshi Natsuno, who teaches at Tokyo's Keio University. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 19, 2009  |accessdate=2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Japanese phones suffer from 'Galapagos Syndrome'—are too complex to survive abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytechlog.com/tag/galapagos-syndrome |title=Galápagos syndrome |accessdate=2009-07-20 |quote= |publisher=The Daily Tech Log }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The term has since been used for similar phenomena in other markets.{{examples|date=August 2016}}

==== Cash machines ====
Across Japan, the majority of the 190,000 [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] do not accept bank and credit cards that have been issued outside of the country. Currently, only about 20,000 post offices and convenience stores allow retrieving cash using non-Japanese bank cards. Due to pressure from the Japanese government concerning this issue, by 2020 the number of ATMs that accept cards issued outside Japan is estimated to increase from 48,000 to 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ATMs in Japan|url = http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2208.html|website = www.japan-guide.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increasing numbers of international tourists in Japan, the country still attracts relatively few tourists according to the [[United Nations World Tourism Organization]], which ranked Japan 27th in the list of most visited countries 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Japanese Banks to Ease Tourists’ ATM Frustrations|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/japanese-banks-to-link-more-atms-to-global-grid-1426218340|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-02|issn = 0099-9660|first = Atsuko|last = Fukase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wallet phone ====
In 2004 the wallet phone was introduced in Japan as a means to allow [[mobile payment]] alongside numerous other applications. In some ways the wallet phone can be seen as a predecessor of mobile payment tools that were later released on the global market such as [[Apple Pay]] or [[Google Wallet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wallet phone Japan and the mobile payment ecosystem|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/store/walletphone/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete integration of multiple tools served to make the classical wallet redundant as the phone allows all types of payments, having train tickets or other everyday needs to be organized on the phone. In many ways the Japanese contactless infrastructure has been and is superior as compared to the current state in rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Apple Pay? No big deal in Japan where mobile payment is years ahead|url = http://www.themalaymailonline.com/tech-gadgets/article/apple-pay-no-big-deal-in-japan-where-mobile-payment-is-years-ahead|website = www.themalaymailonline.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Japanese car market ===

==== Kei cars (軽自動車) ====
[[Kei car|Kei Cars]] ("light cars") are small four-wheeled vehicles/cars that have an engine of less than 660cc and enjoy preferential treatment in the form of tax advantages and lower insurance cost. Originally the Japanese government encouraged the use of those "light cars". This category of cars features a number of different car types including sport cars, minivans and commercial vehicles. However, Kei cars are not seen as profitable in export markets and therefore are only part of the Japanese automobile market.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Chris (1995). ''Microcar Mania''. Minster Lovell &amp; New Yatt, Oxfordshire, UK: Bookmarque Publishing. {{ISBN|1-870519-18-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite no significant global success, major Japanese car manufacturers such as Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu and Honda still produce models belonging into the Kei car category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Galapagos effect – how can Japan capture global value?|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/insights/galapagos/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Kei car has a significant portion of Japanese car market, Japanese auto makers cannot ignore them.  Although the regulatory differences between Kei cars and 1L cars are quite small, the tax benefit of Kei cars is considerable. Until the tax reform in 2013, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate was a quarter of that of 1L cars (¥7200 to ¥29500). This significantly lower tax rate gathered much criticism from European and US auto makers, and as such the EU, the US and Toyota do not make Kei cars. In 2013, the Japanese government revised the vehicle tax law. The new vehicle tax law became effective in 2015. With new vehicle tax law, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate is about 36% of that of 1L cars (¥10800 to ¥29500).

== Handling the Japanese Galápagos syndrome ==
There are many associated issues with the inability to compete on the international export market. In order to revive the parts of the Japanese economy that have suffered from the "Galápagosization", affected businesses had to find the reasons responsible for the development.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Galápagosization of Japan continues. According to a survey released today, a shocking two-thirds of the country’s white-collar workers said they didn’t want to work abroad ... ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mariko | last = Sanchanta | title = Japan’s Workers: Please Don’t Send Me Abroad. Ever. | date = 2010-09-16 | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2010/09/16/japans-workers-please-dont-send-me-abroad-ever/ | work = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Reasons for the issue and associated implications for businesses ===
Furthermore, this has led a number of Japanese companies to adapt their business strategies. [[Hiroshi Mikitani]], CEO of e-commerce company [[Rakuten]], sees the exclusive use of Japanese in workplaces at the centre of the problem. Following his belief that "a language will open your eyes to the 'global', and you will break free from this conventional wisdom of a pure Japan",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hiroshi Mikitani|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/724b144e-b538-11e1-ad93-00144feabdc0.html|newspaper = Financial Times|access-date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0307-1766|first = David|last = Pilling}}&lt;/ref&gt; the co-founder and CEO of [[Rakuten]] made English the main language to be spoken in the company. Dr. Gerhard Fasol, the only European member of Euro Technology Japan's "Galapagos study group", stated that another reason for the non-success of some innovative Japanese products is Europe's conservative standpoint when it comes to certain standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan Galapagos effect. How to capture global value for Japan|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/2013/10/07/galapagos/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the belief that it will improve international competitiveness [[Tadashi Yanai]], the founder and president of [[Fast Retailing]], has decided to change the way the firm works against classical Japanese business methods. A shift of the production of some textiles out of Japan to Southeast Asia was a move to the low-wage-labour market, that aimed to enable to price compete on the international textile market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Globalisierung: Tabubruch|url = http://www.wiwo.de/erfolg/trends/globalisierung-tabubruch/6957128-2.html|website = www.wiwo.de|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor which [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] points out is the need for Japanese companies to adapt to stronger competition when entering global markets. This should be done by accepting to think in "new and unfamiliar ways about organization, marketing, and strategy", whilst the traditional practices that helped the companies to become a big player in the Japanese market shall be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan’s globalization imperative|url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/strategy/japans_globalization_imperative|website = www.mckinsey.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that companies have started to address the issue, which ''could'' have a link to the total value of exports increasing over the past five years, there are concerns about the future Galápagosization of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trade Statistics of Japan  Ministry of Finance|url = http://www.customs.go.jp/toukei/suii/html/nenbet_e.htm|website = www.customs.go.jp|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future threats ===
With the aging and shrinking Japanese population, the fact that fewer and fewer students study abroad to acquire a more internationally oriented university education is reason for concerns over the future of the Japanese economy. Furthermore, there is a conception that the younger generation could enhance the Galápagos effect due to a lack of interest in international education and work placements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who will look after Japan's elderly?|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-31901943|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = Mariko Oi BBC|last = News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiyoshi Takeuchi, sociology professor at the Sophia university, describes the young generation to have less "ambition and motivation" as a result from the fear that a wrong move could have negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Children fear that in a society with a widening gap between the rich and the poor, making a big mistake will prevent them from moving up in the world, which diminishes their ambition and motivation.|url = http://www.japantoday.com/category/quote-of-the-day/view/children-fear-that-in-a-society-with-a-widening-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-making-a-big-mistake-will-prevent-them-from-moving-up-in-the-world-which-diminishes-their-ambition-and-motivation|website = Japan Today|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term referring to instances outside Japan==

=== China ===
* Stephen Ezell and [[Robert D. Atkinson]] describe a similar phenomenon pointing out associated threats this could mean for the Chinese economy. The selling of a product in China could become more expensive for foreign producers due to the fact that they now have to incorporate the Chinese technology standards into their firm. In theory, this could be beneficial for domestic producers. However, this could also lead to an isolation of the respective domestic producers due to less international competitiveness. "China has made the development of indigenous technology standards ... a core component of its industrial development strategy. ... But, by using indigenous rather than global technology standards for ICT products, China risks engendering a 'Galapagos Island' effect that isolates Chinese ICT products, technologies, and markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Middle Kingdom Galapagos Island Syndrome: The Cul-De-Sac of Chinese Technology Standards {{!}} ITIF|url = https://itif.org/publications/2014/12/15/middle-kingdom-galapagos-island-syndrome-cul-de-sac-chinese-technology|website = itif.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese tech firms can avoid the Galapagos effect that got Japan{{!}}Chris Davis{{!}}chinadaily.com.cn|url = http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2014-12/17/content_19111144.htm|website = usa.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
* [[Mark Leonard (director)|Mark Leonard]] describes threats of how, against the predictions he made in 2005 in his book ''Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century'', the political development of the [[European Union]] happened isolated and differently than in any other political system in the world. "Europe might now be facing its own 'Galápagos moment.' ...  It may be that Europe’s postmodern order has become so advanced and particular to its environment that it is impossible for others to follow. It evolved in a protective ecosystem, shielded from the more muscular, "modern" world where most people live."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Europe’s Galápagos moment|url = http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_europes_galapagos_moment|website = www.ecfr.eu|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
* The United States was slow to adopt the [[EMV]] standard for credit and debit cards (as opposed to swiped [[magnetic stripe card]]s), which have been widely-adopted elsewhere, with merchants citing the cost of upgrading hardware and other systems to support it. Work to encourage transition began in 2015 following a series of high-profile retail data breaches involving credit card data. Payment providers implemented deadlines under which liability for fraud would shift to merchants if they did not begin accepting EMV payments by a specific date. As of April 2016, 70% of U.S. consumers had EMV cards, and around half of merchants were EMV compliant as of December 2016. However, the rollout has faced challenges, including merchants with EMV-compatible hardware that do not support EMV transactions due to a lack of certification or software support, and complaints that chip-based transactions took more time to process than swipe cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3182785/retail/is-the-rocky-road-to-emv-retail-adoption-getting-smoother.html|title=Is the rocky road to EMV retail adoption getting smoother?|first=Sharon|last=Goldman|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/in-2015-chip-cards-were-rare-in-the-us-three-years-later-slow-progress/|title=What happened after the US moved to chip-embedded payment cards?|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/717876/the-chip-card-transition-in-the-us-has-been-a-disaster/|title=The EMV chip credit card transition in the US has been a disaster|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/the-plan-to-make-chip-credit-cards-less-annoying|title=The Plan to Make Chip Credit Cards Less Annoying|date=2017-07-17|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|economics|date=November 2008}}
In [[economics]] the '''generalized-Ozaki cost''' is a general description of [[cost]] described by Shuichi Nakamura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shinichiro Nakamura |title=A Nonhomothetic Generalized Leontief Cost Function Based on Pooled Data |journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=72 |issue=4 |year=1990 |pages=649–656 |doi=10.2307/2109605 |jstor=2109605 |publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For output ''y'', at date ''t'' and a vector of ''m'' input prices ''p'', the generalized-Ozaki cost, ''c'', is

: &lt;math&gt;c(p,y,t) = \sum_i b_{ii} \left( y^{b_{yi}}e^{b_{ti}t} p_i + \sum_{j\,:\,j\neq i} b_{ij} \sqrt{p_ip_j} y^{b_y} e^{b_tt}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Discussion==

In [[econometrics]] it is often desirable to have a model of the [[cost]] of [[Manufacturing|production]] of a given output with given inputs&amp;mdash;or in common terms, what it will cost to produce some number of goods at prevailing prices, or given prevailing prices and a budget, how much can be made.  Generally there are two parts to a cost function, the [[fixed costs|fixed]] and [[variable costs]] involved in production.

The [[marginal cost]] is the change in the cost of production for a single unit. Most cost functions then take the price of the inputs and adjust for different factors of production, typically, technology, economies of scale, and elasticities of inputs.

Traditional cost functions include [[Cobb–Douglas]] and the [[constant elasticity of substitution]] models. These are still used because for a wide variety of activities, effects such as varying ability to substitute materials does not change. For example, for people running a bake sale, the ability to substitute one kind of chocolate chip for another will not vary over the number of cookies they can bake. However, as economies of scale and changes in substitution become important models that handle these effects become more useful, such as the [[transcendental log cost function]].

The traditional forms are economically [[Homothetic transformation|homothetic]]. This means they can be expressed as a function, and that function can be broken into an outer part and an inner part. The inner part will appear once as a term in the outer part, and the inner part will be [[monotonically increasing]], or to say it another way, it never goes down. However, empirically in the areas of trade and production, homoethetic and monolithic functional models do not accurately predict results. One example is in the gravity equation for trade, or how much will two countries trade with each other based on GDP and distance. This led researchers to explore non-homothetic models of production, to fit with a [[cross-sectional data|cross section]] analysis of producer behavior, for example, when producers would begin to minimize costs by switching inputs, or investing in increased production.

'''Intrinsic fraud''' is an intentionally false representation that goes to the heart of what a given lawsuit is about, in other words, whether fraud was used to procure the transaction.  (If the transaction was fraudulent, it probably does not have the legal status of a contract.)  Intrinsic fraud is distinguished from extrinsic fraud (a/k/a collateral fraud) which is a deceptive means of keeping a person from discovering and/or enforcing legal rights.  It is possible to have either intrinsic or extrinsic frauds, or both.

During a [[trial]], [[perjury]], [[forgery]], and [[bribery]] of a [[witness]] constitute [[fraud]]s that might have been relieved by the [[court]].  Such actions will usually lead to a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] being declared and after any penalties for the involved parties a new trial will take place on the same matter.

Two types of intrinsic fraud in contract law are ''fraud in the inducement'' and ''fraud in the factum''.

''Fraud in the factum'' is a [[law|legal]] defense, and occurs where A signs a contract, but either does not realize that it is a contract or does not understand the nature of the contract, because of some false information that B gave to A.  ''For example,'' if John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on handwriting analysis, and for his homework, he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed.  If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead "fraud in the factum."

''Fraud in the inducement'' is an [[equity (law)|equitable]] defense, and occurs when A signs a contract, knowing that it is a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the contract is about, but the reason A signed the contract was because of some false information that B gave to A.  ''For example,'' if John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, then John explains that the deed will be kept in a safe deposit box until she dies.  If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed prior to Mom's death, Mom can plead "fraud in the inducement."

'''John Galt''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ɔː|l|t}}; 2 May 1779 – 11 April 1839) was a Scottish [[novelist]], entrepreneur, and political and social commentator. Because he was the first [[novelist]] to deal with issues of the [[Industrial Revolution]], he has been called the first political novelist in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/arts/writingscotland/learning_journeys/reformers_and_radicals/|title=BBC Writing Scotland, Reformers and Radicals: A Man's a Man|accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first superintendent of the [[Canada Company]] (1826-1829) that had been formed to populate a part of what is now Southern [[Ontario]], then known as [[Upper Canada]], in the first half of the 19th century. The company was successful and its achievement was later called "the most important single attempt at settlement in Canadian history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waynecook.com/awellington.html |title=Wellington County |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011 |website=Historic Plaques |publisher=Wayne Cook |access-date=21 March 2017 |quote=Plaque #4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area, known as the [[Huron Tract]] on the eastern shore of [[Lake Huron]], was
{{convert|1100000|acres|km2}} in size and had been acquired from the Chippewa First Nation by the British government. The company surveyed and subdivided this massive area, built roads, mills, and schools and advertised it at affordable prices to buyers in Europe. The company then assisted in the migration of new settlers, bringing them to the area by means of a boat, which the company also owned. Initially settling in York ([[Toronto, Ontario]]) he selected what later became [[Guelph, Ontario]] as the company's headquarters, and began to develop a town there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= The Canada Company|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1698&amp;dat=18270809&amp;id=pTMhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lVcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4153,5119634|newspaper= [[Quebec Gazette]]|location= |date= August 9, 1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galt is also considered to be the founder of [[Goderich, Ontario]] with his colleague [[William "Tiger" Dunlop]]. In 1829, he was recalled to Great Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=3400 |title=John Galt |last=Hall |first=Roger |date=2010 |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for mismanagement of the Canada Company (particularly incompetent bookkeeping), and was later jailed for failing to pay his son's tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.guelphpl.ca/archives/famous_person.cfm?id=37 |title=John Galt |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011 |website=Guelph Archives |publisher=City of Guelph |access-date=22 March 2017 |quote=From Library and Archives Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galt's ''Autobiography'', published in London in 1833 includes a discussion of his life and work in Upper Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/JohnGaltd.1839.htm |title=John Galt |last=Bélanger |first=Claude |date=2005 |website=Marianopolis College |publisher=Marianopolis College |access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
    
He was the father of Sir [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]] of [[Montreal, Quebec]].

==Life==
Born in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], in Ayrshire, Galt was the son of a [[naval]] [[Captain (naval)|captain]] involved in the [[West Indies]] trade. He was a first cousin of [[Alexander Allan (ship-owner)|Captain Alexander Allan]]. His father moved to [[Greenock]] in 1780. The family visited regularly but did not permanently rejoin him until 1789. John was educated at Irvine Grammar School alongside [[Henry Eckford (shipbuilder)|Henry Eckford]], who was a lifetime friend, and [[William Spence (mathematician)|William Spence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Annals of the Parish: The Life of John Galt&lt;/ref&gt;

Galt spent a few months with the Greenock Custom House, at age 17, then became an apprentice and junior clerk under his uncle, Mr Ewing, also writing essays and stories for local journals in his spare time.  He moved to [[London]] in 1804 to join his father and seek his fortune. In 1809 he began studying [[law]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]].&lt;ref name="Can"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=3400|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography entry for John Galt|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/599/000104287/|title=Article detailing John Galt's literary works|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a subsequent trip to Europe, Galt met and befriended [[Lord Byron]] in [[Gibraltar]]. He traveled with Byron and his companion, [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton]] to [[Malta]]. He met them again in [[Greece]]. Parting company, Galt continued alone to [[Constantinople]], [[Adrianople]] and then [[Sofia|Sophia]]. He returned to Greenock via Ireland. He then embarked to [[London]] to pursue business plans, but these did not come to fruition and he took to writing. Galt wrote an account of his travels, which met with moderate success. Decades later, he would also publish the first full [[biography]] of Lord Byron. He also published the first biography of the painter [[Benjamin West]], ''The Life and Studies of Benjamin West'' (1816, expanded 1820).&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt;

In 1813, Galt attempted to establish a [[Gibraltar]]ian trading company, in order to circumvent [[Napoleon]]'s [[embargo]] on British trade; however, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s victory in Spain made this no longer necessary. Galt then returned to London and married Elizabeth Tilloch, daughter of [[Alexander Tilloch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Tilloch, Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three boys. In 1815, he became Secretary of the [[Royal Caledonian School|Royal Caledonian Asylum]] in London. He also privately consulted in several business ventures.&lt;ref name="Can"/&gt;

Galt started to submit articles to ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in late 1819, and in March 1829 he sent Blackwood the publishers the plan for "The Ayrshire legatees". 

Concentrating on his writing for the next several years, Galt lived at times in London, [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]] and elsewhere, writing fiction and a number of school texts under the [[pseudonym]] Reverend T. Clark. Around 1821 he moved his family from Greenock to Eskgrove near [[Musselburgh]]. In addition to moving his residence frequently during this period, Galt also switched publishers several times, moving from ''Blackwood's Magazine'' to Oliver and Boyd and then back again.&lt;ref name="Can" /&gt; In 1821 ''Annals of the parish'' was published as were two instalments of ''The steam boat'' and he started work on the novel ''Sir André Wylie''. ''Annals of the parish'' established Galt's reputation overnight. ''Sir Andrew Wylie'' was published in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5JLBCh6wZNTM4RF9cWtMwyt/john-galt|title=BBC Writing Scotland|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5JLBCh6wZNTM4RF9cWtMwyt/john-galt|title=John Galt|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC Writing Scotland|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Canada Company Office 1834.jpg|thumb|left|Canada Company Office 1834]]
In 1824, Galt was appointed Secretary of the [[Canada Company]], a charter company established to aid in the colonization of the [[Huron Tract]] in [[Upper Canada]] along the eastern shore of [[Lake Huron]].  After the company was incorporated by [[royal charter]] on August 19, 1826, Galt traveled across the [[Atlantic]] on the [[man-of-war]] HMS ''Romney'', arriving at [[New York City]] and then traveling by road. Sadly, soon after arriving, word was sent that his mother had suffered a stroke. He returned to her (in Musselburgh) in 1826 and she died a few months later. He returned to Canada in 1826. While in Canada, Galt lived in York in Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]), but located the headquarters of the Canada Company at [[Guelph]], a town he also founded in 1827.&lt;ref name="Can"/&gt; Later that year, he co-founded the town of [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]]&lt;ref name="Can"/&gt; with [[William "Tiger" Dunlop|Tiger Dunlop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.guelphpl.ca/archives/famous_person.cfm?id=80 |title=Dr. William "Tiger" Dunlop, "the Unforgettable and the Unforgotten" |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011 |website=Guelph Archives |publisher=City of Guelph |access-date=22 March 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323053257/https://www.guelphpl.ca/archives/famous_person.cfm?id=80 |archivedate=23 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The community of [[Galt, Ontario]] was named after him.

His three sons played prominent roles in [[Canadian politics]]; one of them, [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander]], later became one of the 'Fathers of the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]', and Canada's first [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name="Can"/&gt;

During his tenure with the Canada Company, Galt ran afoul of several colonial authorities, including [[Peregrine Maitland|Sir Peregrine Maitland]], who was [[Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Can"/&gt;  He was heavily criticised by his employers for his lack of basic accounting skills and failure to carry out their established policies. This resulted in his dismissal and recall to Great Britain in 1829.&lt;ref name="Can"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=3400 |title=John Galt |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2010 |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his return to Great Britain, he spent several months in [[King's Bench Prison]] for failure to pay debts.&lt;ref name="Can"/&gt; One of Galt's last novels, ''The Member'', has political corruption as its central theme.&lt;ref name="Can"/&gt;

In 1831 he moved to Barn Cottage in [[Old Brompton]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite failing health (following a trip over a tree root whilst in Canada), Galt was involved in another colonial business venture, the [[British American Land Company]], which was formed to develop lands in the [[Eastern Townships]] of [[Lower Canada]] (now [[Quebec]]). Galt served as secretary but was forced to resign in December 1832 because of his health.&lt;ref name="CanEncycl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000993|title=Canadian encyclopedia article on British American Land Company|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quebec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/JohnGaltd.1839.htm|title=Quebec historical article on John Galt|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage his spinal injury was not only crippling him but also affecting his speech and handwriting.

In 1834 he moved to [[Edinburgh]] following the publishing of his two-volume ''Autobiography'' in 1833. Galt here met the travel writer [[Harriet Pigott]]. Pigott persuaded Galt to edit her ''Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage''. She received some criticism for this as it was suspected that she was just taking advantage of Galt. However her unfinished biography of him which is in the [[Bodleian library]] implies that it was more of a mutual respect than her critics allowed. ''Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage'' had an introduction by Galt, and this three volume work was published in 1839.&lt;ref name=harriet&gt;Pam Perkins, ‘Pigott, Harriet (1775–1846)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22253, accessed 5 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired to his old home in Greenock in August 1834 following the departure of three of his sons to Canada. Finding the accommodation unsuitable he lived temporarily in [[Gourock]] before returning to a more comfortable house in December 1834. Galt died on 11 April 1839.&lt;ref name="LitCrit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/nineteenth-century-criticism/galt-john|title=E-notes literary criticism of John Galt|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried with his parents in the New Burying Ground in Greenock (now called the Old Burying Ground).

==Legacy==
In Greenock, John Galt is commemorated by the John Galt memorial fountain on the Esplanade, and by a plaque at the old cemetery where he is buried. Sheltered housing (for seniors) built next to the cemetery in 1988, on the site of the old Royal Hospital,  is named John Galt House in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hewitt | first1 = Regina | title = John Galt : observations and conjectures on literature, history, and society | year = 2012 | publisher = Bucknell University Press  | location = Lewisburg | isbn = 978-1-61148-434-2 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=-5GHwI1U99oC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22john+galt+house%22+greenock+1988&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NMINU6OvKsS50QWU6IGQBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20galt%20house%22%20greenock%201988&amp;f=false 33] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Galt, Ontario]] was named after John Galt, but was absorbed into [[Cambridge, Ontario]] in 1973. His original home in Guelph, known as the "Priory" (built 1827-1828), stood on the banks of the Speed River near the current [[River Run Centre]] for performing arts. The building later became the first CPR station in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shelley |first=Cameron |date=2 July 2016 |title=Historic Priory residence ended up as firewood |url=http://www.therecord.com/living-story/6757318-historic-priory-residence-ended-up-as-firewood/ | work=Waterloo Region Record |location=Kitchener |access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guelphpostcards.blogspot.ca/2013/03/the-priory.html |title=Guelph in postcards |last=Shelley |first=Cameron |date=6 March 2013 |website=Guelph |publisher=Cameron Shelley |access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kees Koolen''' (born 19 August 1965 in [[Bergeijk]], [[North Brabant]]) is a Dutch [[rally raid]] racer and businessman. Koolen participated in various rally raid competitions in a variety of vehicles. Koolen also was the CEO of [[Booking.com]].

==Business career==
Koolen studied technical business administration at the [[Twente University]]. Despite not graduating the university, started his own business as an advisor to different companies.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kees Koolen: ‘Ik ben altijd aan het werk, maar ik ben ook graag lui’|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/05/05/het-gaat-om-de-combinatie-talent-hard-werken-en-timing-maar-vooral-om-hard-werken-a1556816|website=NRC|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Koolen was an [[angel investor]] to different internet startups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kees Koolen|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=45977600&amp;privcapId=33254|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koolen was one of the founders of [[Booking.com]], a price comparison website for hotels. He sold the company in 2005 to [[Booking Holdings]] for 110 milion [[Euros]]. Koolen remained Booking.com's CEO until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oprichter: Verkoop van Booking.com aan Amerikanen is slecht geweest voor Nederland|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/het-verkopen-van-booking-com-aan-de-amerikanen-slecht-voor-nederland-geweest-stelt-de-oprichter/|website=Business Insider Nederland|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 his wealth was estimated at 115 million euro, making him 232nd wealthiest person in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kees Koolen|url=http://www.quotenet.nl/Miljonairs/Kees-Koolen|website=Quote|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Uber (company)|Uber]] placed their headquarters in [[Amsterdam]] Koolen was requested by [[Travis Kalanick]] as the companies COO. Simultaneously the Dutchman founded Agri Brasil, a conglomerate of large dairy farms.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt;

==Rally raid==
Koolen competed in his first [[Dakar Rally]] in [[2009 Dakar Rally|2009]]. Racing a [[Honda CRF series|Honda CRF450]] he finished 69th in the motorbike classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kees Koolen|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108041840/http://www.dakar.com:80/2009/DAK/RIDERS/us/equipage/125.html|website=Dakar|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2010 Dakar Rally]] Koolen and his team raced a [[McRae Enduro]] buggy. Koolen had a troubled third stage. He passed all check points but stranded on his way to the bivak and had to retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etappe 3: Revanche Verhoeven, ellende voor buggy's|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/1297261063/Etappe+3+Revanche+Verhoeven,+ellende+voor+buggys.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2011 Dakar Rally]] Koolen developed his own buggy to compete, the GoKoBra. The team entered two GoKoBra's, one for Koolen and one for teammate [[Jurgen van den Goorbergh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Een nieuw avontuur kan beginnen|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/148209952/Een+nieuw+avontuur+kan+beginnen.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koolen was disqualified after the sixth stage. Koolen finished the sixth stage outside the time limit but was given dispensation by the organisation. The organisation later the decided to disqualify Koolen because he missed the first check point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Omstreden besluit: ook Koolen uit Dakar Rally|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/148580932/Omstreden+besluit+ook+Koolen+uit+Dakar+Rally.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished the [[2012 Dakar Rally]] in 59th place.

Kees Koolen entered his first Dakar Rally with a quad in [[2013 Dakar Rally|2013]]. He again finished the Dakar Rally, in 17th place. In 2014 Koolen became the first participant to finish the Dakar Rally in all four classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KEES KOOLEN SCHRIJFT DAKAR-GESCHIEDENIS|url=http://www.eurol.com/nl/10-nieuws/518-nieuws/3848-kees-koolen-schrijft-dakar-geschiedenis.html|website=Eurol|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Koolen joined Van den Goorbergh and Gijs van Uden in a [[Ginaf]] truck entered by Maxxis Dakar Team Powered by Super B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No. 541 - Maxxis Dakar Team Powered by Super B|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229022155/http://www.dakar.com:80/dakar/2014/fr/pilote/541.html|website=Dakar|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished in 37th place.

For 2015 Koolen developed his own quad off-road racer. During the Dakar Rally Koolen was arrested by Chilean authorities. During the fifth stage Koolen deviated from the determined route and drove through a protected area. Koolen was released after questioning. Koolen was not the only participant racing through a protected area in the [[Atacama Desert]], [[Matteo Cassucio]] was also arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dakar-deelnemer Kees Koolen gearresteerd na omweg door archeologisch gebied|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/2227941093/Dakar-deelnemer+Kees+Koolen+gearresteerd+na+omweg+door+archeologisch+gebied.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following stage Koolen retired from the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Vogels op een keurige 20e plek en de uitslagen van de andere Brabanders in etappe 6|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/221782892/Hans+Vogels+op+een+keurige+20e+plek+en+de+uitslagen+van+de+andere+Brabanders+in+etappe+6.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2016 Koolen returned in his Honda quad with top ten stage results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dakar 2016: Argentijnse broederstrijd bij de quads, Kees Koolen weer in top 10|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/dakar/dakar-2016-argentijnse-broederstrijd-bij-de-quads-kees-koolen-weer-in-top-10/n/71106|website=Racexpress.nl|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not finish the Dakar Rally after stage nine. After his retirement an incident with a helicopter caused his quad (without rider) to drop fifty meters to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helikopter laat quad van Kees Koolen per ongeluk vallen van vijftig meter hoogte [VIDEO]|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/242801542/Helikopter+laat+quad+van+Kees+Koolen+per+ongeluk+vallen+van+vijftig+meter+hoogte+[VIDEO].aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Koolen and his team developed the [[Barren Racing|Barren Racer]] quad racer. With his self developed quad he scored his first stage win. He won the 219km stage between [[Tupiza]] and [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]]. The stage was shortened because of bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kees Koolen pakt etappezege in Dakar: 'Awesome!'|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/259830862/Kees+Koolen+pakt+etappezege+in+Dakar+Awesome!.aspx|website=Omroep Brabant|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koolen finished the Dakar Rally in seventeenth place in class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kees Koolen|url=https://www.dakar.com/en/competitor/254|website=Dakar|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mehmet Nejat Ferit Eczacıbaşı''' ({{IPA-tr|mehˌmet neˌʒat feˌɾit edʒzaːˌdʒɯbaˈʃɯ}}, known simply as Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı,  (January 5, 1913&amp;ndash;October 6, 1993), a second generation member of the notable [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Eczacıbaşı family]], was a [[chemist]], [[industrialist]], [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]].

He was the founder of [[Eczacıbaşı]], a prominent Turkish [[conglomerate (company)|industrial group]] with [[investment]]s in [[pharmaceuticals]], [[personal care]] products, [[consumer product]]s, [[building products]] and [[financial services]].

==Early life and education==
He was born on January 5, 1913 in [[Izmir]], [[Ottoman Empire]] to Süleyman Ferit Eczacıbaşı (1885&amp;ndash;April 18, 1973) and his wife Saffet Hanım as their first of seven sons, Vedat (1916&amp;ndash;1961),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/eczacibasinin-mezari-acilacak-2011-02-15.html |newspaper=EnSonHaber |title=Eczacıbaşı'nın mezarı açıldı |date=2011-02-15 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedat (1917&amp;ndash;ca. 1950), Kemal (1918&amp;ndash;1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gazetearsivi.milliyet.com.tr/Arsiv/1996/03/05 |newspaper=[[Milliyet]] |title=İlan |date=1996-03-05 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haluk (1921&amp;ndash;1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.24dakika.com/news_detail.php?id=38959 |publisher=4 Dakika |title=Tarihte bugün 6 Mayıs |date=2008-05-06 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melih (1923&amp;ndash;2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/ShowNew.aspx?id=260286 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Melih Eczacıbaşı toprağa verildi |date=3004-09-26 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Şakir (1929&amp;ndash;2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/ShowNew.aspx?id=13640195 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Şakir Eczacıbaşı’nın ardından |date=2010-01-31 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the first university-educated [[pharmacist]] in the city of Izmir, who, while working at a hospital in his home town, was appointed "chief pharmacist" ({{lang-tr|baş eczacı}}. The city council awarded him later in 1909 the honorific title "Eczacıbaşı" for his fruitful and successful work. Süleyman Ferit ran in later years his own pharmacy in İzmir. With the introduction of the [[Surname Law]] in 1934, Süleyman Ferit adopted his title "Eczacıbaşı" as family name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenthaber.com/ege/izmir/Kimdir/iz-birakan/suleyman-ferit-eczacibasi |publisher=Kent Haber İzmir |title=Süleyman Ferit Eczacıbaşı |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822133246/http://www.kenthaber.com/ege/izmir/Kimdir/iz-birakan/suleyman-ferit-eczacibasi |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pharmacy.ege.edu.tr/?p=diger&amp;id=10;4 |publisher=Ege Üniversitesi |title=Süleyman Ferit Eczacıbaşı Şifa Eczanesi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nejat Eczacıbaşı completed his primary and secondary education in İzmir. After finishing the high school at [[Robert College]] in Istanbul, he went on to study in [[chemistry]] at [[Heidelberg University]]. He made then his [[master's degree]] at [[Chicago University]] and his [[doctorate]] in 1937 at [[Berlin University]].&lt;ref name="e"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eczacibasi.com.tr/articles/detail/detail2.asp?id=344 |publisher=Eczacıbaşı Holding |title=Dr. Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı conducted post-doctoral scientific works on [[hormone]]s and [[vitamin]]s at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="tb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turkcebilgi.com/ansiklopedi/nejat_eczac%C4%B1ba%C5%9F%C4%B1 |publisher=Türkçe Bilgi |title=Nejat Eczacıbaşı |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies contributed to Eczacıbaşı's scientific, systematic and universal approach to life and business, and reinforced his belief that the right to private enterprise ought to be tempered by social responsibility. This belief was first put forward by his father, whose maxim was "give back to your country what you take from it.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

==Career==
After returning home, he settled in Istanbul, and started in 1942 with the production of vitamin drugs and [[baby food]] in a small laboratory. In 1952, he founded the country's first modern pharmaceutical plant.&lt;ref name="tb"/&gt;

Like his father, he sought to uphold the aspirations of Turkey's founding fathers by contributing to the development of Turkish industry. Between 1950 and 1990, he oversaw the expansion of the Eczacıbaşı Group's activities from pharmaceuticals to building materials, tissue paper, personal health care, capital markets, foreign trade and information technology. He became a leading industrialist in branches such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, consumer products, building products and financial services.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;

In every one of these business ventures, gis cardinal principle was contribution to "a healthier society".  Starting with his first business venture in the 1940s, Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı selected the most advanced technology available to manufacture products of international standards.

==Civic involvement and philanthropy==
In addition to contributing to the development of Turkish industry, Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı sought to promote and assist the development of his country's civil society. His activities in this area included the establishment of educational institutions, professional business organisations, research institutes, cultural foundations and scholarship funds.

In 1954, he helped to found the [[Istanbul University]]'s Institute of Business Administration, and the Turkish Management Association. In 1961, he established the Economic and Social Studies Conference Board, which would later become the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation, one of the country's first independent strategic research institutes.

Eczacıbaşı was the first president of the Turkish Educational Foundation, established in 1966 to provide scholarships for university and graduate students. He was also a member of the [[Middle East Technical University]]'s Board of Trustees during the 1960s and a member of the Board of Directors of the [[Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey|Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Institute]] in the 1970s. He was a principal founding member of the [[Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association]].

Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı used to say: "The meaning of life is best comprehended through the arts. The values which most exalt humankind are culture and the arts."

Throughout his life, he saw to it that every new business venture was complemented by an additional contribution to culture, science, arts and education.  Today, the Eczacıbaşı Group has become a unique symbol in Turkey of the bridge that can be forged between culture and private enterprise.

Eczacıbaşı was one of the principal founders of the Istanbul Foundation for Culture and the Arts, which was established in 1973 on the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Republic.  With the aim of transforming Istanbul into an "international capital of culture", the foundation initiated the annual International Istanbul Arts Festivals. Twenty years later, in recognition of the success of these festivals, [[UNESCO]] awarded the foundation the International Arts and Culture Trophy.

The "Dr. Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı Foundation", established by him in 1978, provides scholarships for talented musicians, annual cinema and graphic arts awards and grants to public schools and institutes for scientific research. It also publishes books by distinguished authors and is developing a collection of modern Turkish paintings. The [[Eczacıbaşı#Sport|Eczacibasi Sports Club]], established jointly by Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı and his brother Şakir Eczacıbaşı in 1966, has trained innumerable young athletes and won a significant number of national and international championships in [[volleyball]], [[basketball]] and [[table tennis]].

In all that he did, Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı endeavoured to improve the standard of life for future generations and had the satisfaction of seeing his life's achievements contribute to these high aspirations.

His memories of the early years of the [[Turkish Republic]] and of the growth of Turkish industry are recounted in his book "''Generation to Generation''" (1982). "''Experiences and Expectations''", published in 1994 soon after he died, recounts the lessons he drew from his unique experiences and the convictions that guided his life.

Nejat Eczacıbaşı used to say that "the real measure of private entrepreneurship is the success with which it increases the wealth of the community as a whole". Dr. Eczacıbaşı also sustained that lasting success requires hard work, risks and innovation. "Success comes not to those who choose the easy path, but to those who dare to embrace innovations and advances." Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı lived by these convictions.

==Personal life and death==
Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı married in 1946 to Fatma Beyhan (née Ergene) (1923–2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://webarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/2004/08/29/513405.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Beyhan Eczacıbaşı toprağa verildi |date=2004-08-29 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple has two sons, [[Bülent Eczacıbaşı|Bülent]] (1949) and Faruk (1954).&lt;ref name="tb"/&gt; Nejat F. Eczabaşıbaşı died on October 6, 1993 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA, he went there for [[cataract surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gazetearsivi.milliyet.com.tr/Nejat%20Eczacibasi/ |newspaper=[[Milliyet]] |title=Sanayiden yıldız kaydı |date=1993-10-07 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was transferred to Istanbul, and was interred at the [[Zincirlikuyu Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/printnews.aspx?DocID=253388 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Beyhan Eczacıbaşı’na son veda  |date=2004-08-30 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and accolades==
He was honored in 1974 by the [[Council of Europe]] for the successful [[Istanbul Festival]], he co-founded. In 1975 he was awarded with the "Medal of Honor" by the [[Turkish Red Crescent]], in 1976 with the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Order of Merit]] by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In 1983, the Turkish Chemistry Association honored him for his contribution to the industry.&lt;ref name="tb"/&gt;

'''Nikolay Aleksandrovich Alekseyev'''&lt;ref&gt;Spelled in contemporary English papers as ''Alexejeff'', ''Alexeieff''&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Николай Александрович Алексеев}}, 1852 –25  ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]] 13) March 1893) was the elected mayor of [[Moscow]] in 1885–1893. Alekseyev is credited with construction of the city's first [[sanitation]] system, the first pressurized [[water supply network]] reaching individual houses, a [[psychiatric hospital]] and 30 new public schools. Alekseyev reorganized the city finances, significantly increasing the share of [[non-tax revenue]] from city-owned commercial ventures, and was known for unorthodox and successful [[fundraising]] campaigns for the municipal charities. Alekseyev was a long-time sponsor of [[Moscow Conservatory]] and local musicians; during his tenure the city acquired the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].

Alekseyev was shot in his office by an insane visitor. He remains the only mayor of Moscow to be assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia]], killed in 1905, was an appointed military governor, not an elected mayor.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family roots===

Nikolay Alekseyev belonged to the fourth generation of an old and wealthy family of traders and industrialists that settled in Alekseyevskaya Street (no direct connection)&lt;ref&gt;The street is named after the parish church of St.Alexis, established in the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Tagansky District]] after the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Fire of 1812]]. The area was a traditional [[Old Believers]] community, however, Alekseyevs were mainstream [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. Their main asset in Moscow, a [[copper]] [[foundry]] with wire-making plant, was placed one block to the north from the family mansion. The family was connected through marriages to Tretyakov, Mamontov, Chetverikov business clans, the [[Sheremetev]]s&lt;ref name=R292&gt;Ruble 2001:292&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greek diaspora. A distant relative, Alexander Vasilyevich Alekseyev, has served as the mayor of Moscow in 1840–1841,&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; although then the mayor's role was far less significant than in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=SM234&gt;Orobey, Lobov 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Alekseyev's mother was an ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]]; [[Boris Chicherin]], mayor of Moscow in 1882–1885, said that "Alekseyev's character merged cunning and refinement of a Greek with the arrogance of a Russian" ({{lang-ru|Он соединил в себе хитрость и утонченность грека с разнузданностью русской натуры}}).&lt;ref name=SM245/&gt; Actor and theater director [[Constantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavsky]], also born Alekseyev, was Nikolay's cousin; he chose a different stage name to disassociate the family from his theatrical endeavours.

===Early years===

Nikolay was [[home schooling|home schooled]], spoke three foreign languages, but never attended university or received any formal qualification. Like his cousin Konstantin, he leaned to the performing arts, spending his youth in the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] musical circles. A close friend of [[Nikolai Grigoryevich Rubinstein|Nikolay Rubinstein]], Alekseyev co-financed [[Moscow Conservatory]]&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; and independent Moscow Opera&lt;ref name=R292/&gt; together with his older mentor [[Sergei Tretyakov (arts patron)|Sergei Tretyakov]] (mayor of Moscow in 1876&amp;ndash;1882) and frequently acted as a manager for musicians. At the same time, Alekseyev in his twenties managed the [[textile]] assets of the family and was responsible for retooling the factories with modern machinery and technologies.&lt;ref name=R292/&gt; His proactive, assertive attitudes were not always welcomed by Moscow elite; influential banker and [[philanthropist]], head of Moscow commodity exchange [[Nikolay Naidenov]] remained outspokenly hostile to Alekseyev throughout his life.&lt;ref name=R292/&gt;

This exposure to real-life business problems eventually led Alekseyev to seek public office. In 1880 he was elected to [[Moscow Governorate]] Duma, in 1881 to the Moscow City Duma; as the member of Duma he participated in various municipal activities from the school board to the coronation of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] (1883).&lt;ref name=R293&gt;Ruble 2001:293&lt;/ref&gt;

===1885 election===

The municipal election of 1885 was regulated by the City Statute of 1870. According to the law, all payers of [[property tax]] were eligible to vote; however, to dilute the share of small homeowners, the eligible voters were split into three unequal groups based on their tax assessment. In the 1880s these groups numbered 2&amp;ndash;3, 5&amp;ndash;6 and 12&amp;ndash;15 thousand voters&lt;ref name=SM238/&gt; for a population of 753 thousand.&lt;ref&gt;1882 census figures; population grew at 2.5% p.a. &amp;mdash; Orobey, Lobov 29&lt;/ref&gt; Each group elected 60 representatives to the City Duma. 180 members of the Duma elected the Mayor who, [[ex officio]], presided over the Duma sessions.&lt;ref name=SM238&gt;Orobey, Lobov 238&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boris Chicherin]] described the members of the Duma as "absent nobles, indifferent merchants and arrogant democracy".&lt;ref name=SM239&gt;Orobey, Lobov 239&lt;/ref&gt; The latter group consisted of uneducated petty traders, laborers and farmers, and was known as the [[Black Hundreds|black hundred]].&lt;ref name=SM239/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term ''black hundred'' re-emerged as the umbrella for ultra-right movements later, around 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Savvy beyond reasonable limit, the ''black hundred'' regularly blocked legitimate municipal projects as too expensive or unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;The situation was "improved" in 1892 with the law which imposed a tax minimum for eligibility.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of candidates at the Duma election was unlimited; [[election by list]] voting with [[Blackballing|black and white balls]] was time-consuming, causing voter absenteeism. Contemporaries estimated that only 3 to 6% of less than 20 thousand eligible voters showed up at the 1880 elections.&lt;ref name=SM239&gt;Orobey, Lobov 239&lt;/ref&gt; Politics were dominated by around 300 wealthy families, many of them parts of historical business clans.&lt;ref&gt;Brumfield et al. 2001:66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, Alekseyev, then only 32 years old, succeeded in bringing the sleeper voters to the elections, thus reducing the weight of ''black hundred'' and easily winning the mayoral ballot in November. He succeeded in shaping up a loyal majority coalition; balancing between a strongman administration and continuous mediation of the rivalling clans, Alekseyev managed to maintain support for his initiatives in the Duma and among the business circles.&lt;ref name=R294&gt;Ruble 2001:294&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moscow, Water Towers, Max Hoeppener, 1890s.jpg|thumb|right|Two water towers, erected in 1892, provided pressure for the new water supply. They were demolished in the 1930s to make way for the expansion of [[Mira Avenue|Prospekt Mira]].]]

===Municipal projects===

Alekseyev started his tenure with the controversial shutdown of the Upper Trade Rows on the [[Red Square]]. The building, erected in 1815 by [[Joseph Bove]], was torn down in 1889 and replaced with the [[Main Department Store|new Upper Trade Rows]], designed by [[Alexander Pomerantsev]], in 1890&amp;ndash;1893. In 1890 he launched construction of a [[Moscow City Hall|new Duma building]] on the nearby Voskresenskaya Square; the project was criticized for its outward [[Russian Revival|pseudo-Russian]] style and cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;Orobey, Lobov 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow of 1885 had no [[sanitation]] and no [[water supply network]] in present sense: water flowed from [[Mytishchi]] in the open trench of the [[Rostokino Aqueduct]] and was distributed to a limited number of [[fountain]]s on the central squares. In the 1870s the city built three local water networks of inadequate capacity that were abandoned by 1885. After long disputes between supporters of municipal and private water supply, in 1888 the city settled on building a single pressurized water system.&lt;ref name=SM267&gt;Orobey, Lobov 267&lt;/ref&gt; Key element of the system – two tower-like water reservoirs near present-day [[Rizhsky Rail Terminal]] – were partially financed with Alekseyev's personal funds.&lt;ref name=SM245/&gt; The main distribution pipeline, 108 [[verst]]s long, was completed during Alekseyev's tenure in 1892. In 1896 the system reached individual houses along the Garden Ring and in 1912 the city was able to require mandatory hookup to running water for all new buildings within the city limits.&lt;ref name=SM268&gt;Orobey, Lobov 268&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886&amp;ndash;1889 Alekseyev sponsored detailed feasibility study of various [[sewage]] system layout. The modular plan, adopted in 1889, divided the city into practically independent parts (central and peripheral), making a provision for subsequent expansion of the city. The project was delayed by budget constraints; in 1892 the city raised money through a 49-year loan. The first 37 [[verst]]s of large-bore sewage pipes were operational in 1894, half a year since Alekseyev's death; by the end of 1895 half of the system was complete and the city laid out its first [[sewage treatment]] facility.

Alekseyev supervised construction of a large municipal [[slaughterhouse]] placed beyond the city limits (present-day Mikoyan meat-processing plant); with its completion all inner city slaughterhouses were shut down.

Alekseyev, personally attached to the fate of the [[Mental disorder|mentally sick]], called for construction of a new [[psychiatric hospital]] in 1889; existing psychiatric hospital in [[Preobrazhenskaya hospital|Preobrazhenskoe]], built before the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|war of 1812]], was inadequate for the growing city. Alekseyev personally rallied wealthy muscovites for donations, his fundraising antics became a source of anecdotes.&lt;ref name=R294a&gt;Ruble 2001:294, 306–307 provides bibliography of English versions of these fundraising-related anecdotes. Amounts of money and personalities of Alekseyev's opponents vary; all these stories revolve around successful fundraising bordering with [[extortion]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he raised enough money to finance the first stage of the hospital which opened in 1894. Contemporary studies of Moscow charities assert that Alekseyev's efforts radically changed the pattern of business donations to the charities; they became a standard of business practice and continued to grow for two decades after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Brumfield et al. 2001:96&lt;/ref&gt;

In seven and half years of Alekseyev's tenure Moscow acquired 30 new schools, its first [[asphalt]] pavement, first permanent electrical power plant (1888),&lt;ref&gt;The first powerplant, built for the coronation of Alexander III in 1883, was not intended for continuous operation.&lt;/ref&gt; unified tram system (1891)&lt;ref&gt;In 1891 two existing horse tram networks were united under a common management &amp;mdash; Orobey, Lobov 278&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] (1892).

===Municipal finance===

Alekseyev's projects unbalanced the city budget, which operated at a significant deficit throughout the 1880s. He responded with investments into revenue-generating municipal enterprises. 1888, the year when the new central slaughterhouse became operational, is considered a breakthrough year: the city acquired its first large profitable asset. Income from city enterprises grew slowly but surely and by 1913 accounted for 55% of the city revenue.&lt;ref name=R345&gt;Orobey, Lobov 254, 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Constrained with political connections, Alekseyev was reluctant to increase taxes; property taxes grew proportionate to city expansion, while the business tax rates decreased (collection remained at the same nominal amount despite rapid growth of the economy).

The city arranged for its first public loan in 1882; in 1886 Alekseyev diverted the proceeds to build the municipal slaughterhouse. He was reluctant to borrow more due to the Duma opposition against loans; the first major loan of this tenure was approved in 1892 to finance sewage system.

===Relations with the Jews===

[[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia]], appointed Governor of Moscow in February 1891, initiated a royal order for deportation of [[Jews]] from the city into the [[Pale of Settlement]]. The decree directly affected nearly half of estimated 20 thousands Moscow Jews, even including retired soldiers. According to the Western sources, Alekseyev supported the deportation and provided the city resources to the police action managed by the Grand Duke. The operation continued at the time of Alekseyev's death and installed "an eternal hatred for him among the Russian-Jewish diaspora."&lt;ref name=R294/&gt; S. M. Dubnow, author of "History of Jews in Poland and Russia" (1918) even branded Alekseyev "an ignorant merchant with a shady reputation", and alleged that his efforts were motivated by rivalry with Jewish banker [[Lazar Polyakov]] (incorrectly described as the owner of a "rural bank").&lt;ref&gt;Dubnow ch.XXIX.2&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, Alekseyev sided with prime minister [[Sergei Witte|Witte]] in his campaign in support of [[Bukharan Jews]]. This may be explained by long-standing ties between Moscow textile industry and the Central Asian [[cotton]] traders (including Bukharan Jews).&lt;ref name=R295&gt;Ruble, 2001:295&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===

March 21 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]] 9), 1893, a man named Andrianov fatally shot the mayor in his City Hall study. Early reports called the shooter a [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]],&lt;ref&gt;This version was reproduced in British and American newspapers on March 22–23, 1893 (e.g. [[Hartford Courant]], March 22)&lt;/ref&gt; but he was later attested to be insane.&lt;ref name=SM245/&gt; After four days of agony, Alekseyev died on March 25 (OS 13). Shortly before his death he instructed his wife to pledge 300,000 roubles of their personal wealth to the completion of the psychiatric hospital; the wish was fulfilled, and the hospital, inaugurated in 1894, was named in Alekseyev's honour.&lt;ref&gt;In 1922 the hospital was renamed after psychiatrist [[Pyotr Kashchenko]]. The original name, ''N. A. Alekseyev First Psychiatric Hospital'', was restored in 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral at [[Novospassky Monastery]] cemetery was attended by 200 thousand mourners.&lt;ref name=SM245&gt;Orobey, Lobov 245&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery was destroyed in the 1930s, and the site of his grave was lost.

Alekseyev's achievements and charismatic personality became a yardstick for evaluation of municipal officers until [[World War I]]. His immediate successor, Konstantin Rukavishnikov, completed the projects launched by Alekseyev and got rid of the [[budget deficit]], but lost the 1897 reelection to the public opinion of "not matching his too splendid forerunner".&lt;ref name=SM245/&gt;

The city remained divided into pro-Alekseyev and anti-Alekseyev factions; his memories were frequently invoked by politicians for support of their own and for denigration of their opponents' initiatives.&lt;ref name=R295/&gt;

'''Paul Isenberg''' (April 15, 1837 – January 16, 1903) was a [[German people|German]] businessman who developed the [[sugarcane]] business in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].

==Life==
Paul Heinrich Friedrich Carl Isenberg was born April 15, 1837 in [[Dransfeld]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite web |title= Finding Aid for Isenberg Collection |work= Kaua’i Historical Society |year= 2010 |author=Marylou Bradley and Carolyn Dettling |url= http://www.kauaihistoricalsociety.org/assets/finding_aids/ms_57_isenberg_collection.pdf |accessdate= September 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister Daniel Isenberg (1807–1875), and mother was Dorothea (Strauch) Isenberg (1808–1871).
He came to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1858, and became known as Paul Isenberg.

Isenberg moved to the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] and first worked in [[Wailua, Kauai|Wailua]]. 
In October 1861 he married Hannah "Maria" Rice, daughter of [[William Harrison Rice]], who was born February 17, 1842, and died April 7, 1867.
They had two children, Mary Dorothea Rice Isenberg (1862–1949) and Daniel Paul Rice Isenberg (1866–1919) known as "Paul Jr."
He traveled back to Germany in 1869 where he married Beta Margarete Glade (born 1846) before returning to Hawaii. They had six more children:  Johannes "John" Carl Isenberg (born September 12, 1870), Heinrich Alexander Isenberg (born January 17, 1872), Julie Maria Pauline (Isenberg) Barckhausen (born November 1876), Clara Margarete (Isenberg) Wendroth (born 1878), Richard Menno Isenberg (born 1880) and Paula Bertha Johanna Isenberg (born 1883).&lt;ref name="adv"/&gt;

Isenberg took over managing the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] at [[Lihue, Hawaii|Līhuʻe]] in 1862, after the death of his father-in-law who was previous manager.
The plantation was founded by diplomat [[Henry A. Peirce]], but struggled to make a profit until Rice built an irrigation system.
Isenberg made improvements to the [[cane sugar mill]] such as using an evaporating pan and steam pipes to concentrate the cane juice.
In 1872 the Lihue Plantation company was officially incorporated, and the {{convert |3300|acre}} expanded by {{convert |17000|acre}} at [[Hanamaulu, Hawaii|Hanamāʻulu]].&lt;ref name="lihue"&gt;{{cite web |title= Finding Aid for Lihue Plantation Collection |work= Kaua’i Historical Society |year= 2009 |author= Marylou Bradley |url= http://www.kauaihistoricalsociety.org/assets/finding_aids/ms45_lihue_plantation_finding_aid.pdf |accessdate= September 24, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726213834/http://www.kauaihistoricalsociety.org/assets/finding_aids/ms45_lihue_plantation_finding_aid.pdf |archivedate= July 26, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 24, 1874 he was appointed to the upper House of Nobles in the [[legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] by King [[Lunalilo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH5b09/3945a7b2.dir/Isenberg,%20Paul%20Daniel%20Rice%20I.jpg |title= Isenberg, Daniel Paul Rice I office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= September 24, 2010 }} Note name not accurate&lt;/ref&gt;
He officially became a citizen of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Citizenship - Naturalization: page 51 Ieatmann - Ives |D29-000052 |q=Isenberg |dic=gene |accessdate= September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1877 he bought equipment for a new mill from [[George Norton Wilcox]] and installed it at Hanamāʻulu to be managed by [[Albert Spencer Wilcox]].&lt;ref name="lihue"/&gt;

In 1878 Isenberg retired as plantation manager, but kept an ownership interest while moving his family back to [[Bremen]] in Germany. He visited the islands at least every two years for legislative sessions. His brother Carl Isenberg then managed the plantation.
In 1881 Isenberg became a business partner with earlier German merchant Heinrich Hackfeld in his Hackfeld &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="adv"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher= [[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |editor= George F. Nellist |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/bios/isenberg34bs.txt |chapter= Isenberg, Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although most other plantation laborers were Chinese or Japanese, Isenberg arranged for groups of workers from Bremen to settle on his company's plantations.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1874-1893, the Kalakaua Dynasty |author= [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall]] |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom3&amp;l=en |volume=3 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 1967 |isbn= 978-0-87022-433-1 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|134–135}}
In the 1887 session of the legislature, he was one of the few who objected to the threat of military force that caused the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] to be called the "Bayonet Constitution".&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|361–362}}

He died in Bremen on January 16, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Paul Isenberg Dies at Bremen, in the 66th Year of his Age |newspaper= Hawaiian Gazette |location= Honolulu |date= January 20, 1903 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1903-01-20/ed-1/seq-6/ |accessdate= September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Big Five Hawaii}}
Hackfeld &amp; Company grew to be one of the "[[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]]" corporations that dominated the economy of the [[Territory of Hawaii]].
During [[World War I]], Hackfeld &amp; Company was seized by the U.S. government [[Alien Property Custodian]] along with other assets owned by Germans. It was sold to a consortium of Hawaii businessmen in 1918, who changed the name to "American Factors" and the company's store [[Liberty House (US)|Liberty House]]. A 1920 lawsuit argued the price was below market value, and some former stockholders including John Carl Isenberg recovered some damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl= 10524/462 |title= German Sugar's Sticky Fingers |journal= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |volume= 16 |author= Frederick Bernays Wiener |year= 1982 |pages= 15–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1966, the name was further shortened to [[Amfac, Inc.]]

His son Paul Jr. married Annie Beatrice McBryde, daughter of neighboring sugar planter Duncan McBryde on October 19, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Oahu (1832-1910) marriage record |D09-000108 |q=Isenberg |dic=gene |accessdate= September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 1891  [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] appointed him to the [[Privy Council]]. From 1898 to 1915 he was elected as representative to the house of representatives of the [[Territory of Hawaii]], and from 1902 to 1905 the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHc539/62b67ce7.dir/Isenberg,%20Daniel%20Paul%20Rice%20II.jpg |title= Isenberg, Daniel Paul Rice (II) office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He married Bertha Koepke on August 9, 1916, and they had one child, Dorothea "Dora" Jane Isenberg  (1917–1988), who married Joseph Cole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher= [[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |editor= George F. Nellist |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/bios/isenberg33bs.txt |chapter= Isenberg, Daniel Paul Rice }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cole was first manager of the [[Kauai Museum|Kaua{{okina}}i Museum]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kauaʻi Museum |work= official web site |url= http://www.kauaimuseum.org/ |accessdate= October 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1887 his younger brother Johannes Friedrich Wilhelm "Hans" Isenberg (1855–1918) was brought in to be pastor of the first Lutheran church on the island for the immigrants who starting arriving in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Our History &amp; Heritage |work= official web page |publisher= Lihue Lutheran Church |url= http://www.lihuelutheran.com/ |accessdate= September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hans had married his own niece, Paul's first child, Mary Dorothea Rice Isenberg, known as Dora, in 1883.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt;

'''Planka.nu''' is a network of organizations in [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] promoting [[tax]]-financed [[zero-fare public transport]] with chapters in [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Skåne]], [[Östergötland]] and [[Oslo]].&lt;ref name="planka-om"&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
In 2001, the Stockholm chapter of the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation ({{lang-sv|SUF, Syndikalistiska Ungdomsförbundet}}) launched the campaign Planka.nu (literally, ''fare-dodge.now'') as a reaction to a rise in ticket prices by the [[Stockholm County Council]].&lt;ref name="planka-om"/&gt; The domain name [[.nu]], which belongs to the
{{convert|260|km²|adj=on}} island of [[Niue]] but is sold primarily to foreigners, was chosen because it means "now" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The standard [[top level domain]] for Sweden is [[.se]].
 
With growing membership and interest, the campaign was detached from the SUF to form an independent organization. Local organizations have since started up in [[Gothenburg]] in 2003, [[Östergötland]] in 2005 and [[Skåne]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=planka-om /&gt; A sister organization, ''pumm.it'' has been created in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="pummit"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, Planka.nu released [http://freepublictransports.com Freepublictransports.com], a global forum for the free public transport movement.  

Ticket fares in Stockholm have increased dramatically over time. By one measure&amp;mdash;single ticket price for a {{convert|10|km|adj=on}} journey&amp;mdash;Stockholm has the most expensive-to-use public transport in the world, as of March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14396066 |title=A fare price?| publisher=[[The Economist]]| date=September 24, 2009| accessdate=2009-09-24| quote=In Stockholm it costs $4.88 for a single journey of 10km on public transport, the highest cost in a study of 73 cities by [[UBS AG|UBS]], a Swiss bank.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{see also|Free public transport#Criticism}}
Planka.nu and its organizers have seen substantial criticism, primarily by politicians and transportation companies in each city. The network has been reported to the police for [[incitement]] by [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]] (SL),&lt;ref name="dn-hermele"&gt;{{cite web

Many critics believe that [[fare evasion]] leads to reduced funds and higher costs for public transport, which must be offset by higher prices for those who do pay their fares.&lt;ref name=gp-nystrom /&gt;&lt;ref name="dn-palmgren"&gt;{{citation

'''Romero Rodrigues Filho''' ([[São Paulo]], October 1, 1977) is a Brazilian businessman who studied Electric Engineering at the [[Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo]]. He was a founder and president of [[BuscaPé]] (www.buscape.com), a Group that also includes the companies [[Bondfaro]], Confiômetro, CortaContas, e-Behavior, [[e-bit]], Lomadee, Pagamento Digital, FControl, Pista Certa, [[QueBarato!]] and SaveMe. At the age of 21, Romero created BuscaPé with three partners also from the University: Ronaldo Takahashi, Rodrigo Borges and Mário Letelier.

In 2009, BuscaPé was sold to the South African company Naspers for US$ 342 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Career==
Rodrigues entered the Escola Politécnica of the Universidade de São Paulo in 1995, when he was 18 years old. After his primary and secondary studies at the Colégio Visconde de Porto Seguro, in Morumbi, São Paulo, he entered the Electric Engineering course. Between 1996 and 2000, Romero worked as a researcher, as part of professional practice at the “Laboratório de Arquitetura e Redes de Computadores” (LARC) of the Poli USP, taking part in projects such as the development of Internet 2 in Brazil (RMAV), Data Base, Security and Monitoring of links. In 1998, Romero and three friends from the University, Ronaldo Takahashi, Rodrigo Borges and Mário Letelier, founded BuscaPé.

==Leadership of BuscaPé==
The first idea of what became BuscaPé surged when Rodrigo Borges was looking for a printer model on the Internet. He could not find information on the price or technical specifications of the product online. Therefore, the four friends concluded that it was an opportunity to be explored and decided to create a business that could provide a solution for that need. With investments of R$ 100 from each monthly to pay for hosting, system development and layout, the four founded BuscaPé in the “garage company” style in 1998. Romero assumed leadership of the project from the beginning, acting as president of BuscaPé. The businessman also led the process of internationalization and expansion of BuscaPé, and its sale of the company to Naspers in 2009.

{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}
[[Image:Snowflake-schema.png|350px|thumb|The snowflake schema is a variation of the star schema, featuring normalization of dimension tables.]]
In [[computing]], a '''snowflake schema''' is a [[Logical schema|logical arrangement]] of tables in a [[multidimensional database]] such that the [[Entity-relationship model|entity relationship]] diagram resembles a [[snowflake]]  shape. The snowflake schema is represented by centralized [[fact table]]s which are connected to multiple [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}.  "Snowflaking" is a method of normalizing the dimension tables in a [[star schema]]. When it is completely normalized along all the dimension tables, the resultant structure resembles a snowflake with the [[fact table]] in the middle. The principle behind snowflaking is normalization of the dimension tables by removing low cardinality attributes and forming separate tables.&lt;ref&gt;Paulraj Ponniah. ''Data Warehousing Fundamentals for IT Professionals.'' Wiley, 2010, pp. 29–32. {{ISBN|0470462078}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The snowflake schema is similar to the star schema. However, in the snowflake schema, dimensions are [[Normalization (database)|normalized]] into multiple related tables, whereas the star schema's dimensions are denormalized with each dimension represented by a single table. A complex snowflake shape emerges when the dimensions of a snowflake schema are elaborate, having multiple levels of relationships, and the child tables have multiple parent tables ("forks in the road").

== Common uses ==
Star and snowflake schemas are most commonly found in dimensional [[data warehouse]]s and [[data mart]]s where speed of data retrieval is more important than the efficiency of data manipulations. As such, the tables in these schemas are not normalized much, and are frequently designed at a level of normalization short of [[third normal form]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Data normalization and storage ==
[[Database normalization|Normalization]] splits up data to avoid redundancy (duplication) by moving commonly repeating groups of data into new tables. Normalization therefore tends to increase the number of tables that need to be joined in order to perform a given query, but reduces the space required to hold the data and the number of places where it needs to be updated if the data changes.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

From a space storage point of view, dimensional tables are typically small compared to fact tables. This often negates the potential storage-space benefits of the star schema as compared to the snowflake schema. Example: One million sales transactions in 300 shops in 220 countries would result in 1,000,300 records in a star schema (1,000,000 records in the fact table and 300 records in the dimensional table where each country would be listed explicitly for each shop in that country). A more normalized snowflake schema with country keys referring to a country table would consist of the same 1,000,000 record fact table, a 300 record shop table with references to a country table with 220 records. In this case, the star schema, although further denormalized, would only reduce the number or records by a (negligible) factor of ~0.9998 (=[1,000,000+300] divided by [1,000,000+300+220])

Some database developers compromise by creating an underlying snowflake schema with [[View (database)|views]] built on top of it that perform many of the necessary joins to simulate a star schema. This provides the storage benefits achieved through the normalization of dimensions with the ease of querying that the star schema provides. The tradeoff is that requiring the server to perform the underlying joins automatically can result in a performance hit when querying as well as extra joins to tables that may not be necessary to fulfill certain queries.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Benefits ==
The snowflake schema is in the same family as the [[star schema]] logical model. In fact, the [[star schema]] is considered a special case of the snowflake schema. The snowflake schema provides some advantages over the [[star schema]] in certain situations, including:

* Some [[OLAP]] multidimensional database modeling tools are optimized for snowflake schemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings09/103-2009.pdf |title=Using SAS® OLAP Server for a ROLAP Scenario|first=Michelle|last=Wilkie|work=SAS Global Forum 2009|date=2009|accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Database normalization|Normalizing]] attributes results in storage savings, the tradeoff being additional complexity in source query joins.

== Disadvantages ==
The primary disadvantage of the snowflake schema is that the additional levels of attribute normalization adds complexity to source query joins, when compared to the [[star schema]].

Snowflake schemas, in contrast to flat single table dimensions, have been heavily criticised. Their goal is assumed to be an efficient and compact storage of normalised data but this is at the significant cost of poor performance when browsing the joins required in this dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

|quote = Do not snowflake your dimensions, even if they are large
|pages = 95–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disadvantage may have reduced in the years since it was first recognized, owing to better query performance within the browsing tools.

When compared to a highly [[Database normalization|normalized]] transactional schema, the snowflake schema's [[denormalization]] removes the data integrity assurances provided by normalized schemas. {{citation needed|date=August 2014|reason=This comment is pretty much the antithesis of most critiques of snowflakes (normalized) vs. unrolled and denormalized single table dimensions, as favored by Kimball.}} Data loads into the snowflake schema must be highly controlled and managed to avoid update and insert anomalies.

== Examples ==
[[Image:Snowflake-schema-example.png|300px|thumb|right|Snowflake schema used by example query.]]

The example schema shown to the right is a snowflaked version of the star schema example provided in the [[star schema]] article.

The following example query is the snowflake schema equivalent of the star schema example code which returns the total number of units sold by brand and by country for 1997. Notice that the snowflake schema query requires many more joins than the star schema version in order to fulfill even a simple query. The benefit of using the snowflake schema in this example is that the storage requirements are lower since the snowflake schema eliminates many duplicate values from the dimensions themselves.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''Sociaal-Economische Raad''' (English: Social and Economic Council; SER) is a major economic advisory council to the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]]. Formally it heads a [[Publiekrechtelijke Bedrijfsorganisatie|system of sector-based regulatory organizations]]. It represents the [[social partners]] [[trade union]]s and [[employers' organization]]s. It forms the core organization of the [[corporatism|corporatist]] and [[social market economy|social market]] [[economy of the Netherlands|economy]] known as the [[polder model]] and the main platform for [[social dialogue]].

==History==
The SER was founded in 1950. It was founded after a long debate about the economic order of the Netherlands. The two main governing parties of the time, the Catholic [[Katholieke Volkspartij|KVP]] and the social-democratic [[Dutch Labour Party|PvdA]] had differing opinions on the subject. Both wanted to prevent the repetition of the [[Great Depression|economic crisis of the 1930s]]. The social-democrats preferred to grant the government an important regulatory role in the economy, while the Catholics preferred to rely on the workings of a self-regulating market economy. A compromise was found in the corporatist model, in which both [[Trade unions in the Netherlands|trade unions]] and employers' organizations would form sector-based regulatory organizations. The SER headed this structure and served as important partner for the national government. The SER was very important in the reconstruction of the Netherlands after the [[Second World War]]. 

In the 1950s and 60s the SER was particularly successful in ensuring economic growth by close cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organizations. In the 1970s because of rising political [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] and the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] the SER was unable to resolve economic problems. In the 1980s the SER returned to the centre of the economic policy making, as it was the platform for dialogue between  the government and its [[social partners]]. In the 1990s the role of the SER began to change. The role of the sector-based regulatory organizations began to decline and the SER more and more took the role of an advisory council of government, In 1997 the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] and [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] were granted the right to submit enquiry commissions to the SER.

==Goals==
The SER has three main goals for Dutch social-economic policy:
* To promote balanced and [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[economic growth]];
* To promote full employment;
* To promote a fair [[income distribution]].

==Organization==
[[File:SERDenHaag.JPG|thumb|SER headquarters, [[The Hague]]]]
The SER has thirty-three members. It consists of three sections, which each have eleven members in the council. These sections are trade unions, employers' organizations and government appointed members, the so-called Crown members. The trade union-members are appointed from the three major unions: [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]] (8), [[Christelijk Nationaal Vakverbond|CNV]] (2) and the [[Federation of Managerial and Professional Staff Unions|MHP]] (1). The members of the employers' organizations are representatives from the three major employers' organizations: [[VNO-NCW]] (7), [[Midden- en Kleinbedrijf Nederland|MKB]] (3) and the [[Land- en Tuinbouw Organisatie|LTO]] (1). The government-appointed members are normally professors of economics or related fields and they include representatives of the economic planning agency [[CPB (Netherlands)|CPB]] and the central bank [[De Nederlandsche Bank|DNB]]. The board of the SER is formed by four members of each section. The chair of the organization is always a government appointee.

The SER heads and oversees the system of sector-based regulatory organizations. These organizations can like other governments, [[province]]s, [[water board]]s etc. enforce legislation{{examples needed|date=October 2018}} for their members, in this case companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3442">'''Staffing models''' are related sets of reports, charts and graphs, that are used to precisely measure work activity, determine how many labor hours are needed,  analyze how [[employee]] time is spent and calculate costs. Staffing models are used in the [[healthcare industry]].&lt;ref name="Media 2015"/&gt;

==Overview==
Staffing models provide:
* A structure for staff scheduling&lt;ref name="Nancy Bateman 2012"/&gt;
* Staff interactions&lt;ref name="Nancy Bateman 2012"/&gt;
* Both a broad and in-depth picture of work activity,&lt;ref name="Nancy Bateman 2012"/&gt; and its time and cost
* Information about current resource and process performance
* Information and tools to manage and improve staffing resource performance.

Staffing models are also used to reduce overtime costs.&lt;ref name="Media 2015"/&gt;

'''Sweethearting''' in the [[retail loss prevention]] industry means theft by employees at the [[cash register]], by giving away merchandise to a "sweetheart" customer (friend, family, fellow employee).  [[Cashier]]s can do it in numerous ways, including:&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Jeff (Jun 1, 2005 12:00 PM). "[http://multichannelmerchant.com/mag/minding_store/ Minding the Store]", ''MultiChannelMerchant.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scan avoidance
* [[Price override]]s
* Refund fraud, gift card fraud
* Void fraud
* Invoicing scams

Sweethearting is the most common type of employee theft.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steven (December 29, 2009). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/business/30theft.html?_r=1 Shoplifters? Studies Say Keep an Eye on Workers]", ''NYTimes.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
Most methods of stopping sweethearting include physical supervision of the cashier or installation of software that detects sweethearting, which can be difficult to do.
Common countermeasures include use of [[CCTV]] surveillance cameras and security guards checking customer receipts at exits. A modern, well-implemented and tightly managed retail management system enables store management to track which cashiers may ring up unusually high amounts of merchandise known to be attractive to thieves.

The '''value grid''' model was proposed by Pil and Holweg as a means to show that the way firms compete has shifted away from the linear [[value chain]] way management theory has traditionally thought about value chain management.

The advantages of a value-grid framework, as opposed to value chains, is in allowing companies' managers to strategize and coordinate operations. Common non-linear value chain strategies include influencing demand, modifying information access, exploring [[multitier]] penetration, managing risk, seizing value, integrating value, creating new value propositions, exploiting value chains across tiers, pursuing pinch-point mapping, and defining demand enablers.

'''Wemy Industries''' is a Nigerian [[company]] involved in manufacturing and distribution of hygiene products, within the [[Fast-Moving Consumer Goods]] (FMCG) market in [[Nigeria]]. It was founded by Pastor Ademola Odunaiya and his wife, late Dr. (Mrs.) Aderonke Odunaiya in 1978.&lt;ref name="wemydrbrowns.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wemydrbrowns.com/info.html|title=Wemy Industries – Wemy Info|work=wemydrbrowns.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable for being the first manufacturer of baby [[diapers]] in [[Nigeria]] and [[West Africa]]. It commenced operation in 1981.

== Brand Names ==
Dr.Brown’s® is a [[brand]] name of sanitary and [[hygiene]] products marketed by Wemy Industries. Dr.Brown’s® sanitary pads and baby diapers were first sold in 1981.

Nightingale® [[brand]] of hygiene products is an alternative brand from the stables of Wemy Industries, introduced to the public in 2009.

== Category ==
As of 2014; the company has 37 SKUs. The products ranges are categorized into 3 different care lines according to the company’s handbook.
# Baby Care&lt;ref&gt;http://www.babycaredrbrowns.com&lt;/ref&gt;
# Feminine Care&lt;ref&gt;http://www.femcaredrbrowns.com&lt;/ref&gt;
# Adult Care&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adultcaredrbrowns.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Traditionally in Nigeria and to some extent West Africa, the use of nappies/diapers/training pants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/nappies-diapers-pants-in-nigeria/report|title=Nappies/Diapers/Pants in Nigeria|work=euromonitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; are low due to the high rate of poverty and illiteracy; it is more so in the [[rural]] areas than the urban areas. Generally, clothes and cotton wools are still used by women who are not able to afford standard [[sanitary]] protection products especially in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/sanitary-protection-in-nigeria/report|title=Sanitary Protection in Nigeria|work=euromonitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the common complaints is that the prices of hygiene and sanitary products for women and babies are too high ; such claims about prices are common in the urban areas.In the area of incontinence there is limited awareness about the availability of [[Incontinence pad|incontinence]] products, many incontinence patients can’t even afford specialized care or doctors’ advice, and some are oblivious of the availability of such products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/incontinence-in-nigeria/report|title=Incontinence in Nigeria|work=euromonitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is no longer the norm- thanks to major awareness and education brought in by governmental parastatals and other popular manufacturer including Wemy Industries.Though usage is still relatively low, compared to [[developed countries]].

Wemy Industries Ltd targets middle to [[Low income countries|low income earners]] helping to improve hygiene standards and reduce infant mortality rates. Wemy Industries Ltd has over the years become the only leading domestic player competing with international brands in the local market.

== History ==
*1978 October 25, Wemy Industries Limited was incorporated as a Private Limited Liability (PLL) company to manufacture Dr. Brown’s brand of ladies sanitary pads and children’s disposable nappies.&lt;ref name="wemydrbrowns.com" /&gt;
*1981 The company commenced full production of its diapers and sanitary pads at its former site in Isolo, a small residential suburb of [[Lagos state]]. At the time, it was the sole domestic manufacturer of these products in Nigeria.
*1983, the company added toilet rolls to its product portfolio. However, this product was discontinued as the company felt that it was not a commercially viable product at the time and decided to commit its efforts and resources to its more profitable product lines.
*1984, due to the increasing scope of the company’s operations, Wemy Industries commissioned the building of a new factory in Ota Industrial Estate, [[Ogun State]].
*1990 as a result of the need to further expand, coupled with the desire to be located within the Lagos metropolis, Wemy Industries relocated the factory site to  Alapere Ketu, where the company still resides today.
*1994 rival companies launched their brands of hygiene products in the Nigeria market, a lot of media buzz was garnered for the health and hygiene industry. Thus, leading Wemy Industries to change strategy and ultimately diversify their product range.
*2004 till present, Wemy Industries has consciously increased its product range in order to optimize its revenue streams and fend‐off increasing competition, introducing products such as [[baby wipes]], panty liners, ultra‐thin [[pads]] and [[Child birth|underlay pads]] into the Nigerian market over a few years.
*2009 Wemy Industries introduced the Nightingale® brand as an alternative brand in maternity care range of products.
*2013 commissioned additional [[factories]] for baby wipes and under-lay towel pads.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1835">A '''work method statement''', sometimes referred to as a '''safe work method statement''' or '''SWMS''' or a '''[[Safe Work Procedure|safe work procedure]]''', is a part of a [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] plan.&lt;ref name="Workcover NSW" /&gt; It is primarily used in construction to describe a document that gives specific instructions on how to safely perform a work related [[Task (project management)|task]], or operate a piece of plant or equipment. In many countries it is law to have work method statements, or similar, in place to advise employees and contractors on how to perform work related tasks safely.&lt;ref name="Workcover NSW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.workcover.nsw.gov.au/formspublications/publications/Pages/WC00231_WritingWorkMethodStatementsinPlainEnglis_.aspx | title=Writing work method statements in plain English: Guidelines | accessdate=April 3, 2011 | date=Feb 1998 | publisher=WorkCover Authority NSW Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement is generally used as part of a safety induction and then referred to as required throughout a workplace, they should outline all the hazards that are likely to be encountered when undertaking a task or process and provide detailed guidance on how to carry out the task safely...

==Procedure for use==
