'''{{lang|de|Aktiengesellschaft}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaktsi̯ənɡəˌzɛlʃaft}}; abbreviated '''AG''', {{IPA-de|aːˈgeː|pron}}) is a [[German language|German]] word for a [[corporation]] limited by [[Share (finance)|share]] ownership (i.e. one which is owned by its [[shareholder]]s) whose shares may perhaps be traded on a [[stock market]]. The term is used in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], and in [[South Tyrol]] (a German-speaking region of [[Italy]]) for companies incorporated there. It is also used in [[Luxembourg]] (as {{lang|lb|Aktiëgesellschaft}}), although the French-language equivalent, {{lang|fr|[[S.A. (corporation)|Société Anonyme]]}}, is more common.&lt;ref name="farlex"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aktiengesellschaft |url=http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Aktiengesellschaft |publisher=Farlex |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2017|reason=The use of the french version isn't implied in the source given.}} The equivalent in the United States or the United Kingdom is an incorporated or limited company.

==Meaning of the word==
[[File:Aktie Dürener.jpg|thumb|Example for an ''Aktie'' with nominal value 1000 [[Reichsmark]] (RM).]]
The [[German language|German]] word ''Aktiengesellschaft'' is a compound noun made up of two elements: ''Aktien'' meaning [[shares]], and ''Gesellschaft'' meaning company or society. An English translation is thus "share company", or company limited by shares, or [[joint-stock company]]. In German the use of the term ''Aktien'' for shares is restricted to ''Aktiengesellschaften''. Shares in other types of German companies (e.g. [[GmbH]]) are called ''Anteile'' rather than ''Aktien''.

==Legal basis==
In Germany and Austria, the legal basis of the AG is the German Aktiengesetz (abbr. AktG) ("shares law") or the Austrian Aktiengesetz (abbr. AktG). Since the German commercial law (§ 19 Handelsgesetzbuch) requires all corporations to specify their legal form in their name, in order to inform the public of the limits on their [[legal liability|liability]], all German (required by § 4 Aktiengesetz) and Austrian stock corporations include ''Aktiengesellschaft'' or ''AG'' as part of their name, frequently as a suffix.

In Switzerland, the Company Limited by Shares (or ''Aktiengesellschaft'' in [[German language|German]], ''société anonyme'' in [[French language|French]], ''società anonima'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''societad anonima'' in [[Romansh language|Romansh]]) is defined in Title Twenty-Six of the [[Swiss Code of Obligations|Code of Obligations]]. Article 950 specifies that the business name must indicate the legal form.

==Structure==
German AGs have a "two-tiered board" structure, consisting of a supervisory board (''Aufsichtsrat'') and a management board (''Vorstand''). The supervisory board is generally controlled by shareholders, although employees may have seats, depending on the size of the company. The management board directly runs the company, but its members may be removed by the supervisory board, which also determines the management board's compensation. Some German AGs have management boards which determine their own remuneration, but that situation is now relatively uncommon.

The general meeting is the supreme governing body of a Swiss company limited by shares. It elects the board of directors (''Verwaltungsrat'' in [[German language|German]]) and the external auditors. The board of directors may appoint and dismiss persons entrusted with managing and representing the company.

==Similar forms==
The equivalent terms in other countries include the following, which mostly mean literally either "share company/society" or "anonymous company/society".

* Norway – ''[[Aksjeselskap]]'' (AS)
* Sweden – ''[[Aktiebolag]]'' (AB)

'''Sir Arthur Lowes Dickinson''' (8 August 1859 – 28 February 1935)&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/46880&lt;/ref&gt; was a British chartered accountant in England and the United States of America.

Dickinson was the senior partner in the USA of Price Waterhouse (now [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] from 1901 to 1913, during which time he established the principles of consolidated accounting, to provide transparency about conglomerate companies.  He was also instrumental in the beginnings of international efforts to establish international accounting standards. A professorship at the Harvard Business School is named after him.

== Life ==

Dickinson was the eldest son of [[Lowes Cato Dickinson]], a Victorian portrait painter, and Margaret Ellen Williams, whose father had discovered [[Charlotte Bronte]] as reader for Smith, Elder, and Company. His younger brother, [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson]] was a distinguished political scientist and philosopher. He also had five sisters.

He was educated at [[Charterhouse School]], and at [[King's College Cambridge]], where he studied mathematics and graduated in 1882. He began a career in accountancy in 1883, and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1888, sharing first place in the Institute of Chartered Accountants' examinations with another candidate.

In 1901 he was posted to New York as the first resident senior partner in the USA of Price Waterhouse, then primarily a British partnership. One of his first acts was to devise a format for presenting the consolidated accounts of the United States Steel Corporation. From 1904 to 1906 he was President of the US Federation of Societies of Public Accountants, and in 1904 helped organise the First International Congress of Accountants in Saint Louis, Missouri, where he delivered a paper entitled "Profits of a Corporation" which set out the principles of consolidated accounting.&lt;ref&gt;http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/arthur-lowes-dickinson/&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1906 he became a naturalised US citizen, but returned to London in 1913, where he remained as a senior partner of Price Waterhouse until 1925.

From 1917 to 1920 he was financial adviser to the Coal Controller (the coal industry having been placed under centralised control during the [[First World War]]), and was awarded a knighthood for his services in this capacity in 1919. After his retirement from Price Waterhouse he maintained an interest in the coal industry, being a director of several coal companies.

In 1888 he married Mary Katherine Jennings. They adopted two daughters.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Legacy ==

His work on developing consolidated accounting was important at a time (of the "Robber Barons" in the USA) when conglomerates' external and internal transactions were far from transparent. So too was his work in helping to establish international accounting standards. But he was critical of the dangers of viewing accountancy as a narrow and technical exercise; and his book ''Accounting Practice and Procedure'' (1913) sought to provide a deeper understanding of the nature and scope (but also limitations) of accountancy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/46880&lt;/ref&gt;

the Astors settled in Germany, first appearing in North America in the 18th century with [[John Jacob Astor]], [[List of wealthiest historical figures|one of the richest people in history]].

==Founding family members==
[[File:John Jacob Astor 1763-1848 photogravure after painting by Gilbert Stuart.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Jacob Astor]]]]
[[John Jacob Astor]] (born Johann Jakob Astor) was the youngest of four sons born to butcher Johann Jacob Astor (1724–1816) and Maria Magdalena vom Berg (1730–1764). John and his eldest brother George (born Georg) (1752–1813), known as 'George &amp; John Astor', were flute makers, who came to England c. 1778 from [[Walldorf]], Germany. While working in England, he learned to speak English and anglicized his name. In 1783, John Jacob left for [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and was active first as a dealer in woodwind instruments, then in New York as a merchant in furs, pianos, and real estate. After moving to New York, John met and married Sarah Cox Todd (1762–1842). Sarah was the daughter of Scottish immigrants Adam Todd and Sarah Cox. She worked alongside her husband as a consultant, and was accused of witchcraft after her success with the company in 1817. The accusations never led to legal action. They had eight children, including occasional poet John Jacob Astor Jr. (1791–1869) and real estate businessman [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]] (1792–1875).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Astor, John Jacob|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Jacob's fur trading company established a [[Columbia River]] trading post at [[Fort Astoria]] in 1811, the first United States community on the Pacific coast. He financed the overland [[Astor Expedition]] in 1810–1812 to reach the outpost, which was in the then-disputed [[Oregon Country]]. Control of Fort Astoria played a key role in English and American territorial claims on the region. John and George's brother Henry (born Heinrich) (1754–1833) also emigrated to America. He was a [[horse racing]] enthusiast, and purchased a [[thoroughbred]] named [[Messenger (horse)|Messenger]], who had been brought from England to America in 1788. The horse became the founding sire of all [[Standardbred]] horses in the United States today. The third brother Melchior remained in Germany. During the 19th century, the Astors became one of the wealthiest families in the [[United States]]. Toward the end of that century, some of the family moved to England and achieved high prominence there. During the 20th century, the number of American Astors began to decline, but their legacy lives on in their many public works including the [[New York Public Library]].

==Family namesake places==
For many years, the members of the Astor family were known as "the landlords of New York".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Astor Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their New York City namesakes are the famous [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], an [[Astor Row]], [[Astor Court]], [[Astor Place (Manhattan)|Astor Place]], and Astor Avenue in the Bronx, where the Astors used to stable horses. The neighborhood of [[Astoria, Queens]], is named after the family as well.

Beyond New York City, the Astor family name is imprinted in a great deal of United States history and geography. There are towns of Astor in the states of [[Astor, Florida|Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Iowa, and Kansas and there are Astorias in [[Astoria, Illinois|Illinois]], Missouri and [[Astoria, Oregon|Oregon]]. In the Astoria, Oregon, school district, the primary elementary school is called [[John Jacob Astor|John Jacob Astor Elementary]].

There is a neighborhood called Astor Park &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astorneighborhood.org/|title=Astor Neighborhood Association – Astor Neighborhood Association – Green Bay, Wisconsin|website=www.astorneighborhood.org|access-date=2016-09-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003045817/http://astorneighborhood.org/|archivedate=2016-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; just south of downtown Green Bay, Wisconsin. At the heart of this neighborhood is a park (also called "Astor Park"); the Astor family donated this land for the building of a trade school.

The Astors were also prominent on [[Mackinac Island]], [[Michigan]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]], with their summer house, [[Beechwood (mansion)|Beechwood]]. At [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] on Mackinac Island, there are the Lord and Lady Astor Suites; the hotel salon is called Astor's.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">'''Blindspots analysis''' (also '''blind spots analysis''') is a method aimed at uncovering obsolete, incomplete, or incorrect assumptions in a decision maker’s mental scheme of the environment. [[Michael Porter]] used the term "blind spots" to refer to conventional wisdom which no longer holds true, but which still guides business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porter Michael, E. |date=1980|title= Competitive Strategy|location= NY|publisher= Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was further popularized by [[Barbara Tuchman]], in her book ''The March of Folly'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tuchman, Barbara |date=1985|title= The March of Folly|location= NY|publisher= Ballantine Books |edition=Paperback }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe political decisions and strategies which were clearly wrong in their assumptions, and by other authors since, such as social psychologists [[Mahzarin Banaji]] and [[Anthony Greenwald]] in their study of [[prejudice]].

==Uncovering blind spots==
Ben Gilad fully developed, in his book, ''Business Blindspots'' (1994), the following three-step "Gilad method" for uncovering blind spots&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step One'': Conducting a [[Porter five forces analysis|Porter’s Industry Structure – aka 5 force analysis]] on a given industry or segment (market), augmented with identification of possible change drivers, which are defined as trends with the potential to have profound (structural) effect on the balance of power among the five forces.&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step Two:'' Collecting [[competitive intelligence]] on the target company’s top executives assumptions regarding the same industry structure as in Step One. Sources may include annual reports' letters to shareholders, autobiographies, interviews in the press, public appearances and speeches, industry meetings, congressional testimonies, conference calls with security analysts (transcripts are publicly available), and all other statements regarding vision and beliefs. An alternative technique is known among competitive intelligence professionals as “strategy’s reverse engineering” which looks for the underlying assumptions which can rationalize existing strategy.
#''Step Three:'' Compare the results of Step Two with the analysis in Step One. Any contradiction with the analysis in Step One is a potential blindspot.

== Underlying assumptions ==

Underlying Blindspots Analysis is an assumption about the inherent [[cognitive bias|biases]] of decision making at the top of organizations (business, government or otherwise) exceeding those of their subordinates or outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liff, Stewart|author-link=Stewart Liff|title= The Complete Guide to Hiring and Firing Government Employees|pages= 109–111|publisher= AMACOM|location= New York|date=2009|isbn= 978-0-8144-1450-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many top executives in business and government organizations are smart, capable people, they are also vulnerable to several decision biases that come with their powerful positions, including [[cognitive dissonance]], motivated cognitions, overconfidence, and ego-involvement.&lt;ref&gt;(Cramer et al., 2005),(Rosenzweig, 2007), (Bossidy and Charan, 2004), (USA Today, 2005), (Gilad, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenzweig, Phil|title= The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers|location= NY|publisher=The Free Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0743291255|edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The impaired ability of leaders to see reality for what it is, and the more objective (less ego-involved) analysis of analysts and mid-level planners means that Step 3 of the Blindspots Analysis can be a powerful tool for pointing to potential blinders

The '''Cantine Giorgio Lungarotti Winery srl''' is an Italian wine company located in the region of [[Umbria]], [[Italy]]. The property is divided between several locations, with the largest in the towns of [[Torgiano]] and [[Montefalco]]. Founded in the late 1950s by [[Giorgio Lungarotti]], the company is now headed by his wife Maria Grazia, and sisters Teresa and Chiara. The Lungarotti name is famous for putting Umbrian wines on the map, through a mixture of traditional respect for the land and modern innovation and research. The Lungarotti company also owns the [[Museo del vino (Torgiano)|Wine Museum of Torgiano (MUVIT)]] and the [[Museo dell'olivo e dell'olio|Olive and Oil Museum (MOO)]], all two located in the center of Torgiano.

==History==
The Lungarotti winery as it is known today was born in the late 1950s. Previously renowned for his family's small-production wines, Giorgio Lungarotti decided to transform his vineyard into a larger scale production, guided his love and respect for the land. Giorgio, together with his wife Maria Grazia, was able to tap into the potential of the under-recognized Umbrian Region, creating a high-quality wine with a marriage between technology and tradition. 
The most important wine for the Lungarotti brand is [[Rubesco]]. Named for the Latin verb, "to blush", it originated from a new way to grow the vine, and a selection of the traditional varietals vinified in a scientific manner. This process was created by Giorgio himself, and is a point of pride for the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3543">When used in [[foreign trade]], a '''commercial invoice''' is a [[customs]] document. It is used as a [[customs declaration]] provided by the person or corporation that is exporting an item across international borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedex.com/bs/tools/invoice.html FedEx - Tools - Commercial Invoice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no standard format, the document must include a few specific pieces of information such as the parties involved in the shipping transaction, the goods being transported, the country of manufacture, and the [[Harmonized System]] codes for those goods. A commercial invoice must often include a statement certifying that the invoice is true, and a signature. 

A commercial invoice is used to calculate [[tariffs]], international commercial terms (like the Cost in a CIF) and is commonly used for customs purposes.

Commercial invoices in European countries are not normally for [[payment]]. The definitive '''[[invoice]]''' for payment usually has only the words "invoice". This invoice can also be used as a commercial invoice if additional information is disclosed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">'''Consumer relationship systems''' ('''CRS''') are specialized [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) [[software]] applications that are used to handle a company's dealings with its customers.&lt;ref name ="Insight44-50"&gt;[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cmp/cmi_200709/index.php ICMI Customer Management Insight Magazine, September 2007, pp 44–50], Retrieved 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Current consumer relationship systems integrate the [[software]] with telephone and call recording systems as well as with corporate systems for input and reporting. Customers can provide input from the company's website directly into the CRS. These systems are popular because they can deliver the 'voice of the consumer' that contributes to product quality improvement and that ultimately increases corporate profits.&lt;ref name ="Insight44-50" /&gt;

Consumer relationship systems that provide automated support as well as advanced systems may have [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) interfaces that can extract and analyse [[data]] collected, or handle basic questions and complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith| first1=S.E.|title= What is Consumer Relationship System? |date= |publisher= WiseGeek.net|url= http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-consumer-relationship-system.htm|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first CRS was developed in the 1980s. In 1981 Michael Wilke and Robert Thornton founded Wilke/Thornton, Inc in [[Columbus, Ohio]], to develop new CRS software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilke-thornton.com/WTI/Pages/products.html Wilke/Thornton, Inc Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820093347/http://www.wilke-thornton.com/WTI/Pages/products.html |date=2008-08-20 }} Retrieved 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contract law in [[Saudi Arabia]]''' is governed by the conservative [[Hanbali]] school of [[Sharia Law]], which adopts a fundamentalist and literal interpretation of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Jan Michiel (2010). ''Sharia Incorporated: A Comparative Overview of the Legal Systems of Twelve Muslim Countries in Past and Present''. p. 167. {{ISBN|978-90-8728-057-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any contract that is not specifically prohibited under [[Sharia]] law is legally binding, with no discrimination against foreigners or non-Muslims.

The Hanbali school is the most liberal among the four [[Sunni]] schools with respect to the freedom of persons to contract.&lt;ref name="P. Nicholas"&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the degree of freedom of contract is governed by the prohibitions in the Quran, and two distinctive doctrines in Sharia law: ''[[riba]]'' ([[usury]]) and ''gharar'' (speculation).

Unlike other Sharia law jurisdictions, Sharia law remains [[uncodified]] in Saudi Arabia due to the strong literalist view of the Hanbali school. There is also no established case reporting in the courts. This has led to much uncertainty and variation in court decisions. Despite being the world's 11th easiest economy to do business in, Saudi Arabia ranks 140th out of 183 economies in terms of enforcement of contracts. (see below: [[#Appendix|Appendix]])

In 2007, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] initiated legal reforms to modernise the courts and codify Sharia law in Saudi Arabia. The [[ulama]], the religious body, approved a codification of Sharia law in 2010, and a sourcebook of legal principles and precedents was published on January 3, 2018. (see below: [[#Legal_Reform|Legal Reform]])

==Sources of Law in Saudi Arabia==
Saudi Arabia is principally governed by [[Sharia Law]], with royal decrees playing a complementary role.

=== Four Sources of Sharia Law ===
The Hanbali school of law acknowledges the following sources of law:

[[File:Hand written Quran in Saudi Arabia.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Hand written Quran in Saudi Arabia]]
#The Quran is a sacred book which contains the divine revelations made to the Prophet by God (Allah), and is the foundation for Sharia law.&lt;ref name ="H. Patrick Glenn"&gt;{{citation|author=H. Patrick Glenn|title=Legal Traditions of the World: Sustainable Diversity in Law|location=United States.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Quran does deal with legal matters, but instead, sets out the goals and aspirations of Muslims, and the general accepted conduct and way of living.
#The [[Sunnah|Sunna]] (meaning "habitual practice" or "trodden path"&lt;ref name = "Bryant W"&gt;{{Citation
 | last=Seaman | first=Bryant W
 | title=Islamic Law and Modern Government: Saudi Arabia Supplements the ''Shari'a'' to Regulate Development
 | journal=Columbia Journal of Transnational Law
 | volume=18 | year=1979–1980 | pages=413–481
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the other primary source of law. It contains the explanations of the Quran and records the sayings, deeds, and approved practices by the Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Bryant W" /&gt;
#''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) is a secondary source of law. There are however, conflicting interpretations as to the meaning of consensus. The conservative Hanbali school prevailing in Saudi Arabia asserts that a legally binding consensus only arises from agreement of the Prophet and his Companions, and not the universal agreement of Muslim authorities today.&lt;ref name="H. Patrick Glenn" /&gt;
# ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy) is another secondary source of law. Forms of analytical reasoning are categorised as law.&lt;ref name="H. Patrick Glenn"/&gt;
Both ''ijmas'' and ''qiyas'' constitute ''[[fiqh]]'', Islamic jurisprudence based upon scholar opinions amassed over the years.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"&gt;{{citation|author=Gayle E. Hanlon|chapter=International Business Negotiations in Saudi Arabia|editor=James R Silkenat, Jeffrey M. Aresty &amp; Jacqueline Klosek eds.|title=The ABA Guide to International Business Negotiations|edition=3rd|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|year=2009|pages=851–229 of 918|isbn=978-1-60442-369-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulations (''lai'hah'') and Ordinances (''nizma'') ===
Ordinances (''nizam''), consisting of royal decrees which address modern legal issues and bureaucratic matters, is another source of law.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"/&gt; These royal decrees by the King supplement ''fiqh''.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"/&gt; Royal decrees are considered subordinate to Sharia law as only religious law is considered "law" under Sharia law.&lt;ref name="Childress"&gt;{{citation|author=Carol Lee Childress|title=Saudi-Arabian Contract Law: A Comparative Perspective|journal=St. Thomas L. F.|year=1990|page=70 of 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts will apply ''fiqh'' over ''nizam'' if the legal issue is already considered in Sharia law, or if ''nizam'' conflicts with Sharia law.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt;

Other forms of regulations (''lai'hah'') including Royal Orders, Council of Ministers Resolutions, Ministerial Resolutions and, Ministerial Circulars,&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lw.com/upload/pubContent/_pdf/pub3507_1.pdf|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia|author= |date=May 2010 |work= |publisher= Latham &amp; Watkins LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt; are likewise subordinate to Sharia law.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt; While contract law is generally governed under Sharia law, many areas of modern business and commercial activities are not considered under Sharia law and are hence governed by the applicable regulations.&lt;ref name="International Lawyer"&gt;{{citation|author=Jeanne Asherman|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia: The Contemporary Application of Islamic Law|journal=International Lawyer|year=1982|pages=321–337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia also abides by international treaties, which are approved by royal decree. One such example is Royal Decree No.11, dated 16 Rajab 1414, corresponding to 30 December 1993, which declared Saudi Arabia's ascension to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Formation of Contract==

[[File:Types of contracts table.png|thumb|750 px|center|Types of contracts at sharia law.&lt;ref name="islamicfinance-102-110"&gt;{{citation|author=Frank E. Vogel and Samuel L. Hayes|title=Islamic Law and Finance Religion Risk and Return|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|year=2006|pages=102–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A contract of sale (''bay’'') can be concluded for the exchange of anything regarded as a commodity or property (''mal'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=H. Gibb and K. Kramer|title=Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam |edition=57 |date=1961}} Marriage and employment agreements are also concluded by contract.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are certain things that are not included as ''mal'' under Sharia and therefore cannot be the subject of a sale.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"&gt;Gibb and Kramer, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; These include: pigs, alcohol, and animals not ritually slaughtered. In accordance to the [[Quran]], there are two exceptions to contract formation: the taking of interest (''riba''), and the use of speculative contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Gibb and Kramer, p. 56. The Quran also prohibits games of chance (''maisir'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules on conclusion of the contract of sale are stricter than the rules in most modern legal systems. Conclusion of the contract must take place at the same transaction as offer and acceptance.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"/&gt; Furthermore, there is a right of withdrawal of the offer even after acceptance.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"/&gt;

At [[common law]], auctions, advertisements, displays of goods on shelves, tenders and the like are treated as mere invitations to create an offer. In contrast, Sharia law recognises these as valid offers (''Ijab'') which, upon being accepted (''Qabul''), will become binding by law upon the parties involved in the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mohd Ma'sum Billah|title=Applied Islamic Law of Trade and Finance, A Selection of Contemporary Practical Issues, Third Edition|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] Asia|year=2007|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a statement with the description and price of goods constitutes an offer, and a display of goods with the price similarly is an offer.&lt;ref&gt;Billah, p. 11 and 19. {{citation|author=Liaquat Ali Khan Niazi|title=Islamic Law of Contract|location=Lahore|year=1990|page=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, advertisers can specify that the advertisement is only an invitation to treat.&lt;ref&gt;Billah, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offer &amp; Acceptance===
[[File:Offer Table 2.png|thumb|left|280 px|As opposed to common law, many commercial actions are offers at sharia law.&lt;ref name="Billah, pp. 10-19"&gt;Billah, pp. 10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like the common law, offer and acceptance are among the vital ingredients of a contract in Islamic law. An offer is a proposal, which leads to an agreement when there is an acceptance of the offer. If there is an acceptance, the offeror is bound by law to perform his promise. The offeror has no right to revoke his offer after its acceptance and he must be prepared to complete his promised accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Michael Furmston|title=Cheshire, Fifoot &amp; Furmston's Law of Contract, 12th Edition|location=London.|publisher=[[Butterworths]]|year=1991|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement of an offer has to be made in the past tense (''Sighatul-Madhi'') to be constituted as a valid offer in Sharia law.&lt;ref&gt;For example the seller saying, "I sold".&lt;/ref&gt; Making the statement in past tense signifies the seller's intention of making a valid offer which is capable of being accepted by the buyer. Once the offer has been accepted, the seller has no right to revoke his offer. If he does revoke his offer, it will be considered a breach of promise on his behalf, which is a great sin in Islam as it encourages rivalry and mischief among the people.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Quran, Chapter 2:177, 61:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike common law, Saudi Arabian law requires acceptance to be made before the parties attempting to contract physically part.&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, The Maslaha (Public Interest) and 'Illa (Cause) in Islamic Law, 12 N.Y.U. J. Int'l. &amp; Pol. 213 (1979), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain terms must also be stated for a Saudi Arabian contract to be enforceable. These include: the items involved, quantity, price, parties and how payment will be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=J. Schacht|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law 21|year=1964|page=147.}} In contracts that involve hire and lease, the period of time must be definite.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consideration===
The concept of consideration implies the bargain, or value given in return for value received. Islamic law, unlike common law, does not require consideration.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt; A contract in Saudi Arabia is a bond between the parties and God, hence, the element of consideration is deemed superfluous.

===Defects of Consent – Vitiating Factors===

Similar to common law, defects of consent will prevent the formation of a valid agreement.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt; Vitiating factors include mistake, misrepresentation, duress&lt;ref&gt;Under the Hanbali school of Sharia law, both declared and undeclared intentions of the parties must be free from duress. The key is that duress must be justified.{{Citation

and undue influence...

== Limitations on Enforceability of Contracts ==
Not all contractual arrangements are condoned in Sharia law. Unless a term is positively allowed by revelation ("in the book of God"), it is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;"Any stipulation not in the Writ of God is void [''batil'']." This is often termed the 'Barira' ''hadith''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Sharia law rarely discusses the idea of contractual freedom outside the standard contract types.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Hamid, "Islamic Law of Contract or Contracts," ''Journal of Islamic and Comparative Law'' 3:1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it provides for situation where standard contracts can be altered or combined. There are specific prohibitions raised by other ''hadiths'', some important ones prohibiting a loan and a sale, two sales in one, and a sale of what one does not have.&lt;ref&gt;"Illicit are a loan and a sale [''salay wa-bay''], or two stipulations in a sale, or sale of what you do not have.": Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi; "The Messenger of God forbade two sales in one [''bay'atayn fi bay'a'']": Ibn Hanbal, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stipulations are divided into three types:&lt;ref&gt;Sanhuri, 3:134-172.&lt;/ref&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|Condition (''ta’liq'')||conditioning of contract on a future event
|-
|Concomitance (''iqtiran'')||varying the terms of the contract
|-
|Extension (''idafa'')||delaying the beginning of a contract until a future time
|}
If the court finds stipulation a void, the contract itself may or may not be void- results vary casuistically.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, concomitant stipulations that coincide with or contradict an entailment of the contract,&lt;ref&gt;Such as, for example, a buyer paying the price and the seller transferring full title.&lt;/ref&gt; such as a stipulation that a buyer must never resell the object, are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combinations of contracts conditioned on each other are open to many objections, because they confuse the price of the individual contracts and obstruct meting out fair remedies for breach, thereby opening a door to ''riba'' and ''gharar''. There are two major types of contracts that are prohibited in Islamic law: contracts involving usury or uncertainty.

===''Riba'' (Usury)===
The Quran forbids ''[[riba]]'' in the strongest terms.&lt;ref&gt;"Devour not usury [''riba''], doubled and re-doubled..." [3:130]. See also the Quran at 2:275-79 and 4:161.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Riba'' is an unjustified enrichment and the principle encompasses a total ban on the charging of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Childress, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usurious transactions were classified into three classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohammed|first=Noor|title=Principles of Islamic Contract Law|journal=Journal of Law and Religion|year=1988|volume=6|issue=1|pages=119|jstor=1051062|publisher=Journal of Law and Religion, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|''ribaal-fadl''||unlawful excess in exchange of counter values in a contemporaneous transaction
|-
|''riba al-nasi'a''||unlawful gain by deferring the completion of exchange of counter values
|-
| ''ribaal-jahilya''||exemplified by the lender asking the borrower at maturity date if he will settle the debt or increase it by charging interest
|}

''Riba al-fadl'' and ''riba al-nasi'a'' apply to the exchange of two precious metals (gold or silver) and four commodities (wheat, barley, dates and salt), based on the Prophet's tradition. It was further extended by analogy to the products of these six articles if their present or future exchange could have the smell or taint of ''riba''. Islamic law did not permit exchange of unequal values of these articles and by analogy to a variety of their products. These articles happened to be the basic necessities of life and were a convenient means of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Noor Mohammed, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Promises for future performance were forbidden if goods comprised these articles as the transactions were suspected to contain ''riba''.&lt;ref&gt;N.A. Saleh, ''Unlawful Gain &amp; Legitimate Profit in Islamic Law'', 12-13 (1986), p.14-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation of ''riba'' has continued to be revised under the changing economic setting. By the turn of the century, the leading Islamic scholars Abduh and Rida held the view that ''riba al-Jahilya'' was forbidden but it could be deemed lawful under extreme necessity, and that ''riba al-fadl'' and ''riba al nasi'a'' are under a rebuttable presumption of prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban against interest rates has been circumvented by both parties pretending that a greater amount was lent or that the difference between loan and debt is actually a commission rate.&lt;ref&gt;N. Anderson, Law Reform in the Muslim World 6 (1976), p. 100. If the former fiction is used, the contract will reflect the greater amount, while the extra money in the second method will be looked upon as a commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gharar'' (Speculation)===
Gambling is another type of transaction condemned in the Quran.
:Intoxicants, games of chance [''maysir''], [worship of] idols, and [divination by] arrows are but an abomination, Satan's handiwork...&lt;ref&gt;Quran, 5:90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sunna takes this prohibition much further; it not only condemns gambling but also sales of ''gharar'' (peril, risk or hazard).&lt;ref&gt;The term ''gharar'' does not appear in the Quran. Etymologically related words meaning 'delusion' do appear.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Messenger of God forbade the 'sale of the pebble' [''hasah'', sale of an object chosen or determined by the throwing of a pebble] and the sale of ''gharar''.

Besides this, other transactions which are conditioned on uncertain events are also prohibited. Lack of knowledge about the existence or nonexistence of the subject matter, or concerning its quality, quantity, or date of performance, was held to trigger ''gharar''.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing refinement of the doctrine has been narrowed down to the presence or absence of uncertainty about future performance and not to the existence or non-existence of the subject matter at the time of contract. If the nonexistent article or subject matter is certain to be delivered or performed at a future date the prohibition of ''gharar'' does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 52-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies for Breach of Contract==
Rescission is allowed under specific circumstances, such as when the seller fails to perform; the merchandise is defective or the quantity incorrect; the quality of service inferior; or when unforeseen circumstances prevent the completion of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;N. Coulson, Commercial Law in the Gulf States 9 (1984), pp. 65-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with Islamic law, remedies for contract are restricted to direct and actual damages.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide" /&gt; The courts will not recognize economic loss of chance, interest, potential profits and other speculative awards that would normally might be given. Specific performance and injunctive relief are likewise generally unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;Halon, p. 908.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Courts also preclude consequential damages based on anticipated profits.&lt;ref name="Carl"&gt;{{citation|author=David J. Carl|title=Islamic Law in Saudi Arabia: What Foreign Attorneys Should Know|journal=George Washington Journal of International Law and Economics|year=1991–1992|pages=131–170 at 162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, contracts involving relationships over time such as continuous supply of goods will not attract full liability if wrongfully terminated.&lt;ref name="Carl"/&gt; Courts would only award reparations for immediate damages.&lt;ref name="Carl"/&gt;

Islamic law fixes the relationship of contracting parties to any object involved in the contract as to liability for loss or damage. A party holds the object either as a 'trustee' (''amin'') or as a 'guarantor' (''damin''). A trustee is not liable at all for injury to the object, unless shown to be in breach of trust. A ''damin'', however, bears the same risk of loss as an owner. If an object is destroyed through an act of God or force majeure, the guarantor has no recourse.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures and Prerequisites of Contract Enforcement==
Enforcing of a contract consists of three main stages:
[[File:Procedure of Contract Enforcement in Saudi Arabia.jpg|300px|thumb|Procedure of Contract Enforcement]]

=== Filing and Service ===

The plaintiff is to ask the defendant for compliance with the contract before filing his summons with the court. Before admitting a plaintiff's summons, a judge will examine it for formal requirements. The summons will be then delivered to a summoning officer for service of process on defendant.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

=== Trial and Judgment ===

The defendant files a written defense in answer to the plaintiff's claim. The judge will then set a deadline for the plaintiff to answer the defendant's answer with a written pleading. A pre-trial conference will be held where the judge will discuss procedural issues with the parties. At trial, merits of the case will be argued, and cross examination of witnesses, if any, will take place. After receiving the judgment, the plaintiff is to formally notify the defendant of the judgment. The defendant will then be given a choice to appeal before a certain deadline.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

=== Enforcement of Judgment ===

The plaintiff approaches a court enforcement office or private bailiff to request for an enforcement order. The defendant will be requested to voluntarily comply with the judgment. For contracted debt, the judge will call for a public auction for the property to be sold after the attachment of the defendant’s movable goods. The proceeds of the public auction are distributed to various creditors according to rules of priority.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

==Enforcement of Foreign Law Contracts==
Foreign law contracts are generally enforceable so long as they conform to Sharia law.&lt;ref name="ICLG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iclg.co.uk/khadmin/Publications/pdf/3834.pdf|title=The International Comparative Legal Guide to: International Arbitration 2010 |author=Alan Sfeir and Joe Tirado |year=2010 |work= |publisher= Global Legal Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus contracts deemed to be usury&lt;ref name="islamicfinance-72"&gt;{{citation|author=Frank E. Vogel and Samuel L. Hayes|title=Islamic Law and Finance Religion Risk and Return|location=Netherlands.|publisher=[[Koninklijke Brill NV]]|year=2006|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or dealing with gambling or risk&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt; would not be enforceable. Courts and judicial committees in Saudi Arabia also do not recognise the doctrine of conflict of laws.&lt;ref name="ICLG" /&gt; Hence any action based on a foreign law contract can be submitted to the courts even if there are express choice of law provisions.&lt;ref name="ICLG" /&gt;

===Enforcement of Foreign Judgments and Arbitral Awards===
The Board of Grievances, a statutory tribunal&lt;ref name="saudilegal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudilegal.com/saudilaw/19_law.html|title=Saudi Arabian Law Overview|author= |date=|work= |publisher= Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; separate from the Sharia courts, is empowered to hear requests for the enforcement of foreign judgments&lt;ref name="BOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/about/country-information/laws/Board_of_grievances_law.aspx|title=Law of the Board of Grievances, Royal Decree No. M/51, 17 Rajab 1402 [10 May 1982]|publisher=Information Office of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arbitral awards.&lt;ref name="saudilegal"/&gt; Article 6 of the Rules of Pleadings and Procedures of the Grievances Board provides that an applicant seeking to enforce foreign judgments or arbitral awards must prove that:&lt;ref name="update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://update.legal500.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=470&amp;Itemid=93|title=Enforcing Foreign Judgments and Foreign Arbitral Awards in Saudi Arabia|author=Alan Sfeir and Joe Tirado |date=June 2004 |work= |publisher= Legal500.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the judgment or award is not contrary to Sharia law or public policy; and
#the applicant proves reciprocity of enforcement ''ie'' that a Saudi judgment or award would be accepted and enforced in the applicant’s country.

Firstly, the judgment or award must not be contrary to Sharia law or public policy; it must not offend the Sharia principles of ''riba'' and ''gharar''. Judgments or awards involving conventional insurance, speculative loss of chance, interest and potential profits would not be recognized.&lt;ref name="update"/&gt;

The applicant must also show that a judgment or award by the Saudi Courts would be reciprocally enforced in the applicant’s country. In the past, the Board has declined to accept a legal opinion by a foreign lawyer or a letter from the UK government stating that foreign judgments would generally be enforced in the UK.&lt;ref name="update"/&gt; This second requirement applies in the absence of any bilateral or multilateral agreement relating to the reciprocal enforcement of decisions.&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; Despite being a signatory to regional reciprocity agreements&lt;ref&gt;The 1983 Arab Convention on Judicial Co-operation and the 1995 Protocol on the Enforcement of Judgments Letters Rogatory, and Judicial Notices.{{cite web |url=http://www.saudilegal.com/saudilaw/19_law.html|title=Saudi Arabian Law Review|author= |date=|work= |publisher= Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an international convention on the enforcement of arbitral awards,&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 following the Royal Decree No.11 dated 16 Rajab 1414. {{cite web |url=http://www.lw.com/upload/pubContent/_pdf/pub3507_1.pdf|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia|author= |date=May 2010 |work= |publisher= Latham &amp; Watkins LLP|page= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the decision to enforce such foreign judgements or awards is subject to compliance with Sharia law and public policy.

==Legal Reform==
[[File:King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|120 px|King Abdullah has sought to implement various legal reforms since his accession to the throne.&lt;ref name="Billah, pp. 10-19"/&gt;]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1876">A '''Court of Assistants''' is a council of members belonging to professional, trade, craft or livery organisations. The term originated among the London [[Livery Company|Livery companies]], as 'certain senior members who manage the affairs of the City of London Companies',&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Onions (ed. and rev.), ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' 3rd Edition (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1964 revision): the term is capitalized.&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be used by other trade associations. The Court of Assistants is usually the governing body of these organisations and may include the officials, as in the case of the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] founded in 1631: "The governing body of the Company is the Court of Assistants, comprising the Master, three Wardens and not less than ten Assistants."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clockmakers.org/about/the-court-committees-panels/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Another example is the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], which has an annual general court open to all members. It meets in March to elect 20 Assistants. The Company is governed in its civil and financial affairs by the court of assistants, which was first established in 1633.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.hac.org.uk/html/about-the-hac/court-of-assistants/?PHPSESSID=9ed42c54191317cd20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330161537/http://www.hac.org.uk/html/about-the-hac/court-of-assistants/?PHPSESSID=9ed42c54191317cd20 |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15090">In [[finance]], a '''credit derivative''' refers to any one of "various instruments and techniques designed to separate and then transfer the ''[[credit risk]]''"&lt;ref name=Econ1&gt;[[The Economist]] ''Passing on the risks'' 2 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt; or the risk of an event of default of a corporate or sovereign borrower, transferring it to an entity other than the lender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Das |first = Satyajit |title = Credit Derivatives: CDOs and Structured Credit Products, 3rd Edition |publisher = Wiley |year = 2005 |isbn = 978-0-470-82159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt; or debtholder.

An unfunded credit derivative is one where credit protection is bought and sold between bilateral counterparties without the protection seller having to put up money upfront or at any given time during the life of the deal unless an event of default occurs. Usually these contracts are traded pursuant to an [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA) master agreement. Most credit derivatives of this sort are [[credit default swap]]s. If the credit derivative is entered into by a financial institution or a [[special purpose vehicle]] (SPV) and payments under the credit derivative are funded using [[securitization]] techniques, such that a debt obligation is issued by the financial institution or SPV to support these obligations, this is known as a funded credit derivative.

This synthetic securitization process has become increasingly popular over the last decade, with the simple versions of these structures being known as synthetic [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs), [[credit-linked note]]s or [[single-tranche CDO]]s. In funded credit derivatives, transactions are often rated by rating agencies, which allows investors to take different slices of credit risk according to their risk appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Bruyere |first1 = Richard |last2 = Cont|first2 = Rama |title = Credit Derivatives and Structured Credit: A guide for investors |publisher = Wiley |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0470018798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit market participants, regulators, and courts are increasingly using credit derivative pricing to help inform decisions about loan pricing, risk management, capital requirements, and legal liability.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Simkovic|editor1-last=Adler|editor1-first=Barry|title=Making Fraudulent Transfer Law More Predictable, in Handbook on Corporate Bankruptcy|date=2016|publisher=Edward Elgar|ssrn=2775920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBO"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|last2=Kaminetzky|first2=Benjamin|title=Leveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the Problem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution|journal=Columbia Business Law Review|date=2011|volume=2011|page=118|ssrn=1632084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=What Can We Learn from Credit Markets|journal=Proceedings of the 93rd Annual Meeting of the American Law Institute|date=2016|ssrn=2782844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and participants ==
The market in credit derivatives started from nothing in 1993 after having been pioneered by [[J.P. Morgan]]'s Peter Hancock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=AIG: America’s Improved Giant |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21571139-insurer-has-done-good-job-rehabilitating-itself-can-it-stand-its-own |newspaper=The Economist |location=London |date=February 2, 2013 |accessdate=March 30, 2015 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996 there was around $40 billion of outstanding transactions, half of which involved the [[debt of developing countries]].&lt;ref name=Econ1/&gt;

Credit default products are the most commonly traded credit derivative product&lt;ref name="BBACDR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bba.org.uk/content/1/c4/76/71/Credit_derivative_report_2006_exec_summary.pdf|format=PDF|title=British Banker Association Credit Derivatives Report |date=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and include unfunded products such as [[credit default swap]]s and funded products such as [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (see further discussion below).

On May 15, 2007, in a speech concerning credit derivatives and liquidity risk, Geithner stated: “Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk.” &lt;ref&gt;Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's 2007 Financial Markets Conference—Credit Derivatives, Sea Island, Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;  Credit market participants, regulators, and courts are increasingly using credit derivative pricing to help inform decisions about loan pricing, risk management, capital requirements, and legal liability.&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LBO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALI"/&gt;
The ISDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isda.org|title=ISDA |date=April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported in April 2007 that total notional amount on outstanding credit derivatives was $35.1 trillion with a gross [[market value]] of $948 billion ([http://www.isda.org ISDA's Website]). As reported in ''[[The Times]]'' on September 15, 2008, the "Worldwide credit derivatives market is valued at $62 trillion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4761839.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Dow dives as Federal Reserve lines up 75bn emergency loan for AIG | date=September 16, 2008 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 | first1=Patrick | last1=Hosking | first2=Miles | last2=Costello | first3=Marcus | last3=Leroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the credit [[derivatives market]] is a global one, London has a market share of about 40%, with the rest of Europe having about 10%.&lt;ref name="BBACDR" /&gt;

The main market participants are banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and other corporates.&lt;ref name="BBACDR" /&gt;

== Types ==
Credit derivatives are fundamentally divided into two categories: funded credit derivatives and unfunded credit derivatives.

An '''unfunded credit derivative''' is a bilateral contract between two counterparties, where each party is responsible for making its payments under the contract (i.e., payments of premiums and any cash or physical settlement amount) itself without recourse to other assets.

A '''funded credit derivative''' involves the protection seller (the party that assumes the credit risk) making an initial payment that is used to settle any potential credit events. (The protection buyer, however, still may be exposed to the ''credit risk'' of the ''protection seller'' itself. This is known as counterparty risk.)

Unfunded credit derivative products include the following products:
* [[Credit default swap]] (CDS)
* [[Total return swap]]
* [[Constant maturity credit default swap]] (CMCDS)
* First to Default Credit Default Swap
* Portfolio Credit Default Swap
* Secured Loan Credit Default Swap
* Credit Default Swap on Asset Backed Securities
* Credit default [[swaption]]
* Recovery lock transaction
* Credit Spread Option
* CDS index products

Funded credit derivative products include the following products:
* [[Credit-linked note]] (CLN)
* Synthetic [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO)
* [[Constant Proportion Debt Obligation]] (CPDO)
* Synthetic [[constant proportion portfolio insurance]] (Synthetic CPPI)

=== Key unfunded credit derivative products ===

==== Credit default swap ====
{{Main|Credit default swap}}
The credit default swap or CDS has become the cornerstone product of the credit derivatives market.  This product represents over thirty percent of the credit derivatives market.&lt;ref name="BBACDR"/&gt;

The product has many variations, including where there is a basket or portfolio of reference entities, although fundamentally, the principles remain the same.  A powerful recent variation has been gathering market share of late: credit default swaps which relate to asset-backed securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last1=Parker |first1=Edmund |last2=Piracci |first2=Jamila |url=http://www.mayerbrown.com/london/article.asp?id=3517&amp;nid=1575|title=Documenting credit default swaps on asset backed securities |publisher=Mayer Brown |date=April 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521170516/http://www.mayerbrown.com/london/article.asp?id=3517&amp;nid=1575 |archivedate=May 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Total return swap ====
{{Main|Total return swap}}

=== Key funded credit derivative products ===

==== Credit linked notes ====
[[Image:Securitization-en.PNG|thumb|RIGHT|400px|In this example coupons from the bank's portfolio of loans are passed to the SPV which uses the cash flow to service the credit linked notes.]]
A credit linked note is a note whose cash flow depends upon an event, which may be a default, change in credit spread, or rating change. The definition of the relevant credit events must be negotiated by the parties to the note.

A CLN in effect combines a credit-default swap with a regular note (with coupon, maturity, redemption).  Given its note-like features, a CLN is an on-balance-sheet asset, in contrast to a CDS.

Typically, an investment fund manager will purchase such a note to hedge against possible down grades, or loan defaults.

Numerous different types of credit linked notes (CLNs) have been structured and placed in the past few years. Here we are going to provide an overview rather than a detailed account of these instruments.

The most basic CLN consists of a bond, issued by a well-rated borrower, packaged with a credit default swap on a less creditworthy risk.

For example, a bank may sell some of its exposure to a particular emerging country by issuing a bond linked to that country's default or convertibility risk. From the bank's point of view, this achieves the purpose of reducing its exposure to that risk, as it will not need to reimburse all or part of the note if a credit event occurs. However, from the point of view of investors, the risk profile is different from that of the bonds issued by the country. If the bank runs into difficulty, their investments will suffer even if the country is still performing well.

The credit rating is improved by using a proportion of government bonds, which means the CLN investor receives an enhanced coupon.

Through the use of a credit default swap, the bank receives some recompense if the reference credit defaults.

There are several different types of securitized product, which have a credit dimension.
* [[Credit-linked note]]s (CLN): Credit-linked note is a generic name related to any bond whose value is linked to the performance of a reference asset, or assets. This link may be through the use of a credit derivative, but does not have to be.
* [[Collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO): Generic term for a bond issued against a mixed pool of assets—there also exists [[CDO-Squared]] (CDO^2) where the underlying assets are CDO tranches.
* [[Collateralized bond obligation]]s (CBO): Bond issued against a pool of bond assets or other securities. It is referred to in a generic sense as a CDO
* [[Collateralized loan obligation]]s (CLO): Bond issued against a pool of bank loan. It is referred to in a generic sense as a '''CDO'''

CDO refers either to the pool of assets used to support the CLNs or the CLNs themselves.

==== Collateralized debt obligations  ====
{{main|collateralized debt obligation}}
Not all collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are credit derivatives. For example, a CDO made up of loans is merely a securitizing of loans that is then tranched based on its credit rating. This particular securitization is known as a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and the investor receives the cash flow that accompanies the paying of the debtor to the creditor. Essentially, a CDO is held up by a pool of assets that generate cash.  A CDO only becomes a derivative when it is used in conjunction with credit default swaps (CDS), in which case it becomes a [[Synthetic CDO]]. The main difference between CDOs and derivatives is that a derivative is essentially a bilateral agreement in which the payout occurs during a specific event which is tied to the underlying asset.

Other more complicated CDOs have been developed where each underlying credit risk is itself a CDO [[tranche]]. These CDOs are commonly known as CDOs-squared.

== Pricing ==
Pricing of credit derivative is not an easy process.&lt;ref name = "Secret Liens"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1323190 "Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008"], American Bankruptcy Law Journal 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is because:
* The complexity in monitoring the market price of the underlying credit obligation.
* Understanding the creditworthiness of a debtor is often a cumbersome task as it is not easily quantifiable.
* The incidence of default is not a frequent phenomenon and makes it difficult for the investors to find the empirical data of a solvent company with respect to default.
* Even though one can take help of different ratings published by ranking agencies but often these ratings will be different.

== Risks ==
Risks involving credit derivatives are a concern among regulators of financial markets.  The [[US Federal Reserve]] issued several statements in the Fall of 2005 about these risks, and highlighted the growing backlog of confirmations for credit derivatives trades.  These backlogs pose risks to the market (both in theory and in all likelihood), and they exacerbate other risks in the financial system.&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt;   One challenge in [[regulation|regulating]] these and other derivatives is that the people who know most about them also typically have a vested [[incentive]] in encouraging their growth and lack of regulation. Incentive may be indirect, e.g., academics have not only consulting incentives, but also incentives in keeping open doors for research.

In 1993 he was one of the candidates for the [[president of Chile|presidency of Chile]], representing the [[Humanist Green Alliance]] (Alianza Humanista Verde, AHV), but only gained 1.17% of the total valid votes; [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] was eventually elected.&lt;ref name=presidencial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elecciones.gob.cl/SitioHistorico/paginas/1993/presidencial1v/pais/candidatos/total/1.htm|title=Votación País Presidencial 1993|work=elecciones.gob.cl|language=Spanish|accessdate=2010-11-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709142522/http://elecciones.gob.cl/SitioHistorico/paginas/1993/presidencial1v/pais/candidatos/total/1.htm|archivedate=2011-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Chilean parliamentary election, 1997|1997 parliamentary elections]], he was a candidate for senator for [[Santiago Metropolitan Region|Santiago Poniente]]. After the elections, he continued to work inside the Humanist Party, and he dedicated himself to his family's business of selling cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={eef3c6ee-b758-42df-8281-9363ba123712}|title=Los candidatos olvidados|work=El Mercurio|date=November 11, 2006|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Curt Rudolf Glover Engelhorn'''&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/nachruf-trauer-um-curt-engelhorn-1.3225903|title=Trauer um Curt Engelhorn|first=Elisabeth|last=Dostert|date=28 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2018|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (25 May 1926 – 13 October 2016) was a German [[billionaire]] heir and businessman, the great-grandson of [[Friedrich Engelhorn]], the founder of the chemical company [[BASF]].&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Education==
Engelhorn graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.utexas.edu/alumni/distinguished-alumni/deg/2014/engelhorn|title=Curt G. Engelhorn - Cockrell School of Engineering|first=Adrienne|last=Lee|date=|website=www.engr.utexas.edu|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
For more than three and a half decades, Engelhorn led the pharmaceutical companies [[Boehringer Mannheim]] and [[DePuy Inc.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/men/curt-engelhorn-net-worth/ |title=Curt Engelhorn Net Worth |publisher=TheRichest |date=1926-05-25 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he sold the two firms (in which together he had a 40% stake) to [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] for more than $10 billion.

In 2008 it was announced that Engelhorn would be donating Euro 400,000 annually over the period of 10 years to support American studies at the [[Heidelberg Center for American Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/press280601-564.html|title=Curt Engelhorn Donates 400,000 Euros Annually to Support American Studies in Heidelberg|publisher=Universität Heidelberg|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2012, Engelhorn owned [[Five Star Island, Bermuda]] a major share holding in a Bermuda registered German pharmaceutical multinational Corange Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keith Archibald Forbes |url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/intexecs.htm |title=Bermuda's world business leaders and their locally-registered companies |website=Bermuda-online.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2013, there have been ongoing investigations by the German authorities concerning suspected tax frauds between Engelhorn and his daughters, avoiding capital transfer taxes of up to Euro 440 million (US$475 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/engelhorn-clan-kann-auf-steuer-deal-hoffen-a-1073408.html|title=Engelhorn clan can hope for court deal|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2016, the family's lawyers conceded capital transfer tax evasions in the amount of Euro 135 million (US $145 million) to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Haben-zwei-Millionaers-Toechter-80-Millionen-Euro-hinterzogen-id36690557.html|title=Haben zwei Millionaers-Toechter 80 Millionen Euro hinterzogen?|publisher=Augsburger Allgemeine|date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Engelhorn is the great-grandson of [[Friedrich Engelhorn]], the founder of the German chemical company [[BASF]]. He was married with five children and lived in [[Gstaad]], Switzerland, with other homes in Costa Brava, Spain and on the Cote d'Azur, France.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Aside from his involvement in the family business, Engelhorn supported the [[Reiss Engelhorn Museum]] in [[Mannheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/nation/the-richest-people-in-germany/|title=The Richest People in Germany|publisher=The Richest|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2015, according to ''[[Forbes]]'', Engelhorn had a net worth of $6.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/curt-engelhorn/?list=billionaires|title=#230 Curt Engelhorn &amp; family|publisher=Forbes|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 13 October 2016, aged 90.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Other==
In 2012 it was discovered that an authentic 12th century [[cloister]] had been used as a pool decoration in one of  Engelhorn's Spanish estates, hidden from the public and the Spanish conservation authorities for more than half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/06/05/inenglish/1338897017_865476.html |title=Who has a cloister around their pool? &amp;#124; In English &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |website=Elpais.com |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collis |first=Helen |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2156904/Spanish-Romanesque-cloister-incredible-pictures-public-viewing.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Spanish Romanesque cloister incredible pictures from first public viewing |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-06-09 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2905">[[File:Wikimedia development and deployment flowchart.png|thumb|[[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]] development and deployment flowchart, mainly refers to [[software deployment]] and [[IT infrastructure deployment]]]]

A '''deployment flowchart''' (sometimes referred to as a '''cross functional flowchart''') is a [[business]] process mapping tool used to articulate the steps and [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] of a given [[business process|process]].

"Deployment [[flowchart]]s consist of a sequence of activity steps and also the interactions between individuals or groups."&lt;ref&gt;The Leader's Handbook: Making Things Happen, Getting Things Done
 By Peter R. Scholtes&lt;/ref&gt;  Each participant  in the process is displayed on the map (which is constructed as a matrix)  - tasks/activity are then articulated in sequence under the column corresponding to that stakeholder.

As deployment flowcharts highlight the relationships between stakeholders in addition to the process flow&lt;ref&gt;Essential Readings in Nursing Managed Care
 By Susan Odegaard Turner, Aspen Reference Group (Aspen Publishers)
&lt;/ref&gt; they are especially useful in highlighting areas of inefficiency, duplication or unnecessary processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanyourcompany.com/methods/How-to-construct-a-deployment-flowchart.asp How to draw a deployment flowchart? - Leanyourcompany.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   Often utilized within [[Six sigma]] activity,&lt;ref&gt;Rath &amp; Strong's Six Sigma Leadership Handbook By Rath &amp; Strong, Thomas Bertels
&lt;/ref&gt; completed flowcharts are commonly used to examine the interfaces between “participants” which are typically causes for delays and other associated issues.   Deployment flowcharts are useful for determining who within an organization is required to implement a process and are sometimes used as a business planning tool.  

While deployment flowcharts can be drawn by hand using pen and paper – various software tools include functionality to construct the flowcharts on computer, these include products such as [[Microsoft Visio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Visio/visio2000/maintain/iddepend.mspx Identify Cross-Department Dependencies with Microsoft Visio Flowcharts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other process mapping techniques, deployment flowcharts require a certain degree of detail (and accuracy) to provide useful benefit.  Care and attention is required to ensure that the correct stakeholder is attributed to the correct parts of the process.  Complex flowcharts may  be difficult to interpret, especially where a flow is unclear, or many stakeholders are identified.  Consistent terminology throughout the map is also important to provide clarity to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Flowcharts: Plain &amp; Simple. By Joiner Assocs., Inc. Staff&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Doctor of Management''' (D.M., D.Mgt. or DMan) is a [[doctoral degree]] focusing on advanced study and research in the applied science and practice of professional [[management]].&lt;ref name=Herts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/courses/dmanma-by-research|title=Professional Doctorate in Management|publisher=[[University of Hertfordshire]]|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and focus==
The D.M. was introduced at [[Case Western Reserve]] in 1995,&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; and several universities have since developed their own programs. In the UK, the Doctor of Management (DMan) was introduced at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=DMan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/word_doc/0018/25209/CMGdman-brochure2011.docx|title=Doctor of Management/Master of Arts|publisher=University of Hertfordshire|date=December 2010|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.M. program is an applied professional practice doctorate including a similar strong emphasis on research to the academically-equivalent [[PhD in management]], but with a focus on the application of management theories rather than on developing and extending those theories.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"&gt;{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132958/http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx| archive-date=20 December 2017|format=PDF|url=http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx | title=D.M. or Ph.D. in Management?| accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to research, it is focused on developing the talents, skills and abilities of organization executives and experienced management professionals.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aasa.org/SchoolAdministratorArticle.aspx?id=6624 | title=A Degree of Difference: A Doctorate in Management| accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D.M. versus Ph.D.===
In most cases, the distinction between the degrees is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D. is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.M. further emphasizes applied research leading to the practical application of this theoretical knowledge. The Ph.D. thus prepares students for careers in academia, while the D.M. is more aimed at those seeking a career in management.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"/&gt; Some D.M. programs require a [[dissertation]], while others have replaced this with a number of applied research projects.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; 

The British DMan is a professional doctorate with the same academic status as a Ph.D.&lt;ref name=DMan/&gt; The U.S. Doctor of Management is also a professional doctorate but is not (as of the report ''Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014'') recognised as a Ph.D.-equivalent research doctorate by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/technotes.cfm|title=Technical Notes|work= Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014 |date=December 2015|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this doctorate is sometimes viewed as a variant of the Ph.D. in Management (especially when a dissertation is required in the program).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Program structure==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
To be admitted as a doctoral management student in the U.S., one must hold a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|management-related]] [[master's degree]], have sufficient managerial experience, and pass a comprehensive entrance exam or doctoral essay. In the UK (and in many programs in the U.S.), there is a minimum of five years of management or professional consulting experience required. In the UK, an [[honours degree]] plus a relevant master's degree is preferred.&lt;ref name=Herts/&gt; The student must then complete necessary [[coursework]] (typically focused on [[Management#Management skills|leadership]] and [[business strategy|strategy]], and including training in [[research methodology]]), perform independent original [[thesis|research]] under supervision of a qualified [[doctoral advisor]], pass the doctoral dissertation or doctoral [[thesis defense]], and in some cases, teach examinable courses.

Although it can be completed in as little as three years, the D.M. typically takes 4–6 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB article about a PhD in Business and Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two years of the program are usually focused on intensive doctoral-level coursework and generally at least one research practicum (near the end of core courses, residencies, and research and writing training). It may be followed by a comprehensive examination (comps) at this point if the candidate has successfully reached this stage.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the PhD, the subsequent dissertation completion phase for the D.M. can take an additional two or more years. In some programs where the candidate has a good deal of professional management practical experience, the D.M. can be completed in as little as three years if the candidate has proven capable of taking a full load of credits each term, as well as successful completion of the required dissertation and its defense.

===Research methodologies===
Common research methodologies used in management studies include both quantitative and qualitative approaches such as: [[Business model|Modeling]], [[Econometrics]], [[Experiment]]s, Descriptive and Field Studies, [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenology]], [[Case Study]], [[Action Research]] or [[Mixed Methods]] strategies of inquiry.

'''Elton L. Bomer''' (born July 30, 1935) is an insurance executive and a retired American [[politician]] from [[Montalba, Texas|Montalba]] near [[Palestine, Texas|Palestine]], the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Anderson County, Texas|Anderson County]] in eastern [[Texas]].

==Political life==

From 1981 to 1985, and again from 1991 to 1995, Bomer was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Palestine, Texas|Palestine]], the seat of Anderson County in East Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeLeaders/members/membersearch.cfm|title=Elton Bomer|publisher=lrl.state.tx.us|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Bomer managed a visit to Palestine for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[gubernatorial]] candidate, [[George W. Bush]] gubernatorial campaign at the request of Bomer's friend and Bush's campaign strategist [[Karl Rove]]. In his memoir entitled ''Courage and Consequence: My Life As a Conservative in the Fight'', Rove describes Bomer as a "hard-working, thoughtful Democrat [who was] not fond of [[Ann Richards]] [Bush's unsuccessful gubernatorial opponent] because he thought that she was not willing to get her hands dirty on tough issues."&lt;ref name=rove&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aw4tOs-x85YC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Karl+Rove+%2B+Elton+Bomer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6UP8TbLjOYL50gGShKC4Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Courage and Consequence: My Life As a Conservative in the Fight|publisher=[[New York City]]: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2010), p. 87|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rove recalls that years later Bomer told him that he had read about Bush's intention if elected governor to  "reform education, juvenile justice, . . . and tort laws."&lt;ref name=rove/&gt;

Bomer left the House in 1995 though he had been reelected in 1994 when Bush offered him the appointment as state insurance commissioner. In 1999, Bush named Bomer as [[Texas Secretary of State]], an appointed office which handles state election matters and public documents and whose occupants over the years included even [[Stephen F. Austin]]. Bomer remained Secretary of State until Bush left office in December 2000. Bush's gubernatorial successor, his fellow Republican [[Rick Perry]], invited another Democrat to become Bomer's successor as secretary of state, then State Representative [[Henry R. Cuellar]] of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] in [[South Texas]], who in 2004 was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he remains.&lt;ref name=bomer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitolannex.com/2006/10/18/whatever-happened-to-elton-bomer/ |title=Whatever Happened to Elton Bomer? |publisher=capitolannex.com |accessdate=June 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928173639/http://capitolannex.com/2006/10/18/whatever-happened-to-elton-bomer/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bomer's successor in House District 11 was [[Todd Staples]], the first Republican to hold the seat in the 20th century.  In 2006, after a stint in the [[Texas Senate]], Staples was elected state agriculture commissioner, a position to which he was easily reelected in 2010.

In 1999, as Bush was preparing to seek 2000 Republican presidential nomination, Bomer assisted him with the purchase of the [[Prairie Chapel Ranch]] near [[Crawford, Texas|Crawford]], Texas. According to Bomer, "image" was not a consideration in the acquisition of the property in [[McLennan County, Texas|McLennan County]]. "One thing I can tell you for sure: there were no public relations considerations when he bought that ranch. He purchased it as a great weekend getaway, a place to go on vacation, a place where he could do some fishing."&lt;ref name=ranch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherrigreen.com/W's%20ranch.htm|title=W's Ranch|publisher=sherrigreen.com|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bomer conceded that while the Crawford ranch has PR value: "It portrays to the people of the country who [GWB] really is, and that is someone who is close to the land and loves the outdoors sincerely. . . . I think people like to know that he's a regular fellow, not a stuffy aristocrat that wants to stay behind closed doors in air conditioning."&lt;ref name=ranch/&gt;

In 2003, Bomer gave the maximum $2,000 per person allowed to the Bush-[[Richard B. Cheney|Cheney]] 2004 reelection campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/elton-bomer.asp?cycle=04|title=Elton Bomer - $2,000 in Political Contributions for 2004|publisher=campaignmoney.com|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and personal life==

Bomer graduated from the [[University of Houston]] in [[Houston]], Texas.&lt;ref name=insurance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=30008609&amp;privcapId=4611417&amp;previousCapId=28923014&amp;previousTitle=Liberty%20Bankers%20Life%20Insurance%20Co.|title=Executive Profile and Biography|publisher=investing.businessweek.com|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2006, Bomer was a business and government affairs consultant in the [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] office of the Gardere Wynne Sewall law firm. In 2006, Bomer was named president of four insurance companies, American Reserve, Liberty Bankers, Mid-Continent Preferred, and Winnfield Life. The companies are linked through the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]-based Heritage Guaranty Holdings Group.&lt;ref name=bomer/&gt; In 2011, Bomer was still president of two of the four companies, the Winnfield and Mid-Continent Preferred life insurance companies.&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;

[[Image:Elton Bomer monument, Austin, TX IMG 2157.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Bomer monument at [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]]]

On June 5, 1964, Bomer married the former Virginia Maxine Roco, known as Ginny Bomer (November 10, 1925&amp;ndash;December 1, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mrs. Bomer was a Houston native, a drum major at [[John H. Reagan High School (Houston, Texas)|John H. Reagan High School]], and a teen solo performer in the [[Jimmy Dorsey]] band. She had also modeled for the [[Neiman Marcus]] department store in Houston before she became an office administrator for an insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cemetery.state.tx.us/pub/user_form.asp?pers_id=7051|title=Virginia Maxine Roco Bomer|publisher=cemetery.state.tx.us|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried  at the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in Austin, where he too will be interred upon his death, a prerogative of state legislators and their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Bomer monument, [[Texas State Cemetery]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2011, Clifford "Cliff" Bomer, formerly of [[Athens, Texas|Athens]], Texas, one of two children of Elton and Virginia Bomer, was named the president of the East Texas National Bank in Palestine. Clifford Bomer is a graduate of [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palestineherald.com/local/x928072999/Bomer-new-chief-at-local-bank|title=Bomer new chief at local bank|publisher=''Palestine, Texas, Herald'', May 1, 2011|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elton Bomer is a director of the bank.&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;

The '''Executive DBA Council''' (EDBAC) is a global volunteer organization that focuses on [[Doctor of Business Administration|executive doctoral programs]] and their issues.  The group's posted mission is "...to provide outstanding networking and educational opportunities for professionals who serve and participate in executive doctoral degree programs."  The group states on its website that it is the only global organization of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/edbac/ |title=The Executive DBA Council |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The EDBAC was founded in 2011 to promote the DBA degree as a business or executive qualification, rather than an academic qualification, such as a PhD.  The group held its first meeting at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in June 2011.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2510e0fe-0941-11e0-ada6-00144feabdc0.html |title=Push to have DBA recognised as practitioner degree |publisher=FT.com |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==DBA versus PhD==
The DBA and PhD both focus on developing an individual's research skills, but the PhD is designed to prepare individuals for academic careers.&lt;ref name=CEO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/ceo-magazine/docs/ceo_15_-_complete_edition/40 |title=Debunking the Doctor of Business Administration |publisher=CEO Magazine |date=2014-07-14|accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DBA is intended to prepare students for a research career in business.  An executive qualification such as a DBA is also called a practitioner degree.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

==Membership==
The EDBAC offers membership to accredited, not-for-profit public or private institutions of higher learning that offer a doctoral program for executives or are considering doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/members/apply/ |title=Application for membership |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2016, there were 48 member schools, including [[University of Maryland University College]],[[Benedictine University]], [[Case Western Reserve University]], [[City University of Hong Kong]], [[Copenhagen Business School]], [[Cranfield University]], [[ESC Rennes School of Business]], [[Georgia State University]], [[Manchester University]], [[Oklahoma State University]], [[Paris Dauphine University]],  [[Rollins College]], [[Temple University]], [[University of Florida]] and [[University of Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/members/|title=Members |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization structure==
The EDBAC has a board consisting of a chairperson and ten other members, of which two are program alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/edbac/executive-board/ |title=Executive Board |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emma Parry of [[Cranfield University]], is the current chairperson.

==Events==
The Executive DBA Council sponsors and organizes an '''Annual Engaged Management Scholarship (EMS) Conference''' where current students and alumni of member programs present peer-reviewed research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weatherhead.case.edu/events/engaged-management/council |title=EXECUTIVE DOCTORATE in BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (EDBA) COUNCIL STATEMENT OF STRATEGIC DIRECTION |publisher=Case.edu |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sixth annual conference was held in Paris, France in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edba.dauphine.fr/en/news-videos/news/news-details/article/6e-conference-internationale-engaged-management-scholarship-ems.html |title=Past &amp; Upcoming Conferences |website =dauphie.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2017 conference was scheduled for Tampa, Florida in September 2017 but was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/past-and-upcoming-conferences/ |title=Past &amp; Upcoming Conferences |publisher=executivedba.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2018 conference is scheduled to take place at Temple University September 6-9 2018.

{{nihongo|'''Fusanosuke Kuhara'''|久原 房之助|Kuhara Fusanosuke|extra=12  July 1869 – 29 January 1965}} was an entrepreneur, politician and cabinet minister in the pre-war [[Empire of Japan]].

==Biography==
Kuhara was born in [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]], [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] into a family of ''[[sake]]'' brewers. His brother was the founder of [[Nippon Suisan Kaisha]] and his uncle [[Fujita Densaburō]] was the founder of the [[Fujita (company)|Fujita zaibatsu]]. He studied in 1885 at the Tokyo Commercial School (the predecessor of [[Hitotsubashi University]]) and went on to graduate from [[Keio University]]. After graduation, he joined the Morimura-gumi, but on the recommendation of ex-[[Chōshū domain|Chōshū]] politicians [[Inoue Kaoru]], he joined his uncle’s company, the Fujita-gumi, and in 1891 was assigned management of the [[Kosaka mine]] in [[Kosaka, Akita]], one of the largest lead, copper and zinc mines in Japan. He introduced new technologies and made the mine very profitable.

In 1903, he left the Fujita-gumi, and acquired the Akazawa Copper Mine in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] in 1905, renaming it the Hitachi Copper Mine. He established [[Hitachi|Hitachi Seisakusho]] in 1910, merging his operations into Kuhara Kōgyō in 1912. The mine became the second largest producer of copper in Japan in 1914 through mechanization and improved production techniques.
 
During [[World War I]], Kuhara expanded his operations into a vast array of enterprises, ranging from shipbuilding  to fertilizer production, petrochemical, life insurance, trading and shipping, creating the Kuhara [[zaibatsu]]. However, the overextended company experienced severe financial difficulties in the post-war depression, and Kuhara turned to his brother-in-law, [[Gisuke Ayukawa|Yoshisuke Aikawa]], who created a [[holding company]] called Nihon Sangyō, or [[Nissan Group|Nissan]] for short.  Kuhara went on to a career in politics, forging ties with future [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Giichi Tanaka]] and other political and military leaders, which Aikawa would later use to his advantage.&lt;ref name="Samuels, pp.102"&gt;Samuels, ''Rich Nation, Strong Army''. pp.102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Kuhara was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]] as a member of the [[Rikken Seiyūkai]] from the Yamaguchi 1st Electoral District, and was made [[Ministry of Communications (Japan)|Minister of Communications]] the same year in the [[Giichi Tanaka|Tanaka administration]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunter| first= Janet| coauthors = | year = 1984| title = Concise Dictionary of Modern Japanese History| publisher = University of California Press | location = {{ISBN|0520045572}} | id = }} page 278&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as secretary-general of the Rikken Seiyūkai in 1931 under [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]]. Politically, Kuhara supported a hard-line approach against China, and was a vocal supporter of a constitutional reform intended to transform Japan into a [[one-party state]]. However, Kuhara was briefly arrested after the [[February 26 incident]] and forced to resign from the party after it was discovered that he had made a financial contribution to the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shillony| first= Ben-Ami| coauthors = | year = 2007| title = Ben-Ami Shillony - Collected Writings| publisher = Routledge| location = {{ISBN|1134252307}}| id = }} page 247&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Rikken Seiyūkai party split, Kuhara was invited back into politics by [[Ichirō Hatoyama]], leading the faction opposed to [[Chikuhei Nakajima]], and rising to the post of president of the party in 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Itoh| first= Mayumi| coauthors = | year = 2003| title = The Hatoyama Dynasty: Japanese Political Leadership Through the Generations| publisher = Palgrave MacMillan | location = {{ISBN|1403981523}} | id = }} page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, he presided over the absorption of the party into [[Fumimaro Konoe]]’s [[Taisei Yokusankai]], thus fulfilling his ambition of creating a one-party state. Under the [[Kiichiro Hiranuma|Hiranuma administration]], he served as an advisor to the cabinet. He was one of the key organizers of the [[League of Diet Members Carry Through the Holy War]].

After [[World War II]], Kuhara was [[Purge (During Occupation of Japan)|purged]] by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupation authorities]]. After the end of the occupation, he was elected to the post-war [[House of Representatives of Japan]] from the Yamaguchi 2nd Electoral District in the [[Japanese general election, 1952|1952 General Election]]. He played an important role in the restoration of [[Russo-Japanese relations]] and [[Sino-Japanese relations]].

Kuhara died at his home in [[Shirokanedai, Minato, Tokyo]] in January 1965. His home is now the Happo-en, a hotel with a noted [[Japanese garden]].

'''HokBen''' (was known as '''Hoka Hoka Bento''') is a [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] [[fast food]] chain of restaurants based in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia. Their chain of restaurants today spread across [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. The name ''Hoka Hoka Bento'' is derived from Japanese language which means "steaming [[bento]]" (Japanese meal in a package).

==History==
[[File:Mall culture jakarta45.jpg|thumb|right|Hoka Hoka Bento's employee]]

Established on 18 April 1985 in Kebon Kacang, Jakarta, under PT. Eka Bogainti by [[Hendra Arifin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciputraentrepreneurship.com/makanan/hendra-arifin-sang-pemilik-hokben Ciputra Entrepreneurship Hendra Arifin, Sang Pemilik Hokben ]&lt;/ref&gt; HokBen is the largest Japanese fast food chain in Indonesia. Although they serve Japanese fast food, the ownership,&lt;ref&gt;[http://indocashregister.com/2009/05/31/ternyata-hoka-hoka-bento-100-milik-orang-indonesia-toh/ Ternyata Hoka Hoka Bento 100% Milik Orang Indonesia Toh….]&lt;/ref&gt; management and cook are entirely Indonesian. There is no Japanese involvement in the business.

In April 2008, the firm had 98 outlets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hokahokabento.co.id/?mod=aboutus&amp;opt=vwSub&amp;cid=2&amp;id=1&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2010, there were around 120 outlets, with expansion planned to other Indonesian cities in Central Java, Yogyakarta and Bali.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribunjabar.co.id/read/artikel/18989/hoka-hoka-bento-rambah-pasar-luar-jawa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halojepang.com/berita-utama/200-pt-eka-bogainti-resmikan-2-gerai-baru-hoka-hoka-bento-di-bali Halo Jepang]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Hoka Hoka Bento has 141 restaurant chains in [[Java]] and [[Bali]].

HokBen serves various Japanese fast food. However, unlike the common ordering and serving method in most fast food restaurants, HokBen's serving arrangement is set similar to a highschool [[cafeteria]] where customers move along the line with a tray to collect their dishes. Their menu comprises both set meals and [[à la carte]] dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hokben.co.id/menu|title=HokBen|website=www.hokben.co.id|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they define themselves as a Japanese restaurant, most of the food served have been adapted to suit Indonesians' taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294229-d6173190-r300197226-Hoka_Hoka_Bento_Gambir-Jakarta_Java.html|title=Japanese Bento with indonesian taste - Review of Hoka Hoka Bento - Gambir, Jakarta, Indonesia - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com.sg|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the change include stronger flavour compared to authentic Japanese food as well as the addition of [[sambal]] to cater to Indonesians' preference for spicy food.

[[File:Hoka Hoka Bento Bento Special 4.jpg|thumb|right|Hoka Hoka Bento meal set]]
HokBen offers a kids' meal package called "Kidzu Bento" which includes toys. They are also able to accommodate for children's birthday parties in their restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hokben.co.id/special_offer/detail/kidzu-bento-battle-of-unibot|title=HokBen|website=www.hokben.co.id|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo and toys offered are based on Hoka Hoka Bento characters.

==Mascot==
The mascots of HokBen are a pair of adolescent characters named Taro (boy) and Hanako (girl).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lifestyle.kompas.com/read/2012/09/04/15333151/~Etalase~Produk%20Baru|title=Paket Baru Bento Anak - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2017-11-06|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both characters appear in the restaurant's logo.

'''Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing''' ('''IUU''') is an international issue around the world. Industry observers believe IUU occurs in most fisheries, and accounts for up to 30% of total catches in some important fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;World Wildlife Fund: [http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/marine/problems/problems_fishing/illegal_fishing/index.cfm Fishing problems: Illegal fishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411060604/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/marine/problems/problems_fishing/illegal_fishing/index.cfm |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Illegal fishing''' takes place when vessels or harvesters operate in violation of the laws of a [[fishery]]. This can apply to fisheries that are under the jurisdiction of a coastal state or to [[International waters|high seas]] fisheries regulated by regional fisheries management organisations (RFMO). According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, illegal fishing has caused losses estimated at US$23 billion per year with about 30% of illegal fishing in the world occurring in [[Indonesia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2014/07/19/056594269/Almost-Half-of-Illegal-Fishing-in-the-World-Occur-in-Indonesia |title=Almost Half of Illegal Fishing in the World Occur in Indonesia |author=Ella Syafputri |date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unreported fishing''' is fishing that has been unreported or misreported to the relevant national authority or RFMO, in contravention of applicable laws and regulations.

'''Unregulated fishing''' generally refers to fishing by vessels without nationality, vessels flying the flag of a country not party to the RFMO governing that fishing area or species on the high seas, or harvesting in unregulated areas.

The drivers behind illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing are similar to those behind many other types of international [[environmental crime]]: pirate fishers have a strong economic incentive -- many species of fish, particularly those that have been [[over-exploited]] and are thus in short supply, are of high financial value.

Such IUU activity may then show a high chance of success – i.e. a high [[rate of return]] – from the failure of governments to regulate adequately (e.g. inadequate coverage of international agreements), or to enforce national or international laws (e.g. because of lack of capacity, or poor levels of governance). A particular driver behind IUU fishing is the failure of a number of flag states to exercise effective regulation over ships on their registers &amp;mdash; which in turn creates an incentive for ships to register under these [[flag of convenience|flags of convenience]].

Since no one reports catches made by pirates, their level of fishing cannot be accurately quantified. 

==Economic and environmental impacts==
One economic impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on developing countries is the direct loss of the value of the catches that could be taken by local fishermen if the IUU fishing were not taking place.

These losses include a loss to GNP, and government revenues from [[landing fee]]s, licence fees, and taxes payable by legal fishing operators. There are further indirect impacts in terms of loss of income and employment in related industries; losses in income will tend to reduce the consumer expenditures of families working in the [[fishing industry]].

IUU harvests may be brought to market at a lower price as unfair competition to the same products from the regulated supply or as a mislabeled competing product. In either situation this illegal unregulated contribution to the market may lower the overall quality and price of products available, thus creating an economic burden on harvesters following the laws and regulations.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing can have a significant impact on the sustainability of both the targeted species and the ecosystem. Fishing generally has the capacity to damage fragile marine ecosystems and vulnerable species such as [[coral reef]]s, turtles and seabirds. In fact, all eight [[sea turtle]] species are now endangered, and illegal fishing and hunting are two major reasons for their destruction. Regulating legitimate fisheries is aimed at mitigating such impacts, but IUU fishers rarely comply with regulations. This may reduce future productivity and biodiversity and create imbalances in the ecosystem.

This may lead to reduced [[food security]] in communities heavily dependent on fish as a source of animal protein.

IUU fishing can also lead to increased pressure on endangered fish species.  IUU fishing can directly affect the population of fish species by increasing the number of fish caught within the population in spite of population management efforts by the international community.  Indirectly, the substitution ([[Applied Food Technologies#Economic fraud resulting from fish mislabeling|mislabeling]]) of IUU caught fish for popular, but threatened or endangered species, increases the perceived supply of these species, thus decreasing the price and increasing the demand for the fish species.

==Certification and labeling==
Mandatory [[product certification]] and catch documentation are increasingly part of fishery monitoring and enforcement, and to exclude IUU products from consumer markets. Certification is also used for timber and for diamonds, which have analogous enforcement problems. Labels can reward harvesters and supply chains which honor regulations. Labeling may also provide accountability for [[adaptive management]] planning, as well-managed fisheries may provide higher quality products and more stable economics for producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/iuu/noaa_taskforce_report_final.pdf Presidential Task Force on Combating IUU Fishing and Seafood Fraud Action Plan for Implementing the Task Force Recommendations] at noaa.gov. 2014-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waitt Institute. [http://waittinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IUU-Waitt-Institute-Factsheet-13Mar2015.pdf Factsheet: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of certification or catch document schemes is encouraged in the [[FAO]]'s [[International Plan of Action on IUU Fishing]]. Several [[RFMOs]] include them, including [[CCAMLR]]'s [[Catch Documentation Scheme for Toothfish]], [[CCSBT]]'s [[Trade Information Scheme for Southern Bluefin Tuna]] and [[ICCAT]]'s [[Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Programme]]. Similar systems are applied at a national level, including the USA's [[Certification of Origin of Tuna and Tuna Tracking and Verification Systems]], Japan's reporting requirements (including area of capture) for all imports or transportation of tunas into Japan by boat, and the EU’s labelling of all fish products (including area of capture).

===Marine Stewardship Council===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MSC ecolabel.png|thumb|right|125px|The MSC ecolabel for certified, traceable sustainable seafood]] --&gt;The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) is an international [[non-profit organization]] that runs a certification and ecolabelling program for traceable, sustainable seafood.

To achieve certification as sustainable a fishery must meet a standard based on three principles:

# ensuring healthy [[fish stock]]s
# minimal impact on the marine ecosystem
# effective management (which includes ensuring the fishery operates within national and international laws).

Fisheries that meet the MSC standard for a sustainable fishery can use the blue MSC ecolabel on their [[seafood products]].

The second element of the program is a certification for seafood traceability. This is called MSC Chain of Custody. From the fishery, every company in the [[supply chain]] that handles the certified fish is checked to ensure the MSC label is only applied to fish products that come from a certified fishery. This requires effective record-keeping and storage procedures. This traceability element of the program helps to keep illegally fished seafood out of the supply chain by linking seafood sold in shops and restaurants to a certified sustainable fishery.

The MSC eco-label enables consumers to easily identify sustainable seafood when shopping or dining out. As of June 2014, there are over 14,000 MSC-labelled seafood products sold in over 90 countries around the world.  The MSC website lists outlets selling MSC-certified seafood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msc.org/where-to-buy/msc-labelled-seafood-in-shops-and-restaurants]&lt;/ref&gt;

The six MSC certified [[Patagonian toothfish]] and Antarctic toothfish fisheries (which are the South Georgia, Ross Sea, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Kerguelen Islands and Falkland Islands fisheries) provide a good example of how good [[fisheries management]] can reverse the trend of illegal fishing. These fisheries took significant steps to exclude illegal vessels from their waters:

* strict vessel licensing systems are rigorously enforced,
* each vessel must have at least 1 CCAMLR approved Government observer on board its vessel to verify catch data,
* each vessel must have port-to-port monitoring of its movements via two tamper-proof Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) units on board,
* all toothfish product that is transported must be accompanied by a CCAMLR Dissostichus Catch Document (DCD), with details of where and when that fish was caught.

These are only some of the measures taken by the toothfish fisheries to achieve MSC certification.  Further information on each of these toothfish fisheries can be found on the MSC website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Responsible Fishing Scheme====
The Responsible Fishing Scheme is the only global standard that audits compliance on board fishing vessels, including ethical and welfare criteria. First launched in 2006 by Seafish to help fishing vessels demonstrate their commitment to a responsibly sourced catch, in January 2016 a revised scheme was launched to include the health and safety and welfare of crew on board. The new scheme has been re-developed in accordance with the requirements of internationally recognised standard ISO17065. Initially focused on vessels supplying the UK market, the scheme will be rolled out internationally over the next two years. 

The Responsible Fishing Scheme website has the most up to date information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seafish.org/rfs&lt;/ref&gt;

Seafish is the UK's authority on seafood. It was founded in 1981 by an Act of Parliament and aims to support all sectors of the seafood industry for a sustainable, profitable and socially responsible future. It is the only pan-industry body offering services to all parts of the industry, from the start of the supply chain at catching and aquaculture; through processing, importers, exporters and distributors of seafood right through to restaurants and retailers. Seafish is funded by a levy on the first sale of seafood landed in the UK. Its services are intended to support and improve the environmental sustainability, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the industry, as well as promoting responsibly-sourced seafood.

==Enforcement==
[[File:Proposed modification to the Damen Stan patrol vessel for the USCG.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Design for an environmental protection patrol vessel]]

Illegal and unreported fishing (two of the three components of IUU fishing) essentially arise from a failure to adequately enforce existing national and international laws. There are, however, many factors underlying enforcement failure, including, notably, poor levels of national governance.

There are obvious problems with enforcing fisheries regulations on the high seas, including locating and apprehending the pirate ships, but solutions are available, chiefly through improved monitoring and surveillance systems. 

Many fishermen are getting away with illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) ocean fishing due to the difficulty of monitoring every single fishing boat. This will begin to change with new technology that is able to watch and follow each boat from space consistently. This will be done through radio beacons, which all boats in the ocean are required to have. By implementing this new monitoring system, it will be impossible for fishermen to get away with IUU fishing in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/09/08/the-fight-against-illicit-fishing-of-the-oceans-is-moving-into-space|title=The fight against illicit fishing of the oceans is moving into space|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine Stewardship Council|MSC]] systems are similarly of value within exclusive economic zones, including, for example, offshore patrols and licensing schemes.

==Flag state liability==
Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, states bear responsibility for the vessels (including fishing vessels) that fly their flag. While it is uncontroversial that individuals engaged in IUU fishing may be subject to legal sanctions, the extent to which flag states may be held liable under international law for the IUU fishing activities of their vessels is less clearly defined.
	
In March, 2013 the issue of flag state liability for IUU fishing was brought before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in a request for an advisory opinion submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC) of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/advisory_opinion/C21_AdvOp_02.04.pdf] "Request for an Advisory Opinion Submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC)" &lt;/ref&gt; The SRFC asked the Tribunal to advise on the following four questions:

# What are the obligations of the flag State in cases where illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities are conducted within the Exclusive Economic Zone of third party States? 
# To what extent shall the flag State be held liable for IUU fishing activities conducted by vessels sailing under its flag? 
# Where a fishing license is issued to a vessel within the framework of an international agreement with the flag State or with an international agency, shall the State or international agency be held liable for the violation of the fisheries legislation of the coastal State by the vessel in question? 
# What are the rights and obligations of the coastal State in ensuring the sustainable management of shared stocks and stocks of common interest, especially the small pelagic species and tuna? 

In its submissions to the Tribunal, the SRFC emphasized the severity of the IUU fishing problem in West Africa and the need for a clear regime of flag state responsibilities with respect to vessels engaged in this trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/written_statements_round1/C21_19_CSRP_orig_Eng_rev.pdf] "Written Statement of the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission" &lt;/ref&gt; The SRFC argued that its member states had been unable to mount successful prosecutions against IUU fishers following boardings due to a lack of support and cooperation from flag states.
	
A number of states and international organizations also made submissions&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/en/cases/list-of-cases/case-no-21/#c2272]&lt;/ref&gt; adopting a range positions with respect to the four questions above. It was held by some states that the Tribunal lacked the advisory jurisdiction to respond to these questions. Both the government of Spain, a major contributor to the problem of IUU fishing, as well as the United Kingdom adopted such a view. A number of other states took the position that flag state responsibility for IUU fishing should take the form of a general responsibility to perform due diligence with respect to vessels and their activities, rather than an obligation to assist in prosecutions or another more substantive requirement.
	
In its Advisory Opinion&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/advisory_opinion/C21_AdvOp_02.04.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; issued on April 2, 2015, the Tribunal adopted the  “due diligence” approach. The Tribunal found that flag states are under only a general obligation to take the necessary measures to ensure that their nationals and vessels flying their flag are not engaged in IUU fishing activities. This obligation may be satisfied by adhering to generally accepted international norms of fishing vessel regulation and complying with international treaties that indicate best practices. At the same time, the Tribunal found that in coastal waters the coastal state bears primary responsibility for preventing IUU fishing and not the flag state.

==Political processes==
===EU action plan===
The [[European Union|EU]] helped draw up FAO's international plan of action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing, endorsed by the FAO Council in June 2001. The EU then developed its own plan to implement the commitments agreed at international level, and the European Commission‘s action plan for the eradication of IUU fishing was published in May 2002. It is intended to be implemented at four levels:

At the EU level, more responsibility will be requested with regard to member state nationals acting under a [[flag of convenience]]. Moreover, market measures concerning fisheries products caught in violation of the international agreements will be adopted. In addition, information actions addressed to the fishing industry, consumers, and the public will be launched to raise their awareness.

In the framework of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, control and inspection plans would be adopted as well as specific conservation and management measures. In addition IUU vessels would be identified and monitored and their catches would be quantified.

At the international level, concepts like genuine link would be defined, and a number of rights and obligations of the port state would be established. Moreover, the exchange of information on IUU activities and the international co-operation would be strengthened.

In partnership with developing countries, the necessary means would be provided to enable them to effectively control fishing activities undertaken in waters under their jurisdiction.

===High Seas Task Force===
The [[WCPA High Seas Task Force|High Seas Task Force]] comprises a group of fisheries ministers and international NGOs working together to develop an action plan designed to combat IUU fishing on the high seas.

Launched in 2003, the Task Force includes fisheries ministers from Australia, Canada, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand and the UK, together with the [[Earth Institute]], [[IUCN]]-World Conservation Union, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] International and the [[Marine Stewardship Council]].

The goal of the Task Force is to set priorities among a series of practical proposals for confronting the challenge of IUU fishing on the high seas. A series of expert panels have been convened to identify the legal, economic, scientific and enforcement factors that permit IUU activity to thrive, and then determine key points of leverage that can brought to bear at national, regional, and global levels to minimise the incentives to carry out IUU fishing on the high seas. The completed action plan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.high-seas.org/docs/HSTFfinal/HSTF-Final-Report-09-03-06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; published on 3 March 2006, will be placed by ministerial members of the Task Force directly in the hands of other ministers.

=== Regional Fisheries Management Organizations ===
[[Regional Fisheries Management Organisation]]s (RFMOs) are affiliations of nations that co-ordinate efforts to manage fisheries in a particular region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=4566&lt;/ref&gt;

RFMOs may focus on certain species of fish (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of [[Southern bluefin tuna]]) or have a wider remit related to living marine resources in general within a region (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ([[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|CCAMLR]])). This wide diversity of mandates and areas of application, and also effective implementation of regulations, opens up opportunities for IUU vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fi/website/FIRetrieveAction.do?dom=topic&amp;fid=2940 FAO website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN high seas processes===

The present system of high seas governance has evolved over a period of several hundred years, the end result being a [[patchwork quilt]] of measures in the form of binding and non-binding instruments with different geographical and legal reaches and different levels of participation.

Most legal instruments build on the foundation established by the UN [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Convention on the Law of the Sea]], which was agreed in 1982 and entered into force in 1992.

The UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which entered into force in 2001, sets out principles for the conservation and management of fish stocks and establishes that such management must be based on the precautionary approach and the best available scientific information. The Agreement provides a framework for cooperation on conservation and management, but since only about a third of the parties to the Law of the Sea Convention have ratified it, its impact is inevitably limited.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) carries out much of the technical work on international fisheries management, and provides a forum for the negotiation of agreements and codes of conduct. In 1995 the FAO agreed its [[Code of Conduct]] for Responsible Fisheries to promote long-term [[sustainable management]].

In 2001, the FAO adopted the International Plan of Action (IPOA) on IUU Fishing. The aim of this voluntary instrument is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by providing all states with comprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate regional fisheries management organisations established in accordance with international law.

The FAO Compliance Agreement, which entered into force in 2003, is designed to close a major loophole in international fisheries management, that of the circumvention of fisheries regulations by ‘re-flagging‘ vessels under the flags of states that are unable or unwilling to enforce such measures.

In 2009, the FAO brokered the [[Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing]], which entered into force in 2016. The agreement closes ports to vessels suspected of illegal fishing.&lt;ref name=MercoPress/&gt; The treaty requires that fishing vessels request permission to dock and inform the port of the details of its fishing operations. Permission to dock can be denied if unregulated fishing was occurring. The measure is intended to block illegally caught fish from entering the marketplace. Other measures in the treaty include inspections of equipment, paperwork, catches, and ship's records. Though the treaty does not compel countries to apply these measures to ships under their own flags, they may choose to do so under the agreement.&lt;ref name=MercoPress&gt;{{cite news | title = FAO: New treaty will leave fish pirates without safe haven | url = http://en.mercopress.com/2009/09/01/fao1 | date = 2009-09-01 | publisher = [[MercoPress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 91 countries agree to illegal fishing treaty | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jozF6o3ZudxKjNHdVnaj8w7cOVHQD9AEO9Q82 | publisher = The Associated Press | date = 2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2007, the Certificate of establishment of the institute was issued thereby making it a forensic accounting educational institute in Nigeria.

'''Jorien van den Herik''' (born 11 November 1943 in [[Sliedrecht]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] business man and was [[chairman]] of [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]] till 2006.

Van den Herik helped Feyenoord to purchase some players in 1984 as chairman of the "Friends of Feyenoord Group". In a few years time he had invested 3 million [[Dutch gulden]]s in the club. In 1989 be became president of the [[Feijenoord Stadion|Stadion Feyenoord NV]]. When Feyenoord almost was bankrupt due to their sponsor [[HCS Technologies|HCS]], Van den Herik claimed his position in the Feyenoord board by saying "If I lose my money, I would like to be there myself".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In 1992, he became Feyenoord's chairman by taking over from {{Interlanguage link multi|Amandus Lundqvist|nl}}.

In 1998 the Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service ([[FIOD-ECD|FIOD]]) visited Feyenoord because of suspected fraud.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Mainly based on the signings of [[Aurelio Vidmar]], [[Christian Gyan]] and [[Patrick Allotey]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} This became a continuous subject in the years to come with Van den Herik as the main suspect.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} After several visits in court Van den Herik and Feyenoord were found to be not guilty in 2002.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Attorney General however appealed, but in 2005, after three years of investigations the results stayed the same.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} They still did not give up and went into cassation.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} On 19 December 2006 Van den Herik and Feyenoord came out of court as the winners again and this time it was the final decision.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Van den Herik has already said he will take the Attorney General to court to reclaim the damage his personality has received in all these years.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The 2005/06 season ended in deception for Feyenoord.{{clarify|date=January 2012}} The team was challenging the Dutch Championship for most of the season, but eventually lost it to [[PSV Eindhoven]]. The newly born Dutch play-offs (held for the first time that year) then became fatal for Feyenoord. [[Ajax Amsterdam]] which ended on a fair distance in the regular league was Feyenoord's opponent in the play-offs and overclassed them and Feyenoord was eliminated for winning an [[UEFA Champions League]] ticket. During the summer break Feyenoord had to sell two of their key players, [[Salomon Kalou]] and the very popular [[Dirk Kuyt]]. Only a small amount of the money became available to invest in new players.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} When [[Angelos Charisteas]] was signed from arch rivals Ajax to replace Dirk Kuyt hundreds of die-hard fans moved to the Feyenoord board to force Van den Herik to resign. Van den Herik stayed at the team and did not want to give up his position, unless the growing pressure, the underperforming of the team and several other problems that had not been solved yet.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In the meanwhile Feyenoord was placed under special guardianship because of their financial problems.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} A group of some Feyenoord icons, with former chairman [[Gerard Kerkum]] as their leader, operated under the name of "Commissie Kerkum" to restructure Feyenoord's future. In December 2006 they published their thoughts and came to the conclusion that Van den Herik should leave the club. Still Van den Herik did not want to leave, however after hooligan incidents in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and the growing pressure he announced his retirement in mid December. Van den Herik himself said not the thoughts of the Commissie Kerkum were the key factor for his decision, but the upcoming final result in the fraud case was. After the case was finished in December 2006 - Van den Herik was acquitted - he stepped down.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the summer transfer window of 2007, Feyenoord surprised friend and foe with the signing of big names like Roy Makaay and Giovanni van Bronckhorst. According to player manager Rob Jansen, Van den Herik played an important role in the realization of the transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris van Nijnatten |year=2006 |url=http://www.ad.nl/sport/article1473578.ece |title=Het succes van Feyenoord |publisher= Ad.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lactation consultant''' is a [[health professional]] who specializes in the clinical management of [[breastfeeding]]. The International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners (IBLCE) certifies lactation consultants who meet its criteria and have passed its exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iblce.org/|title=IBLCE|website=Iblce.org|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Lactation consultants are trained to assist mothers in preventing and solving [[breastfeeding difficulties]]{{sfn|Lawrence | 2016| p= 749}} such as sore nipples and [[low milk supply]]. They commonly work in hospitals, [[physician]] or [[midwife]] practices, [[public health]] programs, and private practice. In the United States, lactation consultants are often nurses, midwives, [[nurse practitioner]]s, and dieticians who have obtained additional certification.{{sfn|Lawrence | 2016| p= 749}} 

==History and organization==
The IBLCE was founded by a group of [[La Leche League]] leaders who wanted to professionalize the skills they had developed while working with breastfeeding mothers.&lt;ref name="The LLL Leader and the IBCLC--A Partnership in Breastfeeding History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/lv/lvjunjul00p52.html|title=LLLI - The LLL Leader and the IBCLC - A Partnership in Breastfeeding History|work=www.llli.org|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lawrence | 2016| p= 749}} Candidates can choose various pathways to qualify, including options for current health professionals and volunteers, through college or university academic programs, or through mentoring. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iblce.org/continuing-education-review/application-information/|title=IBLCE Continuing Education Review / Application Information|website=Iblce.org|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) and may use the [[post nominals]] IBCLC and/or RLC after her name. The International Lactation Consultant Association (ILCA) is the [[professional association]] for lactation consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilca.org/home|title=ILCA Home|website=Ilca.org|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Exclusive and partial breastfeeding are more common among mothers who gave birth in IBCLC-equipped hospitals.&lt;ref name=ussg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/breastfeeding/executivesummary.pdf|title=US Surgeon General Breastfeeding Executive Summary|author=|date=|website=surgeongeneral.gov|accessdate=6 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513032923/https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/breastfeeding/executivesummary.pdf|archivedate=13 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[maternity hospital]]s, a ratio of one IBCLC for every 15 [[postpartum period|postpartum mothers]] is suggested.{{sfn|Lawrence|2016|p=246}} The [[U.S. Surgeon General]] recommends that all communities ensure access to services provided by lactation consultants.&lt;ref name=ussg/&gt; Evidence found that breastfeeding interventions including lactation consultants and counselors increased the number of women initiating breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Sanjay|last2=Patel|first2=Shveta|date=August 2016|title=The Effectiveness of Lactation Consultants and Lactation Counselors on Breastfeeding Outcomes|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26644419|journal=Journal of Human Lactation: Official Journal of International Lactation Consultant Association|volume=32|issue=3|pages=530–541|doi=10.1177/0890334415618668|issn=1552-5732|pmid=26644419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The B.B.D. Bagh [[tram]] and bus terminus of [[Calcutta Tramways Company]] is also located on one side of Netaji Subhas Road just opposite Writer's Building.

==Operation==
The road is one-way directional throughout the day. During first half of the day up coming traffic is allowed to come and during evening hours as the shops and offices close, the down traffic is allowed. However, some part of it is maintained as totally one-way and some as two-directional throughout the day. Traffic resurrections are lifted after 9:00 pm till 6:00 am every day.

==Traffic==

As there is Writer's Building alongside it, there are always a number of policeman and traffic police to control and ease the traffic at any part of day. Therefore, even during peak hours the traffic flows with ease at Netaji Subhas Road. Public transport and private vehicles are not allowed to stop on this road for long for security reasons.

In 1999-2004, he was president of the Satu Mare Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture.

Silaghi joined the PNL in 1990, and was president of its youth wing section in Satu Mare until 1996, while serving as vice president of the main local section. He had other leadership positions until 2000, ultimately becoming president of the PNL section in 2001-2004, and a delegate to the central leadership body in 2002-2004.

'''Revolo''' is a [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in]] [[Parallel hybrid|parallel]] [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] technology that can be [[Retrofitting|retrofitted]] in both existing and new [[cars]]. This technology can also be used in buses and trucks.  The technology was developed by [[KPIT Technologies]] and the product will be manufactured through a [[joint venture]] between [[Bharat Forge]] and KPIT. As part of the joint venture, KPIT will license the hybrid technology while Bharat Forge will provide manufacturing, assembly, and integration.

Pre-compliance tests conducted at the Automotive research Association of India (ARAI), [[Pune]] have confirmed that the technology provides [[fuel efficiency]] improvements by over 40 percent and reduction in [[green house gas]] (GHG) emissions by over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is to be marketed to [[OEM]]s and individual vehicle owners through a network of dealerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Bharat-Forge--KPIT-to-float-joint-venture/630376 |title = Bharat Forge, KPIT to float joint venture | publisher = [[Indian Express]] |date = 2010-06-07 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Planning and concept===
The idea of Revolo first occurred to Tejas Kshatriya in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was stuck in [[Mumbai]] traffic en route to [[Pune]].

KPIT sanctioned a team of four engineers for the project, which was kept separate from [[KPIT Cummins#Research and development|CREST]], the research and development center at KPIT. It took 2 years of research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/hybrid-car-makeover-to-hit-the-road |title = Hybrid car makeover to hit the road | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a budget under US$2 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to evolve the idea through trial and error and several failures, including the inability of the system to withstand sudden surge in power when brakes were applied.

The research and development team studied the firing pattern of [[internal combustion engines]] and identified the weak spots that lead to fuel waste&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/fill-the-gap-between-petrol-and-electric |title = Fill the gap between petrol and electric | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a technology that can convert a passenger car to a hybrid that is environmentally friendly, cheap, fuel-efficient and at the same time offers good performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/hybrid-car-makeover-to-hit-the-road |title = Hybrid car makeover to hit the road | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolo is designed to work in typical stop-and-go city traffic and allows cars to cruise at about 30&amp;nbsp;km/h in the third gear without straining the engine.

===Latest developments===
KPIT continues the road tests of pilot vehicles as well as consumer trials with results so far having validated the pre-announced performance results. The team has further reduced the overall weight of the solution, improved on the durability and standardized many components across multiple vehicle platforms. Construction at the assembly and manufacturing plants continues. It is expected to be operational by March 2014.

The company will test various vehicles, including [[Automobiles|passenger cars]], with engines sizes between 800 cc and 2,500 cc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2010/11/16/stories/2010111652720200.htm |title = KPIT plans road tests for hybrid tech soon | publisher = [[Business Line]] |date = 2010-11-15 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of limited hybrid kits is planned to start by first half of 2012.{{update inline|date=November 2017}} The commercial production would begin in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2010/11/16/stories/2010111652720200.htm |title = KPIT Cummins plans road tests for hybrid tech soon | publisher = [[Business Line]] |date = 2010-11-15 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=November 2017}}

==Technology==

===Revolo technology details===
The Revolo kit is similar to a [[retrofitting|retrofit]] [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) kit which contains all required mechanical and electrical components in the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.wheelosphere.org/bharat-forge-india-unveil-retrofit-revolo-hybrid-kits-on-sale-in-india-in-six-months | title = Bharat Forge India unveil retrofit Revolo hybrid kits; on sale in India in six months | publisher = Wheelosphere | date = 2010-06-17 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kit can be installed in both [[petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel vehicles]] within 4–6 hours by trained technicians who will be trained by a [[joint venture]] that KPIT has formed with [[Bharat Forge]].

The Revolo kit comprises a 7.5 to 10 [[horsepower]] [[electric motor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and patented by KPIT, an electronic [[motor controller]], [[lead–acid battery]] pack, mechanical assembly and [[coupling]], [[proprietary software]] for control [[algorithms]] of the motor and batteries, and  [[battery management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/fill-the-gap-between-petrol-and-electric |title = Fill the gap between petrol and electric | publisher = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)]] |date = 2010-06-20 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a parallel hybrid the motor and engine will work simultaneously and as a plug-in, the vehicle can be charged through a standard external electricity source such as a domestic [[power outlet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike an electric vehicle, the vehicle will operate as a conventional fuel vehicle even if the batteries are completely drained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plug-in parallel hybrid conversion kit===
The conversion kit is a lot less complex and light in weight in context of the moving engine components which effectively enhances the [[fuel efficiency]] to twice as compared to existing solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=59416 |title = Bharat Forge And KPIT Cummins To Form A Joint Venture - Announce ‘New Hybrid Technology Solution’ for Automobiles |publisher = [[Nasscom]] |date = 2010-06-16 |accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battery specifications: The solution is battery agnostic. It can be adopted to work with various types of batteries such as [[lead–acid batteries]] or [[Lithium-ion batteries]]. The solution typically produces 60 volts from five valve-regulated, lead–acid batteries, and can be recharged from the standard Indian household current of 230 volts in 4 to 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolo also consists of an in-built device that recognizes driving patterns and self-adjusts to provide optimum efficiency in stop-and-go traffic situations.

===Pricing===
Revolo is said to be 80 percent cheaper as compared to the [[retrofitting|after-market]] [[hybrid car]] kits available in the United States which cost around US$20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/09/phev-conversions-slow-to-catch-on-in-us-but-could-be-big-elsewhere.html | title = PHEV Conversions Slow to Catch On in U.S., But Could Be Big Elsewhere | publisher = [[Edmunds.com]] | date = 2010-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be retrofitted into any vehicle at an average cost of [[Rupee|Rs.]] 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/29211227/Cleaner-greener-cheaper.html |title = Cleaner, greener, cheaper | publisher = [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date = 2010-07-29 |accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Robert Van Straelen was born in [[Borgerhout]] to Paul Verstraelen, Director of the [[Banque Belgolaise]] in Antwerp, and Leopoldina Vinsolest from Borgerhout. Van Straelen attended the St. Edmondus Institute in Antwerp, and the St. Jan Berchmanscollege. In 1952 he started to study at the Sint-Ignatius Handelshogeschool (later part of the [[University of Antwerp]]), where in 1957 he received his degree cum laude. In 1958 he received an other degree and a Special Licence at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]. There in 1968 he was granted a colloquium doctum &lt;ref name="SK 04"/&gt; and in 1971 received his PhD in Economics&lt;ref name="RVS at AMS"&gt;[http://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/nl/faculty-research/faculty/van-straelen-robert-n.aspx Robert Van Straelen] at Antwerp Management School. Accessed 8 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; with a thesis entitled "Prijsontwikkeling en produktiestructuur: proeve tot formulering van een stochastisch model voor produktiecoëfficiënten."

In 1959 Van Straelen started his career in industry as business economist at a chemical company in Antwerp. The same year [[Fernand Nédée]] (1930–1980), later the founder of the University Institution Antwerp, invited him to join the research center "Studiecentrum voor de Expansie van Antwerpen". In 1961 he started as director of the new department of [[econometrics]] at the [[:nl:Universitaire Faculteiten Sint-Ignatius Antwerpen|Sint-Ignatius Handelshogeschool]]. In 1963 he also succeeded [[Vic van Rompuy]] as lecturer, and was appointed member of the [[Federal Planning Bureau]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name="SK 04"/&gt;

In 1968 Van Straelen became Associate Professor at the Faculty for Applied Economics at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]. Later he was appointed Professor at the Department of Applied Economics at the [[University of Antwerp]] and at the [[Antwerp Management School]]. There in 1996 he initiated a study of Real estate.&lt;ref name="RVS at AMS"/&gt;

Van Straelen was elected fellow at the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]].&lt;ref name="RVS at AMS"/&gt;

'''''Squawk Box Europe''''' (since May 2011, billed on-screen as just '''Squawk Box''') is a television business news programme on [[CNBC Europe]], aired from 7-10am [[Central European Time|CET]] (6-9am [[Western European Time|WET]]) each weekday. It also airs on CNBC Asia between 2.00 p.m.-5.00 p.m. [[Hong Kong]] / [[Singapore]] time (1.00 p.m.-4.00 p.m. with [[Daylight saving time|DST]]), and in the United States on CNBC World at the respective time, 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. - 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., ET. The programme is co-anchored by [[Geoff Cutmore]], [[Steve Sedgwick]] and [[Karen Tso]]. Prior to June 2003, the programme ran for only two hours, between 7.00 to 9.00 UK time but later gained an hour from ''[[Today's Business (CNBC Europe)|Today's Business]]''.

==History==
''Squawk Box Europe'' was in existence prior to CNBC Europe's merger with [[European Business News]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Like the current version, the original version took viewers to the opening of the European markets. This version was hosted by Nigel Roberts. After the merger, it was replaced by ''[[Europe Today (CNBC Europe)|Europe Today]]'' for more than a year before being revived in 1998. The programme was originally known by the fuller title of ''CNBC Europe Squawk Box'' until it was relaunched in September 2004 as part of a wider relaunch of all of CNBC Europe's programming. From this point it used titles and graphics inspired by (but unlike the previously set, not directly derived from) CNBC US' look at the time and the show's theme music was an edited version of its US' counterpart's theme music used between 2003-2005.

On 1 December 2008, ''Squawk Box Europe'' was relaunched with a new look, logo, and music. The programme became more similar to the US version but the new look was designed specially for ''Squawk Box Europe''. [[Louisa Bojesen]] and Steve Sedgwick, previously reporters, were promoted to full co-presenters of the programme at this point, and the "News Update" segments, which had been axed by CNBC Europe some years previously, returned. [https://www.cnbc.com/id/27997245]

On 1 March 2010, ''Squawk Box Europe'', along with the rest of CNBC Europe's programmes, realigned its graphics (and title) with those of CNBC U.S. Bojesen left the programme in April 2010 to join ''[[European Closing Bell]]'', and was replaced by Anna Edwards, but she left the network at the end of 2011 and was subsequently replaced by [[Karen Tso]] (formerly of CNBC Asia).

On 9 May 2011, the programme's format received a major re-working, with the second hour of the programme being dubbed "Squawk Pre-Trade" and the third hour as "Squawk Real-Time". The programme's on air title was changed to simply "Squawk Box", in line with the US and Asian equivalents.

On 9 March 2015, ''Squawk Box Europe'' launched new titles and new theme music based on the US version.  On 27 April 2015, the [[Asia Squawk Box|Asia]] version began using the US theme music.

On 8 February 2016, both the Asian and European versions started using the remastered ''Squawk Box'' logo that has been used by their US counterpart since 4 January 2016.

==Format==
Since the May 2011 reformatting, the focus has been on the pan-European picture and the [[STOXX Europe 600]] rather than on the national indices. It covers the opening of the European markets at 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. WET where Tso stands in front of the video wall. 

A guest host also appears on the programme each day (during the second and third hour, like its US and Asian counterparts). Another important element of the show is its interviews with other analysts and [[chief executive officer|CEOs]] of major companies. Viewers are welcomed to email their thoughts and questions to the show's guests.

[[Maria Bartiromo]] (who was part of the original [[Squawk Box|US ''Squawk Box'']] team) served as a guest co-anchor on the show when in London to co-host the annual [[European Business Leaders Awards]] until she left CNBC altogether in November 2013.

==Supplements to the show==
The host of ''Squawk Box Europe'', Geoff Cutmore, also has a blog on [[CNBC#CNBC.com|CNBC.com]], called "Morning Thoughts".

'''Stefano Casiraghi''' (8 September 1960 &amp;ndash; 3 October 1990) was an [[Italians|Italian]] speedboat racer, [[socialite]], and businessman. He was the son of Giancarlo Casiraghi and Fernanda Biffi, and became the second husband of [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline of Monaco]]. He was famous for having set a speed record in speedboat racing and was at the time of his death in a racing accident, the world champion of [[offshore powerboat racing]].

==Early life==
The son of Giancarlo Casiraghi (d. 1998), a businessman and  Fernanda (née Biffi), Stefano Casiraghi grew up in the Casiraghi family's estate, Villa Cigogne, in [[Fino Mornasco]].&lt;ref name="biographie"&gt;[http://stefanocasiraghi.chez.com/ ''Biographie de Stefano Casiraghi''.]&lt;/ref&gt; He had two brothers, Marco and Daniele (died in 2016), and one sister, Rosalba.&lt;ref name="biographie"/&gt; He also developed an early passion for the speedboat races on [[Lake Como]].&lt;ref name="people"&gt;Reed, J.D.; Joel Stratte-McClure and Logan Bentley. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113334,00.html "Another Tragedy for Monaco"], ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', 15 October 1990. Accessed 7 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the course of his brothers by enrolling at [[Milan]]'s [[Bocconi University]]. However, his eagerness to work in business was stronger than his wish to have a degree, or his skills to obtain one,&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;Fowler, Glenn. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/04/obituaries/stefano-casiraghi-30-husband-of-caroline-of-monaco-is-killed.html Stefano Casiraghi, 30, Husband of Caroline of Monaco, is killed], ''The New York Times'', 4 October 1990. Accessed 7 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and he left the university after only two years of study, to begin to work for his father and his oldest brother, Marco.&lt;ref name="biographie"/&gt;

==Business==
He was involved in the real estate and retail export enterprises of the family business that his father had built up.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; His [[obituary]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as a [[financier]] and said, at his death, Casiraghi was Chairman of "Cogefar France" (a construction [[subsidiary]] of [[Fiat]]). The same source said he had a majority interest in Engeco, a Monaco-based [[construction]] company which he founded in 1984.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; At the time of his first child's birth, it was said that he was the director of the [[Christian Dior]] boutique in Monte Carlo.&lt;ref name="biographie"/&gt;

== Speedboat racing ==

A self-styled "throttle man,"&lt;ref&gt;''Private Lives'', published by Oxmoor House, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-8487-1024-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casiraghi participated in eighty [[Offshore powerboat racing|offshore]] races during his lifetime. Over a 20-year career, he won a dozen of those competitions and, at the time of his death, was the world champion of offshore speedboat racing, including the World Championship held off the coast of [[Atlantic City]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;  Casiraghi had set the record (since broken) for 277&amp;nbsp;km/h on [[Lake Como]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="people"/&gt; It is a very dangerous sport, but as Casiraghi once said, "There are more dangerous sports and I believe one should live life to the fullest."&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
On 29 December 1983 in [[Monaco]], he and Princess Caroline married in a civil ceremony in the Hall of Mirrors of the Monegasque Princely Palace. They were not able to have a Catholic ceremony because Caroline had been divorced from [[Philippe Junot]], and an annulment had not yet been obtained. However, as Caroline was over three months pregnant, the couple did not want to wait any longer.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Her father, [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]] was by all accounts initially suspicious of his new son-in-law as were many others. The Italian papers called Casiraghi "Carolino" and portrayed him as a mere plaything for his wife.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The couple had three children: [[Andrea Casiraghi|Andrea]] (born 8 June 1984), [[Charlotte Casiraghi|Charlotte]] (born 3 August 1986), and [[Pierre Casiraghi|Pierre]] (born 5 September 1987). The children are, respectively, fourth, eighth and eleventh in the [[line of succession to the Monegasque throne]], after their twin cousins and their mother. Despite their parents' not having married in the Church as required for legitimacy under church (but not Monagasque) law, they were legitimised by [[Pope John Paul II]] in February 1993, eight months after their mother's marriage to Junot was [[annulled]] in June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knightley |first1=Emma |title=Princely Monaco XXI: The House of Grimaldi in the 21st Century |isbn=9780359058945 |edition=Kindle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Casiraghi was killed in an offshore powerboat racing accident off the coast of [[Monaco]] near [[Cap Ferrat]] on 3 October 1990 while defending his world offshore title.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; He was 30 years old and had planned to retire after the race. Only weeks earlier, he had escaped death when his boat blew up off the coast of [[Guernsey]].&lt;ref name="kurth"&gt;Kurth, Peter. [http://www.peterkurth.com/Monaco1.htm "In the House of Grimaldi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927064324/http://www.peterkurth.com/Monaco1.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}, ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three to four-foot wave conditions on the race course, which caused Casiraghi's 42-foot [[catamaran]], ''Pinot di Pinot'', to flip.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;  Traveling at ca. 150&amp;nbsp;km/h,&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; it did not have a full canopy, and experts who studied the accident have said that Casiraghi would most likely have survived the accident had the boat been equipped with such a canopy. As a result of his death, safety laws became more stringent; a [[safety harness]] and closed hull became compulsory, as was a twin hull design for boats. Races nowadays take place close to the harbor where waves are gentler, which is policed off for safety reasons as boats are no longer allowed to drive near the course.

Of the tragedy, [[Anne Edwards]] wrote that Casiraghi and his copilot, Patrice Innocenti, had been "trying to make up for time they had lost earlier in the race when they had stopped to rescue a pilot whose vessel had caught fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Anne|title=The Grimaldis of Monaco|date=1993|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0006374697|page=17|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrice Innocenti, survived the accident. He was pulled from the water and taken to Monaco's Princess Grace Hospital.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

The funeral Mass was held in Monaco's Cathedral of St. Nicholas exactly eight years after Princess Grace's funeral in the same place.&lt;ref&gt;Tarraborelli, J. Randy :''Once Upon a Time: Behind the Fairy Tale of Princess Grace and Prince Rainier ''. Warner Books, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-446-61380-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefano Casiraghi is buried in the Chapelle de la Paix in [[Monaco]], which is also the resting place of his wife's paternal grandfather, [[Pierre de Polignac|Prince Pierre of Monaco]].
