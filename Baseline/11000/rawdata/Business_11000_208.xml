'''AEDIPS''', the '''Association of Educational Development and Improvement Professionals in Scotland''' is an association that supports the development of [[education in Scotland]], with a particular focus on [[entitlement]] and quality.

Formerly known as the '''AEAS''' (the '''Association of Educational Advisers in Scotland'''), AEDIPS updated its [[constitution]] and its name in 2005 to reflect the changing roles of professionals working in the areas of quality improvement, [[curriculum]], and professional development in Scottish education today.

AEDIPS acts as a forum for the approximate five hundred educational professionals now supporting schools in all sectors of education in the areas of improvement, curriculum, and professional development in local authorities in Scotland.

Membership of AEDIPS is open to permanent staff, secondees, [[consultants]], and former improvement and  development professionals who may have moved on from local authority work but wish to keep up with educational developments in Scotland.

In 1904, '''Benjamin Ginsberg''', a Russian immigrant and pioneer in the [[Cederberg]] region of the Cape, [[South Africa]], became the first to trade [[Rooibos]] (''Red Bush'') tea and cultivate it under production. 

The [[Bushmen]], who lived in the area, first discovered that the fine, needle-like leaves of the "[[Aspalathus Linearis]]" plant made a distinctive, aromatic tea. For centuries, they had harvested the wild-growing plants, chopped them with axes and then bruised them with hammers, leaving them to ferment in heaps before drying them in the sun. In 1904, Benjamin Ginsberg started trading the tea from the [[Bushmen]], distributing and marketing it throughout the Cape. Ginsberg was descended from a family that had been in the tea industry in Europe for centuries and this provided him with the necessary experience to market the tea successfully.  Although a direct heir to the three family baronies, Ginsberg refrained from using his title.

By the late 1920s, growing demand for the tea led to problems with supply of the wild Red Bush plants. Working with his friend, a local [[General Practitioner|GP]] and keen [[botanist]], Ginsberg used innovative germination techniques to cultivate the tea under production. 

After Benjamin's death in 1944, his son Charles took over the business, introducing sophisticated machinery to cut the unusual leaves and building large “courts” on his farms in which to dry and cure the tea under the hot [[Cederberg]] sun. He was soon supplying tea seed to hundreds of farmers and promoting his Eleven O' Clock brand and its healthful properties (e.g. [[caffeine]]-free) across a variety of channels, including cinema advertising, which was still new to [[South Africa]]. Charles began distributing internationally and, although he sold the business in the 1970s, the brand is still widely distributed and the distinctive 1940's Eleven O' Clock packaging, depicting a mother and daughter serving tea, remains almost unchanged. 

In the 1990s, spurred on by greater consumer awareness of different teas, brand diversity and mainstream distribution (particularly through supermarkets), international demand for Red Bush tea increased dramatically.

The '''Brazilian Institute of Actuaries''' ({{lang-pt|Instituto Brasileiro de Atuária, IBA}}) is the national association for [[actuary|actuaries]] in [[Brazil]].

==History==
The Brazilian Institute of Actuaries was founded in 1944, by mathematicians and researchers interested in extending their field of study to subjects related to [[actuarial science]]. Established in Rio de Janeiro, the IBA’s main objective is to promote and support research and development initiatives, aiming at improving the scientific study of contingent facts of an economic, financial or biometric nature, in all their aspects and applications. 

==Role==
The Institute is the only entity representing the actuarial profession in Brazil, and for this reason it has concentrated efforts towards becoming a formal [[regulatory body]]. This new status would render it more capable to employ the adequate means to address professional issues in this area.

Professional actuaries are required by the Brazilian legislation to register with the National Labor Department prior to their employment in the Brazilian market and, although the IBA has not been assigned any formal responsibility by the government, it plays an important part in this regulation by assuring professional ethics and good practice among professionals. The National Labor Department requires professional actuaries to present one of following documents for registration: Bachelor’s degree in actuarial science, duly recognized and registered with the National Department of Education or  Bachelor’s degree in actuarial science from a recognized foreign institution and accepted by the National Department of Education.

In 2002, the [[International Actuarial Association]] (IAA) defined a minimum standard syllabus for Actuarial Science courses, with which all affiliated actuarial associations will be required to comply by 2005. With this purpose, and as a member of the IAA, the IBA is committed to implement a certification process using exams to which new applicants would have to be submitted, following a trend already consolidated not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in certain European countries.

As of 2002, the Institute has registered more than 600 members, including individuals and legal entities providing actuarial services, as well as pension funds, capitalization entities and insurance companies. Members are admitted to one of six membership categories after approval by decision of either the Institute’s Board of Directors or the Plenary of Members.

==Membership==
IBA Membership Categories
* Junior Members: students from a recognized graduation course in actuarial science, formally accepted by IBA’s Board of Directors;
* Individual Members: actuaries with a Bachelor’s Degree obtained from an accredited Brazilian or foreign institution, admitted by IBA’s Board of Directors;
* Organizations: private companies and public entities officially accepted by IBA’s Board of Directors;
* Honorary: individuals granted this position by the Plenary of Members as recognition of the value of their work, scientific knowledge or experience in areas related to the objectives pursued by the IBA;
* Meritorious: individuals and legal entities considered by the Plenary of Members to deserve public recognition from the IBA as a result of their legacy, relevant services or donations.
* Correspondents: Brazilian or non-Brazilian residents accepted by the Board of Directors due to their interest in the Institute’s activities or to their contribution to the IBA.

==Organization==
The Board of Directors holds monthly meetings to discuss and decide upon issues relevant to the Institute’s interests. Many of the positions assumed by the Board of Directors are based on previous studies carried out by the various existing commissions, which centralize discussions in specific areas such as Pension Funds, General Insurance, Health Insurance, Capitalization Plans, Education, Foreign Relations and Planning of Events.

In every month of September a general meeting is held in order to revise and ratify the Institute’s Annual Report, Statements of Accounts and their corresponding Audit reports. This assembly also votes to choose the members to compose the following year’s Audit Committee. Every two years, this General Board Meeting also elects the President, the Vice-President and the Board of Directors for the following two-year term.

The IBA maintains a newsletter focusing on topics of actuarial interests: ATUAR. Published bimonthly in Portuguese since January 1996, it has proved to be an efficient channel of communication with associates, bringing news from the Brazilian actuarial market and interviews, as well as book reviews and suggestions of relevant websites and news features. Just visit www.atuarios.org.br to access the web version of ATUAR and to find out more about the IBA.

== History ==


Breton was established in 1963 in [[Castello di Godego]], Italy, by Marcello Toncelli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcello Toncelli Biography|url=http://www.blurb.com/b/534441-marcello-toncelli|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who started developing new technologies and manufacturing industrial plants for producing engineered stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moriarty|first1=Ann Marie|title=Diamonds Are Forever.

Around the mid 1990s the company decided to enter also into the [[machine tool]] market, manufacturing machining centres for the mechanical industry.

In 2003 Marcello Toncelli, Breton's founder, died, and the control of the company passed to his sons Luca and Dario Toncelli, who since then have been running the company together with the founder's long-time partner, Roberto Chiavacci, Vice President of the Board of Directors.

In 2011 the company acquired Bideseimpianti and signed a partnership with Boart &amp; Wire, diamond wires manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsline: Technology supplier Breton of Italy acquires Bideseimpianti|url=http://www.stoneworld.com/articles/86754-newsline-technology-supplier-breton-of-italy-acquires-bideseimpianti|website=www.stoneworld.com/|publisher=Stone World.com|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breton Acquires Wire-Saw Maker Bideseimpiani|url=http://www.stoneupdate.com/news-info/latest-stuff/67-breton-acquires-wire-saw-maker-bideseimpiani|website=www.stoneupdate.com/|publisher=Stone update|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014 Breton became an official member of the Graphene Flagship Project, one of the largest research initiative of the European Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission announces huge new influx of partners to the Graphene Flagship project|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-707_en.htm|website=europa.eu/|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the [[potential applications of graphene]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5602">A '''buyout clause''' or '''release clause''' refers to a clause in a [[contract]] that imposes an obligation on another organisation wishing to acquire the services of the employee under contract to pay the (usually substantial) fee of the clause to the organisation which issued the contract and 'owns' the employee.

It is most commonly used in reference to sports teams, where a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer fee]] is usually paid for a player under contract; however, the current owning club is not obliged to sell their player, and if an agreement on a suitable fee cannot be reached, the buying club can instead resort to paying the player's buyout fee – should their contract have such a clause – which the owning club cannot block.&lt;ref name=applied&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3172294/how-release-clauses-work-neymar-treated-like-any-spanish-worker|title=How release clauses are applied: Neymar like 'any other worker' in Spain|date=5 August 2017|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually this is a higher amount than the player's expected market value, although on occasion a player at a smaller club will sign a contract but insist on a low buyout fee to attract bigger clubs if their performances generate interest.

The aim of this clause is twofold; firstly with its high amount, competing teams are discouraged from attempting to acquire the player if the current club shows no signs of selling them, and secondly it raises any hint to the players not to go through with their contractual commitment.

[[Football in Spain|In Spain]], buyout clauses have been mandatory in football contracts since 1985. If wishing to rescind their contract, the players are required to pay the buyout fee to their current club personally (via the [[Liga de Fútbol Profesional|league body]]), which would be advanced to them by the club signing them;&lt;ref name=applied/&gt;&lt;ref name=change/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanguard/&gt; however this advance of funds was originally deemed by the Spanish government to be taxable income, requiring the buying club to pay [[income tax]] on top of the fee itself, with the prohibitively high costs involved in this dual transaction discouraging clubs from making such deals.&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cityam.com/252013/recent-change-spains-tax-laws-could-make-buying-liga-manchester-united|title=A change in Spain's tax laws could make buying La Liga players easier for Premier League clubs such as Manchester United|date=22 October 2016|work=[[City A.M.]]|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanguard&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/spanish-buyout-clauses-work/|title=How Spanish buyout clauses work|date=2 August 2017|publisher=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]]|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 the laws were changed, with the buyout fee advances to the players no longer subject to tax, meaning only the fee itself had to be paid.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanguard/&gt;

As of November 2017, the five largest buyout clauses were those of association football players [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and player [[Karim Benzema]] of [[Real Madrid]] (€1 billion each) – Ronaldo subsequently moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (a deal not involving the buyout fee); [[Isco]] and [[Marco Asensio]] (also Real Madrid, €700 million each),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/liga/2017-2018/isco-pens-new-real-madrid-deal-with-huge-buyout-cause-marcelo-also-extends-contract_sto6333555/story.shtml|title=Isco pens new Real Madrid deal with huge buyout clause, Marcelo also extends contract|date=2017-09-14|work=[[Eurosport]]|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4223054/isco-signs-new-five-year-real-madrid-deal-and-his-staggering-release-clause-will-leave-you-speechless/|title=Real Madrid midfielder signs new five-year-deal with outrageous buyout clause|date=2017-08-11|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/the-neymar-effect-real-madrid-slap-astronomical-buyout/zd8ndsturtlw1jcarttg0zunc|title=The Neymar effect: Real Madrid slap astronomical buyout clauses on stars to avoid Barcelona’s fate|website=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2017-2018/video-lionel-messi-signs-new-contract-fc-barcelona|title=Lionel Messi signs new deal through 2020/21 season {{!}} FC Barcelona|website=FC Barcelona|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of [[FC Barcelona]] player [[Lionel Messi]] (also €700 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42123022|title=Lionel Messi: Barcelona forward signs new deal until 2021|date=2017-11-25|work=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2017, [[Paris Saint-Germain]] activated the buyout clause of Brazilian footballer [[Neymar]] from FC Barcelona, which was set at €222 million, making him the [[world football transfer record|most expensive football player]] in history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neymar Has Signed a Record-Breaking $262 Million Deal With PSG|url=http://time.com/4887096/neymar-psg-world-record-transfer//|website=The Time|date=4 August 2017|access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=applied/&gt; ahead of the previous record set by [[Paul Pogba]] (€105 million) in 2016.

The '''Cessna Citation family''' is [[Cessna]]'s [[business jet]]s line.

'''Chi-square automatic interaction detection''' ('''CHAID''') is a [[Decision tree learning|decision tree]] technique, based on adjusted significance testing ([[Bonferroni testing]]). The technique was developed in South Africa and was published in 1980 by Gordon V. Kass, who had completed a PhD thesis on this topic. CHAID can be used for prediction (in a similar fashion to [[regression analysis]], this version of CHAID being originally known as XAID) as well as classification, and for detection of interaction between variables. CHAID is based on a formal extension of the United States' AID (Automatic Interaction Detection) and THAID (THeta Automatic Interaction Detection) procedures of the 1960s and 1970s, which in turn were extensions of earlier research, including that performed in the UK in the 1950s.

In practice, CHAID is often used in the context of [[direct marketing]] to select groups of consumers and predict how their responses to some variables affect other variables, although other early applications were in the field of medical and psychiatric research.

Like other decision trees, CHAID's advantages are that its output is highly visual and easy to interpret. Because it uses multiway splits by default, it needs rather large sample sizes to work effectively, since with small sample sizes the respondent groups can quickly become too small for reliable analysis.

One important advantage of CHAID over alternatives such as multiple regression is that it is non-parametric.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">The '''Credit Managers' Index''' '''(CMI)''' is a monthly economic indicator of financial activity reflecting credit managers' responses to levels of favorable and unfavorable factors. The measure has been sourced in stories from publications such as the ''Wall Street Journal'', ''CFO'' and ''Bloomberg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.cfo.com/credit/2015/09/credit-managers-index-continues-decline/|title=Credit Managers' Index Continues to Decline -|last=Kuehner-Hebert|first=Katie|date=2015-09-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-11-01/economy-looking-up-ahead-of-big-jobs-number|title=Economy Looking Up Ahead of Big Jobs Number|last=Coy|first=Peter|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/10/01/woes-dont-extend-to-credit-managers/|title=Woes Don’t Extend to Credit Managers|last=WSJ|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracked since February 2002, the CMI is produced by the [[National Association of Credit Management]] (NACM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nacm.org/cmi.html|title=Credit Managers' Index (CMI)|website=nacm.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently conducted by Armada Corporate Intelligence's Chris Kuehl, who also serves as NACM's economic advisor. The CMI is compiled through a voluntary poll of credit and finance professionals in the service and manufacturing sectors. The CMI results generally are released on the last business day of each month.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.nacm.org/CMI/PDF/CMIcurrent.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A CMI number of more than 50 indicates an economy in expansion; less than 50 indicates contraction.

Unlike many economic indexes, the CMI resisted the month-to-month swings during the most recent{{when?|date=October 2017}} economic downturn. The index accurately signaled that the economic plunge was stabilizing and beginning to recover from the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacmnc.org/news/news.asp?id=271241|title=Simple Act, Huge Impact - NACM North Central|website=www.nacmnc.org|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chartered Institute of Credit Management (CICM) in the UK produces a similar Index&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cicm.com/credit-management-index/|title=CICM UK Credit Management Index - Chartered Institute of Credit Management|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a quarterly basis reflecting its members' responses to questions about the same factors and it uses the same methodology.

==Methodology==
The index is based on survey responses of approximately 1,000 trade credit managers in the second half of each month. There is typically an approximately equal representation between the manufacturing and service sectors. Respondents from throughout the United States are asked to comment on whether they are seeing improvement, deterioration, or no change for various favorable and unfavorable factors.

The computation of seasonality is based on the formula used by the U.S. Census Bureau and most of the federal government's statistical gathering apparatus. This is designed to streamline comparisons between the CMI diffusion index and comparable indices.

==Biography==
Dorice Reid was born to parents Leo Morrel and Ruby Peyroux (''[[née]]'' Matamua), on [[Rarotonga]], [[Cook Islands]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She moved from Rarotonga to [[New Zealand]] when she was eight years old.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

Reid became very influential among Cook Islanders living in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She initially worked as a sales representative for [[Air New Zealand]], a [[Radio Pacific]] [[talk show host]] and a journalist and reporter for [[South Pacific Television]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; Reid later became the first woman of [[Pacific Island]] descent to be nominated for a seat in the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] by a national political party.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

Reid moved back from New Zealand to her birthplace of Rarotonga in 1983.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She took a position with the [[Cook Islands Tourist Authority]] as a [[sales manager]] and [[marketer]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; In 1985 she and her sister, Jeannine Peyroux, acquired the Little Polynesian Resort in Rarotonga. They renovated the small resort and it won two [[World Travel Awards]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

The members of the Takitumu council, one of the three Vaka councils on Rarotonga, bestowed the chiefly title ''Te Tika Mataiapo'' on Reid during the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; The title, which is named for the Cook Islands warrior Te Tika, was granted to Reid at a ceremony in [[Marae Te Pou Toru]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; Reid declined multiple requests to run for the Cook Islands Parliament, citing incongruity of engaging in politics while bearing a traditional title.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

Reid became an advocate for tourism and the preservation of Cook Islands culture. Reid made several pilgrimages to [[Taputapuatea marae]], a traditional religious center of eastern [[Polynesia]] located in the [[commune]] of [[Taputapuatea]], [[Raiatea]], with other Polynesian [[tribal chief|chiefs]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She was also an active member of the [[Cook Islands Voyaging Society]].  In 1995, Reid served as the only female crew member on board the [[Te Au O Tonga]], which sailed to [[Raiatea]], [[Tahiti]], [[Nuku Hiva]] and [[Hawaii]] during a three and a half month voyage.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; In 2002, she completed a second sailing voyage aboard the ''Te Moana Nui O Kiva'' from her home in Rarotonga to [[Tahiti]], [[Huahine]], [[Raiatea]], [[Tahaa]], [[Bora Bora]] and [[Mitiaro]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

Additionally, Reid was a member five separate Cook Islands environmental agencies and served as a judge for the country.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; She is credited with the reintroduction of the [[raui system]] to the Cook Islands,&lt;ref name=cin/&gt; a traditional system forbidding access to or use of a resource, such as to a fishing lagoon or shellfish, for a certain period of time.&lt;ref name=nes&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=National Parks and Conservation Areas |url=http://www.environment.gov.ck/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=95 |work=Cook Islands National Environment Service |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707010447/http://www.environment.gov.ck/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=95 |archivedate=2011-07-07|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is traditionally used to preserve scarce food resources and also encourages the protection of the environment.&lt;ref name=nes/&gt;

In April 2011, [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Cook Islands|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Foreign Minister]] [[Tom Marsters]] announced Reid's appointment as [[High Commissioner]] of the Cook Islands to New Zealand, based in [[Wellington]].&lt;ref name=rnzi&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Cook Islands appoints new High Commissioner to New Zealand |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=60299 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |publisher= |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was to take office in July 2011, succeeding [[Mike Mitchell (Ambassador)|Mike Mitchell]].&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt;

Dorice Reid collapsed while attending a tourism conference in Auckland,&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; and died at Auckland Hospital at 1 AM on 16 June 2011, aged 67.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;  A resident of [[Kauare]], Rarotonga, she was survived by two nieces and a nephew.&lt;ref name=cin/&gt;

'''Downtown Denver''' is the main financial, commercial, and entertainment district in [[Denver, Colorado]]. There is over {{convert|23000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office space in downtown Denver, with 130,000 workers.
The downtown area can be divided into six or seven main districts: [[Union Station, Denver (neighborhood)|Union Station]], [[LoDo]] (however, Union Station is often considered to be part of LoDo), [[Ball Park, Denver (neighborhood)|Ball Park]], [[Central Downtown]], [[Civic Center, Denver|Civic Center]], [[Upper Downtown]], and [[Arapahoe Square]].&lt;ref name="DenverInfill.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://denverinfill.com/main_map.htm |title=Downtown Denver Districts |publisher=DenverInfill.com |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within those districts are many smaller features, districts and squares.  Some of the more popular features include the [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]] pedestrian mall, built in 1982, Larimer Square, the re-emerging Theatre District near Curtis and 14th, and [[Civic Center, Denver|Civic Center Park]]. Surrounding neighborhoods include [[Capitol Hill, Denver, Colorado|Capitol Hill]] and [[North Capitol Hill, Denver, Colorado|Uptown]] to the east, [[Highland (Denver)|Highland]] to the west, [[Five Points (Denver)|Five Points]] to the north, and the [[Golden Triangle, Denver, Colorado|Golden Triangle]] to the south.

== Overview ==
[[File:Denver Colorado from space.jpg|thumb|Astronaut's photograph of Denver, Colorado, taken from the [[International Space Station]]. North is to the upper right of the image.]]

As of 2008, there are 34 buildings in the downtown area reaching over 300&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name="Emporis.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=101307&amp;bt=9&amp;ht=2&amp;sro=0 |title=Denver High Rise Buildings |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This count does not include the recently completed [[One Lincoln Park, Denver|One Lincoln Park]] (380&amp;nbsp;ft) or the Spire (478&amp;nbsp;ft) and the [[Four Seasons Hotel Denver|Four Seasons]] (565&amp;nbsp;ft) both under construction.&lt;ref name="Denver-CityScape.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.denver-cityscape.com/downtownprojects.html |title=New Downtown Denver Projects |publisher=Denver-CityScape.com |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[List of tallest buildings in Denver]].

== Entertainment ==
[[Image:Wynkoop&amp;17th.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Looking down 17th Street]]
Denver has made a strong effort to centralize its commercial and entertainment interests in the Downtown area.  Currently, it is home to both [[Coors Field]] and [[Pepsi Center]], and roughly a mile from nearby [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]].  LoDo and the 16th Street mall are home to hundreds of bars, restaurants, and cafes, attracting many residents from the metro area and supporting the 10,000 plus residents living in the [[central business district]].&lt;ref name="Downtown Denver Partnership"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.downtowndenver.com |title=Downtown Denver Partnership |publisher=Downtown Denver Partnership |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Downtown Denver is home to the second largest [[Denver Performing Arts Complex|Performing Arts Center]] in the United States.

== Federal District ==
Downtown Denver also houses a smaller Federal District consisting of four blocks around Champa, Stout, 19th and 20th streets.  This district contains a federal courthouse, the [[Byron G. Rogers Federal Building]], a [[U.S. Court of Appeals]], and a [[US Customs House]].  Not a part of this district is the [[Denver Mint]], which actually lies behind the City and County Building at Civic Park.

==Economy==

'''''Drive''''' is the fourth non-fiction book by [[Daniel Pink]]. The book was published on December 29, 2009 by [[Riverhead Hardcover]]. In the text, he argues that human motivation is largely [[intrinsic]], and that the aspects of this motivation can be divided into [[autonomy]], [[mastery]], and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=mind-reviews-drive-the-surprising-truth |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=May 7, 2010 |title=MIND Reviews: Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues against old models of [[motivation]] driven by [[reward system|rewards]] and fear of [[punishment]], dominated by [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|extrinsic factors]] such as [[money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/books/reviews/2010-01-25-drive25_ST_N.htm |title='Drive' author Daniel Pink: Raises make bad motivators |newspaper=USA Today |author=Richard Eisenberg |date=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://readwrite.com/2010/05/14/weekend-reading-drive-by-daniel-pink |title=Weekend Reading: Drive, by Daniel Pink |author=Chris Cameron |date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
Based on studies done at MIT and other universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersUpside/Large%20Stakes%20Big%20Mistakes.pdf |title=Large Stakes and Big Mistakes| author=Dan Ariely, et. al. |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher pay and bonuses resulted in better performance ONLY if the task consisted of basic, mechanical skills. It worked for problems with a defined set of steps and a single answer. If the task involved cognitive skills, decision-making, creativity, or higher-order thinking, higher pay resulted in lower performance. 
As a supervisor, you should pay employees enough that they are not focused on meeting basic needs and feel that they are being paid fairly. If you don’t pay people enough, they won’t be motivated. Pink suggests that you should pay enough “to take the issue of money off the table.”

To motivate employees who work beyond basic tasks, give them these three factors to increase performance and satisfaction:

* Autonomy  —  Our desire to be self directed. It increases engagement over compliance.
* Mastery  —  The urge to get better skills.
* Purpose —  The desire to do something that has meaning and is important. Businesses that only focus on profits without valuing purpose will end up with poor customer service and unhappy employees.&lt;ref&gt;Pink, Daniel H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">The '''Export Promotion Council of Kenya''' ('''EPC''') is [[Kenya]]’s premier institution in the development and promotion of export trade in the country. Established in 1992, EPC’s primary objective was to address bottlenecks that were facing exporters and producers of export goods and services with a view to increasing the performance of the export sector. The Council was therefore established for the purpose of giving an outward orientation to an economy that was hitherto inward looking. Over time, the EPC has embraced the mandate of co-ordinating and harmonising export development and promotion activities in the country, providing leadership to all national export programmes. Today, EPC is the focal point for export development and promotion activities in the country.

The EPC was established on August 19, 1992 through Legal Notice No. 4342, with the mandate of developing and promoting Kenya’s exports. In pursuit of its mandate, the EPC primary objective is to address bottlenecks facing exporters and producers of export goods and services in order to increase the performance level of the export sector. It also provides a forum for dialogue between the exporting fraternity and relevant public and private sector institutions and organizations through Sectoral Panels..

==Sectors==

The EPC is organized by industrial sector:
*[[Horticulture]] and [[agriculture|other Agriculturals]]
*[[textile industry|Textiles and Clothing]]
*[[Small and medium enterprise|Commercial Crafts and SMEs (Small and Medium Size Enterprises)]]
*[[fishery|Fish]] and [[Livestock]] products
*[[manufacturing|Other manufactures]]
*[[service sector|Services other than tourism]]

Dr. '''Garo H. Armen''' ({{lang-arm|Կարո Արմեն}}) is a Turkish-born American businessman of [[Armenia]]n descent.

He was born on January 31, 1953, in [[Turkey]]. He moved to [[New York City]] in 1970. According to the ''New York Times''&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, The Boss Section, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; he became a messenger boy for a nonprofit [[Armenia]]n organization. In the article Armen stated, ''"I worked five hours a day, five days a week. I got two bucks an hour…and that was a lot of money for me.'' His second job was in the kitchen of the Lawyers’ Club but it only lasted a day. ''"I thought I’d learn to cook. Instead, they asked me to wash dishes. I had to climb into the soup bucket, which was huge, and clean it out. Shortly after, I got a job in a bank as a clerk."''

One night in 1978, in the middle of the [[energy crisis]], Armen was driving home when he stopped at a gas station. "I noticed that gas pumps only had two digits [for the per gallon price]," in interview with ''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E0DD113FF936A35752C0A9659C8B63&amp;scp=13&amp;sq=garo%20armen&amp;st=cse|title=EXECUTIVE LIFE: THE BOSS; History in a Greenhouse|publisher=The New York Times|date=2003-01-05|author=Garo H. Armen; Written with Bridget Eklund}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Realizing that continued rising prices would force the pumps to be replaced in the near future, I borrowed $5,000 to invest in gas pumps." Soon enough, virtually every gas pump in America was replaced – and Armen had made $20,000. His interest in business was pricked, and had already paid off.

By 1979, he received his PhD in [[physical chemistry]] from the [[City University of New York]]. Armen served as Senior Vice President of Research for [[Dean Witter Reynolds]] (1986–1989), focusing on the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and with [[E.F. Hutton]] &amp; Company as first Vice President (1981–1986). Before entering finance, Armen had been an associate professor at the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]] and a research associate at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].

Armen’s journey into [[drug development]] began when his mother died from [[breast cancer]] in 1973. The two shared a one-room [[Brooklyn]] apartment where Armen administered her [[morphine]] shots until she died. In 1994, Armen was approached by Pramod Srivastava, then a biochemist at [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]], about the possibility of developing [[Oncophage]] from a clinical and commercial perspective. The treatment involved removing a patient's [[tumor cells]], isolating and fortifying the cellular proteins that normally alert the immune system to disease, and re-injecting the proteins into the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/16065/title/Profile---Garo-Armen/|journal=The Scientist|date=22 November 2004|issue=18(Supplement 1)|page=S19|author=Vicki Brower|title=Profile : Garo Armen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Armen co-founded Antigenics with Srivastava.

== Career and business ventures ==
'''Agenus''' &lt;br/&gt;
Armen is chairman and chief executive officer of Agenus Inc., formerly known as Antigenics Inc., a [[biotechnology]] company that discovered Oncophage, a personalized [[cancer vaccine]] recently approved in [[Russia]] for patients with earlier-stage [[kidney cancer]] and currently under review with the European Regulatory Agency. The clinical history of Oncophage was described in detail in a story in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', August 2, 2007. In another interview with [[Business Week]] and [[CBS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antigenics.com/media/animation.html |title=Heat Shock Proteins: How They Work (animated demonstration) |accessdate=2008-12-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109061729/http://www.antigenics.com/media/animation.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armen described how the idea of [[personalized medicine]] tailored to the patient led to his launching Antigenics with $250,000 of his own money, plus the backing of a few friends. He was initially stirred by the results from animal testing; the vaccine cured 80% of mice in the early stages of cancer with virtually no side effects.

By February 2000, Antigenics went public at $18 a share, raising $72.5 million. A few months later the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) agreed to review the vaccine on an accelerated schedule when the company filed for approval, and Antigenics began recruiting 728 patients with kidney cancer for the phase 3 trial, the largest study conducted in the world.

Ultimately, 118 cancer centers participated in the trial, 63 of them outside the U.S.. The largest group of patients, 172, was treated in Russia. In April 2008, Oncophage was approved by the Russian Ministry of Health, making Russia the first country in the world to approve a personalized cancer vaccine in patients with earlier-stage kidney cancer. On the day Antigenics announced Oncophage's approval, [[CNBC]] ran a lead story on the personalized cancer vaccine as well as generating a debate on both television and their website on the regulatory landscape in Russia versus USA – the question posed to the audience was whether America had fallen behind the rest of the world in terms of approving innovative drugs? CNBC concluded with the following statement "The Antigenics story, of course, is making big news in Russia. It's the top story, for example, on this news web site. According to our Senior Economics Correspondent Steve Liesman--who used to live and work in Russia where he won a Pulitzer for his reporting--the headline says, Russia becomes the first country in the world to sell an American cancer vaccine."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-05-20/cancers-cruel-economics and http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/05/21/eveningnews/main4114975.shtml or http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4116930n%3fsource=search_video&lt;/ref&gt; Armen is now focusing the company’s efforts in Europe, and hopes to receive marketing approval for Oncophage in early 2010.

Oncophage is currently{{When|date=March 2011}} in clinical development for [[brain cancer]], a devastating disease with few treatment options and survival rates of between three and six months, according to the lead investigator, Dr. Andrew Parsa from [[UCSF]]. The study is showing encouraging results and the first patient who received the vaccine, Ms Hammerman, was interviewed by ''[[Good Morning America]]'' describing her experiences of taking the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/24010964/site/14081545 Antigenics Finds That "Russian Roulette" Pays Off&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elan''' &lt;br/&gt;
While retaining his position at Antigenics, Armen became chairman of the board of directors for the biopharmaceutical company [[Élan]] Corporation plc from mid-2002 through 2004. The company was on the brink of collapse brought down by an [[accounting scandal]] that earned it the label of "Europe's [[Enron]]". During his tenure, Armen became the architect of the company’s $1 billion restructuring program by strengthening Élan’s finances, refocusing the group on its core clinical development business and returning shareholder value. On the day that Armen assumed chairmanship, the ''Wall Street Journal'' and [[BBC]] discussed the restructuring plan in some detail. He said "(our) first task is clean house…the world is concerned we’ll file for bankruptcy".&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/Story?id=1777364&amp;page=2|title=Promising Brain Tumor Vaccine|publisher=ABC News|date=2006-03-28|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004, the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' of London &lt;ref name="Sundaytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article1058114.ece|title=The Irish patient is on the mend|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=April 11, 2004|author=Ciaran Hancock | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; hailed Armen as the chairman that saved the company stating that “it is one of the great corporate recovery stories.” Armen commented “ For about three months… every day, every hour was critical. Any one of many things could have made the company collapse. We were on the hook every single day until we had an agreement to sell our first major asset.”

'''Armen Partners''' &lt;br/&gt;
Prior to founding Antigenics in 1994, Armen established Armen Partners, a money management firm specializing in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and was the originator of the widely publicized{{cn|date=October 2018}} creation of the [[Immunex]] Lederle oncology business in 1993.

== Humanitarian initiatives ==
Armen is also the founder and chairman of the Children of Armenia Fund (COAF), a charitable organization established in 2003 to provide for children and communities of rural [[Armenia]]. Since its inception, COAF has implemented infrastructure improvement projects directed at ongoing impoverished conditions affecting significant numbers of people in rural Armenia. {{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 2006, the ''Daily News'' under the headline “Celebrating New Yorkers Who Make A Difference” highlighted Armen’s philanthropic achievements.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2117302.stm; http://www.independent.ie/business/world/agm-setback-for-groups-share-placing-296610.html&lt;/ref&gt; The article quoted a report by Strategem Consulting International, an independent firm hired by the United Nations, which stated “between 2003 and 2005, life in Karakert, known as Children of Armenia’s first model village, improved dramatically.”

COAF’s annual Holiday Gala and Awards dinner has become a premier event in New York raising millions of dollars from a diverse and committed community.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Their contributions have affected more than 70,000 people and these project are highlighted in a video entitled "A Formula to Eliminate Global Poverty."&lt;ref name="Sundaytimes"/&gt; A documentary charting COAF’s revitalization of rural Armenia was broadcast in 2009 involved a film crew spending extensive time on the ground capturing the effect of these comprehensive programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/11/02/fashion/02partiesCA01ready.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Evening%20Hours%20/%20Gowned%20and%20Costumed&amp;st=cse|title=Gowned and Costumed|publisher=The New York Times|author=Bill Cunningham|date=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors ==
In 2004, Armen became a recipient of the prestigious [[Ellis Island Medal of Honor]] for his humanitarian efforts in Armenia as well as his exceptional contributions to American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neco.org/profileList.php?list=a |title=Listings |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225044500/http://www.neco.org/profileList.php?list=a |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ernst &amp; Young]] recognized him as the NYC Biotechnology Entrepreneur of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=409958&amp;ticker=AGEN|title=Garo H.

Founder, in 1998, along with Ennio Doris, of Alboran SPA (with which he has implemented the first European TV Company in finance), is also co-founder in 2006 of Mobango Ltd, one of the world's first Mobile Community. Always up to date with technological innovation, Mascitelli has implemented its digital ecosystem with numerous platforms connected with www.giuseppemascitelli.com aggregator.
Giuseppe Mascitelli has been with the [[Mediolanum Group]] since its birth, making a strong imprint both to the communication side of the group and to the important strategic choices it has made. He has been CEO of [[Mediolanum Communications]] S.p.A., a board member of the [[Mediolanum Corporate]] University S.p.A. and business management consultant of [[Banca Mediolanum]] S.p.A.

==Early life and education==
Giuseppe Mascitelli was born on 9 November 1959 in [[Porto San Giorgio]], a small town in Marche overlooking the Adriatic sea. He attended a scientific high school, first in Fermo then in [[Civitanova Marche]], a school that well represented his interests towards humanistic subjects and as well as scientific ones. Strong ties together with constant patronage tie him to his father's land, [[Abruzzo]], whose mountainous harshness and proud population has always fascinated him.

He left his family at a young age to dedicate himself to his university studies, which he financed by working in various jobs. He traveled often in Europe and stopped for several months in Northern Germany near [[Marberg]] and [[Essen]] in order to become more confident with German in view of  his very complex graduation thesis.

In 1983 he graduated with top honours in History of Philosophy with a thesis on “[[Max Stirner]] - The Ego and Its Own” at the University of Urbino. In that same year he started a master in Economics at the same university, finishing in 1985. From 1983 to 1990 he shifted his attention to the financial sector, attending  training courses at Programma Italia S.p.A. (a financial course, sales, supervising, manager, top manager, 3 editions of the Kaiser course). Also in 1990 he received his final trainer diploma for the European GRID method. Finally in 1994 he completed the advanced masters from  Programma Italia S.p.A concentrated on Financial and Insurance markets.

==Career==
Giuseppe Mascitelli's has worked in the banking world and television.

===Banking===
Meeting [[Ennio Doris]] in 1983 was the turning point in Giuseppe's journey into the banking world. From 1983 to 1988 he is first an agent, then supervisor  and finally manager at Programma Itaia S.p.A. In 1988 he changed roles and became head of training for central Italy, a position that he maintained until 1990 - the year of his second turning point - that lead him to become business management consultant of the same company until 1997. This position was renewed by Banca Mediolanum S.p.A. until 2011.  From 2008 to 2011 he has also been a member of the board of Mediolanum Corporate University S.p.A.

===Creative world===
His path in communications - both in terms of promotional and management tools, as well as company training - took place parallel to his banking activities from the early 1980s. In this period a full-fledged strategy is implemented, varying from the production of a series of popular publications created to bring Italian clients closer to the investment world, and to the design and implementation of one of the first - and today's most popular - European company TV stations. In 1994 Giuseppe became  Sole Director of Filmare S.a.S, an office that he maintained until 2009. From 1998 to 1999 he was president of Magic General Media S.p.A, leaving to become, in the same year,  President and then CEO of Alboran S.p.A. until 2005. From 1996 to 2011 he has also CEO Of Mediolanum Communication S.pA., a company that was established with the aim of managing the entire communications branch (from Branding to all international events) of Banca Mediolanum.

==Communication==

===Other activities===
In the 1990s we find the design and production of one of the first and most popular in-company [[TV stations]], defined by Ennio Doris as “the real secret weapon of Banca Mediolanum”. This experience will later be applied to the creation of other company TV stations  such as [[Pirelli &amp; C. Real Estate]], [[Wellcome]] [[datamatic]] S.p.A. and the [[Deutsche Bank Group]]. In this period we have the creation and  implementation of the Mediolanum Tour, a traveling show that has involved hundreds of thousands of spectators. In the last decade  the design and the launch of the Mediolanum Channel is to be remembered, a theme channel in cooperation with Sky, and of the Mediolanum Market Forum, a cross-media format currently transmitted live in four languages -  both on the Internet platform as well as via satellite. He has been the designer and creator of all Banca Mediolanum events and conventions.

===TV programs===
Giuseppe Mascitelli has been author and creator of various television programs. In the 1990s he planned of some of the first telesales on Italian television, carried out in the Mediaset  studios in 1992 with Marco Columbro; next we find “Pensione Completa” broadcast on the syndications Rete A and Odeon TV, with the TV debut of Ennio Doris and “ Una città per cantare “ which sees the return of [[Mike Bongiorno]] live, a format that was later inherited by Maurizio Costanzo and Fiorello. Also in the 1990s he directed the  show  and created the DVD of a live Milan concert of Fausto Leali. In the last decade, he created many formats for Mediolanum Channel from “Gente di mare” to “ Piccolo fratello” but what really needs to be remembered in particular are the experimental activities  carried out in new media - an unexpected format for Italian culture - such as “My virtual boy”, the first  ideal programmable boy via Web and presented during the Future Show of the same year (the project gave rise to a movie produced by Warner Bros) and “BlackCube”, a reality format similar to Grande Fratello, in which the participants were forced into a closed environment, precisely the black cube, and they had to resolve 6 enigmas posed by a computer. Their story was filmed and transmitted both via website and satellite channels, which could be altered and enriched by public participation through special web-live interfaces. “BlackCube”, in 2001 had over 300,000 hits on line.

==Awards==
Among the main awards are, in 1995 “ Lifetime achievement Global winner” - Programma Italia S.p.A.;  2001 “Hot Bird TV Award” - Special Prize at the SAT Expo;  2004 “TV digitali in chiaro” a Mediolanum Channel for production refinement - 30 anni di Mille Canali;  2006 “TV programmes” for Piccolo Fratello - Premio Aretè  - responsible for communication;  2008 “1st  prize Convention Aziendale” with the event Anno Domini - Bea, “2nd prize Technical Excellence for the best props  for the event Anno Domini - EuBea;  2009 “1st prize Best Company Event” for Banca Mediolanum, “1st prize Best congress/convention “ with “Inauguriamo l'ottimismo” - Bea.

==Trivia==
He invented the term “Tecnocreativo” (techno creative) defining a new generation of eclectic professionals ready to operate with new technologies while maintaining a great awareness of human nature and a strong focus towards emotions.

An '''international joint venture''' (IJV) occurs when two businesses based in two or more countries form a [[partnership]]. A company that wants to explore international trade without taking on the full responsibilities of cross-border business transactions has the option of forming a [[joint venture]] with a foreign partner. International investors entering into a joint venture minimize the risk that comes with an outright [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition of a business]]. In international business development, performing [[due diligence]] on the foreign country and the partner limits the risks involved in such a business transaction.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

IJVs aid companies to form [[strategic alliance]]s,&lt;ref name="HY"&gt;[http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/jv_main.html Joint Ventures]&lt;/ref&gt; which allow them to gain competitive advantage through access to a partner's resources, including markets, technologies, capital and people. International joint ventures are viewed as a practical vehicle for [[knowledge transfer]], such as [[technology transfer]], from multinational expertise to local companies, and such knowledge transfer can contribute to the performance improvement of local companies.&lt;ref name="HY"/&gt; Within IJVs one or more of the parties is located where the operations of the IJV take place and also involve a local and foreign company.&lt;ref name="HYP"&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/faq/faq_docs/Venture.shtml The University of Iowa Center for International Finance and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic elements ==
These include:
*'''Contractual Agreement''' - IJVs are established by express contracts that consist of one or more agreements involving two or more individuals or organizations and that are entered into for a specific business purpose.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;
*'''Specific Limited Purpose and Duration''' - IJVs are formed for a specific business objective and can have a limited life span or be long-term. IJVs are frequently established for a limited duration because (a) the complementary activities involve a limited amount of assets; (b) the complementary assets have only a limited service life; and/or (c) the complementary production activities will be of only limited efficacy.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;
*'''Joint Property Interest''' - Each IJV participant contributes property, cash, or other assets and organizational capital for the pursuit of a common and specific business purpose. Thus, an IJV is not merely a contractual relationship, but rather the contributions are made to a newly formed business enterprise, usually a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership. As such, the participants acquire a joint property interest in the assets and subject matter of the IJV.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;
*'''Common Financial and Intangible Goals and Objectives''' - The IJV participants share a common expectation regarding the nature and amount of the expected financial and intangible goals and objectives of the IJV. The goals and objectives of an IJV tend to be narrowly focused, recognizing that the assets deployed by each participant represent only a portion of the overall resource base.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;
*'''Shared Profits, Losses, Management, and Control''' - The IJV participants share in the specific and identifiable financial and intangible profits and losses, as well as in certain elements of the management and control of the IJV.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;

== Reasons for forming ==
There are many motivations that lead to the formation of a JV. They include:

*'''Risk sharing''' – Risk sharing is a common reason to form a JV, particularly, in highly capital intensive industries and in industries where the high costs of product development equal a high likelihood of failure of any particular product.
*'''Economies of scale''' – If an industry has high fixed costs, a JV with a larger company can provide the economies of scale necessary to compete globally and can be an effective way by which two companies can pool resources and achieve critical mass.
*'''Market access''' – For companies that lack a basic understanding of customers and the relationship/infrastructure to distribute their products to customers, forming a JV with the right partner can provide instant access to established, efficient and effective distribution channels and receptive customer bases. This is important to a company because creating new distribution channels and identifying new customer bases can be extremely difficult, time consuming and expensive activities.
*'''Geographical constraints''' – When there is an attractive business opportunity in a foreign market, partnering with a local company is attractive to a foreign company because penetrating a foreign market can be difficult both because of a lack of experience in such market and local barriers to foreign-owned or foreign-controlled companies.
*'''Funding constraints''' – When a company is confronted with high up-front development costs, finding the right JVP can provide necessary financing and credibility with third parties.
*'''Acquisition barriers'''; Prelude to Acquisition – When a company wants to acquire another but cannot due to cost, size, or geographical restrictions or legal barriers, teaming up with a JVP is an attractive option. The JV is substantially less costly and thus less risky than complete acquisitions, and is sometimes used as a first step to a complete acquisition with the JVP. Such an arrangement allows the purchaser the flexibility to cut its losses if the investment proves less fruitful than anticipated or to acquire the remainder of the company under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;

==Due diligence==
Before entering an international joint venture, businesses are advised by business advisers to do a thorough [[due diligence]] on the country, the business, and the partner. Due diligence is the investigation of a country, business or person, for the purpose of obtaining useful information on the potential benefits, pitfalls and costs. It helps investors to make better profit and mitigate risk. It includes a thorough research about the potential partners through channels like internet, database and media search, establishing each partner's duties and responsibilities, management control, agreeing on splits of returns, exit strategies, contingency plans, etc.&lt;ref name="blog.thenello.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.thenello.com/how-to-do-your-due-diligence-when-working-with-a-joint-venture-partner// |title=How To Do Your Due Diligence When Working With A Joint Venture Partner |publisher=http://blog.thenello.com/ |date= |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; International law firms working with businesses who are considering a joint venture will use a due diligence checklist to ensure that it is a sound business development.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Benefits ==
Many of the benefits associated with international joint ventures are that they provide companies with the opportunity to obtain new capacity and expertise and they allow companies to enter into related business or new geographic markets or obtain new technological knowledge.&lt;ref name="HY"/&gt; Furthermore, international joint ventures are in most cases have a short life span, allowing companies to make short term commitments rather than long term commitments.&lt;ref name="HY"/&gt; Through international joint ventures, companies are given opportunities to increase profit margins, accelerate their revenue growth, produce new products, expand to new domestic markets, gain financial support, and share scientists or other professionals that have unique skills that will benefit the companies.&lt;ref name="HY"/&gt;

== Structure ==
International joint ventures are developed when two companies work together to meet a specific goal. For example, Company A and Company B first begin by identifying and selecting an IJV partner.&lt;ref name="I3"&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/32766096/INTERNATIONAL-JOINT-VENTURES/ International Joint Ventures]&lt;/ref&gt; This process involves several steps such as market research, partner search, evaluating options, negotiations, business valuation, business planning, and due diligence.&lt;ref name="I3"/&gt; These steps are taken on by each company. There are also legal procedures involved such as IJV agreement, ancillary agreements, and regulatory approvals.&lt;ref name="I3"/&gt; Once this process is complete, the IJV Company is formed and during this final procedure the steps taken are formation and management.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;

Structuring IJVs can pose a challenge when parties are from two different cultural backgrounds or jurisdictions&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt; Once both parties have come to an agreement on fundamental issues such as commercial nature, scope and mutual objectives of the joint venture, the parties must decide on where, geographically, the venture will take place and what the legal structure for the venture will look like.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt; Most of the time, the structure agreed on will be between different types of corporations, partnerships, or some form of a limited liability company.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;

===Limited liability===
[[Limited liability]] allows to limit debts and losses to the assets of the venture and protect the assets of the members themselves from being liable for the venture's debts.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In a [[limited liability partnership]] (LLP), the partners have limited liability and can be held liable only to the extent of their capital investments. In the U.S., in addition to limited liability partners, the law requires that every limited partnership have at least one general partner who has unlimited liability. The general partner can be held responsible for all the liabilities of the limited partnership. Many ventures resolve this problem by forming a [[special purpose entity]], usually a limited liability company or a corporation, which then acts as the general partner.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

A joint venture formed as [[limited liability company]] (LLC) offers protection to the partners by providing limited liability to all of its members. Unlike a limited liability partnership (LLP), there is no requirement to have a general partner who has unlimited liability and can be held responsible for all the liabilities.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Both limited partnerships and limited companies in the U.S. enjoy the advantage of being pass-through entities for U.S. tax purposes. The limited partnership does not pay taxes. Instead, the tax liability of the venture is allocated to the members of the LLP in proportion to their interests in the venture.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Management ==
There are two types of international joint ventures: ''dominant parent'' and ''shared management''. Within ''dominant parent'' IJVs, all projects are managed by one parent who decides on all the functional managers for the venture.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt; The board of directors, which is made up of executives from each parent, also plays a key role in managing the venture by making all the operating and strategic decisions.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt; A dominant parent enterprise is beneficial where an international joint venture parent is selected for reasons outside of managerial input.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;

On the other hand, ''shared management'' ventures consist of both parents managing the enterprise.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt; Each parent organizes functional managers and executives that will be within the board of directors.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt; In this form of management, there are also two types of shared management ventures. The first type is 50:50 IJV and this is where each partner puts in 50% of the equity in return for 50% participating control.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt; The second type is where both partners can negotiate that not all shared management ventures are 50:50 and that one partner has more than a co-equal role in the IJV.&lt;ref name="HYP"/&gt;

== Finance ==
When two or more partners get together and form an international joint venture agreement, they must decide early on in regards to what the financial structure will entail as this will aid in management and control.&lt;ref name="I3"/&gt; Some of the steps include establishing the capital required to start the IJV, the impact of securing a strong strategic alliance partner, and financial reporting.&lt;ref name="I3"/&gt; Once an arrangement is made, a tax-planned joint venture will be created which will aid in maximizing the after-tax returns.&lt;ref name="I3"/&gt;

== Factors affecting IJV ==
=== Economic factors ===
*&lt;big&gt;'''Poor formation and planning'''&lt;/big&gt;
Problems that arise in joint ventures are usually as a result of poor planning or the parties involved being too hasty to set up shop. For example, a marketing strategy may fail if a product was inappropriate for the joint venture or if the parties involved failed to appropriately assess the factors involved . Parties must pay attention to several analysis both of the environment and customers they hope to operate in. Failure to do this sets off a bad tone for the venture, creating future problems.&lt;ref name="bus"&gt;A short course in international joint venture by Alan Gutterman&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;big&gt;'''Unexpected poor financial performance'''&lt;/big&gt;
One of the fastest ways for a joint venture is financial disputes between parties. This usually happens when the financial performance is poorer than expected either due to poor sales, cost overruns or others. Poor financial performance could also be as a result of poor planning by the parties before setting up a joint venture, failure to approach the market with sufficient management efficiency and unanticipated changes in the market situation. A good solution to this is to evaluate financial situations thorough before and during very step of the joint venture.&lt;ref name="bus" /&gt;

* &lt;big&gt;'''Management problems'''&lt;/big&gt;
One of the biggest problems of joint ventures is the ineffective blending of managers who are not used to working together of have entirely different ways of approaching issues affecting the organization. It is a well-known fact that many joint ventures come apart due to misunderstanding over leadership strategies. For a successful joint venture, there has to be understanding and compromise between parties, respect and integration of the strengths of both sides to overcome the weaker points and make their alliance stronger.&lt;ref name="bus" /&gt;

* &lt;big&gt;'''Inappropriate management structure'''&lt;/big&gt;
In a bid to have equal rights in the venture, there could be a misfit of managers. As a result, there is a major slowdown of decision making processes. Daily operational decisions that are best made quickly for more efficiency of the business tends to be slowed down because there is now a ‘committee’ that is in place to make sure both parties support every little decision. This could distract from the bigger picture leading to major problems in the long run.&lt;ref name="bus" /&gt;

===Economic environment of IJV===
The ultimate goal of a successful JV partnership is more customers and a stronger body. To ensure a JV's partnerships are as profitable as possible, it helps to look at them from the customer's point of view. The features a JV partnership should aim to address for an effective marketing campaign: Channeling the expertise and strengths of both parties to maximize value for the customers and stakeholders while downplaying the weaknesses and presenting a united font.&lt;ref name="bus" /&gt;

===Cultures of IJV ===
When a joint venture is formed, it is an attempt at blending two or more cultures in the hope of leveraging on the strength of each party. Lack of understanding of the cultures of the individual parties poses a huge problem if not addressed. A common problem in these multi-cultural enterprises is that the culture is not considered in their initial formation. It is usually assumed that the cultural issues will be addressed later when the new unit has been created. Usually, compromises are reached and certain cultural from the parties are kept on while others are others are either out rightly discarded or modified.&lt;ref name="bus" /&gt;

== Pros and cons for IJV ==
The joint venture is becoming a popular way for companies that outsource their operations to retain a piece of the ownership pie. The creation of a new legal entity during the launch of a joint venture comes with its share of ups and downs.

=== On the plus side ===
*Joint ventures enable companies to share technology and complementary IP assets for the production and delivery of innovative goods and services.&lt;ref name="business"&gt;Business Briefing 2009: Trade Policy Available from: http://www.intracen.org/btp/wtn/newsletters/2009/ip_6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*For the smaller organization with insufficient finance and/or specialist management skills, the joint venture can prove an effective method of obtaining the necessary resources to enter a new market. This can be especially true in attractive markets, where local contacts, access to distribution, and political requirements may make a joint venture the preferred or even legally required solution.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*Joint ventures can be used to reduce political friction and improve local/national acceptability of the company.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*Joint ventures may provide specialist knowledge of local markets, entry to required channels of distribution, and access to supplies of raw materials, government contracts and local production facilities.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*In a growing number of countries, joint ventures with host governments have become increasingly important. These may be formed directly with State-owned enterprises or directed toward national champions.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*There has been growth in the creation of temporary consortium companies and alliances, to undertake particular projects that are considered to be too large for individual companies to handle alone (e.g. major defence initiatives, civil engineering projects, new global technological ventures).&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*Exchange controls may prevent a company from exporting capital and thus make the funding of new overseas subsidiaries difficult. The supply of know-how may therefore be used to enable a company to obtain an equity stake in a joint venture, where the local partner may have access to the required funds.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;

=== On the minus side ===
*A major problem is that joint ventures are very difficult to integrate into a global strategy that involves substantial cross-border trading. In such circumstances, there are almost inevitably problems concerning inward and outward transfer pricing and the sourcing of exports, in particular, in favour of wholly owned subsidiaries in other countries.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*The trend toward an integrated system of global cash management, via a central treasury, may lead to conflict between partners when the corporate headquarters endeavours to impose limits or even guidelines on cash and working capital usage, foreign exchange management, and the amount and means of paying remittable profits.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*Another serious problem occurs when the objectives of the partners are, or become, incompatible. For example, the multinational enterprise may have a very different attitude to risk than its local partner, and may be prepared to accept short-term losses in order to build market share, to take on higher levels of debt, or to spend more on advertising. Similarly, the objectives of the participants may well change over time, especially when wholly owned subsidiary alternatives may occur for the multinational enterprise with access to the joint venture market.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*Problems occur with regard to management structures and staffing of joint ventures.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;
*Many joint ventures fail because of a conflict in tax interests between the partners.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;

== Disputes and agreements ==
=== Disputes ===
When two or more partners agree on an international joint venture, there are possibilities for disputes to arise. Particularly in IJVs, there can be issues between the partners who are likely to want their home country's governing law and jurisdiction to apply to any disputes that may come up; therefore, to avoid such a problem, a neutral governing law and jurisdiction is chosen in some cases.&lt;ref name="Cr"&gt;[http://www.internationalresourcejournal.com/features/features_april_10/cross-border_joint_ventures.html Cross-border joint ventures-getting the dispute resolution clause right]&lt;/ref&gt; A popular dispute resolution technique used in IJVs is arbitration; however, many times a court process is given priority as this system has more authority.&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt; Other dispute resolution strategies utilized are mediation and litigation.&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt;

=== Agreements ===
Entering into an international joint venture agreement begins with the selection of partners and then generally this process continues to a Memorandum of Understanding or a Letter of Intent is signed by both parties.&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;[http://madaan.com/jointventures.html International Joint Ventures and Agreements]&lt;/ref&gt; The Memorandum of Understanding is a document describing an agreement between parties. On the other hand, a Letter of Intent is a document outlining an agreement between the parties before the agreement is finalized. Before signing an IJV, specific aspects of the agreement must be addressed such as applicable law, holding shares, transfer of shares, board of directors, [[dividend policy]], funding, access, confidentiality and termination.&lt;ref name="ag"/&gt;

== IJV in different countries ==
=== IJV in China ===
An IJV is an attractive way to get into Chinese market for the people who are unfamiliar with the completed [[culture]] and the less opened market. But [[China]] is becoming more and more global and familiar to the world. IJV is fading out because of the practical difficulties in picking a proper partner, [[management]], [[technology]] transfer profit sharing and soon.

There are two main types of IJV in [[China]]: ''Equity Joint Ventures'' and ''Cooperative Joint Ventures''.

*Equity joint ventures (EJVs):
An equity joint venture is a partnership between an overseas and a Chinese individual, enterprises or financial organizations approved by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]].&lt;ref name="Chinese Market"&gt;[http://www.starmass.com/en/investment_in_china.htm Chinese Market]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies in an equity joint venture share both mutual rewards, risks and losses according to the ratio of investment.&lt;ref name="Chinese Market"/&gt;
A minimum of 25% the capital must be contributed by the foreign partners, and no minimum investment for the Chinese partners.&lt;ref name="How"&gt;[http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/topic/chinainvest/foreigntradelaw/200708/20070804963587.html How to establish an equity joint venture in China?]&lt;/ref&gt;
A joint venture is free to hire Chinese nationals without the interference from government employment industries by abiding Chinese Labor Law, and purchase land, build their own buildings, and privileges prevented to representative offices.&lt;ref name="How"/&gt;

*Cooperative joint ventures (CJVs)
CJVs are a rather unevenly regulated form of IJV between Chinese and foreign-based companies. They are usually found in venture, which are both technology-based and have a substantial requirement for [[fixed assets]], for example infrastructure and volume manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xcdacc.cn/en/show_info.asp?InfoID=91 What is a cooperative joint venture?]&lt;/ref&gt;

No minimum foreign contribution is required to initiate cooperative venture and the contributions made by the investors are not necessarily expressed in a monetary value. These contributions can include excluded in the equity joint venture process can be contributed such as labor, resources, and services.&lt;ref name="Cooperative"&gt;[http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/topic/chinainvest/foreigntradelaw/200708/20070804963583.html How to establish a cooperative joint venture in [[China]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater flexibility in the structuring of a cooperative venture is also permissible including the structure of the [[organization]], [[management]], and [[assets]].&lt;ref name="Cooperative"/&gt;

=== IJV in Turkey ===
International joint ventures have played a significant role in the reform and liberalization of the laws governing foreign investors as part of [[Turkey]]'s economic program adopted after 2001. [[Turkey]] lies on the borders between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] and is used as a way to achieve strategic goals to enter into the Asian or European market, which is important for those wanting to entre [[European Union|EU]] market since Turkey signed the European Customs Union (ECU).&lt;ref name="Turkey"&gt;[http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=61292 Turkey: Establishing Joint Ventures In Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish Accounting Standards Board requires that all enterprises established under the Turkish Commercial Code in [[Turkey]] must prepare statutory financial statements in compliance with the Turkish Accounting Standards Board, which makes all accounting data transparent and more reliable for all parties involved.&lt;ref name="Turkey"/&gt; Under Turkish Law, a joint venture may be formed under two ‘umbrellas’: Commercial Company, governed by the Turkish Commercial Code or Ordinary Company, Governed by the Turkish Code of Obligations.&lt;ref name="Turkey"/&gt;

== Examples of successful IJVs ==
=== Aera Energy ===
[[Aera Energy]] covers a large area of California. The state's leading oil and gas producer (accounting for 30% of California's total production), [[Aera Energy]]'s properties extend from the Los Angeles Basin in the south to Coalinga in the north. It has daily production of 165,000 barrels of oil and 50 million cubic feet of natural gas and boasts proved onshore and offshore reserves of 800 million barrels of oil equivalent.&lt;ref name="Aera"&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/53/53891.html Aera Energy LLC Company Profile] 
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aera Energy]] also has interests in real estate operations (in partnership with homebuilder [[Toll Brothers]]). The exploration and production company is a joint venture of affiliates of [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref name="Aera"/&gt;

===Omega Navigation Enterprises Inc.===
Omega Navigation Enterprises Inc. is an international provider of marine transportation services focusing on seaborne transportation of refined petroleum products.&lt;ref name="Omega"&gt;[http://www.omeganavigation.com/corporateoverview.html Omega Navigation Enterprises Inc. –Company overview]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the vessels, namely the Omega Duke, is owned through a 50% controlled joint venture with Topley Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore International AG ([[Glencore]]).&lt;ref name="Omega"/&gt; They have also formed an equal partnership joint venture company with Topley Corporation, namely Megacore Shipping Ltd.&lt;ref name="Omega"/&gt;

'''King Pharmaceuticals''', is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Pfizer]] based in [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. Before being acquired by Pfizer, it was the world's 39th largest [[pharmaceutical company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingpharm.com/default_king.htm Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kingpharm.com/fast_facts.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pharmexec.findpharma.com/pharmexec/data/articlestandard//pharmexec/512007/480240/article.pdf Pharmaceutical Executive - 2006 Top 50 Pharmaceutical Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 12, 2010, King was acquired by [[Pfizer]] for $14.25 per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/pfizer-to-buy-king-pharmaceuticals-for-3-6-billion/ | work=The New York Times | title=Pfizer to Buy King Pharmaceuticals for $3.6 Billion | date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; King produced a wide range of [[pharmaceutical]]s, including [[Ramipril|Altace]] for [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] prevention, [[Levothyroxine|Levoxyl]] for [[hypothyroidism]], [[Zaleplon|Sonata]], a [[Sedative|sleeping aid]],  and [[Metaxalone|Skelaxin]], a [[muscle relaxant]].  King Pharmaceuticals operated manufacturing facilities in [[Bristol, Tennessee]]; [[Rochester, Michigan]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]; and [[Middleton, Wisconsin]]. They employed approximately 2,700 people including a sales force of over 1,000 individuals.

King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Tennessee in 1993. According to the King Pharmaceutcals, Inc. Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the wholly owned subsidiaries of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; King Pharmaceuticals Research and Development, Inc.; Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.; Parkedale Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; King Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.; and Monarch Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

==Company history==
King Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1993 [[John M. Gregory (businessman)|John M. Gregory]], [[Randal J. Kirk]], Joseph "Joe" R. Gregory, Jefferson "Jeff" J. Gregory, and James E. Gregory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/King-Pharmaceuticals-Inc-Company-History.html King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Company History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20030201091134/http://www.kingpharm.com/chairman.htm King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Message From Our Chairman.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, King acquired a former [[King University|King College]] campus plant in Bristol, Tennessee. The {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility was purchased for $1.18 million from RSR Pharmaceutical, who had been using it after Beecham merged with [[SmithKline]].  King initially manufactured drugs for other pharmaceutical companies, but soon established a strategy of acquiring branded prescription drugs, which have a much higher gross margin than contract manufactured drugs.

In February 1998, King acquired 15 branded pharmaceuticals, a sterile products manufacturing facility located in Rochester, Michigan that it called the "Parkedale Facility") and some contract manufacturing contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King Pharmaceuticals, Amendment 8 to Form S-1|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=680633|publisher=NASDAQ|date=June 2, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 1998 King had placed its sterile products business into a subsidiary it named Parkedale Pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: King Pharmaceuticals and Hoechst Marion Roussel Sign an Agreement for One Of The Largest Single Product Transactions in Emerging Pharmaceutical Sector {{!}} Evaluate|url=http://www.evaluategroup.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&amp;id=173748|publisher=King, via Evaluate|date=December 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Pharmaceuticals obtained about twenty smaller branded drugs from the start up of the company until it went public in June 1998. The King Pharmaceuticals subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals acquired one of its most profitable branded drugs, Altace, later the same year on December 18, 1998 from [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst Marion Roussel]].

==U.S. marketing and distribution rights to Altace™==

During 1994, the U.S. [[National Right to Life Committee]] announced an anti-[[RU-486]] [[boycott]], targeting all Hoechst pharmaceutical products including [[Altace]]™. By September 17, the [[pro-life]] organization Pharmacists For Life International joined the NRLC anti-RU-486 boycott "...against the American subsidiary of Hoechst, AG Hoechst-Roussel, Hoechst-Celanese, its generic subsidiary Copley Pharmaceuticals and the agricultural Hoechst subsidiary"&lt;ref name="pln-0419"&gt;[http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/ProLife.News/1994/pln-0419.txt "3) Pharmacists For Life Joins International Boycott"]. Life Communications. November, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; while asking U.S. consumers to "...focus on key Hoechst drugs which have the most economic impact rather than taking an across-the-board shotgun approach"&lt;ref name="pln-0419"/&gt; and specifically targeting Altace as a boycott list item.&lt;ref name="pln-0419"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20080220223236/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp940708/07080818.htm "Abortion Foes To Boycott Drugs (Altace) Made By RU-486 Manufacturer"]. ''The Virginia-Pilot''. Associated Press. July 8, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoechst merged with Marion Merrill Dow of Kansas City, Missouri in 1995, forming the Hoechst U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary Hoechst Marion Roussel (HMR). Altace was bringing in under $90 million in U.S. revenues for HMR and Hoechst had stopped promoting Altace within the United States.,&lt;ref name="136_print"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080403070806/http://www.forbesimg.com/forbes/2002/1028/136_print.html "Faith Healers: The born-again Gregory brothers worked a financial miracle from cast-off drug brands"]. Forbes. Zina Moukheiber. October 28, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and King Pharmaceuticals President Jefferson "Jeff" Gregory also began negotiations in 1995 with Hoechst to acquire U.S. distribution rights to Altace.&lt;ref name="136_print"/&gt;

The King Pharmaceuticals wholly owned subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (another brother of John Gregory - Joseph Gregory - was then the president of Monarch Pharmaceuticals) acquired ownership of the U.S. distribution and marketing rights to Altace and other Hoescht products from Hoescht AG subsidiary Hoechst Marion Roussel of Kansas City, Missouri on December 18, 1998, and&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.custservices.com/news.asp?up=8 "Monarch Pharmaceuticals acquired"]. sanofi-aventis Group. December 18, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; following a January 1999 merger a few weeks later with [[Rhône-Poulenc]], Hoechst assumed the new corporate identity of [[Aventis]]).

In 2001, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked John Gregory among the 400 richest Americans. The bulk of Gregory's personal fortune was due in large part due to the ability of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to reintroduce the Hoechst branded prescription drug Altace back into the U.S. market under the King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals brand following the 1998 U.S. marketing and distribution agreement between King Pharmaceuticals/Monarch Pharmaceuticals and AG Hoechst/HMR.

In late December 1998, King Pharmaceuticals (d.b.a. Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) purchased the U.S. marketing and distribution rights of the company's most successful drug, Altace, for $362.5 million from the U.S. subsidiary of [[Hoechst AG]], Hoechst Marion Roussel of Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.twst.com/notes/articles/jab202.html "King Pharmaceuticals CEO focuses on patented products".&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of increasing the number of sales representatives and the findings of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ([http://www.chd-taskforce.com/pdf/sk_hope.pdf HOPE]), Altace sales skyrocketed. Using profits from Altace, King continued to add product lines, the most significant purchases being [[Levoxyl]], [[Thrombin]], and [[Cytomel]] in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Also in 2000, seeing fewer opportunities to obtain branded drugs, the company acquired an R&amp;D company based in North Carolina.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In 2002, King and [[Meridian Medical Technologies Inc.]] agreed that King would purchase Merdian for $247.8 million in cash; Meridian was a manufacturer of autoinjectors, including EpiPen, an [[epinephrine autoinjector]].&lt;ref&gt;King Pharmaceuticals Oct 21, 2002. [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/king-pharmaceuticals-to-acquire-meridian-medical-technologies-76364227.html Press Release: King Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Meridian Medical Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was completed in January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;King Pharmaceuticals [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1047699/000095014404006620/g89681e11vk.htm Form 11K] filed For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, John Gregory stepped down as CEO, and his brother Jefferson Gregory took over. Then in 2004, Jeff Gregory stepped down as well after the SEC began investigations into King’s Medicaid billing practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/_tsclsii/stocks/robertsteyer/10144369.html TheStreet.com : King Pharmaceuticals CEO to Step Down | Robert Steyer | KG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The board named Brian Markison to replace him. Soon after, in July 2004, a deal was made for [[Mylan Laboratories]] to acquire King for $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109079748272873376?mod=googlewsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Leila | last1=Abboud | first2=Dennis K. | last2=Berman | title=Mylan to Buy King Pharmaceuticals | date=July 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors, most notably [[Carl Icahn]], were critical of the merger, saying that Mylan was overpaying for King. The next year the deal was called off.

In 2008 King Pharmaceuticals acquired Alpharma Pharmaceuticals to expand into the pain treatment market.  From the acquisition, King gained the patents on the pain management drugs, Flector and Embeda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dddmag.com/news-King-Pharmaceuticals-Acquires-Alpharma.aspx King Pharmaceuticals Acquires Alpharma]  They also gained a completely separate animal health division, which focuses on the many agricultural and animal health needs of livestock animals.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisition ==

On October 12, 2010, [[Pfizer]] Inc. ({{NYSE|PFE}}) announced it would acquire Bristol-based King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for a total cost to Pfizer of $3.6 billion in cash or $14.25 per share. The acquisition was expected to expand Pfizer's product line of pain relief and management medication by adding King products such as Embeda, Avinza, and the Flector Patch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingpharm.com/Investors/News_Details.cfm?news_item_id=564 Pfizer to Acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other product lines that made King attractive to Pfizer included the [[EpiPen]] for emergency delivery of medications and the Alpharma animal health line.&lt;ref name=PfizerMarch2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.com/news/press_releases/pfizer_press_release_archive.jsp?guid=20110301006102en&amp;source=2011&amp;page=14 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630050306/http://www.pfizer.com/news/press_releases/pfizer_press_release_archive.jsp?guid=20110301006102en&amp;source=2011&amp;page=14 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |title=Pfizer Completes Acquisition Of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Pfizer and King begin joint operations on March 1, 2011 |date=March 1, 2011 |publisher=Pfizer |type=press release }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Borovoi was born in 1948 in [[Moscow]] and is the son of a math professor. He is a graduate of [[Moscow State University]] Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics (1974). In 1990, he founded the first Russian commodities market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bilked Russian Investors Search for Redemption|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/30/world/bilked-russian-investors-search-for-redemption.html|website=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=19 July 2018|date=30 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A market grows in Russia|url=https://www.forbes.com|website=www.forbes.com|accessdate=19 July 2018|date=8 June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;and was its president from 1990 to 1992. He also opened the first clearing bank, an investment company and the first business-news wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out of Russia: Moscow's father of capitalism sires a political party|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/out-of-russia-moscows-father-of-capitalism-sires-a-political-party-1550643.html|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2016|date=10 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a financial director of Russia's Open Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bozaboza.narod.ru/borovoy.html Где дремлют мёртвые]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 he created an [[Economic Freedom Party]] ({{Lang-ru|Партия экономической свободы (ПЭС)}}, ''Partiya Ekonomicheskoi svobody'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Партия экономической свободы (ПЭС) Лидер - Константин Боровой.|url=http://www.panorama.ru/works/vybory/party/borovoy.html|website=Panorama.ru|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party ran in the [[Russian legislative election, 1995|1995 parliamentary elections]], but received 0.13% of the proportional representation vote, failing to cross the [[electoral threshold]]. However, it did win a constituency seat in the [[State Duma]], taken by Borovoi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Nicole J.|title=Russian Foreign Policy and the CIS|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134403592|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=BEqBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Konstantin+Borovoi+State+Duma+Party+of+Economic+Freedom&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wvjn74Wg6c&amp;sig=Qyq56YHDFwbEeh1nOzVw8PVNSpo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIlcvKwaPPAhXiBcAKHXsgA9MQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Konstantin%20Borovoi%20State%20Duma%20Party%20of%20Economic%20Freedom&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was deregistered in 2003.

Up until December 1999, Konstantin Borovoi was a deputy of the [[Russian Parliament]] (Duma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keefe|first1=Patrick Radden|title=Chatter: Uncovering the Echelon Surveillance Network and the Secret World of Global Eavesdropping|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9781588365330|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=6sahBZQXbNkC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=Konstantin+Borovoi+deputy+of+the+Russian+Parliament&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oyHEoiD5JD&amp;sig=lLiukBiSFcKIven4GyVthV6stUA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8ycT5waPPAhVrLcAKHWyYDIYQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Konstantin%20Borovoi%20deputy%20of%20the%20Russian%20Parliament&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2010 together with [[Valeriya Novodvorskaya]] he created a liberal political party, Western Choice. On 17 March he was elected its president.

==Political activism==
Borovoi self-identifies primarily as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[politician]]. In 1991 he participated in the resistance to the Communist Coup d'État in Russia [[State Committee on the State of Emergency]] (GKChP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wheeling and Dealing, Moscow Style; Soviet Entrepreneurs Lobbying Hard to End Socialist Stagnation|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1086724.html|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=19 July 2018|date=26 September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 August 2001 he and the 2,000 members of his stock exchange carried a huge flag of Russia to the [[White House (Moscow)|White House]], Russia's parliament building. In the spring of 2010 he was among the 34 first signatories of the online anti-Putin campaign "[[Putin must go]]" (Путин должен уйти).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kborovoi.livejournal.com/35500.html |title=Konstantin Borovoi's blog, 16 March 2010 |publisher=Livejournal.com |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305151607/http://kborovoi.livejournal.com/35500.html |archivedate= 5 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was begun by a coalition of opposition to Putin who regard his rule as lacking any rule of law. Together with [[Valeriya Novodvorskaya]] he made video clips which he published on [[Live Journal]], [[Facebook]] and [[Youtube]]. In 2012 he created a campaign called "Russia without Hitler". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Liberals Growing Uneasy With Alliances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/world/europe/russian-liberals-weigh-alliance-with-nationalists.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=70BBCEF42CEF88B52BFDEEED3F95B39E&amp;gwt=pay|accessdate=19 July 2018|date=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he created the Valeriya Novodvorskaya Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jevgeni Krištafovitš: Kuidas mu emakeelest tehakse okupatsioonikeel|url=http://www.delfi.ee/archive/jevgeni-kristafovits-kuidas-mu-emakeelest-tehakse-okupatsioonikeel?id=63995631|website=Delfi.ee|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:LeadingCompanyJVDCorporateHQScreenshot.jpg|left|thumb|This player is focusing on adjusting the levels of production at his JVD (JVC) corporate headquarters.]]

The traditional definition of a '''leading company''' is a corporation that currently dominates the "corporate wars" against their competitors. Its [[employee]]s are considered by most people to be winning the "[[rat race]]."

Both versions of this game were released to an exclusively [[Japan]]ese market. However, the NEC PC-9801 version has sharper [[Computer graphics|graphics]] and the ability to use a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]]. Instead of abstract colors (to depict control of each square of the board), buildings are used to depict a typical Japanese residential neighborhood. A [[Amusement park|theme park]] is visibily shown on an island in the PC-9801 version to depict recreational opportunities while the interior of the corporate headquarters is seen in the Sharp X68000 version.

The game challenges young people to create their own business empire by researching and marketing better [[VHS]] machines for the [[Demographics of Japan|Japanese consumers]]. In both version of the game, the player is introduced to jazzy instrumental song being played in the background while [[neon]] pictures of various people fly across the screen. As of 2011, there has been no attempt to produce an [[English language]] version for this game either through official channels or through unofficial emulator translator groups. This game is considered to be in Japanese for the full duration of the game, making literacy skills in Japanese mandatory. Only the brand names themselves use [[ASCII]] letters; all other words use the [[Japanese alphabet]]. There are only two time periods in the game and [[jazz music]] plays throughout the entire game.

The player can either start in the 1970s when [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] were beginning to be researched in Japan or in the [[1980s in Japan|1980s]] when VHS (and video cassette recorders) were beginning to come of age.&lt;ref name="ocn"/&gt; Up to eight buildings can be constructed on the corporation's property to build and research new technology. However, three buildings are already established at the start of the game. Each product that he or she manufactures has a separate [[profit chart]]. When an older model goes down in profits, research and manufacture a newer one (don't forget to discontinue the older one first) and make more money from willing Japanese customers.&lt;ref name="ocn"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://archive.is/03jpd| title = Basic game overview | publisher = AXL | date = | accessdate = 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered to be the job of the player to try to keep his chosen corporation profitable by creating new VHS machines while making sure that people still spend money on the ones being made.&lt;ref name="ocn"/&gt; If they go down to zero or less, then his or her company goes [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. At this point, he or she loses the game. When a company goes bankrupt, a television news screen appears with the English word "[[Dissolution (law)|DISSOLVED]]" right on the picture caption.

Li Yonghong was born in Guantang Village, Daqiao Town, [[Huazhou, Guangdong|Huazhou]], [[Maoming]], Guangdong Province.&lt;ref name="Nanfang Weekend"/&gt; He also had a citizenship in Hong Kong S.A.R. of China by migrating there in 1994 (claimed by himself),&lt;ref name=csrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/shanghai/xzcf/201401/t20140116_242648.htm|title=行政处罚决定书：沪［2013］1号|date=29 November 2013|access-date=13 April 2017|publisher=China Securities Regulatory Commission (Shanghai Bureau)|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duolun2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cninfo.com.cn/finalpage/2011-12-06/60287610.PDF|title=详式权益变动报告书|date=6 December 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun|publisher=hosted by cninfo.com.cn|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered as a "foreign" investor in mainland China due to separate legal jurisdiction of Hong Kong from the rest of China. 

==Career==
According to a C.V. provided by Li Yonghong to Duolun Industry, Li Yonghong was the director and general manager of a Hong Kong incorporated company Enson Enterprises Limited ({{zh|t=安順企業有限公司}}) from 1994 to 1997 (a company dissolved by striking-off in 2000); the director and general manager of a [[Chongqing]]-based company ({{zh|s=爱普科技|l=Aipu Technology}}) from 1997 to 2005, as well as chairman and CEO of Hong Kong-incorporated "Grand Dragon International Holdings Co., Ltd." from 2005.&lt;ref name=Duolun2011/&gt;

However, according to the filings in Hong Kong Companies Registry, there was no such Li Yonghong in the board of directors of Enson Enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;Annual Return in 1995, 1996, 1997 of Enson Enterprises to Hong Kong Companies Registry&lt;/ref&gt; nor in Grand Dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Return in 2006, 2007, 2016, 2017 of Grand Dragon to Hong Kong Companies Registry&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Li Yonghong was the director of China Power Group (HK) Limited ({{zh|t=華力寶集團(香港)有限公司}}), Hong Kong China Power Books Publication Co., Ltd. ({{zh|t=香港華力寶圖書出版有限公司}}), Noble Wisdom Development Limited ({{zh|t=卓彥發展有限公司}}) and LYH Investment Limited, according to the database of Hong Kong Companies Registry.

==A.C. Milan==
In August 2016, [[Fininvest]], the parent company of Italian football club [[A.C. Milan]], signed a preliminary agreement with a Chinese investment management company '''Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Co., Ltd.''' ({{zh|s=中欧体育投资管理长兴有限公司}}) to sell the club for €740&amp;nbsp;million (including €220&amp;nbsp;million indebtedness of the company), valued on 30 June 2016 (A further €90&amp;nbsp;million cost of the club from 1 July to the closing date&lt;ref name=pressreleaseApril2017/&gt; was added to the valuation). Sino-Europe Sports paid Fininvest €100&amp;nbsp;million immediately after the deal as a deposit, and the closing date of the deal was set at December 2016.&lt;ref name="selling"&gt;{{cite web |title=Comunicato Stampa – Milan: Fininvest firma preliminare di vendita con cordata cinese |trans-title=Press Release – Milan: Fininvest signs preliminary selling agreement with Chinese group of investors |url=http://www.fininvest.it/assets/press/it/CS_Fininvest-Milan_5.08.16.pdf |work=fininvest.it |publisher=[[Fininvest]] |date=5 August 2016 |accessdate=9 August 2016 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fininvest.it/assets/press/en/CS%20ENG_caparra%20Milan_6.9.16.pdf|title=Fininvest: receipt of 85 million euros, the second installment of the down payment for the purchase of AC Milan|date=6 September 2016|access-date=6 September 2016|publisher=Fininvest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sino-Europe Sports, registered in [[Changxing County]], according to Chinese Government's National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, was solely owned by mainland Chinese citizen Chen Huashan ({{zh|s=陈华山}}) with a [[share capital]] of just {{CNY|100&amp;nbsp;million}}.&lt;ref name=Chinesedatabase&gt;Filings in National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was reported that Li Yonghong and a private equity fund ({{zh|s=海峡中欧私募投资基金}}) of [[Haixia Capital Management]] were the true owner of Sino-Europe Sports.&lt;ref name="selling"/&gt; Moreover, Sino-Europe Sports was represented by David Han Li in the signing of the contracts with Fininvest.&lt;ref name="selling"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pressreleaseApril2017/&gt;

In the same month Sino-Europe Sports found a private equity fund (incorporated as a [[limited partnership]] as {{lang|zh|中欧体育投资长兴合伙企业}}&lt;ref name=Chinesedatabase/&gt;) to raise fund to acquire Milan, which Chinese listed company [[Rongyu Group]] (formerly known as Jilin Yongda Group) signed an agreement to subscribe {{CNY|300&amp;nbsp;million}} deferred share, which would only paid-in the capital when the fund raise enough capital in ordinary and preference share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cninfo.com.cn/cninfo-new/disclosure/szse_sme/bulletin_detail/true/1202354621?announceTime=2016-06-03%2011:49|title=关于全资子公司永大创新金融服务(深圳)有限公司拟参与投资产业并购基金的公告|date=2 June 2016|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=Jilin Yongda Group|publisher=Hosted by cninfo.com.cn|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cninfo.com.cn/cninfo-new/disclosure/szse_sme/bulletin_detail/true/1202562697?announceTime=2016-08-13|title=关于中欧体育投资管理长兴有限公司与Fininvest S.p.A.签署收购A.C.米兰俱乐部99.93%股权协议的公告|date=12 August 2016|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=Jilin Yongda Group|publisher=Hosted by cninfo.com.cn|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sino-Europe Sports failed to pay the residual sum in December, and the deal was delayed to March 2017. Sino-Europe Sports paid a second deposit of €100&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fininvest.it/assets/press/en/Joint%20PR%20Fininvest-SES_7.12.16.pdf|title=AC Milan: agreement for the closing by March 3rd 2017.

The holding company owned 11.75% shares of the listed company as the largest shareholder at 31 December 2011.&lt;ref name=csrc/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duolun2011AR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2012-03-20/600696_2011_n.pdf|title=2011 Annual Report|date=20 March 2012|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Yonghong acquired the holding company in December 2011 for {{CNY|360&amp;nbsp;million}}&lt;ref name=Duolun2011/&gt; and sold in May–June 2012 for {{CNY|340&amp;nbsp;million}}.&lt;ref name=csrc/&gt; Before the deal, the holding company had already faced financial difficulties, which pledged 11.75% shares of the listed company to [[Bohai Trust]] in October 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2011-10-22/600696_20111022_1.pdf|title=大股东股权质押的公告|date=22 October 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as selling a further 15.22% shares from April to September 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2011-09-21/600696_20110921_2.pdf|title=简式权益变动报告书|date=21 September 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional 9.53% shares in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2011-11-19/600696_20111119_2.pdf|title=简式权益变动报告书|date=19 November 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2011-11-24/600696_20111124_1.pdf|title=关于大股东减持公司股份的公告|date=24 November 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2011-11-25/600696_20111125_1.pdf|title=关于大股东减持公司股份的公告|date=25 November 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pledge of 35.82% shares of the listed company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2011-04-01/600696_2010_n.pdf|title=2010 Annual Report|date=1 April 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; (to [[Hua Xia Bank]] and [[New China Trust]]) were only released in April&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2011-04-13/600696_20110413_1.pdf|title=大股东股权解押的公告|date=13 April 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2011-09-10/600696_20110910_1.pdf|title=大股东股权解押的公告|date=10 September 2011|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the pledge of the 11.75% share of the listed company by the holding company was released by Bohai Trust. However, the holding company, under the new owner Xian Yan ({{zh|s=鲜言}}), pledged the entire 11.75% shares back to Li Yonghong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2013-07-08/600696_20130709_1.pdf|title=大股东股权解押及质押的公告|date=9 July 2013|access-date=13 April 2017|work=Duolun Industry|publisher=Shanghai Stock Exchange|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the pledged shares were released in April 2014 and May 2014, only sold by the holding company on the same day. In August 2014, the shares pledged to Li Yonghong were released, only re-pledged to [[Ping An Securities]] on the same day.

According to a news report by ''[[China Securities Journal]]'', Chen Jianyong ({{zh|s=陈建勇}}) and Xian Li ({{zh|s=鲜栗}}), the relatives of Li Yonghong and Xian Yan respectively, had formed two companies ({{zh|s=广东鸿远能源投资}} and {{zh|s=湖北精九投资}}) respectively, which were the investors in a private equity fund (as a [[Trust law|trust]]) to buy the shares of Duolun Industry, which was accused by other investor ({{zh|s=江苏沐雪}}) of the fund as insider trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/money/smjj/20130227/005914654309.shtml|title=私募沐雪巴菲特一号纠纷追踪：谁的资本玩偶|date=27 February 2013|access-date=15 April 2017|work=China Securities Journal |publisher=Re-published by sina|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using alias===
According to news report by ''Securities Times'' (a newspaper of "[[People's Daily]] Press"), Li Yonghong may used an alias '''Li Bingfeng''' ({{zh|s=李秉峰}}) to do business in some companies, such as Beijing Dahe Zhizhou Group ({{zh|s=北京大河之洲集团}}) and Li family's Chief Power Real Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stcn.com/2013/0730/10639328.shtml|title=多伦股份幕后玩家指向大河系 看似平行的交叉线|date=30 July 2013|access-date=6 June 2017|work=Securities Times|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=163report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.163.com/special/view719/|title=AC米兰玩家李勇鸿:或曾列入非法集资追逃名单|date=30 September 2016|access-date=15 April 2017|publisher=163.com|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Dragon International Holding===
Li Yonghong alleged himself as the chairman of Hong Kong-incorporated Grand Dragon International Holdings ({{zh|t=龍浩國際集團|l=Longhao International Group}}).&lt;ref name=Duolun2011/&gt; The company falsely claimed itself as the official Chinese side representative to build the [[Thai Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-05/20/c_127819248.htm|title= 揭秘"中泰签署克拉运河合作备忘录"的背后 |date=20 May 2015|access-date=15 April 2017|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 a press release of Grand Dragon International Holding was appeared in the website of another company Guangdong Longhao Aviation Group ({{zh|s=广东龙浩航空集团}}), denying Li was the chairman of Grand Dragon International Holdings in anytime.&lt;ref name=NYT2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.longhao-air.com/index.php?c=article&amp;a=detail&amp;id=215|script-title=zh:澄清声明|trans-title=Clarification|date=10 June 2017|access-date=21 November 2017|publisher= Grand Dragon International Holdings|via=longhao-air.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== List of Dishonest Judgment Debtors===
On 12 September 2018, Li was added to the ''List of Dishonest Judgment Debtors'' ({{zh|s=失信被执行人名单}}) by the local court of [[Jingmen]].&lt;ref name=court/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bjnews.com.cn/finance/2018/10/22/512976.html|script-title=zh:AC米兰旧主李勇鸿被限出入境 牵出神秘资本圈|newspaper=新京报 [The Beijing News]|language=zh-cn|date=22 October 2018|accessdate=29 October 2018|author=赵毅波 [Zhao Yibo]|editor=马小龙}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the press release, Li defaulted a loan from aforementioned Hubei Jingjiu ({{zh|s=湖北精九|p=Húběi Jīngjiǔ}}).&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://jmzy.hbfy.gov.cn/WenshuManage/ViewWenshu?id=799f6aa7-4dfe-4ffc-a0af-a96b0130ac19|script-title=zh:湖北精九投资有限公司、李勇鸿金融借款合同纠纷执行实施类执行裁定书 |date=12 September 2018|accessdate=18 October 2018|publisher=湖北省荆门市中级人民法院|language=zh-cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent and announced changes to the list of S&amp;P 400 Components==

&lt;!--                                                EDITORS PLEASE TAKE NOTE:

 If you are updating the following table due to a change which occurred in the components of the S&amp;P 400 please consider the following.

 1.  S&amp;P never adds or removes a stock in isolation, it's always "AAA replaces BBB".
     Please do not simply add or remove a component;  Rather, make sure you record both parts of the change.

 2.  If you record a change here, please also make the corresponding changes in the above table "S&amp;P 400 Component Stocks"
     Keeping these two tables in sync should make it much easier for editors to keep track of which changes have/haven't been entered.

 3.  Company name changes or ticker changes are not changes to the index and should not be in this table.

     Thanks!                       --&gt;

S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices updates the components of the S&amp;P 400 periodically, typically in response to acquisitions, or to keep the index up to date as various companies grow or shrink in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=s%26p+midcap+400&amp;Search=GO&amp;sortType=Date&amp;resultsPerPage=25&amp;ContentType=Announcement&amp;Region=region-americas

During the panel discussions the audience can discuss with several top tier personalities from the worlds of [[business]], [[economics]], [[society]] and [[politics]]. Under the topic „(Without) Borders?“, the next Forum will take place, under the patronage of the [[States of Germany|state]] [[Baden-Württemberg]] and its [[Minister-President]] [[Winfried Kretschmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mannheim-forum.org/|title=Mannheim Forum - Official webpage|publisher=Mannheim Forum|accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mannheim-forum.org/eu-schirmherrschaft|title=Mannheim Forum - EU Schirmherrschaft|publisher=Mannheim Forum|accessdate=2014-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201222800/http://mannheim-forum.org/eu-schirmherrschaft|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handelsblatt-hochschulinitiative.com/index.php/veranstaltungen/partner-veranstaltungen.html|title=Partner-Veranstaltungen: Mannheim Forum|publisher=Handelsblatt|accessdate=2014-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314115430/http://www.handelsblatt-hochschulinitiative.com/index.php/veranstaltungen/partner-veranstaltungen.html|archive-date=2014-03-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiumgenerale.uni-mannheim.de/de/initiativen/mannheimer_forum/mannheimer_forum_ev/|title=Mannheimer Initiative: Mannheim Forum e.V.|publisher=University of Mannheim|accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Mannheim Forum 2014 Pic 2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Frank Plasberg]], [[Paul Achleitner]] and [[Peer Steinbrück]] on Mannheim Forum 2014]]
In 2012, the student initiative Mannheim Forum was founded by the three largest student initiatives at Mannheim's campus: [[Arbeitskreis Börse (AKB)]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225149/http://www.mtp.org/mtp-site/regional/mannheim.nsf/id/pa_gs_start.html MTP - The Marketing Initiative], and [http://www.polimotion.de/ PoliMotion - The Politics Initiative].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mannheim-forum.org/gruendungsinitiativen|title=Mannheim Forum - Gründungsinitiativen|publisher=Mannheim Forum|accessdate=2013-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005304/http://mannheim-forum.org/gruendungsinitiativen|archive-date=2013-12-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea and goal behind the initiative was to establish an event that enable participants and students of different branches of study to engage in dynamic dialog with representatives of politics, science and economics about specific issues that are relevant in today's world. The first event organized by the initiative was the panel discussion in 2012 between Mannheim professors of different disciplines and company representatives about the topic "EU - Economic Poliy - Quo Vadis?!". The event received positive responses from both students and participants alike. From then on, the students'aim was to establish this event on a larger scale under the name "Mannheim Forum" as a fixed annual event at the University of Mannheim. 
The first "Mannheim Forum" was then conducted in 2013 under the topic of “Resources – 6 Perspectives: Economy, Ethics, Security, Politics, Technology and Startups”, and was followed by annual events in the years 2014-2016, the next event will take place in spring 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sp-dozenten.de/index.php?mod=news&amp;id=449|title=Mannheim Forum 2014|publisher=Schäffer-Poeschel Verlag|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/vortrag-archiv+M503073053eb.html|title=Mannheim Forum 2013|publisher=AK Börse|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Market share''' is the percentage of a [[Market (economics)|market]] (defined in terms of either units or revenue) accounted for by a specific entity. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 67% responded that they found the revenue- "dollar market share" metric very useful, while 61% found "unit market share" very useful.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0137058292}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

"Marketers need to be able to translate and incorporate sales targets into market share because this will demonstrate whether forecasts are to be attained by growing with the market or by capturing share from competitors. The latter will almost always be more difficult to achieve. Market share is closely monitored for signs of change in the competitive landscape, and it frequently drives strategic or tactical action."&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics2&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0137058292}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/projects/underway/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing market share is one of the most important objectives of [[business]]. The main advantage of using market share as a measure of business performance is that it is less dependent upon [[environmental scanning|macro environmental variables]] such as the state of the economy or changes in [[tax policy]]. 

In the [[United States]] market, however, increasing market share may be dangerous for makers of [[fungibility|fungible]] and potentially hazardous products such as medicine, due to a US-only legal doctrine called [[market share liability]].

== Purpose ==

Market share is said to be  a key indicator of market competitiveness—that is, how well a firm is doing against its competitors. "This metric, supplemented by changes in sales revenue, helps managers evaluate both primary and selective demand in their market. That is, it enables them to judge not only total market growth or decline but also trends in customers’ selections among competitors. Generally, sales growth resulting from primary demand (total market growth) is less costly and more profitable than that achieved by capturing share from competitors. Conversely, losses in market share can signal serious long-term problems that require strategic adjustments. Firms with market shares below a certain level may not be viable. Similarly, within a firm’s product line, market share trends for individual products are considered early indicators of future opportunities or problems."&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics/&gt;

Research has also shown that market share is a desired asset among competing firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=685 | title = Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Kesten C. Greene | journal = International Journal of Business | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–134 | year = 2007 | ISSN= 1083-4346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts, however, discourage making market share an objective and criterion upon which to base economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/compet.pdf | title = Competitor Orientation: Effects of Objectives and Information on Managerial Decisions and Profitability | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Fred Collopy | journal = Journal of Marketing Research | volume = 23 | pages = 188–199 | year = 1996 | publisher = American Marketing Association | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101217085359/http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/compet.pdf | archivedate = 2010-12-17 | df = | doi=10.2307/3152146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned usage of market share as a basis for gauging the performance of competing firms has fostered a system in which firms make decisions with regard to their operation with careful consideration of the impact of each decision on the market share of their competitors.

It is generally necessary to commission [[market research]] (generally [[secondary research|desk/secondary research]]) to determine.  Sometimes, though, one can use [[primary research]] to estimate the total market size and a company's market share.

== Construction ==
"'''Market share:''' ''The percentage of a market accounted for by a specific entity.''"&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

"'''Unit market share:''' ''The units sold by a particular company as a percentage of total market sales, measured in the same units.''"&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

:Unit market share (%) = 100 * Unit sales (#) / Total Market Unit Sales (#)

"This formula, of course, can be rearranged to derive either unit sales or total market unit sales from the other two variables, as illustrated in the following:"&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

:Unit sales (#) = Unit market share (%) * Total Market Unit Sales (#) / 100

:Total Market Unit Sales (#) = 100 * Unit sales (#) / Unit market share (%)

"'''Revenue market share:''' ''Revenue market share differs from unit market share in that it reflects the prices at which goods are sold. In fact, a relatively simple way to calculate relative price is to divide revenue market share by unit market share.''"&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

:Revenue market share (%) = 100 * Sales Revenue ($) / Total Market Sales Revenue($)

"As with the unit market share, this equation for revenue market share can be rearranged to calculate either sales revenue or total market sales revenue from the other two variables."&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

Market share can be decomposed into three components, namely: penetration share, share of customer, and usage index. These three underlying metrics can then be used to help the brand identify market share growth opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Fripp, Geoff.[http://www.marketingstudyguide.com/how-to-decompose-market-share-video/ “Decomposing Market Share”] The Marketing Study Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies ==
"Although market share is likely the single most important marketing metric, there is no generally acknowledged best method for calculating it. This is unfortunate, as different methods may yield not only different computations of market share at a given moment, but also widely divergent trends over time. The reasons for these disparities include variations in the lenses through which share is viewed (units versus dollars), where in the channel the measurements are taken (shipments from manufacturers versus consumer purchases), market definition (scope of the competitive universe), and measurement error."&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8910">'''Mass finishing''' is a group of [[manufacturing]] processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously [[finishing (manufacturing)|finished]]. The goal of this type of finishing is to [[burnishing (metal)|burnish]], [[burr (metal)|deburr]], clean, radius, [[flash (manufacturing)|de-flash]], [[descaling|descale]], remove [[rust]], polish, brighten, [[surface harden]], prepare parts for further finishing, or break off [[die cast]] runners. The two main types of mass finishing are [[tumble finishing]], also known as barrel finishing, and [[vibratory finishing]].&lt;ref name="degarmo781,784"&gt;Degarmo, pp. 781–784.&lt;/ref&gt; Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid [[lubricant]]s, cleaners, or [[abrasive]]s, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10&amp;nbsp;minutes for [[nonferrous]] workpieces or as long as 2&amp;nbsp;hours for [[hardened steel]].&lt;ref name="degarmo781,784"/&gt;

Mass finishing processes can be configured as either batch systems, in which batches of workpieces are added, run, and removed before the next batch is run, or as continuous systems, in which the workpieces enter at one end and leave at the other end in the finished state. They may also be sequenced, which involves running the workpieces through multiple different mass finishing processes; usually, the finish becomes progressively finer. Due to the random action of the processes, mass finishing is as much an art as it is a science.&lt;ref name="degarmo784"&gt;Degarmo, p. 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

==Media==
===Functions of Media===
Media are designed for four things:

;Cut: Media which cut can remove burrs and can smooth surfaces.  As a carrier of abrasive grain, the large medium pieces effectively increase the impact force of the abrasive on the metal part to be cut, thereby improving the efficiency of the abrasive.  Cutting media develop dull, [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] surfaces.

;[[Lustre (mineralogy)|Luster]]: Some grades of medium are designed to promote luster on the surface of metal parts.  These products are generally non-abrasive or have a very low degree of abrasiveness.  They deburr by [[peening]], rather than actually removing the burr.  Media selection, therefore, will control the degree of surface luster, making the part bright and shiny or developing a very matte, dull surface characterized by a completely random scratch pattern, or anything in between.

;Part separation: A very important function of the medium is to separate parts during the deburring, cutting, surface improving or burnishing operations.  The media:parts volume ratio is normally used to control the amount of part-on-part contact which will occur in a vibratory or tumble finishing operation.  At low ratios, considerable part-on-part contact occurs, while at higher ratios part-on-part contact is limited.

;Surface scrubbing: Media have the unique ability to scrub surfaces and physically assist compounds in their cleaning function.  Both abrasive and non-abrasive media are effective in this.  They can remove organic soils, scale, and other inorganic residues. Media come in a wide range of materials in order to fulfill various needs.

===Types of Media===

;Aluminum media: [[Aluminium]] media are typically [[casting|cast part]]s and are available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Aluminum scrubs parts and can work in conjunction with cleaning compounds to clean parts. Since aluminum is fairly nonabrasive it tends to remove surface impurities without affecting the part's surface qualities. Its cost is typically higher than other cast media. Wear rates are lower than [[ceramic]] but higher than steel media.

;Preformed ceramic media: Ceramic media are manufactured by mixing clay-like materials and water with abrasives, forming the mud into shapes, drying the shapes, and [[pottery firing|firing]] them at high temperatures to [[vitrify]] the binder.  Many of these binders are [[porcelain]]-like in nature.  Variability in these products occur both with the type of binder used, firing temperatures, the amount, size and type of abrasive grains they contain, and their uniformity of firing.  This type of media today is the general workhorse of mass finishing systems and is the type of medium generally used, because of its availability in a variety of shapes and sizes, low cost, and low wear rate.

;Preformed resin-bonded media: Plastic or [[resin]]-bonded media utilize a wider range of abrasive types and sizes than preformed ceramics.  The most popular grades are those using [[quartz]] as an abrasive.  [[Aluminum oxide]], [[silicon carbide]] and other abrasives are also used.  Usually, low-cost [[polyester]] resins are employed as the binder and the various shapes are produced by casting. Resin bonded media is good for preparing a metal surface for [[plating]].

;Steel: [[Case hardened]], stress-relieved steel preformed shapes are available in a variety of sizes and configurations.  Balls, balls with flat spots, ovoids (footballs), diagonally cut wire similar to angle-cut cylinders, ball cones and cones (both of which are different from the general concept of cones) and pins are the most commonly used.  Steel media weigh approximately 300 pounds per cubic foot and are expensive for initial installation, but, because of their minimal attrition rate and extreme cleanliness, are being more widely used for light deburring applications and cleaning.  Compounds are available to keep steel burnishing media clean and bright for extended periods.

;Synthetic random-shaped media: The most popular synthetic random media is [[melting|fused]] aluminum oxide, which is available in a number of grades.  The more loosely bound, coarse-grained materials are characterized by fast cut and high depreciation rates.  Because of the dark color of fused aluminum oxide, the soil generated by this material is excessive in many applications.  Fine-grained fused aluminum oxide is generally employed for burnishing and in this respect is unexcelled in many applications with the possible exception of steel.  Where some light cutting is required, fine-grained aluminum oxide can develop a better luster on stainless steels and other hard surfaces than can be achieved with steel burnishing media.

;Natural random-shaped media: River rock, [[granite]], [[quartz]], [[limestone]], [[emery (mineral)|emery]] and other naturally occurring abrasive materials are also used in vibratory and tumble finishing applications.  In general, these media are not very efficient in vibratory equipment because of their high attrition rates.  

;Cobmeal, walnut-shell flour, and related materials: These are used for drying applications because of the natural ability of these materials to absorb water from metal surfaces.  These can also be blended with abrasives and used for fine-polishing applications in vibratory, barrel, or spindle finishing equipment.

;Other: [[Shoe peg]]s, leather, [[carpet tack]]s, and many other solid materials have been used at one time or another in tumble or vibratory finishing for certain applications.

==Compounds==
Compounds are added to mass finishing processes to assist in deburring, burnishing, cutting, cleaning, descaling, and inhibiting [[corrosion]]. They may be liquids or dry powders. They are usually broken up into four types: deburring and finishing, burnishing, cleaning, and water stabilizing.&lt;ref name="degarmo784"/&gt;

;Deburring and finishing: These compounds are mainly designed to suspend the small particles created when deburring and abrading parts. They are also designed to keep workpieces clean and inhibit corrosion.
;Burnishing: Burnishing compounds are designed to enhance brightness and to develop certain colors after mass finishing.
;Cleaning: These compounds are usually dilute [[acid]]s or [[soap]]s designed to remove soil, grease, or oil from the incoming parts. They also provide corrosion resistance for ferrous and non-ferrous parts.
;Water stabilizers: These are used in conjunction with water to maintain a consistent [[water hardness]] and level of metal ions. This helps ensure consistent results from batch to batch.

'''Mohammed Mahfoodh Al Ardhi''' is an [[Omani]] businessman and former military chief. He is currently the Executive Chairman of Investcorp, Chairman of Bank Sohar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banksohar.net/Latest-News/News-Details/NewsID/4106|title=Bank Sohar - Articles|website=Banksohar.net|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous Chairman of the [[National Bank of Oman]] and was both the youngest and longest serving native head of the [[Royal Air Force of Oman]], having joined as a fighter pilot.

== Family background and early life ==
Al Ardhi was born in [[Sur, Oman]], to Omani parents. His father was head of the regional customs office. Due to the demands of his father’s career, Al Ardhi’s family moved several times during his early life to various parts of western Oman. Eventually the family moved to Al Batana and finally to [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], where Al Ardhi attended secondary school.&lt;ref name="Book1" /&gt;

Al Ardhi’s childhood was often difficult, not just for his family but for Oman as a whole. Families often lived without running water and electricity during this period. The [[Dhofar Rebellion]], a conflict that eventually turned out to be the longest armed conflict in the history of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (1965–1975), Britain's last colonial war in the region, and a [[proxy war]] in the [[Cold War]], further exacerbated Oman’s problems. It wasn’t uncommon for civilians to become victims of the political and military conflict. Al Ardhi’s family was no exception. In 1968 and 1969, their homes in [[Alaswad]] were bombed by revolutionaries. Government facilities, including his father's office, were often attacked. His father narrowly escaped death during a bombing when he stepped away from his desk.&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beasant |first=John |title=Oman: the True-Life Drama and Intrigue of an Arab State |url=https://www.amazon.com/Oman-True-Life-Drama-Intrigue-ebook/dp/B0054J64H0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid= |accessdate=19 August 2013 |year=2002 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaped by the experience of his country and his family, Al Ardhi was drawn into public service as a young adult. His father played a crucial role during this phase, encouraging his son to take up internships with the government rather than attend summer camps, play sports, or travel. Al Ardhi worked briefly as an intern in the [[Ministry of Oil and Gas (Oman)|Ministry of Oil and Gas]] and the court of the [[Qaboos bin Said al Said|Sultan of Oman]] before he joined the Royal Air Force of Oman at the age of 17.&lt;ref name="Book1" /&gt;

== Career and education ==
=== Military service ===
A fighter pilot in the early part of his career, he went on to graduate from the United Kingdom’s [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell|Royal Air Force Military Academy]] in Cranwell with a Bachelor of Science in Military Science. He also attended the Command and Staff College in Bracknell and the [[National Defense University]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Bank1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazon1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulf" /&gt;

Al Ardhi’s service with the Royal Air Force included serving as chairman of the Oman–U.S. Military Commission and chairman of the Oman–Iran Military Committee. He was appointed head of the Omani Air Force, a position he held for 10 years. While head of the air force, Al Ardhi worked hard to standardize military procurement among [[arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]]. Al Ardhi retired from the Royal Air Force with the rank of Air Vice Marshal.&lt;ref name="Bank1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbo.co.om/tabid/182/Default.aspx |title=About Us, Board of Directors |publisher=National Bank of Oman |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazon1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Procurement"&gt;{{cite news |title=OMAN URGES GULF STATES TO LINK UP ON PROCUREMENT  |newspaper=Jane's Defence Weekly |date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognising his contributions to the Royal Air Force of Oman, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said Al Said decorated Al Ardhi with the Order of Oman, the country’s highest honor, in the year 2000. He has also received the Order of Al Amjad and Order of Al Istihqaq in appreciation of his public service.&lt;ref name="Bank1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulf" /&gt;

=== Kennedy School at Harvard ===
Following his military service, Al Ardhi earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. After graduation, he returned to Oman to join his family's business.&lt;ref name="Bank1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulf" /&gt;

=== Banking ===
Al Ardhi (now Chairman) was appointed vice-chairman of the [[National Bank of Oman]] (NBO) in 2010. NBO is one of the country’s largest financial institutions. He is also the Chairman of the Executive, Nomination and Remuneration Committee (ENRC). As part of his role, Al Ardhi oversees the bank’s growth strategy and its corporate social responsibility programmes, especially those focusing on youth.&lt;ref name="Bank1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulf" /&gt; Under Al Ardhi's leadership NBO has expanded into [[Islamic banking]]. NBO has sponsored a conference on Islamic banking and implemented related training for its staff.&lt;ref name="Islamic"&gt;{{cite news |title=NBO plans to tap Islamic banking in Oman
 |author= |url=http://www.gulfbase.com/news/nbo-plans-to-tap-islamic-banking-in-oman/194264 |newspaper=Times of Oman |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Ardhi received the “Bank of the Year” award for 2012 on behalf of NBO. The award, granted by ‘’The Banker’’ magazine and highly coveted, is given for excellence in global banking.&lt;ref name="Gulf"&gt;{{cite news |title=Omar re-elected NBO chief, Al Ardhi is deputy |author=|url=http://www.gulfbankers.com/news-1822-omar_re_elected_nbo_chief_al_ardhi_is_deputy.html |newspaper=Gulf Bankers |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy, real estate, tourism, and other investments ===
Previously, Mohammed Mahfoodh Al Ardhi served as the chairman of Rimal Investment Projects, which has mandate from the government to direct invest in real estate development, oil and gas industry, and information technology.&lt;ref name="AE1" /&gt;

Al Ardhi also chaired Sundus Investments, which as of 2013 is spearheading the first Rotana hotel in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], as well as other developments to support the country’s ambitious tourism objectives as outlined in the Sultanate of Oman’s plan for its economy, Vision 2020. As of May 2013, Sundus has invested $60 million in hotels so far and plans four more hotels in Oman including an "eco hotel" on [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]] in the [[Al Jahar Mountains]], a resort in [[Dhofar]], and another resort in [[Sohar]].&lt;ref name="AE1" /&gt; Speaking of his firm's investments in the hotel industry Al Ardhi said, "It ́s pretty much untapped. That ́s why we ́re investing in hotels in Oman. Oman is a fantastic country for tourism; the geography, the people, the topography, We have all the ingredients that make it a hot destination. It is untapped still. It is stable. And the growth is fantastic. That is why we are investing in this."&lt;ref name="Quote"&gt;{{cite news |title=Oman begins hotel-building spree |author=|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/property/muscat-the-focus-of-omans-aggressive-plan-for-a-tourism-push |newspaper=The National |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Ardhi was also chairman of Al Ardhi Energy Services, offering support services to oil and gas industry in the GCC region.&lt;ref name="AE1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Muscat the focus of Oman's aggressive plan for a tourism push |author=Lucy Barnard |url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/property/muscat-the-focus-of-omans-aggressive-plan-for-a-tourism-push |newspaper=The National |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He serves on the board of Investcorp, a leading international provider of alternative investments with a special focus on the [[Persian Gulf]] with approximately US$23 billion of assets under management.

Three months after taking up his role as Executive Chairman of Investcorp, Al Ardhi announced a new growth strategy aiming to more than double its USD 10.8 billion Assets Under Management (AUM) over the medium term. A number of initiatives were communicated in relation to this plan, namely tapping into European Real Estate markets, establishing a global distribution platform and inorganic growth.

During the first year of his chairmanship, Investcorp strengthened its institutional shareholders base by agreeing to sell a 20% of interest in the company to Mubadala Development Company, the Abu Dhabi based investment and development company.&lt;ref name="AE1" /&gt;

=== Non-profit work ===
Al Ardhi serves on the International Advisory Board of [[The Brookings Institution]] in Washington, D.C. and is a trustee for the [[Eisenhower Fellowship]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Ike"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.efworld.org/about/eisenhower_fellowships_board.php |title=Eisenhower Fellowships Board of Trustees |publisher=Eisenhower Fellowships |accessdate=15 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830152415/http://www.efworld.org/about/eisenhower_fellowships_board.php |archivedate=30 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Net Impact''' is a [[nonprofit]] membership organization for students and professionals interested in using [[business]] skills in support of various social and environmental causes.  It serves both a [[professional organization]] and one of the largest [[student organizations]] among [[MBA]]s in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, David. ''The Market for Virtue: The Potential and Limits of Corporate Social Responsibility'' Brookings Institution Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; From its central office in [[Oakland]], the organization supports over 300 autonomous volunteer-run chapters and a membership base of over 100,000, with programs and networking events centered on topics such as [[corporate social responsibility]], [[social entrepreneurship]], [[nonprofit]] management, [[international development]], and [[environmental sustainability]].

==Historical background==
Net Impact was founded in 1993 as Students for Responsible Business (SRB).  Its inaugural conference was convened by 13 graduate business students in collaboration with Dr. [[Mark Albion]] and a handful of members of [[Social Venture Network]], an organization that has been a launching pad for several other organizations within the business and society movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hollender, Jeffrey and Stephen Finchell, ''What Matters Most: How a Small Group of Pioneers Is Teaching Social Responsibility to Big Business, and Why Big Business Is Listening'', Basic Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The organization grew steadily in its first few years as an organization exclusively for graduate students.

Beginning in 1998, a professional network of SRB alumni began to form.  The organization was renamed Net Impact in 1999 in part to accommodate a shift toward inclusion of professional MBA graduates.&lt;ref&gt;”Naming the Future” ''Leading Business'', Net Impact, Fall 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The first professional chapter was launched in San Francisco in 2001, and in 2008 professionals made up 44% of all dues-paying members, and 23% of chapters.

In 2007, an [[undergraduate]] pilot program was initiated, growing to 34 undergraduate chapters by early 2009.

While the bulk of Net Impact’s activity has been focused in the [[United States]], international chapters began as early as 1997 at [[INSEAD]] in Fontainebleau, France.  The inaugural European conference was held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland in June, 2008 in partnership with [[University of Geneva|HEC Geneva IOMBA]], INSEAD and the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, Yasmina “Net Impact Europe: Can Business Make a Positive Difference?” ''Acumen Fund Blog'', &lt;http://blog.acumenfund.org/2008/06/24/net-impact-europe-can-business-make-a-positive-difference/&gt; 2008-06-24, retrieved 2008-08-22&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2008 there were 40 student and professional chapters located outside the United States, on six continents.

Between 2004 and 2008, under the leadership of Executive Director Liz Maw, the organization increased its paid membership nearly fivefold, in keeping with a growth trend that has been identified among MBAs and society at large toward interest in responsible business practices.&lt;ref&gt;“CSR Jobs Rank High for Newly Minted MBAs: Report” ''GreenBiz'' &lt;http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2008/01/16/csr-jobs-rank-high-newly-minted-mbas-report&gt; 2008-01-16, retrieved 2008-08-22&lt;/ref&gt;

For professionals, the organization also offers the Impact at Work program to help members change their companies’ practices from within.&lt;ref&gt;Schutt, Melanie. “Do Green MBAs Get Green Jobs?” ''Sustainable Industries'', &lt;http://www.sustainableindustries.com/sijnews/17287629.html&gt; 2008-04-04, retrieved 2008-08-22&lt;/ref&gt; Programs under the umbrella of Nonprofit Capacity Building, such as Board Fellows and Service Corps, support members interested in volunteering for nonprofits on a [[pro bono]] basis and gaining key experience in the process.

At universities, Net Impact supports both campus greening and curriculum change initiatives that its members are engaged in, and its annual Green Challenge, open to students and professionals alike, serves to catalyze the sustainability movement among business students and create effective plans for environmental improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Rupe Eubanks, Michelle “A Campus Going Green”, ''TimesDaily.com'' &lt;http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20080707/NEWS/807070319/1011&gt; 2008-07-07, retrieved 2008-08-22&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Robertson, Dean of [[the Wharton School]], cited Net Impact activities at Wharton as evidence in an article where he claimed, “Social responsibility is no longer relegated to the relatively small percentage of students who seek to work in the nonprofit sector. It has become integrated into our way of thinking in business education and in the coming years needs to be further developed.”&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Thomas. “Schools aspire to be forces for social good” ''Financial Times'' &lt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/409f928c-cd41-11dc-9b2b-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1&gt; 2008-01-28, retrieved 2008-08-22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phyllis Kenner Robinson''' (née '''Kenner''', October 22, 1921 – December 31, 2010) was an advertising executive – a copywriter who helped create numerous notable ad campaigns.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Phyllis K. Robinson, a Top Copywriter, Dies at 89|first=Stuart|last=Elliott|date=January 21, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/media/22robinson.html|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a foundation employee of the US agency [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]] from 1949 and was instrumental in that agency's success and growth over the next twenty years.

==Career==
Born in New York City, in 1942 Robinson earned a bachelor's degree in sociology in from [[Barnard College]];&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; she wanted to be a writer.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; She worked for the US government as a statistician during World War II.

After the war, she moved to Boston, and embarked on a career in advertising. After starting out at Bresnick &amp; Solomont, she joined [[Grey Advertising]] in 1947 writing fashion promotion, where she first worked for [[William Bernbach]]. When he and [[James Edwin Doyle|Ned Doyle]] left Grey in 1949 to start their eponymous agency with [[Maxwell Dane|Mac Dane]] their "little gold mine of people,"&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Mary Wells|title=A Big Life in Advertising|year=2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4586-9|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3ckaRboJ3kC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; included Robinson and the art director Bob Gage with whom she was teamed and would enjoy much creative success.

Robinson was [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]]'s first chief copywriter.&lt;ref name=lawrence/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering Phyllis Robinson: The Original Mad Woman|date=January 7, 2011|magazine=[[New York Magazine]]|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/01/phyllis_robinson_was_the_origi.html|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At DDB, she supervised a team that would produce a number of notable people in advertising, including [[Mary Wells Lawrence]] and [[Paula Green]]. Wells described Robinson's place at DDB when Wells arrived there in 1957 ''"By the time I arrived the gods were firmly ensconced, the pantheon was established, the rituals, the sacred writings were already beloved. The Dei Majores were the originals, Bill, Ned, Mac, Phyllis and Bob Gage; they spoke a secret language. There were talented others, the spirits and the elves, but the gods were the gods, everyone in the industry knew who was who''". Years later Wells put it more simply, ''"I would buy a used car from Phyllis Robinson."''&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Stephen R.|title=The mirror makers: a history of American advertising and its creators|year=1997|publisher=U of Illinois P|isbn=978-0-252-06659-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlVB6ARdT7kC&amp;pg=PA295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson worked on memorable campaigns for numerous clients, including [[Ohrbach's]], [[Henry S. Levy and Sons]] – "You don't have to be Jewish to love Levy's Real Jewish Rye", [[El Al Airlines]], and [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] with a long running campaign featuring actors [[James Garner]] and [[Mariette Hartley]].&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; On the occasion of her death Keith Reinhard, Chairman-Emeritus of [[DDB Worldwide]] wrote "''In presentations to students, I still use her campaigns for Levy's rye bread and Ohrbach's as timeless examples of how to make brands famous by writing in a conversational tone...... [The Ohrbach's ad] is great on its own merits, but the more important reason I singled it out was that, when Volkswagen decided to introduce the Beetle to the U.S. market, they did not conduct an agency search. Instead, they simply said, "We want the agency that does Ohrbach's" – and thus, thanks to Phyllis, the creative revolution was born.''" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddb.com/ddblogs/creativity/thank-you-phyllis-robinson.html Reinhard: Thank you Phyllis Robinson&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, she also worked in theater, co-writing the lyrics for ''[[Cry for Us All]]''. She also wrote the books, lyrics, and music for a 1995 musical based on [[Bernard Malamud]]'s short story ''Angel Levine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 30, 2000|title=Phyllis Robinson|newspaper=[[Adweek]]|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=522332|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Performance: Theater|first=Lawrence|last=Van Gelder|date=May 17, 1995|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/17/theater/in-performance-theater-059495.html|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1944 she married Dr. Richard G. Robinson, who died in 2005. They had a daughter Nancy. Robinson quit full-time work at DDB in 1962 to raise her daughter, but continued to consult to the agency working three days a week through to 1968.&lt;ref name=warlick&gt;{{cite news|title=Phyllis Robinson, First DDB Copy Chief, Dies at 89.

==Accolades==
Robinson was inducted into the [[The One Club#Creative Hall of Fame|Creative Hall of Fame]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=warlick/&gt; For a time she served as chairperson for the Creative Hall of Fame. In 1999, ''Advertising Age'' magazine named her one of the 100 most influential figures in the history of advertising.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

She was featured in the 2009 documentary film ''[[Art &amp; Copy]]''.

Healy (1997) ''Project Management: Getting the Job Done on Time and in Budget.''&lt;/ref&gt; The Project Management Institute was founded  by Ned Engman (McDonnel Douglas Automation), James Snyder and Susan Gallagher (SmithKline &amp; French Laboratories), Eric Jenett (Brown &amp; Root) and J Gordon Davis (Georgia Institute of Technology)  at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref name="SS08"&gt;Michele Sliger and Stacia Broderick (2008). ''The Software Project Manager's Bridge to Agility''. Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0321502752}} p.26: The five people, who founded the Project Management Institute were James Snyder, Gordon Davis, Eric Jennett, A.E. Engman, and Susan C. Gallagher.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 as a nonprofit organization. It was incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania in the same year. PMI described its objectives in 1975 as to "foster recognition of the need for professionalism in project management; provide a forum for the free exchange of project management problems, solutions and applications; coordinate industrial and academic research efforts; develop common terminology and techniques to improve communications; provide interface between users and suppliers of hardware and software systems; and to provide guidelines for instruction and career development in the field of project management."&lt;ref name = "NBS 1975"&gt;Sophie J. Chumas &amp; Joan E. Hartman (1975) ''Directory of United States standardization activities'' [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NBS]] Special Publication 417. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s standardization efforts represented 10 to 15 percent of the institute's efforts. The functions were performed through the Professional Liaison Committee which called on and coordinated with the Technology, Research Policy and Education Committees. The institute participated in national activities through the American National Standards Committee XK 36.3 and internationally, through liaison with an appointed observer to Europe's [[International Project Management Association]], by then called INTERNET.&lt;ref name = "PLH 1997"/&gt; PMI did not deal with the US Federal Government directly; a number of members were federal employees in agencies involved with project management.&lt;ref name = "NBS 1975"/&gt;

In the 1980s, efforts were made to standardize project management procedures and approaches. The PMI produced the first Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) in 1996.&lt;ref name="PLH 1997" /&gt;

In the late 1990s Virgil R. Carter became president of the PMI. During his incumbency the number of members tripled to 90,000 members from 120 countries around the globe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"ASME names new executive director" in: ''ASME news'', May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 Carter was succeeded by [[Gregory Balestrero]], who directed the institute into the next decade. The current president is Mark Langley. The number of members tripled again to 260,000 members from 150 countries in 2008.&lt;ref name="NASA2007"&gt;"NASA Project Management Challenge 2007" at ''pmchallenge.gsfc.nasa.gov''. Accessed December 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership exceeded 540,000 in 208 countries and territories in July 2018.

== Credentialing and certification ==
Launched in 1984, PMI's first credential was the [[Project Management Professional|PMP]]. It has since become a [[de facto]] standard certification, along with the [[PRINCE2]] certification, in project management. In 2007 it earned the ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accreditation from the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). {{As of|2018|July}} over 876,000 people held the PMP credential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|first=|date=September 2018|title=PMI Fact File|url=http://www.pmitoday-digital.com/pmitoday/september_2018|journal=PMI Today|publisher=Project Management Institute|volume=|page=4|pages=|access-date=15 Sep 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMI later introduced many other credentials and a certification.  Credential holders do not have to be members of PMI.

To initially obtain a PMI credential, candidates must first document that they have met required education and experience requirements.  They must then pass an examination consisting of multiple choice questions.  To maintain most PMI credentials, holders must earn Professional Development Units (PDUs), which can be earned in a variety of ways such as taking classes, attending PMI global congresses, contributing to professional research or writing and publishing papers on the subject.  Most credentials must be renewed every three years. These are the certifications and credentials offered by PMI (there is an up-to-date list at the PMI web site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmi.org |title=the World's Leading Professional Association for Project Management |publisher=PMI |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;):

'''Public consultation''', or simply '''consultation''', is a regulatory process by which the public's input on matters affecting them is sought. Its main goals are in improving the efficiency, transparency&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/43/36785341.pdf Background Document on Public Consultation] (from the [[OECD]] Code, 10-Mar-2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and public involvement in large-scale projects or laws and policies. It usually involves ''notification'' (to publicise the matter to be consulted on), ''consultation'' (a two-way flow of information and opinion exchange) as well as ''participation'' (involving interest groups in the drafting of policy or legislation).&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; A frequently used tool for understanding different levels of community participation in consultation is known as [[Arnstein's ladder]].

The process is typical of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shannon|first=Moneo|title=Everyone Has An Opinion: The Art of Community Consultation|url=http://cityspaces.ca/art-community-consultation/|accessdate=April 8, 2014|newspaper=Douglas Magazine|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]] or [[Australia]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} though most [[democracy|democratic]] countries have similar systems. In the [[United States]], for example, this process is called "public notice and comment" (see [[Rulemaking]]). Some organisations such as the [[OECD]] also use such processes.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; In Canada, the word "consultation" has a special meaning among some First Nations Groups: "it is the duty of the Crown and third parties to consult with First Nations who have asserted, but not proved, [[Indigenous peoples#Indigenous rights, issues and concerns|aboriginal rights]] or title."&lt;ref&gt;Billy Garton and Sandra Carter, "First Nations Consultation: Higher, Wider, Deeper and Sooner", Bull, Housser &amp; Tupper, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great variation of public consultations. In some countries there is a list of all consultations, or consultations are mentioned in normal news feed. Depending on the country there can be national or regional public consultations.

Ineffective consultations are considered to be cosmetic consultations that were done due to obligation or show and not true participatory decision making.

'''Certified refurbishment''' is the distribution of products, usually [[electronics]] and electricals, that have been previously returned to a manufacturer or vendor for various reasons like not sold in the market or new launch of a product. Those known as certified Refurbished products are normally tested for functionality and defects before they are sold to the public. They are repaired by the original manufacturer and resold.

==Description==
The main difference between "refurbished" and "used"&lt;ref name="Cloud Ninjas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cloudninjas.com/refurbished-vs-used-servers/|title=Refurbished Servers vs. Used Servers|last=|first=|date=May 21, 2015|website=Cloud Ninjas|publisher=Scott Flowers|access-date=|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; products is that refurbished products have been tested and verified to function properly, and are thus free of [[Product defect|defects]], while "used" products may or may not be defective. Refurbished products may be unused customer returns that are essentially "new" items, or they may be defective products that were returned under warranty, and resold by the manufacturer after repairing the defects and ensuring proper function.&lt;ref name="Newegg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quickmobilefix.com/blogs/knowledge-centre/what-is-the-meaning-of-refurbished|title=What is a Refurbished product?|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2016|website=QuickMobilefix|publisher=Jordan Humphreys|access-date=|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of products that may be sold as "refurbished" include:

:* Items used in field tests, sales displays or demonstrations&lt;ref name="Newegg" /&gt;
:* Items returned for reasons other than defect, and tested by the [[manufacturer]]&lt;ref name="Newegg" /&gt;
:* Items returned to the manufacturer because the box or item was damaged in shipping&lt;ref name="Newegg" /&gt;
:* Used items that have been [[donated]] to a [[charity (organization)|charity]] or [[non-profit]] organization&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorks" /&gt;
:* Leftover equipment sold by a downsized company to a 3rd party refurbisher&lt;ref name="Refurbished IT Equipment"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tekboost.com/blog/refurbished-it-equipment-what-you-need-to-know/ |title=Refurbished IT Equipment: What You Need to Know |publisher=tekboost.com |accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the following types of products are considered recycled, not refurbished:

:* Previously leased units that are returned and resold after the lease ends&lt;ref name="webopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/R/refurbished.html |title=refurbished |publisher=Webopedia |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Used [[electronics]] that have been returned to an electronic [[recycling]] program&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/refurbished-electronic.htm |title=How Refurbished Electronics Work |first=Chris |last=Pollette |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various types==
Different [[companies]] and [[industries]] may have different types of "refurbished" products. Since the electronics industry doesn't have a firm, widely accepted definition of "refurbished", its exact meaning may vary from one product to the next, or one company to the next.&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorks" /&gt; In various cases "refurbished" may be synonymous with "reconditioned", "refreshed", "repaired", "recertified", or "like new". Note: The term "remanufacture", however, is a distinct term used for [[product (business)|products]] that are returned to the identical-to-new condition in industrial closed-loop processes, and which often possess the same [[warranties]] and [[guarantees]] as a new product.

'''Rogelio Julio Frigerio''' (November 2, 1914 &amp;ndash; September 13, 2006) was an Argentine economist, journalist and politician.

==Background and early career ==
Rogelio Frigerio was born in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1914 to Gerónimo Frigerio, an Italian immigrant, and his wife Carmen Guanziroli. One of eight brothers, he grew up in the quiet residential neighborhood of [[Villa del Parque]] and enrolled at the prestigious [[University of Buenos Aires]].

Pursuing higher studies at the university's School of Economics, he helped found ''Insurrexit'', a [[Marxist]] student association and, as one of its leaders, he edited the group's newsletter, ''Claridad''.  Graduating in 1935, he soon distanced himself from the Argentine left, however, believing them to harbor an elitist disposition.&lt;ref name=BAleg&gt;[http://www.legislatura.gov.ar/1inicio/070919/frigerio.htm  Buenos Aires City Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing a wholesale distributorship with diversified interests in lumber, textiles, leather and minerals, in 1940 he married Noemí Blanco, with whom he had five children. A talented businessman, Frigerio nonetheless remained politically active, involving himself in intellectual circles and establishing a newsweekly in 1946, ''Qué pasó en siete dias'' ("''What Happened in Seven Days''").  Alienated by the magazine's staunch opposition to the new populist Administration of [[Juan Perón]], however, Frigerio left its editorial board shortly before Perón had the magazine shuttered in 1947.

Though he did not seek public office during the Perón era, Frigerio became a highly visible proponent of accelerated industrial growth and social progress, a combination of policies he described as [[developmentalism]]. Inspired by recent efforts in that direction such as Brazilian President [[Getúlio Vargas]]' ''[[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]]'' and U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], Frigerio's concern that Perón's similar policies might be reversed following the populist leader's violent [[Revolución Libertadora|1955 overthrow]] led him to re-open his former newsmagazine in 1956, naming it simply ''Qué''. ''Qué'' soon attracted prestigious contributors from Argentine intellectual life such as [[Arturo Jauretche]], [[Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz]], [[Jorge Sabato]] and [[Arturo Frondizi]].  Frondizi, the centrist [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR)'s 1951 Vice Presidential nominee, soon developed a close friendship with Frigerio.

==Developmentalism and Arturo Frondizi==
Frigerio, in 1956, secretly arranged a meeting with Perón and his closest adviser at the time, [[John William Cooke]], an erstwhile Communist who, imprisoned for his prominence in the Perón government, had recently escaped his remote [[Patagonia]] prison cell.&lt;ref name=Rock&gt;Rock, David. ''Argentina: 1516&amp;ndash;1982''. University of California Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Exiled in [[Venezuela]] and subjected to numerous assassination attempts ordered by the new regime in Argentina, Perón continued to exert considerable political influence in his homeland; as Argentine voters geared for the [[Argentine general election, 1958|1958 elections]], the exiled leader's [[Justicialist Party]] was barred from fielding even local candidates (the mere mention of Perón's name was illegal).  Following the secret meeting in [[Caracas]], however, Perón endorsed Arturo Frondizi, instructing his supporters to vote for their former opponent and forego casting blank ballots, as a number of Peronists were advocating.  Failing to secure the UCR nomination, Frondizi ran on a splinter ticket, whose party he named the [[Intransigent Radical Civic Union]] (UCRI).  Enjoying Perón's support, Frondizi's UCRI handily defeated the mainstream UCR candidate, [[Ricardo Balbín]], by about 1.5 million votes out of 9 million cast.&lt;ref name="Rock"/&gt;

Arturo Frondizi was inaugurated [[President of Argentina]] on May 1, 1958 and designated Frigerio Secretary of Socio-Economic Affairs, a secondary post in the critical Economics Ministry the new president was forced to offer Frigerio due to steadfast opposition from the [[Armed forces of Argentina|Argentine military]] and the U.S. Embassy, both of whom saw Frigerio as a veiled Marxist because of his activities as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentina-rree.com/13/13-021.htm Relaciones Exteriores]&lt;/ref&gt; President Frondizi, even so, gave Frigerio informal say over a broad swath of economic policy.  

Frondizi and Frigerio inherited a difficult economic situation: following a 1946-48 boom, GDP had grown by a modest 3% a year in the decade since.  Declining exports and a growing need for costly imported motor vehicles, machinery and fuel, moreover, had caused Argentina to run trade deficits in seven out the past ten years.  Unable to finance these easily, Frondizi's two predecessors, Perón and [[Pedro Aramburu]], resorted to "printing" money to cover the nation's yawning [[current account]] deficits, causing prices to rise around sixfold.  Frigerio, whom U.S. interests in Argentina suspected of being a Communist, believed that the only sustainable remedy for this was the encouragement of [[foreign direct investment]] into Argentina, particularly in energy and industry {{mdash}} the sectors accounting for most of the country's trade deficits.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;Lewis, Paul. ''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''.  University of North Carolina Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost upon his appointment, Frigerio drafted the Law of Foreign Investment, promptly signed by the president. This law gave incentives and tax benefits to both local and foreign corporations willing to develop Argentina's energy and industry sectors and created the Department and Commission of Foreign Investments, which was designed to give foreign investors more legal recourse.  Frigerio's plans were ambitious, calling for greatly expanded public lending for homebuilders and local industry, and public works investment.

Frigerio also promulgated large [[petroleum]] exploration and drilling contracts with foreign oil companies.  These gave interested participants a generous share of the profits from such activities, provided these were carried out in conjunction with the Argentine state oil concern, [[YPF]].  As a consequence of investments initiated during the next four years, the profile of a number of sectors in the Argentine economy were revolutionized by the early 1960s:&lt;ref name=Rock/&gt;&lt;ref name=hcdn&gt;[http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&amp;numexp=2249-D-2007 Cámara de Diputados de la Nación: Homenage a Arturo Frondizi {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of consumer durables like washing machines, refrigerators, ovens, appliances and television sets all also increased sharply, as local and foreign investors soon broke ground on factories making all these goods and many more. One fourth of all [[foreign direct investment]] into Argentina between 1912 and 1975 took place in the Frondizi years, and the nation's chronic trade deficits, for their part, vanished by 1963.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;
[[File:Castro y Frondizi - 1959.jpg|thumb|left|240px|President Arturo Frondizi hosts Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] in 1959, before Castro allied himself with the [[USSR]].  Frondizi's attempts to mediate the U.S.-Cuba dispute resulted in his overthrow.]]  
Partly the victim of bad timing, these policies did not earn either Frondizi or Frigerio the respect of the most powerful institution in Argentina at the time: the armed forces and in December, Frondizi was forced to remove Frigerio from his post. One of the policy makers behind this was a relatively unknown defense contractor named [[Alvaro Alsogaray]], whose austerity plan Frondizi was forced to implement, causing a sudden doubling of consumer prices and, consequently, a fall in GDP and widespread protest. Alsogaray made frequent television appearances publicizing his plan; during the first of these, he declared that the Argentine people "must go through winter." &lt;ref name=todo&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/frondizi/ Todo Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relegated to informal adviser to the president, Frigerio opposed Alsogaray's belt-tightening measures and increasingly unpopular, Alsogaray's influence quickly waned; in early 1961, he resigned.  Again influencing economic policy from his informal role, Frigerio's close working relationship with the president continued until, on March 28, 1962, Arturo Frondizi was deposed while attending a Western Hemisphere summit in [[Montevideo, Uruguay]] in hopes of mediating the conflict between the U.S. and [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=Rock/&gt;  Arrested upon his return to the [[Casa Rosada]] the following morning, Frondizi defiantly pronounced that he would ''"not resign, nor commit suicide, or leave the country,"'' the president was imprisoned and Frigerio, exiled in Uruguay.

==Frigerio and politics==
Returning to Buenos Aires in 1963, Frigerio was reunited with Arturo Frondizi, now free.  Believing that their past economic accomplishments had made a return to politics possible, the two friends founded the [[Integration and Development Movement]] (MID).  MID was barred from the [[Argentine general election, 1963|1963 elections]] due to military opposition and serious differences over strategy resulted in an open enmity between [[UCRI]] candidate [[Oscar Alende]] (the progressive former governor of the [[Province of Buenos Aires]] and Frondizi ally) and the MID, which opted to encourage its supporters to cast blank ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pi.org.ar/documentos/libro.html Partido Intransigente]&lt;/ref&gt;  but  Many of Frigerio's policies were reinstated by the newly elected President [[Arturo Illia]]. Policy differences over Frondizi-era oil contracts, which Illia rescinded, led the MID to actively oppose him, however. Many of their policies endured following the [[Juan Carlos Ongania|1966 coup]], particularly during the 1970-71 tenure of Economy Minister [[Aldo Ferrer]].  Frigerio became a significant shareholder in Argentina's largest newsdaily ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' following a 1971 deal made with the newsdaily's owner, [[Ernestina Herrera de Noble]], whose late husband, ''Clarín'' founder [[Roberto Noble]], had supported Frondizi. Perón's return from exile imminent, the MID opted to endorse the aging leader for the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|1973 elections]], believing Perón would give them a meaningful say in the nation's economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Grupo-Clariacute;n-SA-Company-History.html Funding Universe: Clarín Group]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Given little say by the new Peronist government, which, instead saw its policy shift from populism to erratic crisis management measures, Frigerio initially supported the 1976 coup against Perón's successor (his hapless widow, [[Isabel Perón]]); what ensued, however, was unlike the last military regime in that [[National Reorganization Process|this dictatorship]] adopted policies largely anathema to Frigerio's.  Freezing wages for prolonged stretches, deregulating financial markets and encouraging a flood of foreign debt and of imports, these policies all helped undo much of what Frondizi and Frigerio had accomplished twenty years earlier.  Though Frigerio and his supporters were not targeted in the way left-wing dissidents were, the MID's opposition to the regime's chief economist, [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]] and his policies earned a number of party officials death threats and forced exile.&lt;ref name=Rock/&gt;

Allowing elections in 1983, the dictatorship left an insolvent Argentina, its business and consumer confidence almost shattered and its international prestige damaged following the 1982 [[Falklands War]], an invasion Frigerio opposed.  Taking up the MID's nomination for President in his first campaign for high office, Frigerio, however, refused to condemn the regime's [[Dirty war|human rights atrocities]], something which deprived his longshot 1983 MID candidacy of needed support.  Rogelio Frigerio fared poorly on [[Argentine general election, 1983|election night]], October 30, 1983 and, elected by an ample margin, UCR leader [[Raúl Alfonsín]] left Frigerio out of the economic policy discussions he held before taking office on December 10. Frigerio succeeded Frondizi as President of the MID in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croquetadigital.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=853&amp;Itemid=58 Croqueta Digital]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking representation in Congress, the MID maintained a considerable following in a number of Argentine provinces.  In the [[Formosa Province|Province of Formosa]], where voters had fond memories of the Frondizi Administration's development projects, Frigerio leveraged this influence into an agreement with [[Justicialist]] Governor [[Floro Bogado]] for his support of developmentalist policies and a MID candidate for Congress in exchange for the MID's alliance with them in Formosa and in nearby [[Misiones Province]], helping the Peronists wrest control of the Misiones Governor's office from the UCR in 1987.  Frigerio negotiated something similar in the other end of the country, the [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Province of Santa Cruz]]; electing two MID councilwomen to the [[Río Gallegos]] City Council, Frigerio advised them to support Peronist candidates.  These two city districts gave Justicialist Mayoral candidate [[Néstor Kirchner]] the deciding margin of victory in local elections in 1987 and Mayor Kirchner went on become governor and, in 2003, President of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcuello.wordpress.com/2006/09/14/murio-rogelio-frigerio/ Planetario]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Having written thirty books and numerous articles concerning the Argentine economy, he was sidestepped by the Administration of Raúl Alfonsín and his policies were only partly adopted by the Administration of [[Carlos Menem]] and by Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]], whose reforms attracted foreign investment and helped lead to a sorely needed modernization of Argentine industry;  Menem-era privatizations, however, yielded very mixed results and the combination of [[Layoff|downsizing]] and higher productivity led to an increase in unemployment after 1992 that Frigerio felt was not being addressed. He became distanced from the MID leadership, though he continued to contribute as a commentator (particularly in ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', Argentina's leading newsdaily). Frigerio lost his friend, Arturo Frondizi, to [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1995, and his own health declined subsequently. Many of his ideas became national policy after a [[Argentine economic crisis (1999&amp;ndash;2002)|profound economic crisis]] bottomed out in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/09/14/um/m-01271314.htm ''Clarín'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

Possessing an affable, self-effacing personality, he was known for his taste for whisky and broccoli and affectionately referred to as the "[[tapir]]", for his robust, compact frame.  The [[Buenos Aires City Legislature]], on August 31, 2006, voted to bestow on him the title of Illustrious Citizen of the City for his contributions to national development, the public discourse and the common cause.  Scheduled to receive the recognition later that month, Rogelio Frigerio died in his [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] neighborhood home on September 13, 2006, at the age of ninety-one.  His widow, Noemí, and his son, Octávio, accepted the recognition the following day and the renowned economist's body lay in state at the City Legislature.&lt;ref name=BAleg/&gt;

A {{nihongo|'''Salaryman'''|サラリーマン,|Sararīman}} is a [[salary|salaried]] worker and, more specifically, a Japanese [[white-collar worker]] who shows overriding loyalty to the corporation where he works.

Japan's society prepares its people to work primarily for the good of the whole society rather than just the individual{{OR|date=June 2018}}, and the salaryman is a part of that. Salarymen are expected to work long hours,&lt;ref&gt;A Week in the Life of a Tokyo Salary Man. Dir. Stu. Perf. Stu. Youtube.com. N.p., 28 Feb. 2015. Web. 5 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as [[Nomikai|drinking]], singing [[karaoke]] and visiting [[Host and hostess clubs|hostess bars]] with colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically [[Simultaneous recruiting of new graduates|enters a company after graduating college]] and stays with that corporation his whole career. 

Other popular notions surrounding salarymen include [[karōshi]], or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected career choice for young men and those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word ''salaryman'' is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.

==History==

The word "salaryman" saw widespread use in Japan by 1930, "although the white-collar class remained relatively small until the rapid expansion of government bureaucracies and war-related industry before and during World War II."&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;Vogel, Ezra F. "The Problem and Its Setting." Japan's New Middle Class; the Salary Man and His Family in a Tokyo Suburb. Berkeley: U of California, 1963. 1-12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term does not include all workers who receive a set salary, but only "white-collar workers in the large bureaucracy of a business firm or government office." The term includes those who work for government (e.g. [[bureaucrat]]s) and major companies (e.g. those listed in [[Nikkei 225]]). Workers in the [[mizu shōbai]] (nightlife) and entertainment industries (including actors and singers) are not included even though their income may be salary based. Similarly, doctors, engineers, lawyers, accountants, musicians, artists, politicians, the self-employed, and corporate executives are also excluded.&lt;ref name="vogel"/&gt;

A typical description of the salaryman is a male white-collar employee who typically earns his salary "based on individual abilities rather than on seniority."&lt;ref name="wingate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fairfield.edu/fjgc/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wingate-Japanese-Salarymen-On-the-Way-to-Extinction.pdf|format=PDF|title=Japanese Salarymen: On the Way to Extinction?|last=Wingate|first=Kristin|publisher=Undergraduate Journal of Global Citizenship 1.1|date=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416115022/http://blog.fairfield.edu/fjgc/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wingate-Japanese-Salarymen-On-the-Way-to-Extinction.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salarymen are known for working many hours, sometimes up to sixty hours per week. Oftentimes, because of his busy work schedule, the salaryman does not have time to raise a family and his work becomes a lifelong commitment. Companies typically hire the salarymen straight after high school, and they are expected to stay with the company until retirement, around the time they reach the age between 55 and 60. As a reward for the demonstration of their loyalty, companies rarely fire the salarymen unless it is under special "dire" circumstances.&lt;ref name="wingate"/&gt; There is also a belief that the "amount of time spent at the workplace correlates to the perceived efficiency of the employee." As a result of this intense work-driven lifestyle, salarymen may be more likely to suffer from mental or physical health problems, including heart failure or suicide.&lt;ref name="wingate"/&gt;

The media often portray the salaryman in negative fashion for lack of initiative and originality. Because of this portrayal, communities may be less willing to help the salaryman with his emotional problems, which often leads to [[clinical depression]] or even [[suicide]]. Corporations are often more willing to fire salarymen to lower costs, and many Japanese students are attempting to veer off the typical path of graduating from college to enter a corporation and become a salaryman. The act of escaping from the corporate lifestyle is known as datsusara. A vivid portrait of this can be found in the 2002 Takeshi Kitano film, ''[[Dolls (2002 film)|Dolls]]''.

[[File:Japanese Mahjong Tiles 1.jpg|thumb|Mahjong tiles]]
The prevalence of salarymen in Japanese society has given birth to many depictions by both the Japanese and American media. Some films in Japan about salarymen include ''Mr. Salaryman'', ''Japanese Salaryman NEO'' (based on the TV series), and a drama series entitled ''History of a Salaryman''. There is a certain expectation among the middle and upper classes for Japanese men to become salarymen. For many young Japanese men, accepting anything less than becoming a salaryman and conforming to its ideal is considered a failure, not only of him, but of his parents.&lt;ref name="mclelland"&gt;McLelland, Mark. "Salarymen Doing Queer: Gay Men and the Heterosexual Public Sphere." Genders, Transgenders, and Sexualities in Japan. N.p.: Routledge, 2005. 96-110. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of a salaryman revolves around work. The activities that he does outside of work typically involve his coworkers, which lessens the distance between him and work. Due to this expectation, there have been a variety of derogatory names given to salarymen: {{nihongo|''shachiku''|社畜}} meaning corporate livestock, {{nihongo|''kaisha no inu''|会社の犬}} dog of the company, and {{nihongo|''kigyou senshi''|企業戦士}} corporate soldier, to ridicule salarymen.

===Entertainment===
Changing social circumstances have greatly diversified the life of the salaryman outside of work. Though the importance of social drinking has not declined, its image has changed over time from mass partying during the economic bubble to conservative consumption at home after the collapse of the economy during the 1990s. [[Mahjong]] was an immensely popular game among the 1960s generation of salarymen, who brought the game into company circles directly from high school and college groups. The 1970s generation saw a gradual decrease in the number of avid mahjong players, and by the 1980s, it became common to not show any interest at all. Some current salarymen do not partake in the game.

[[Golf]] became widely popular during the economic bubble, when golf club passes became useful tools for currying favor with corporate executives. Many mid-level salarymen were pressured into taking up golf to participate in golfing events with their superiors. The collapse of the economic bubble led to the closing of many golf courses, and the ritual of playing [[golf]] with executives has become increasingly rare. However, some current salarymen may have golfing experience from their student days, and [[golf]] is still acknowledged as an expensive hobby for salarymen.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Romit. "Creating Corporate Warriors: The "Salaryman" and Masculinity in Japan." Asian Masculinities: The Meaning and Practice of Manhood in China and Japan. By Kam Louie and Morris Low. London: Routledge, 2003. 118-34. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Karōshi==
[[File:Salaryman asleep on the Tokyo Subway.jpg|thumb|A salaryman asleep on the Tokyo subway.]]
Extreme pressure on salarymen can lead to death by overwork, or ''[[karōshi]]''.&lt;ref name="harden"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/12/AR2008071201630.html |title=Japan's Killer Work Ethic |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=July 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="north"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.redpepper.org.uk/japanese-workers-fight-against-karoshi-death-from-overwork/ |title=Japanese Workers Fight against Karoshi, Death from Overwork |last=North |first=Scott |publisher=Red Pepper |date=September 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salarymen feel intense pressure to fulfill their duty to support their family because of the gendered expectations placed on men. According to a ''Washington Post'' article, the Japanese government attempted for years to set a limit to the number of hours one can work, and the issue has been prevalent since the 1970s. In 2014, after 30 years of activism, Japan's parliament (the [[Japanese Diet]]) passed a law "promoting countermeasures against karōshi."&lt;ref name="north"/&gt; 

However, many Japanese still criticize the government and believe there should be laws and penalties for companies that violate work hour laws. Approximately 2000 applications are filed by the families of salarymen that die of karōshi{{When|date=June 2017}}. However, the death toll may be much higher, and "as many as 8000 of the 30,000 annual suicides each year are thought to be work-related," with "as many as 10,000 non-suicide karōshi deaths per year."&lt;ref name="harden"/&gt;

Karōshi, literally "overwork death," was first diagnosed as a "circulatory disease brought on by stress" in the late 1970s after the [[1973 oil crisis]], which took a toll on the post-war reconstruction of Japanese industry.&lt;ref name="north"/&gt;  Since then, the number of deaths from overwork has increased, especially at larger and more prestigious companies. In 2002, Kenichi Uchino, a 30-year-old quality-control manager at [[Toyota]], collapsed and died after working over 80 hours unpaid overtime for six months. After this incident, Toyota announced it would begin monitoring their workers' health and pay for all of their overtime hours.&lt;ref name="north"/&gt;

'''Olusegun Abraham''' (born {{birth date|1953|12|24}}) is a Nigerian [[politician]] and [[business mogul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/politics/5644-ondo_governorship_acn_shortlists_three_candidate.html|title=Ondo governorship: CAN shortlists three candidates, drops Agunloye, others|work=[[Premium Times]]|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/why-i-want-to-govern-ondo-by-abraham/|title=Why I want to govern Ondo, by Abraham|work=[[The Nation (Nigeria)|The Nation]]|last=Oladesu|first=Emmanuel|date=21 December 2015|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Olusegun was born and raised in [[Ikare|Ikare-Akoko]], [[Ondo State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://citynews.ng/ondo-2016-likely-political-gladiators-for-governorship-seat/|title=Ondo 2016: Likely political gladiators for governorship seat|work=[[Daily Post (Nigeria)|Daily Post Newspaper]]|last=Badejo|first=Abiodun|date=12 August 2015|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he had his early formal education. He holds a master's degree in [[Technology management]]. He has also undertaken professional courses in notable institutions including [[Tyndale University College and Seminary]], [[Canada]] and the [[Institute of Directors]], [[United Kingdom]].

==Career==

==History==
Xchanging was founded in 1999, by David Andrews, a former partner in [[Andersen Consulting]]. Andrews came up with the idea at Andersen Consulting, to create joint ventures with large multinationals to outsource the  processing of back-office transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalservicesmedia.com/Strategies-and-Best-Practices/Global-Sourcing/The-Power-of-Partnerships/24/47/0/general200705211356 The Power of Partnerships] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711102358/http://www.globalservicesmedia.com/Strategies-and-Best-Practices/Global-Sourcing/The-Power-of-Partnerships/24/47/0/general200705211356 |date=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Xchanging and [[BAE Systems]] created the first of these 'Enterprise Partnerships',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carig.co.uk/pages/userdata/carig/bpoenterprisepartnership_teb.pdf BPO Enterprise Partnerships] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312225716/http://www.carig.co.uk/pages/userdata/carig/bpoenterprisepartnership_teb.pdf |date=March 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for HR services (see also&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=188248|title=Xchanging Acquires BAE Systems' Remaining 50% Share in Jointly Owned HR Services Company|author=Xchanging UK Limited|date=17 January 2007|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A second followed soon after, again with BAE Systems, for indirect procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xchanging.com/Media/PressRelease.aspx?ID=67|title=News|work=Xchanging plc|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Xchanging entered the US Indirect Procurement market through an agreement with U.S. based [[BAE Systems]] representing $800 million in spend to be addressed over 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/17/idUS168170+17-Aug-2011+BW20110817|title=Xchanging and BAE Systems Inc Sign Seven Year US Procurement Outsourcing Services Contract|author=Reuters Editorial|date=17 August 2011|work=Reuters|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Xchanging and [[Lloyd's of London]] created two more 'Enterprise Partnerships',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lloyds.com/Lloyds/Press-Centre/Press-Releases/2001/11/Lloyds_and_Xchanging_announce_deal_to_commercialise_Lloyds_claims_office Lloyd's Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928120606/http://www.lloyds.com/Lloyds/Press-Centre/Press-Releases/2001/11/Lloyds_and_Xchanging_announce_deal_to_commercialise_Lloyds_claims_office |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one for claims processing, and one for the London Insurance market's back office system; the latter including the IUA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iua.co.uk/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home |title=IUA of London |accessdate=13 May 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626095602/http://www.iua.co.uk/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home |archivedate=June 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a partner too.
