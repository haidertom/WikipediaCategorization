'''Ace Centre''' (previously  '''ACE Centre''' (Aiding Communication in Education), ACE Centre North) provides support for people with complex communications difficulties. Ace Centre offer assessment, training and information services across England, with a focus on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and Assistive Technology (AT). AThe ACE Centre have two offices are based in [[Oldham]] and Abingdon, and provide assessment services to [[England and Wales]] and are non-profit making independent organisation with charitable status.

== Brief outline ==
Ace Centre is a registered charity (No. 1089313) providing support for people with complex communications difficulties. 

== Foundation ==

The first ACE Centre was started in 1984 through UK government funding as part of the new initiative to introduce information technology into schools in England and Wales following the end of the Micro-Electronics Project MEP.  During MEP four [[Special education|Special Education]] Micro-technology Resource Centres (SEMERCs) were set up in London (Redbridge), Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle. A special education [[Software engineering|software development]] centre was also established in Manchester.  It was felt that those pupils with severe language or physical disabilities required more specialist support.

This idea for the first ACE centre to support these students came from Tim Southgate (Head of Ormerod Special School) and Prue Fuller, a teacher at the school. They were inspired by the computer research of Patrick Poon at the school. The original staff at the opening of the Centre in May 1984 were Prue Fuller (Director), Andrew Lysley (SEN Teacher), David Colven (Technical Officer) and Pauline Paine (Administrator).  The Centre was managed by Mary Hope at MESU, a post that was later taken over by Tina Detheridge now of Wigit Software.

It was essentially a project under the management of MESU (Micro Electronics Support Unit) a government quango which later merged with CET (Centre for [[Educational technology|Educational Technology]]) to become NCET (the National Centre for Educational Technology). This eventually became Becta (British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;ACE Centre: [http://www.ace-centre.org.uk/index.cfm?pageid=12D0CFAF-3048-7290-FE61D857018897C3 History of the ACE Centre]. (Source for part of the "Founcation" section.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 a second Centre was opened in [[Oldham]]  at Park Dean School It was managed by the head teacher Rhys Williams, who later became principal of Hereward College, and Roger Bates (now of Inclusive Technology).  The first Director proper of ACE Oldham as it was then was Steve Broadbent.  The two Centres in Oldham and Oxford service the north and south of England and Wales respectively.

== History ==

'''Location'''
The ACE Center was housed in a spare classroom at Ormerod special school in [[Headington|Headington, Oxford]] .  Later it moved to temporary buildings on the same site and remained there until the new 'Wooden Spoon' building was erected on [[Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre]] site in 1998.  The new 'Wooden Spoon' building was largely funded by the Wooden Spoon Society&lt;ref&gt;Wooden Spoon: [http://www.woodenspoon.com/projects/project_history.php?sortd=wspoon_commitment&amp;includeref=dynamic Project History].&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially opened by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] in April 1999. The new building has custom build facilities for assessment and training.

'''Staff'''
It has occupational therapists, speech and language Therapists, special needs and mainstream teachers, assistive technology specialists and support staff.  Early members of staff were Caroline Gray ([[occupational therapist]]), Gillian Hazell (the Nelms, Speech and Language Therapist) and Mark Saville (web page and publications creator).

Prue Fuller retired as director in 1999 and was later awarded an MBE for her services to Assistive and Alternative Communication.  She was also bi-annual president of ISAAC 1998 - 2000.  Caroline Grey became director of the ACE Centre following Prue's retirement until she retired in 2007.  Liz Tapper took over as temporary director until September 2008 and Dr Ben Janubi has been in post since January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;ACE Centre: [http://www.ace-centre.org.uk/index.cfm?pageid=CC3AA672-3048-7290-FE03DC64593E3CD8 Staff Profiles] (incomplete source).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The CAP Project''' This was a government initiative to boost the support and provision of communication aids to school students.&lt;ref&gt;Teach Training Resource Bank: [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100605151523/http://www.ttrb.ac.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?anchorId=17790&amp;selectedId=18229&amp;menu=17837&amp;ContentId=13930 Evaluation of the Communication Aids Project].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACE Centres were two of the organisations involved with assessment for this project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  It initially had a two-year timetable and a £10M budget but was extended for a further two years on the same funding basis. During this time the staffing in the centre increased considerably to cope with the assessment demand.

== Software developments ==
The first software developments at the ace centre was to re-write Sentence Scan and Start-Write for the increasingly popular [[BBC Micro]].  Sentence scan was a switch or keyboard accessible sentence builder with speech support.  Sentences could be built up from sets of stored words or phrases.  Start-Write was a letter/keyboard based program with speech support and sophisticated user support configurations.  Staff from the Centre also contributed to the design of the programs such as 'Prompt Writer' and 'Concept', being created by the Special Needs Software Centre based at the Manchester SEMERC managed by Dave King.

The advent of the [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]] computer lead to more graphics based programs being developed for switch users such as 'Plocka' (Swedish for 'pick up').  Plocka has facilities for creating sorting and matching scenarios for switch users and has a built in [[graphics library]].

* AccessMaths is a program developed for students that need to create geometric drawings but cannot manipulate a mouse. Users can use a laptop keyboard only to produce accurate and detailed mathematical constructions and drawings. Switch users can also manipulate the program via programs like 'The Grid 2' and 'SAW' (see below). It was originally developed on the BBC Master computer but later versions were created for use in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows 3]] and later.  The current version is version 4 which is available in English, Swedish and French.  Number Navigator is also a maths based utility which enables students to do 'sums' within a formatted grid.
* SAW (Special Access to Windows) is a program that was created from a grant from the then [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] to enable switch users to manipulate mathematical equations on screen.  It was quickly realised that creating a programmable scanning on-screen keyboard for Windows (version 3 at the time,) the full functionality of what they were hoping to create - and much more - could be realised by using other programs such as 'MathType'.  These programmable on-screen keyboards (selection sets) are now available for a number of very different applications.  SAw 5 is now an [[Open-source software|open source]] program available from the [[OATS|Oatsoft web site]].
* Hotspots - This program has similar user characteristics to SAW, but is designed for [[Point-and-click|point and click]] environments.  In addition to scanning user defined spots on the screen it can annotate these with sounds, images and text.  It is easy to make simple software switch accessible.

== Publications ==
The Ace Centre has published a number of reviews, guides, and 'how to' documents over the years. as well as contributing articles to conferences and [[peer review]]ed journals.  The main forum for disseminating out work is increasingly through the web site but they regularly give papers at conferences including the ISAAC conference,  Communication Matters, AAATE and others.

== Research and projects ==
Ace Centre works with companies, universities and other charities to:
* Investigate health and education issues for children and adults with complex disabilities
* Support companies to trial new products and develop progressive technology
* Find solutions for an individual or a sector
Research and development projects enhance achievement and good practice in the field; directly, through the development of AT &amp;  AAC, and indirectly through awareness raising, skills building and informing government policy. Service-users with communication disabilities are involved throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://acecentre.org.uk/services/research/|title=Research {{!}} Ace Centre|work=Ace Centre|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[stellar astronomy]], the '''Algol paradox'''  is a [[paradox]]ical situation when elements of a [[binary star]] seem to evolve in discord with the established theories of [[stellar evolution]].&lt;ref name=Pustylnik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pustylnik | first1 = I. | year = 1998 | title = The Early History of Resolving the Algol Paradox | journal = Astronomical and Astrophysical Transactions | volume = 15 | pages = 357&amp;ndash;362 | doi = 10.1080/10556799808201791 | accessdate = 2012-07-09 | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1998A%26AT...15..357P/0000357.000.html|bibcode = 1998A&amp;AT...15..357P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fundamental feature of these theories is that the rate of [[Stellar evolution|evolution of stars]] depends on their mass:  The greater the mass, the faster this evolution, and the more quickly it leaves the [[main-sequence]], entering either a [[subgiant]] or [[Giant star|giant]] phase.

In the case of [[Algol]] and other binary stars, something completely different is observed: The less massive star is already a subgiant while the star with much greater mass is still on the main-sequence.  Since the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages, this appears paradoxical. The more massive star, rather than the less massive one, should have left the main sequence.

The paradox is resolved by the fact that in many binary stars, there can be a flow of material between the two, disturbing the normal process of stellar evolution.  As the flow progresses, their evolutionary stage will advance, even as the relative masses change.  Eventually, the originally more massive star will reach the next stage in its evolution despite having lost much of its mass to its companion.

==Overview==
''Algorithms of Oppression'' is a text based on over six years of academic research on Google search algorithms. Noble argues that though algorithms themselves may not be racist, they can [[Algorithmic bias|reflect the biases]] and values of the people who create them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/06/scholar-sets-twitter-furor-critiquing-book-he-hasnt-read|title=Scholar sets off Twitter furor by critiquing a book he hasn't read|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/algorithms-of-oppression-racist/|title=Can an algorithm be racist?

==Critical reception==
Critical reception for ''Algorithms of Oppression'' has been largely positive. In the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Emily Drabinski writes, "What emerges from these pages is the sense that Google’s algorithms of oppression comprise just one of the hidden infrastructures that govern our daily lives, and that the others are likely just as hard-coded with white supremacy and misogyny as the one that Noble explores."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/ideologies-of-boring-things-the-internet-and-infrastructures-of-race/#!|title=Ideologies of Boring Things: The Internet and Infrastructures of Race - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[PopMatters]],'' Hans Rollman describes writes that ''Algorithms of Oppression'' "demonstrate[s] that search engines, and in particular [[Google]], are not simply imperfect machines, but systems designed by humans in ways that replicate the power structures of the western countries where they are built, complete with all the sexism and racism that are built into those structures."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ''[[Booklist]],'' reviewer Lesley Williams states, "Noble’s study should prompt some soul-searching about our reliance on commercial search engines and about digital social equity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Algorithms-of-Oppression-How-Search-Engines-Reinforce-Racism-Safiya-Umoja-Noble/pid=9240185|title=Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism, by Safiya Umoja  Noble {{!}} Booklist Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2018, ''Algorithms of Oppression'' received press attention when the official [[Twitter]] account for the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] expressed criticism of the book, citing that the thesis of the text, based on the text of the book's official blurb on commercial sites, could not be reproduced. IEEE's outreach historian, Alexander Magoun, later revealed that he had not read the book, and issued an apology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Archaeological ethics''' refers to the [[moral]] issues raised through the study of the material past. It is a branch of the [[Philosophy of archaeology]].

In common with other academic disciplines, archaeologists are bound to conduct their investigations to a high standard and observe intellectual property laws, [[Health and Safety]] regulations and other legal obligations. Professional bodies in the field require that their members work towards the preservation and management of archaeological resources, treat human remains with dignity and also usually encourage [[outreach]] activities. Where these bodies exist, sanctions are in place for those professionals who do not observe these ethical codes. By no means all jurisdictions have such professional bodies however and even where they do exist, membership may not be necessary in order to carry out archaeological investigations. While such considerations are fundamental to a pursuit, they are unfortunately coming rather late to the field. Questions regarding ethics have only arisen since the UNESCO accords in the 1970s began to protect world culture.

A common ethical issue in [[modern archaeology]] has been the treatment of human remains found during [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s, especially those that represent the ancestors of [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] groups in the [[New World]] or the remains of other minority races elsewhere. Where previously sites of great significance to native peoples could be excavated and any burials and [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] taken to be stored in museums or sold, there is increasing awareness in the West of taking a more respectful approach. The [[NAGPRA]] legislation in the [[United States of America]] is an example of this. The issue is not limited to ancient remains; nineteenth- and twentieth-century burial sites investigated by archaeologists such as [[First World War]] graves and cemeteries disturbed by developments have seen the remains of people with closely connected living relatives being exhumed and taken away.

The international trade in [[antiquities]], although not formally connected with the modern discipline of archaeology has also raised ethical questions regarding the ownership of archaeological artefacts. The market for imported antiquities has encouraged damage to [[archaeological site]]s and often led to appeals for the recall.

Examples of archaeological material removed from its place of origin and controversy over its return include the [[Elgin Marbles]].

A wider question of control and ownership over the past has also been raised through the political manipulation of the [[archaeological record]] to promote [[nationalism]] and justify military invasion. A famous example is the corps of archaeologists employed by [[Adolf Hitler]] to excavate in central Europe in the hope of finding evidence for a region-wide [[Aryan]] culture. Many archaeologists in the West today are employees of national governments or are privately employed instruments of government-derived archaeology legislation. In all cases this legislation is a compromise to some degree or another between the interests of the archaeological remains and the interests of economic development. Questions regarding the ethical validity of government heritage policies and whether they sufficiently protect important remains are raised during cases such as [[High Speed 1]] in [[London]] where burials at a cemetery at [[St Pancras railway station]] were hurriedly dug using a [[J. C. Bamford|JCB]] and mistreated in order to keep an important infrastructure project on schedule.

Another issue is the question of whether unthreatened archaeological remains should be excavated (and therefore destroyed) or preserved intact for future generations to investigate, perhaps using more advanced techniques that could provide more detailed information. Some archaeological guidance such as [[PPG 16]] has established a strong ethical argument for only excavating sites threatened with destruction.

Problem Areas in Archaeological Ethics
* Human Remains
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis local traditions and cultures
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis the architectural remains that have been uncovered during an excavation
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis dissemination of the material uncovered, not only in academic circles but also to a broader public, both in the area of the excavation and from where the Sponsors come
* Balancing World, National and regional claims to various parts of the archaeological record
* protecting Archaeological sites and objects from illegal trade

== Company History ==
BenevolentAI was founded in November 2013 by Ken Mulvany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lunden |first1=Ingrid |title=BenevolentAI, which uses AI to develop drugs and energy solutions, nabs $115M at $2B valuation |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/benevolentai-which-uses-ai-to-develop-drugs-and-energy-solutions-nabs-115m-at-2b-valuation/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=TechCrunch |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Initially the company focussed on the development of a cross functional AI technology to incorporate basic science, chemistry and clinical components and designed that could ingest, read and contextualise the world’s available bioscience information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BenevolentAI |title=BenevolentAI Raises $115 Million to Extend Its Leading Global Position in the Field of AI Enabled Drug Development |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/benevolentai-raises-115-million-to-extend-its-leading-global-position-in-the-field-of-ai-enabled-drug-development-680180573.html |website=PR Newswire |publisher=Cision |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Throughout the course of 2014 and 2015 the technology was further developed to also reason and propose hypotheses to treat disease. By 2015, the company had raised $87 million in funding, including investors like Woodford Investment Management and Lansdowne Partners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Nick Paul |title= MedTech BenevolentAI bags $115M to fuel AI-enabled R&amp;D push |url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/benevolentai-bags-115m-to-fuel-ai-enabled-r-d-push |website=Fierce Biotech |publisher=Questex |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2015 BenevolentAI began to fully apply its technology to drug discovery and development and announced the appointment of Jackie Hunter to lead bioscience research at the company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BenevolentAI |title=BenevolentAI, the pioneering London-based company using artificial intelligence to advance pharmaceutical development, appoints head of BBSRC as new Chief Executive |url=https://benevolent.ai/news/announcements/benevolentai-appoints-jackie-hunter-as-ceo-of-benevolentbio |website=BenevolentAI |publisher=BenevolentAI |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

During 2016 further early drug R&amp;D programmes were established and an in-license deal completed with J&amp;J for novel clinical stage drug candidates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exclusive license agreement with Janssen for clinical stage drug candidates |url=https://benevolent.ai/news/announcements/british-artificial-intelligence-firm-announces-exclusive-license-agreement-with-janssen |website=BenevolentAI |publisher=BenevolentAI |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That year BenevolentAI also initiated their first full drug programmes for ALS, and indicated in a later press release positive results from the initial data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AI enabled research shows delay in onset of motor neurone disease |url=https://benevolent.ai/news/announcements/ai-enabled-research-shows-delay-in-onset-of-motor-neurone-disease |website=BenevolentAI |publisher=BenevolentAI |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

2017 saw the company file its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application. In February 2018, BenevolentAI acquired a Cambridge research facility in order to expand its capabilities across the entire drug discovery process. Two months later the company announced a further round of funding for $115 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reuters |title=AI drug hunter BenevolentAI worth $2 billion after fund raising |url=https://www.euronews.com/2018/04/19/ai-drug-hunter-benevolentai-worth-2-billion-after-fund-raising |website=EuroNews |publisher=EuroNews |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In May of 2018, the company announced it had appointed Joanna Shields as CEO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shead |first1=Sam |title=BenevolentAI Makes Joanna Shields New CEO |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2018/05/01/benevolentai-makes-joanna-shields-new-ceo/#54c99605b9cd |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In Europe, '''biosystems engineering''' is a field of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological and environmental sciences. It represents an evolution of engineering disciplines applied to all living organisms not including biomedical applications. Therefore, biosystems engineering is 'the branch of engineering that applies engineering sciences to solve problems involving biological systems' (according to Erabee Network).

In the US, biosystems engineering (see also [[biological systems engineering]]) is a field of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological, environmental and agricultural sciences.  It represents an evolution of the agricultural engineering discipline applied to all living organisms (but generally not including biomedical applications, which is the realm of biomedical engineering).

In many institutions in the US, biosystems engineering is synonymous with [[biological engineering]].  In some institutions, biosystems engineering is considered a broader term which includes [[agricultural engineering]] and biological engineering also agricultural and biosystems engineering.

Typical programmatic areas include: production of [[bioenergy]]; development of [[biosensors]]; environmental and [[ecological engineering]]; [[controlled-environment agriculture]]; food processing and [[food safety]]; [[agricultural engineering]] (machinery, irrigation, storage), [[water quality]], water quantity, and water recycle (including measurements of pathogens, chemicals, and other contaminants).

In [[oil tanker]]s and other marine vessels used for transporting fluid products, there are small service openings though the deck into each tank to allow access for miscellaneous reasons such as sampling, inspection, gauging and cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eyres, David J.|year=2006|title=Ship Construction|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Burlington, Massachusetts|page=258|isbn=978-0-08-046823-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the service opening is not in use, it is sealed by a removable cover plate, commonly referred to as a Butterworth cover.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Jr., John P "Cover plate having adjustable latch means" http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4059202.html&lt;/ref&gt; Butterworth hatches are not the main access hatches, but are the servicing hatches, and are generally closed with a metal cover plate with a gasket that is fastened to the deck by a number of bolts which stick up from the deck. Holes on the edges of the plate fit over these bolts and the cover is fastened down with nuts or dogs.

Vapor accidents can occur when pressure builds up in the tank below and the Butterworth cover is carelessly removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wang, Y.

'''claro fair trade''', commonly shortened to '''''claro''''' and written in [[Lower case|minuscules]], is a [[sustainability]]-oriented retail company based in [[Orpund]], Biel/Bienne administrative district, in the Swiss [[Canton of Bern]]. claro was initiated by [[Erklärung von Bern]], a sustainability-oriented independent solidarity development in Switzerland in 1977.&lt;ref name="woz-evb-20090122"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woz.ch/0904/erklaerung-von-bern/erfinderinnen-des-fairen-handels|title=Erklärung von Bern: Erfinderinnen des fairen Handels|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 04/2009|author=Susan Boos|language=German|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and orientation ==
{{main|Erklärung von Bern}}
The history of fair trade in Switzerland is closely linked to the rise of the solidarity movement in Switzerland in the 1970s, and the political development organizations such as the [[Erklärung von Bern]] (EvB) consumer actions. At that time, products such as coffee, bananas and jute were symbols of the growing support for displaying developmental contexts. At the same time consumers demanded more engagement for development aid without supporting the charity mentality. The success of these actions occurred to the establishment of a joint Swiss import central named ''OS3'' that was pioneering fair trade, and specialized in the sale of food and crafts from developing trading partners, i.e. small producers from economic marginal areas, an alternative approach to the world trade.&lt;ref name="sozialarchiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmittel.ch/Archive/archNeu/Arclaro.html|title=claro fair trade AG|publisher=Schweizerisches Sozialarchiv: Archivfindmittel|author=|language=German|date=2014-04-17|accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ''OS3'', in 1977 EvB initiated the organisation ''Suisse Tiers Monde'' which became the first two claro fair trade labels; they resulted in the collaboration with ''Corr-the jute works'' situated in Bangladesh. In the following years the product line was expanded gradually, among them cane sugar from the Philippines and other agriculture products from the so-called third world countries, for example coffee from Tanzania, and tea from Sri Lanka, and the cooperative ''El Ceibo'' in Bolivia around 1985,&lt;ref name="hds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D47101.php|title=Erklärung von Bern (EvB)|publisher=HDS|author=Andrea Weibel|language=German|date=2004-10-29|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as today the popular ''claro'' shops in Switzerland,&lt;ref name="zsz-20120426"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsz.ch/artikel_54490.html |title=Fair-Trade-Läden müssen sich auf den Markt ausrichten |publisher=[[Zürichsee-Zeitung]] |author=Bettina Bernet-Hug and Silvia Luckner (photo) |language=German |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119044427/http://www.zsz.ch/artikel_54490.html |archivedate=2015-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among other sustainable initiatives financially supported by the [[Alternative Bank Schweiz]] ABS.

In 1997 the ''claro fair trade'' cooperative was transformed into an [[Aktiengesellschaft]] according to the Swiss law. claro fair trade claims as ultimate goals the continuous improvement of the social, economic and environmental situation of their producers. These include the minimization of middlemen in favor of direct cooperation with local partners and supporting social projects. Whenever possible the products are certified by the Max Havelaar Foundation.&lt;ref name="sozialarchiv"/&gt;

== Weltladen and claro shops ==
''claro'' contributes its products in the so-called ''claro'' and associated ''Weltladen'' shops.&lt;ref name="claro-überuns"/&gt; As other sustainable corporations, there was a decrease in turnover the past fiscal years, mainly caused to reduced export of the products outside Switzerland.&lt;ref name="claro-jahresbericht-2014"/&gt;

The distributor claimed as of 2014, to support by its import activities more than 260 small producer groups and craft shops, and thus improved the living conditions of more than 100,000 people from the [[southern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="claro-jahresbericht-2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20808">'''Cognitive inhibition''' refers to the mind's ability to tune out stimuli that are irrelevant to the task/process at hand or to the mind's current state. Cognitive inhibition can be done either in whole or in part, intentionally or otherwise.&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite journal| last = MacLeod| first = Colin| title = Concept of Inhibition in Cognition| year = 2007| url = http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~msommers/aging/inhibit0.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive inhibition in particular can be observed in many instances throughout specific areas of [[cognitive science]].

==History==

The early models of what would become the study and concept of cognitive inhibition were developed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition was believed to play two primary roles: the prevention of unwanted thoughts or behaviors, and the [[Psychological repression|repression]] of experiences from infancy and childhood.&lt;ref name=Dempster&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F.N.| title = Chapter 1: A Historical Perspective| journal = Interference and Inhibition in Cognition| year = 1995| url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021992632168?LI=true#page-3| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1023/A:1021992632168| volume=11| pages=1–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed cognitive inhibition was not just a lack of awareness to stimuli but an active process, requiring a constant energy expenditure.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

Other early theories of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists. They proposed that children acquire control of behavior and thought through internalized speech, and that they consciously exhibit a cognitively inhibitory process in order to regulate their own behavior. Cognitive inhibition was thought to develop as mental control over behavior developed.

During the past 30 years inhibitory mechanisms such as cognitive inhibition have not been particularly prominent in [[developmental psychology]], but currently they are undergoing a revival in the study of inefficient inhibition (explored in a later section) and resource limitations.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

==Developmental psychology==

Cognitive inhibition can be seen at work during studies in [[developmental psychology]].  An experiment done by Friedman and Leslie&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; explained children's performance in the [[Theory of mind#False-belief task|false belief task]] as relying on a critical inhibitory process. What this demonstrated is that reaching the age of 3 or 4 triggers cognitive inhibition ability formation.&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; The idea is that children who are 3 or 4 can suppress information from their cognitive experience in order to evaluate a situation from another's point of view. This is very important developmentally as it may interact with the formation of [[empathy]]: cognitive inhibition cannot be so great as to completely block one's experiences while evaluating another point of view, but must be strong enough to enable an accurate representation of that point of view. Other elements of cognitive inhibition that are studied in developmental psychology include memory formation &lt;ref name=Harnishfeger&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harnishfeger| first = Katherine| title = The Development of Cognitive Inhibition| publisher = Academic Press, Inc.| location = San Diego, CA| year = 1995| url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lJ5ubLyVaGYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=harnishfeger+memory+formation&amp;ots=i9OxRMNODo&amp;sig=kk-o4lud62_NJ7Vm5n7RTGSuia8#v=onepage&amp;q=harnishfeger%20memory%20formation&amp;f=false| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[memory inhibition]]. It has been demonstrated that intentional inhibition of memory commitment is not fully developed until adulthood, and is very difficult for children to accomplish. This illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition tasks, such as those in memory processing, are a gradually acquired skill rather than instinctual. Other cognitive functions that are developed gradually throughout childhood include exercising self-control over retained representational structures of information and quickly adapting cognitive processing to changing behavioral situations. Both of these functions were determined to be present throughout development, but not at full capacity until young adulthood.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Davidson| first = Matthew|author2=Dima Amso |author3=Loren Cruess Anderson |author4=Adele Diamond | title = Development of cognitive control and executive functions from 4 to 13 years: Evidence from manipulations of memory, inhibition, and task switching| journal = Neuropsychologia| volume = 44| issue = 11| pages = 2037–2078| publisher = Neuropsychologia| year = 2006| pmc=1513793| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006 | pmid=16580701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the ability to intentionally ignore irrelevant details and to focus attention and [[cognitive ability]] on more relevant details is not present in young children and is a highly developmentally-related process.&lt;ref name=Harnishfeger /&gt;

==Role in survival==

Cognitive inhibition may have played a role in the survival of human children, in what is called [[betrayal trauma theory]].&lt;ref name="Freyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Freyd|first = Jennifer|title = What is a Betrayal Trauma? What is Betrayal Trauma Theory?|journal = Encyclopedia of Psychological Trauma|pages = 76|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|location = New York|year = 2008|url = http://pages.uoregon.edu/dynamic/jjf/defineBT.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In situations involving treacherous acts by a caregiver, a 'cognitive information blockage' may occur that results in an isolation of knowledge of the event from awareness".&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal| last = Todd| first = Peter|author2=Ralph Hertwig |author3=Ulrich Hoffrage | title = Evolutionary Cognitive Psychology| journal = Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology| year = 2004| url = http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/pt/PT_Evolutionary_2005.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This motivated forgetting caused by cognitive inhibition would have been necessary in the past to maintain the crucial relationship between child and caregiver so that the child would survive; therefore, cognitive inhibition has endured through [[evolution]]. For example, a parent or caregiver may have been abusive physically or emotionally to a child, perhaps not intentionally, but the effect would be the same to the child. However, the world outside the protection of the caregiver would be even less forgiving and almost certainly fatal to the child in ancient history. So, they cognitively inhibited the memory of the abuse in order to maintain the relationship.

==Behavioral psychology==
[[Behavioral psychology]] may play an important part in the development of cognitive inhibition.
Cognitive inhibition is believed to strongly influence both sexual and aggressive urges within human society. When signals or stimuli are perceived by an individual, the mind processes the information and the body elicits a response. However, in the case of sexual arousal or perceived aggressive behavior, the individual needs to exercise caution in the cognitive processing of the incoming signals. This is where cognitive inhibition plays its part, preventing the individual from cognitively processing the stimuli and selecting an inappropriate response, thus potentially saving crucial social relationships.&lt;ref name=Dempster2&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F|author2=A. Corkill| title = Neo-interference research and the development of intelligence| journal = The development of intelligence| pages = 215–243| publisher = Hove| year = 1999| jstor = 10.1086/650572| volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior towards others in a social circle is strongly influenced by [[empathy]], which can be seen as a form of cognitive inhibition. Empathy causes an individual to understand the physical/emotional pain and suffering of others. When an interaction occurs, cognitive inhibition on the part of the individual causes him or her to respond appropriately and avoid upsetting someone already in physical or emotional pain. Again, this is important in maintaining [[social relationships]].

Behavioral control is an important application of cognitive inhibition in [[behavioral psychology]], as is emotional control. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is an example of cognitive inhibition failure in emotion control. Correctly functioning cognitive inhibition would result in reduced selective attention to negative stimuli and retention of negative thoughts. "There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material. These deficits could result in prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information thereby hindering recovery from negative mood and leading to the sustained negative affect that characterizes depressive episodes".&lt;ref name=Joorman&gt;{{cite journal| last = Joorman| first = J |author2=K.L. Yoon |author3=U. Zetsche| title = Cognitive inhibition in depression| journal = Applied and Preventive Psychology| volume = 12| pages = 128–139| year = 2007| url = http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/jjoormann/| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1016/j.appsy.2007.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is another important emotion affected by cognitive inhibition. "Trait anger is a robust predictor of the angry and aggressive response to hostile situational input, but it is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying this personality...individuals low in trait anger systematically recruit cognitive control resources within hostile contexts".&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Robinson| first = Michael|author2=Benjamin M. Wilkowski |author3=Brian P. Meier |author4=Sara K. Moeller |author5=Adam K. Fetterman | title = Counting to ten milliseconds: Low-anger, but not high-anger, individuals pause following negative evaluations| journal = Cognition and Emotion| pages = 1–21| publisher = Psychology Press| year = 2011| url = http://public.gettysburg.edu/~bmeier/Publications/Robinson%20et%20al.%20(in%20press)%20-%20Counting%20to%20Ten.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi = 10.1080/02699931.2011.579088 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations that may elicit anger leading to violence arise, cognitive inhibition is used extensively. Hostile stimuli magnitude are considered and ignored to avoid confrontation. Social context situations that may be interpreted as hostile are processed, and through cognitive inhibition, logic and reasoning are used to handle the situation. When a degree of cognitive inhibition ability is absent in an individual, it can result in "trait anger", or frequent angry and violent outbursts at relatively inoffensive stimuli.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; Without cognitive inhibition and its resulting omission of irrelevant or unimportant information, emotional stability can be compromised.

==Behavioral neuroscience==

[[Behavioral neuroscience]] applies the principles of [[neurobiology]], to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior.   Cognitive inhibition is caused by several different interacting [[biological]] factors. The first is the existence of inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]], or chemicals emitted by brain cells to both communicate and inhibit communication between each other. "[[GABA]], an inhibitory transmitter substance that has been implicated in certain simple behavioral measures of inhibition and the control of aggressive behavior, was discovered in the [[cerebral cortex]] in substantial quantities".&lt;ref name=Dempster2 /&gt; Given the [[cerebral cortex]]'s importance in many brain functions such as memory and thought, the presence of the inhibitory substance GABA supports the cognitive inhibition processes that go on in this area of the brain. [[Serotonin]] and [[dopamine]], which can play inhibitory roles as well, are present in the brain in large quantities. All three of these [[neurotransmitters]] are capable of "blocking" the transmissions between neurons, which can ultimately result in cognitive inhibition. In addition, the presence of inhibitory connections in the [[central nervous system]] has been firmly demonstrated (Eccles, 1969). A process known as [[lateral inhibition]], which involves the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, is integral in the biology of cognitive inhibition. It provides much of the [[neural]] background behind it and explains what exactly is going on at the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level.

==Theory of inefficient inhibition==

Many contemporary cognitive theorists postulate models featuring a central pool "of mental resources that must be allocated to the various operations involved in processing, retaining, and reporting information".&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt; This means that [[working memory]] and the various areas of the [[brain]] responsible for it are theoretically limited to a finite set of "mental resources" or mental capacity with which to carry out operation. Cognitive inhibition, of course, is responsible for determining what is relevant to the working memory and shuts out what is irrelevant, "freeing up space" and mental capacity needed for more pressing matters. In the theory of inefficient inhibition, cognitive inhibition does not perform its function fully, and a shortage of mental resources leads to decreased performance or inefficiency in tasks that require more mental capacity. While inefficient inhibition can result naturally in individuals diagnosed with mild [[cognitive impairment]], this effect is especially pronounced in [[methamphetamine]]-dependent individuals.&lt;ref name=Salo&gt;{{cite journal | last = Salo | first = Ruth |author2=Thomas E. Nordahl |author3=Kate Possin |author4=Martin Leamon |author5=David R. Gibson |author6=Gantt P. Galloway |author7=Neil M. Flynn |author8=Avishai Henik |author9=Adolf Pfefferbaum |author10=Edith V. Sullivan  | title = Preliminary evidence of reduced cognitive inhibition in methamphetamine-dependent individuals | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 111 | pages = 65–74 | doi=10.1016/s0165-1781(02)00111-7  | year = 2002 | url = http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/salo_nordahl_etal_PR2002.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinically, these individuals can be highly distractible and exhibit difficulty focusing, which illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition is being impaired and that inefficient inhibition is resulting. Because of the nature of the [[psychoactive drug]], the brain is unable or reduced in its capacity to shut out irrelevant stimuli to the task at hand, and so tries to process and respond to any and all stimuli. This is most likely due to the effects of [[methamphetamine]] on inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]] like [[GABA]], discussed in an earlier section.

==Failure and deficits==

If an individual experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological results can be extremely debilitating. Patients with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. "Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rosenberg | first = D.R. |author2=Dick, E.L. |author3=O'Hearn, K.M. |author4=Sweeney, J.A. | title = Response-inhibition deficits in obsessive-compulsive disorder; an indicator of dysfunction in frontostriatal circuits | journal = Psychiatry Neuroscience | volume = 22  | issue = 1 | pages = 29–38 | year = 1997 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects have to make a simple motor response (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the motor response when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al.

The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of [[working memory]] deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on an individual's ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. "In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under ''inhibitory deficit theory'' as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target".&lt;ref name=Zacks&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zacks | first = R.T. |author2=L.

Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[ADHD]], or [[OCD]] indicate.

'''''Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified''''' or the '''''Washing Away of Wrongs''''' is a [[Chinese literature|Chinese book]] written by [[Song Ci]] in 1247&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Hsi-yüan chi-lu|page=186|last=Uematsu|first=Tadashi|last2=(transl.

The author combined many historical cases of [[forensic science]] with his own experiences and wrote the book with an eye to avoiding injustice. The book was esteemed by generations of officials, and it was eventually translated into English, German, Japanese, French and other languages.

It is the first ever written book of forensic science.

==Content==
Different versions of the book exist, but the earliest existing version was published during the Yuan Dynasty, containing fifty-three chapters in five volumes. The first volume describes the imperial decree issued by Song Dynasty on the inspection of bodies and injuries. The second volume contains notes and methods on post-mortem examinations. The third, fourth, and fifth volumes detail the appearances of corpses from various causes of death and methods of treatments to certain injuries of a wounded person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Song Ci and his Xi Yuan Ji Lu | publisher = Huaxia Jingwei Wang| url = http://big5.huaxia.com/wh/gjzt/2007/00571994.html| accessdate = 2007-09-01 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKnight. The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. p 161.&lt;/ref&gt; how to wash dead body for examining the different reasons of death. At that time, the book had given methods to distinguish suicide or pretending suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Song, Ci, and Brian E. McKnight. The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. p 79-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In the book, Ci said:'''''
&lt;blockquote&gt;The particulars of each case must be recorded in the doctor’s own handwriting. No one else is allowed to write his [[autopsy]] report. A coroner must not avoid performing an autopsy just because he detests the stench of corpses. A coroner must refrain from sitting comfortably behind a curtain of [[incense]] that masks the stench, letting his subordinates do the autopsy unsupervised, or allowing a petty official to write his autopsy report, otherwise any potential inaccuracy is unchecked and uncorrected.” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''He also said:'''''
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Should there be any inaccuracy in an autopsy report, injustice would remain with the deceased as well as the living. A wrongful death sentence without justice may claim one or more additional lives, which would in turn result in [[feud|feuds and revenges]], prolonging the tragedy. In order to avoid any miscarriage of justice, the coroner must immediately examine the case personally.” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Importance to the history of forensic entomology==
In ''The Washing Away of Wrongs'', the first documented [[Forensic entomology|forensic entomology]] case is reported.&lt;ref name=Benecke&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benecke M. | title=A brief history of forensic entomology | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2001 | volume=120 | issue=1–2 | pages=2–14 | pmid=11457602  | doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00409-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1235 A.D., a stabbing occurred in a Chinese village. By testing different blades on an animal carcass, it was determined that the wound was caused by a sickle. After further questioning, the investigator had all villagers bring their [[sickle]]s and lay them out before the crowd. [[Blow-fly|Blow flies]] were attracted to a single sickle because invisible remnants of blood and tissue still adhered to it. The owner of the alleged sickle later broke down and confessed the crime. In other areas of the text, the author demonstrates knowledge of blow fly activity on bodies relative to those orifices infested, the time of infestation, and the effect of trauma on attractiveness of tissue to such insects.

Brian McKnight describes the murder case involving the sickle as thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A local peasant from a Chinese village was found murdered, hacked to death by a hand sickle. The use of a sickle, a tool used by peasants to cut the rice at harvest time, suggested that another local peasant worker had committed the murder. The local magistrate began the investigation by calling all the local peasants who could be suspects into the village square. Each was to carry their hand sickles to the town square with them. Once assembled, the magistrate ordered the ten-or-so suspects to place their hand sickles on the ground in front of them and then step back a few yards. The afternoon sun was warm and as the villagers, suspects, and magistrates waited, bright shiny metallic green flies began to buzz around them in the village square. The shiny metallic colored flies then began to focus in on one of the hand sickles lying on the ground. Within just a few minutes many had landed on the hand sickle and were crawling over it with interest. None of the other hand sickles had attracted any of these pretty flies. The owner of the tool became very nervous, and it was only a few more moments before all those in the village knew who the murderer was. With head hung in shame and pleading for mercy, the magistrate led the murderer away. The witnesses of the murder were the brightly metallic colored flies known as the blow flies which had been attracted to the remaining bits of soft tissue, blood, bone and hair which had stuck to the hand sickle after the murder was committed. The knowledge of the village magistrate as to a specific insect group's behavior regarding their attraction to dead human tissue was the key to solving this violent act and justice was served in ancient China.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, Neal H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">The '''Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art''' (CIHA) is an international committee that endeavors to improve [[art history|art historical]] research.

It was created in 1930 in order to develop the historical and methodological study of artistic activities and productions; to ensure permanent links between [[art historian]]s of all countries; to improve methods of art historical teaching and research; and to increase the research resources available to art historians, i.e. data bases, bibliographies, photographic and [[Iconography|iconographical]] documentation. It stimulates international meetings of art historians and co-ordinates the dissemination of information about research undertaken under the aegis of the committee. Its conferences, publications and research projects disseminate information and publicity about art historical activities world-wide.

The CIHA is currently directed by Professor LaoZhu from Peking University in China. Former director is Georg Ulrich Großmann, director of the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]. Former members of the board included [[Millard Meiss]], [[Herbert von Einem]], [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]], [[Mario Salmi]], [[André Chastel]], [[Jacques Thuillier]], [[Jan Białostocki]] and many other well-known art historians.

Every four years, the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art holds a major Congress. The thirty-fourth Congress in the History of Art, organized by CIHA members, took place in Beijing, China, in September 2016. 

The [[National Committee for the History of Art]] (NCHA) is the U.S. affiliate of the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art.

'''Comparative criminal justice''' is a subfield of the study of [[Criminal Justice]] that compares [[justice]] systems worldwide. Such study can take a descriptive, historical, or political approach.&lt;ref name="PLR"&gt;Philip L. Reichel. (2005). ''Comparative Criminal Justice Systems'' (4th Ed.). Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson. {{ISBN|0-13-113159-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It studies the similarities and differences in structure, goals, [[punishment]] and emphasis on rights as well as the history and political stature of different systems. It is common to broadly categorize the functions of a criminal justice system into policing, adjudication (i.e.: courts), and corrections, although other categorization schemes exist. Comparativists study the four different types of [[societies]], their methods of enforcement and their different types of punishment such as capital punishment, and imprisonment. Within these societies they study different types of legal tradition and analyze the issues they solve and create. They use their information in order to learn effective ways of enforcing laws, and to identify and solve problems that may arise within a system due to its methods.

==Societies==
[[File:Supreme Court.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Supreme Court]]
Comparativists in criminal justice study four different kinds of societies: Folk-communal, Urban-commercial, Urban-industrial, and bureaucratic.&lt;ref name="apsu"&gt;O'Connor, T. August 16, 2010 '''Comparative Criminal Justice''' ''Megalinks in Criminal Justice'' retrieved from http://www.drtomoconnor.com/3040/3040lect01a.htm accessed on July 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Folk-communal societies are often seen as primitive and barbaric, they have little specialization among [[law]] enforcers, and let many problems go unpunished to avoid over-criminalization however, once tempers “boil over” and the situation becomes a larger issue, harsh and unusual punishment may be administered. Examples are African or Middle Eastern Tribes, or early [[puritan]] settlements of America. Urban-commercial societies have few written laws and some specialized enforcement for religious or king’s law enforcement. Punishments are inconsistent and usually harsh. Urban-industrial societies enforce laws that prescribe good behavior and give incentives and disincentives for behavior and police are specialized in property crimes such as theft. Finally, bureaucratic societies are today’s modern society. They feature fully developed laws, lawyers, and police forces trained for multiple types of crime. Different “side effects” of these societies include over-criminalization, overcrowding, and even juvenile delinquency due to the extended age of adolescence these societies bring on.&lt;ref name="apsu" /&gt;

==Legal Traditions==
[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|left|thumb|A Map of the Legal systems of the World.]]
Legal traditions play an important role in the development of [[international law]] and justice. Comparativists for criminal justice study these traditions with the intent of finding a way to combine the views of different traditions towards a single view that allows for the successful development of international law.&lt;ref name="zar"&gt;Zartner Falstrom, Dana. "The Role of Legal Tradition in the Development of International Law: Conflict or Compromise" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Political Science Association, Hotel Intercontinental, New Orleans, LA, Jan 09, 2008 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-10-27 http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p212496_index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many comparativists believe that the more states with similar legal views the more likely it is to be able to create international laws that please all.
Reichel (2005) identifies four major legal traditions that each have their own respective body of laws:
*[[Common law]] is found particularly in countries that are current or former members of the [[British Empire]].
*[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] countries include most of continental Europe and various states in South America and Africa.
*[[Socialist law]] is essentially civil law with major modifications from [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. It is currently only used in China and a few other contemporary [[Communism|Communist]] states, but has had enormous influence on [[Russia]] and the former [[USSR]].
*[[Sharia|Islamic law]] is religiously-inspired law used in [[Islam|Muslim]] countries.

==Punishment==
[[File:Death Penalty World Map.svg|right|thumb|Map of death penalty]]

People who study comparative criminal justice study different forms and use of punishment across societies, including [[capital punishment]]. Fifty-nine countries retain the death penalty as reported in 2007.&lt;ref name="over"&gt;Overview of the Death Penalty Worldwide as of 2008. http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt; Comparativists study the different ways in which execution is carried out across the world including hanging, shooting, beheading, injection, electrocution, and even stoning.&lt;ref name="over" /&gt; Comparativists find that in many developing countries such as Iran, Indonesia, Belarus, and many others, that violent methods of execution such as hanging beheading, shooting, and stoning are much more common ways of carrying out the death penalty, and in many cases the only ways. However in western culture as well as developed countries such as the United States less brutal execution such as lethal injection is utilized.&lt;ref name="over" /&gt; Even prison sentences can come harshly.  In many countries such as Burma a person can be sentenced to prison for merely disagreeing with the government.&lt;ref name="top"&gt;Top 10 Longest Prison Sentences in the World. Avery, L. May 2008. accessed on 28 October 2009 at {{cite web |url=http://www.listsergeant.com/site/index.php/content/article/top_10_longest_prison_sentences_in_the_world/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105161325/http://www.listsergeant.com/site/index.php/content/article/top_10_longest_prison_sentences_in_the_world |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably ridiculous sentences such as multiple life sentences or sentences of hundreds, even thousands of years are meant to prohibit the chance of parole in the future.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt; Although it may seem preposterous, western cultures carry out the same type of sentencing.
Even though similar sentences are used across the globe leniency is varied widely between societies. Many governments such as the one mentioned above in Burma provide swift and heavy punishment to assert their roles of power.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt;

[[File:Australian National Insect Collection - Buforaniidae - ZooKeys-209-147-g007.jpeg|thumb|Buforaniidae grasshoppers ([[Orthoptera]]) from the Australian National Insect Collection]]
The '''conservation and restoration of insect specimens''' is the process of caring for and preserving insects as a part of a collection. Conservation concerns begin at collection and continue through preparation, storage, examination, documentation, research and treatment when restoration is needed.

== Collection ==
[[File:Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay with Ernst Hackel 1866.jpg|left|thumb|261x261px]]
[[Insect collecting]] can be done in many different ways depending on the kind of insects being collected and from which habitats. Both hobbyists and professional entomologist have found particular ways to collect with minimal damage to their specimens. Following established techniques helps begin the conservation of insect specimens from the beginning by eliminating as much potential damage as possible. It must be done delicately to ensure that neither the collector nor the live insect itself will cause harm to the distinctive features such as wings, legs and antennae that give purpose to the collection. Special collection nets, traps and techniques must be utilized in consideration of how easily breakage can happen. A [[kill jar]] is often used to immediately immobilize the insect before it can damage itself.

== Preparation ==
The way an insect specimen is prepared is often the first step in their conservation. They have to be carefully prepared with the appropriate methods depending on their size, anatomy, and potentially delicate features to ensure they will not break before they begin their role as a specimen available for study, research and display. Some specimens must be prepared using a dry method and others with liquid to preserve. The choice made will preserve key features necessary for identification and represent the insect's living form as closely as possible.

=== Pinning ===
[[File:Neduba morsei, female, lateral view.jpg|thumb]]
The process of '''pinning''' insect specimens is a dry method to preserve and display collections and requires special [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|entomological equipment]] to accomplish effectively. It is used primarily for hard-bodied, medium to large specimens and is beneficial for easier study and color preservation. Flies and butterflies, though they are partially soft-bodied, are also best preserved through pinning because when preserved in fluid their hairs and/or scales will either clot or fall off.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 20 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Some smaller specimens may still be pinned use minuten pins, which are much thinner, to avoid breakage. Insects are pinned on foam block or specialized pinning blocks that provide support for the limbs while drying and may be moved to another specialized, protected display case after they have dried completely, at which point they will be more brittle. The pin is most often driven through the thorax of the insect just to the right of the mid-line to preserve the appearance of at least one side should any damage occur from pinning. The exception is butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies, which are pinned through the middle of the thorax.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Enough of the pin must be left both above and below the specimen to allow for labeling below and handling.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StagedandCardedInsects.jpg|left|thumb]]

=== Carding ===
'''Carding''' is used when pinning would destroy too much of the specimen because its size is quite small.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; A triangular point is cut from acid free card to ensure best conservation practice because it comes in direct contact with the specimen. A pin is then driven through the broad side of the point for mounting. A soluble glue that can be removed with solvents when necessary is used to adhere the right side of the thorax of the specimen to the point opposite the pinned side. The point is sometimes bent to allow the specimen to present in the same position as normally pinned specimens.

=== Wet specimen ===
A '''wet specimen''' is a specimen preserved in fluid, often 70% alcohol. Specimens that would receive this preservation technique are usually soft-bodied, such as caterpillars, larva, and spiders because of their soft abdomens. This is done to minimize shriveling allowing the identifying characteristics to be preserved as true to life as possible. Hard-bodied insects may also be preserved temporarily in alcohol before pinning.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slides ===
Slides of very small insects are also kept as part of insect collections.

== Core aspects of conservation ==
The [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) describes in their [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice.pdf?sfvrsn=9 Code of Ethics] the aspects of conservation to include: preventive conservation, examination, documentation, treatment, research and education. Each of these areas also apply to the conservation and restoration of insect specimens.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Insect collections may suffer multiple types of degradation including fading colors from light exposure, mold growth from improper humidity and temperature levels, and infestations from pests that feed on dried insect,&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M Agrilife Extension, (n.d.) [http://bughunter.tamu.edu/preservation/preservationconsider/ Bug hunter: Preservation considerations] Retrieved 2017-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; but much of this is avoidable when proper [[preventive conservation]] practices are followed.

==== Routine cleaning ====
In addition to maintaining a clean storage environment for specimens, it is sometimes necessary to clean the specimens themselves. Cleaning incredibly delicate and brittle dry insect specimens is done carefully and methodically. The conservator chooses the appropriate method based on the kind of insect that needs cleaning and how robust it is. Cleaning tools vary widely, but generally clean watercolor brushes are used to gently dust the specimens, sometimes with a [[stereo microscope]] for very small specimens, warm water and/or alcohol baths used with or without an ultrasonic cleaner, and lens blowers to gently blow away dust, or dry the specimen after a cleansing bath.&lt;ref&gt;Ingles-LeNobel, Johan, J. (March, 2017). [http://extreme-macro.co.uk/cleaning-insects/ How to clean insects] Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proper storage ====
A common way to prevent damage from pests intent to feed on insect specimens and dust accumulation in a collection is to keep them in sealed boxes or cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; When properly sealed, they can also aid in preventing damages cause by [[relative humidity]] (RH)  and temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Szczepanowska, H., Shockley, F., Furth, D. G., Gentile, P., Bell, D., DePriest, P. T., Mecklenburg, M., Hawks, C. Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections. (2013). Effectiveness of entomological collection storage cabinets in maintaining stable relative humidity and temperature in a historic museum building. ''Collection Forum, 27(1-2),'' 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Wet specimens are kept in separate vials or jars and in a secure cabinet, tray or shelf. Fluid levels are regularly monitored to ensure specimens are completely immersed in fluid, though a well-sealed jar or vial will prevent excessive evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safe handling ====
Proper handling for insect specimens prevents the excessive breaking of legs, antennae and other body parts that could then easily be lost. Curved forceps may be used to allow more precision and less chance of the brittle specimen coming in contact with the handler. The handler picks up the specimen by the pin, which is placed with enough space below the specimen for the handler to put in the pinning block and enough space above to grip without touching the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 11080 Tribolium destructor False black flour beetle.jpg|thumb|156x156px|The flour beetle, a common pest affecting dried insect specimens.]]

==== Integrated pest management ====
'''[[Integrated Pest Management (for museums)|Integrated pest management]]''' (IPM) is a specialized modern pest control used in museums.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R. A., &amp; Allman Gilmore, J. (2010). ''Museum registration methods 5th edition''. Washington, DC: The AAM Press&lt;/ref&gt; All IPM systems begin with regular sanitation and  monitoring of collections to detect castings from various pests, and checking insect traps laid out to capture and identify which pests are present. Some pests, such as carpet beetles and flour beetles, feed on dried insects.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 27 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; When an infestation is present, treatment may be necessary. Freezing is commonly used to rid insect collections of pests.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conservation Institute, (1997), [https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/ccinotesicc/3-3_e.pdf Controlling insect pests with low temperature] ''CCI Notes'' Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[inert gases]] may be used for an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] [[fumigation]] - depriving the pests of oxygen to exterminate, and in extreme cases chemical fumigation proven to be safe for collections and people may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examination  ===
[[File:Isoparce cupressi sjh.JPG|left|thumb|322x322px|Verdigris is present near the pin and an antennae is missing.]]
Assessing the condition of an insect collection is done regularly and the results are recorded accordingly. The conservator observes the specimens in high detail remarking all areas of damage, or altered states of the specimen. Tools used during this process may include a strong light source, magnifying glass and handling tools that allow the conservator to pick up the specimen from the pin without touching it. The observations made during the examination process result in the conclusions drawn for a treatment plan if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, B. (2010). ''Conservation treatment methodology.'' San Bernardino, CA. {{ISBN|1453682112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservator is knowledgeable of the kinds of deterioration to look for specific to insect specimens.

==== Common agents of deterioration ====
* Pests - Evidence of pests are recognized in castings of insects, their droppings or the damages they have caused from chewing on specimens.
* Mold - Mold is most likely to grow when humidity is high. 
* Verdigris - A blue-green hair-like crystallization caused by reaction to copper and brass entomological pins and the fats from the insects internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentation ===
The documentation of insect specimens is carried out in many different aspects of a specimen's existence. Documented information begins with the capture of an insect. The collector records information about capture method, place and date of capture and any relevant habitat information in field notes. This information is then transferred to labels and collection records. The documentation path then continues with every recorded observation or treatment the specimen receives. Killing agents, preservation agents, rehydrating agents, and fumigants are all important to record.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; This then informs any future decisions for conservation actions.

==== Labeling ====
As a minimum, labels contain the place and date of collection, and the identification of genus and species. On pinned insects, the labels are likewise pinned with the space left under the specimen on the same pin.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways to write the information on labels, but an ink that will not fade or come off in liquid is generally used. The paper is ideally 100% cotton or linen rag to avoid yellowing or embrittlement of the paper as it ages.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 3289 A pinned Australian sheep blowfly.jpg|left|thumb|145x145px]]

==== Photographing and digitization ====
With improvements in [[digital photography]] and web resources, many natural history museums have begun a new kind of documentation through digitization, bringing high quality images and associated information to anyone with access to the Internet. Large databases can hold vast amounts of information improving research efforts.

[[File:Odonata aeshnidae adult.jpg|thumb|Pen and ink scientific illustration of a dragonfly.]]

==== Illustrating ====
[[Scientific illustration]] of insects is an older technique used to preserve information about collected insects. It visually documents insects, and unlike photography, can add intellectual ideas about anatomy and behavior of the insect through artists' renditions. Scientifically informed observation of specimens combined with technical and aesthetic skill yields the highly detailed illustrations necessary for the documentation of each species that is illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, E. R. S. (2003). ''The guild handbook of scientific illustration: Second edition.'' Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Description of the state of the specimen and treatments ====
This area of insect specimen documentation comes after the close examination of specimens by conservators. The conservator records all of the visual information about the specimen that can be gleaned from detailed inspection. Conclusions are drawn from inspection and potential treatments are also documented to inform researchers and future conservators. 
[[File:Life cycle of ticks family ixodidae.PNG|thumb|Researching ticks helps develop health guidelines against the diseases they spread.]]

=== Research ===
Researching the collections of insects provides important information that develops knowledge about ecology, human health and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Well-kept records aid the researcher in identifying whether there are differences in an observed specimen because of damages, treatments or deterioration. Research of the insect collections in museums can lead to new discoveries of species,&lt;ref&gt;Entomology Today, July, 2106, [https://entomologytoday.org/2016/07/12/new-assassin-bug-species-discovered-in-museum-collections-and-in-the-field/ New assassin bug species discovered in museum collections and in the field] ''Entomology Today'' Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; and provide an important historical resource.&lt;ref&gt;Entomological Society of America, Jan. 2016, [http://www.entsoc.org/PDF/2016/ESA-PolicyStatement-EntomologicalCollections.pdf ESA position statement on the importance of entomological collections] Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment === 
Once a close observation reveals what issues are present in insect collections, the conservator makes a decision on actions to be taken. It is highly preferable that any treatment applied be reversible or done with little risk to the specimen. For example, broken limbs may be glued back on, which has traditionally been done with white glue. The advantage to white glue being that it is removable in warm water.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Another common problem is pest infestation. When dried insect collections have suffered an infestation, the affected specimens can be frozen or sealed with inert gases to kill the pests without harming the specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatments might include simply refilling wet specimens' jars with alcohol to ensure the specimens are completely submerged, cleaning specimens of dust and debris, or repositioning specimens for display or research. In the case that a specimen needs to be repositioned, the conservator will "relax" the specimen in a jar with a rehydrating substrate to move the limbs without breaking them. The technique used will vary among conservators. Some use a relaxing jar that the specimen is left in for days with the substrate of choice, others may choose to use a warm water bath with a drop of detergent. Whatever treatments are used are diligently documented.

=== Education ===
Conservation of insect specimens is done in large part to preserve the information for the public. The display of collections in museums and their interpretation offer one avenue that accomplishes this effort. However, websites offer a unique opportunity to disseminate information to a broad audience with layers of information to give general information or to provide depth where desired. These websites are often also provided by museums and their collections. Below is a list of some major educational endeavors with interests in insect specimens.

The '''cultural turn''' is a movement beginning in the early 1970s among scholars in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] to make [[culture]] the focus of contemporary debates; it also describes a shift in emphasis toward ''meaning'' and away from a [[positivist]] [[epistemology]]. The cultural turn is described in 2005 by [[Lynette Spillman]] and [[Mark D. Jacobs]] as "one of the most influential trends in the humanities and social sciences in the last generation".&lt;ref name="Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Mark|last2=Spillman|first2=Lynette|title=Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline|journal=Poetics|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X05000045 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.poetic.2005.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent [[historiographer]] argues that the cultural turn involved a "wide array of new theoretical impulses coming from fields formerly peripheral to the social sciences",&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinmetz|first=G|title=State/Culture: State-Formation after the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[post-structuralism]], cultural studies, literary criticism, and various forms of linguistic analysis, which emphasized "the causal and socially constitutive role of cultural processes and systems of signification".&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"/&gt;

==Background==
The cultural turn in the late 20th century is interpreted as referring to either a substantive shift in society or an analytical shift in academia. The former argues that culture plays a more significant role in advanced societies, which fits with the notion of [[post-modernity]] as an historical era in which people "emphasizes the importance of art and culture for education, moral growth, and social criticism and change".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steven|first1=Best|title=Culture Turn|journal=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2007 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_yr2013_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-202|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is movement within academia to place the concept of culture, and the related notions of ''meaning'', ''cognition'', ''affect'', and ''symbols'' at the center of methodological and theoretical focus. Some argue that the analytical shift is endogenous to the substantive shift.&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt;

Culture can be defined as "the social process whereby people communicate meanings, make sense of their world, construct their identities, and define their beliefs and values".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt; Or, for [[Georg Simmel]], [[culture]] refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Thus culture can be interpreted on a spectrum from purely individualistic [[solipsism]] to objective forms of social organization and interaction.

==History==

===Analytical shift===
One of the earliest works in which the term "cultural turn" showed up was [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]'s chapter "The New Theoretical Movement" in [[Neil Smelser]]'s ''Handbook of Sociology'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=Handbook of Sociology|year=1988|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=77–101|editor=Smelser, N. J.|chapter=The New Theoretical Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, rightly pointed out that the origins of the cultural turn should be traced in the debate of idealism and materialism i.e. Marx and Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Eyerman|first=Ron|title=Jeffrey Alexander and the Cultural Turn in Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Thesis Eleven&amp;#124;No. 79|pages=25–30|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the labeling of the movement, in the 1970s, "foundational works underlying and facilitating the turn to cultural forms of analysis" emerged: [[Hayden White]]'s ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (1973), [[Clifford Geertz]]'s ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (1973), [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1977), and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bonnell, V. E.  |author2=Hunt, L.|title=Beyond the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the earlier twentieth century experienced a linguistic turn, mostly brought about by the thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the cultural turn of the late twentieth century absorbed those criticisms and built on them.

The cultural turn has helped [[cultural studies]] to gain more respect as an academic discipline. With the shift away from [[high culture|high arts]] the discipline has increased its perceived importance and influence on other disciplines.

British historian Heather Jones argues that the [[World War I#Historiography|historiography of the First World War]] has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years.  Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalizion of politics, race, and the male body.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jones,  "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography." ''Historical Journal'' (2013) 56#3 pp: 857-878&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive shift===
The cultural turn as an historical era that breaks substantively with the past is only tangentially related to cultural turn as analytical shift. Proponents of the former argue that:

{{quote|“The very sphere of culture itself has expanded, becoming coterminous with market society in such a way that the cultural is no longer limited to its earlier, traditional or experimental forms, but it is consumed throughout daily life itself, in shopping, in professional activities, in the various often televisual forms of leisure, in production for the market and in the consumption of those market products, indeed in the most secret folds and corners of the quotidian. Social space is now completely saturated with the image of culture.”|[[Fredric Jameson]]| 1998, p. 111&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Fredric|title=The Cultural Turn: Selected Writings on the Postmodern, 1983-1998|year=1998|publisher=Verso|location=Brooklyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Advertising]], [[amateur photography]], [[yellow journalism]] and an assortment of other forms of media arose after the politically charged 1960s. Moreover, this media was [[multicultural]], and attempted to target all races, ethnicities and age groups, as opposed to more exclusive media prior to the 1960s. This "[[new media]]" of a [[postmodern]] America brought about an expansion and differentiation of culture, which has only been rapidly expanded by the [[Internet]] and [[social media]].

==In rural studies==
In recent years, there has been something of a resurgence in [[rural studies]], which has become somewhat more mainstream than previously in the academic space of social science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=M|title=Rural geography|date=2005|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing numbers of people have taken on important dualistic questions of society/space, nature/culture structure/agency and self/other from the perspective of rural studies. However, it is the 'cultural turn' in wider social science which has lent both respectability and excitement to the nexus with rurality, particularly with new foci on landscape, otherness and the spatiality of nature. With a conceptual fascination with difference, and a methodological fascination with [[ethnography]], cultural studies have provided a significant [[palimpsest]]ual overlay onto existing landscapes of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloke|first=P|title=Country backwater to virtual village? Rural studies and 'the cultural turn'|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|date=October 1998|volume=13|issue=4|pages=367–375|doi=10.1016/s0743-0167(97)00053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecoleasing''' is a system in which goods (mainly from the [[Cradle-to-cradle design|technical cycle]], i.e. appliances, ...) are rented to a client for a certain period of time after which he returns the goods so the company that made it can recycle the materials.

==Terminology==
The term ecoleasing has been used by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their book Cradle_to_Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things.&lt;ref&gt;Term found in Dutch version of the book&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to distinct itself from regular [[Lease|leasing]] in that:

* the operation is similar to regular [[Purchasing|purchasing of goods]], so not requiring a contract to be made up as with leasing
* it is done with appliances and other products used for the household, rather than with land or very expensive products (cars, ...)
* the period of time the product is rented would be about the same as the lifespan of the product, so it can only be rented once before it is taken back by the company to recover the materials (and to create another product with it)

==Examples==
Ecoleasing can for instance be done with TV's. Instead of the consumer purchasing the TV, by ecoleasing it, he is entitled to say 10 000 service hours. After this, he can send the TV back to the company.

==Advantages==
* Since materials are reclaimed, fewer or no materials end up in landfills, or require other forms of waste disposal. As such, it is quite environmental.
* Materials are recovered by which the company can make new products, so the material costs for this new product are much lower for the company.
* Since new products can be made at a lower expense, the sale price of these products can also be comparatively lower than similar products made by the competition (if they use a system of purchasing the goods)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">The '''extended mind thesis''' ('''EMT''') says that an agent's mind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor even body-bound, but extend into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonR&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/ |date=July 25, 2011}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Andy Clark|Clark]] and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] put it:

{{quote|Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?...We propose to pursue... an ''active externalism'', based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.|Andy Clark and David Chalmers: "[[The Extended Mind]]"&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3328150?sid=21105405194441&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739824&amp;uid=4 |title=The Extended Mind |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=1 |date=January 1998 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}; reprinted as: 
{{cite book |title= The Extended Mind |chapter=Chapter 2: The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |editor=Richard Menary  |pages=27–42 |isbn= 9780262014038 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010}}; and available on line as: {{cite web |title=The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=http://cogprints.org/320/1/extended.html |publisher=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question is raised as to the division point between the mind and the environment. The EMT proposes that some objects in the external environment are utilized by the [[mind]] in such a way that the objects can be seen as extensions of the mind itself. Specifically, the mind is seen to encompass every level of the cognitive process, which will often include the use of environmental aids.

==Criticism==

Philosophical arguments against the extended mind thesis include the following.&lt;ref name="Adams Aizawa"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ADADTB | title=Defending the bounds of cognition, in The Extended Mind (Eds, Richard Menary) |author1=Adams, Fred. |author2=Aizawa, Ken | year=2010 | pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# When focusing on cognition, the thesis confuses claims about what is constitutive about the concept of cognition with claims about causal influences on cognition (the "causal-constitutional fallacy"). For example, Adams and Aizawa (2010) write, "Question: Why did the pencil think that 2 + 2 = 4?, Clark’s Answer: Because it was coupled to the mathematician." 
# It stretches the limits of our ordinary concept of cognition too far ("cognitive bloating"), potentially implying that everything on the Internet is part of individual cognitive systems.
# It uses a coarse-grained functionalism about the mind that ignores plausible differences between internal and external processes, such as differences between beliefs and external props and devices; or for creating a notion of cognition too heterogeneous to make up a scientific natural kind.

Each of these arguments is addressed in Clark (2008), in which he notes:&lt;ref name="Supersizing"&gt;{{cite book | title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Clark, Andy | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# While coupling is important for cognition, that is not to say that it is sufficient – the coupling must play a functional role in cognition. Many couplings do not do so and thus would not be 'extensions' (and this is consistent with a strong extended mind thesis).
# Any putative part of a system – internal or external – is unlikely to yield "cognition" on its own. Thus, examples such as calculators, pencils, should be considered in parallel with neural regions. Simply looking at the part is not enough for cognition.
# One can imagine circumstances under which a biological being might retain information in non-neural ways (a hypothetical Martian with a bitmap-based memory, or humans with prosthetics to support memory). Thus, being neural cannot be a necessary condition for being cognitive.

While in ''Supersizing the Mind'' Clark defends a strong version of the hypothesis of [[extended cognition]] (contrasted with a hypothesis of embedded cognition) in other work, some of these objections have inspired more moderate reformulations of the extended mind thesis. Thus, the extended mind thesis may no longer depend on the parity considerations of Clark and Chalmers' original argument but, instead, emphasize the "complementarity" of internal and external elements of cognitive systems or processes. This version might be understood as emphasizing the explanatory value of the extended mind thesis for cognitive science rather than maintaining it as an ontological claim about the nature of mind or cognition.&lt;ref name="Supersizing" /&gt;

'''Food play''' can have sexual or non-sexual connotations. The term often refers to ''sitophilia'', a form of [[sexual fetishism]] in which participants are aroused by erotic situations involving [[food]]. The phrase is also used to refer to non-sexual play with food, such as playful and decorative food displays, enjoyment of preparing food, or even a play about food. This article refers to the sitophilia connotation of food play.

Some [[Aphrodisiac#Aphrodisiac foods and herbs|foods and herbs]] themselves are purported to cause [[sexual arousal]] in and of themselves. Food play overlaps with other fetishes, including [[wet and messy fetishism]], [[feederism]], and [[nyotaimori]]. It is differentiated from [[vorarephilia]] (often shortened to "vore") in that food play fetishizes food while vore fetishizes the act of eating a living creature, or being eaten alive.

==Practice==
Certain fruits (e.g., [[banana]]s), vegetables (e.g., [[cucumber]]s and [[zucchini]]s) and processed meat (e.g., [[sausages]] and [[hot dog]]s), if used safely, may be fetish objects because they have a [[phallic]] shape, and can be substitutes for [[dildo]]s, useful for [[vagina]]l or [[anal sex|anal]] penetration. Other foods are so constituted that they can be sexually penetrated by a [[penis]], if an appropriate hole is drilled in them, such as the namesake of ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''.

Francesco Morackini, an Austrian designer and artist, designed and created a home [[Dildo]] Maker. It allows phallic food to be sculpted into an even more phallic shape for easier insertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cargocollective.com/morackini/Dildo-Maker|access-date=2017-04-05|title=Dildo Maker|website=carocollective.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509173221/http://cargocollective.com/morackini/Dildo-Maker|archive-date=2017-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
A '''body shot''' is a [[Shot glass|shot]] of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] (such as [[tequila]]) that is consumed from a person's [[Human body|body]], usually from [[erogenous zones]] such as the [[navel]] or the [[breasts]].

In one version of the body shot, the person taking the shot holds a shot glass in one hand, while the person giving the shot holds a wedge of lime (or lemon) in his or her mouth.  The person taking the shot then licks a body part of  his or her choosing on the person giving the shot, sprinkles salt on that body part, and then licks the salt off the body part. The person then drinks the alcohol and then takes the citrus wedge out of the subject's mouth using only his or her mouth.

Another version of the body shot requires licking the partner's body as the shot runs down him or her.  In this example, the person having liquor poured on them lies on a table, floor, or any other flat surface, slightly propped up, leaning on an arm perhaps.  The person taking the shot positions him or herself around the belt buckle.  A third person then pours the shot slowly into the navel of the person lying down, and the person taking the shot must lick or suck the liquor up before it runs into the clothes of the person lying down.  This can also be done on the breasts, and with practice, the thighs, testicles, or buttocks.

The Japanese version, {{nihongo|'''wakamezake'''|わかめ酒}}, also called '''wakame sake''' and '''seaweed sake''', similarly involves drinking alcohol from a woman's body. The woman closes her legs tight enough that the triangle between the thighs and [[mons pubis]] form a cup, and then pours [[sake]] down her chest into this triangle. Her partner then drinks the sake from there. The name comes from the idea that the woman's pubic hair in the sake resembles soft seaweed ([[wakame]]) floating in the sea.

Adverse effects of gentamicin can range from less severe reactions such as nausea and vomiting to more severe reactions such as:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Low blood counts
* [[Hypersensitivity|Allergic responses]] 
* [[Neuromuscular disease|Neuromuscular]] problems
* [[neuropathy|Nerve damage]] 
* [[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)]]
* [[Ototoxicity|Ear disorders (ototoxicity)]]
[[Nephrotoxicity]] and [[ototoxicity]] are thought to be dose related with higher doses causing greater chance of toxicity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These two toxicities may have delayed presentation, sometimes not appearing until after completing treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Kidney damage ===
[[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage]] is a problem in 10-25% of people who receive aminoglycosides, and gentamicin is one of the most nephrotoxic of the class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Oftentimes acute nephrotoxicity is reversible, but it may be fatal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The risk of nephrotoxicity can be affected by the dose, frequency, duration of therapy, and concurrent use of certain medications such as NSAIDs, diuretics, cisplatin, ciclosporin, cephalosporin, amphotericin, iodide contrast media, and vancomycin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Factors that increase risk of nephrotoxicity include:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Increased age
* Reduced renal function
* Pregnancy
* Hypothyroidism
* Hepatic dysfunction
* Volume depletion
* Metabolic acidosis
* Sodium depletion
Kidney dysfunction is monitored by measuring [[creatinine]] in the blood, electrolyte levels, [[Oliguria|low urine output]], [[Proteinuria|foamy urine]],  and concentrations of other chemicals in the blood.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = New insights into the mechanism of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity: an integrative point of view|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ki.2010.337|journal = Kidney International|pages = 33–45|volume = 79|issue = 1|doi = 10.1038/ki.2010.337|first = Jose M|last = Lopez-Novoa|first2 = Yaremi|last2 = Quiros|first3 = Laura|last3 = Vicente|first4 = Ana I|last4 = Morales|first5 = Francisco J|last5 = Lopez-Hernandez|pmid = 20861826|date = Jan 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095505/http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ki.2010.337|archivedate = 2016-03-10|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inner ear ===
11% of the population who receives aminoglycosides experience damage to their [[inner ear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gentamicin induced ototoxicity during treatment of enterococcal endocarditis: resolution with substitution by netilmicin|journal = Heart|date = 2005-05-01|issn = 1355-6037|pmc = 1768868|pmid = 15831617|pages = e32|volume = 91|issue = 5|doi = 10.1136/hrt.2003.028308|first = J E|last = East|first2 = J E|last2 = Foweraker|first3 = F D|last3 = Murgatroyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common symptoms of inner ear damage are: [[tinnitus]], hearing loss, [[vertigo]], [[ataxia|trouble with coordination]], dizziness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Chronic use of gentamicin can affect two areas of the ears. First, damage of the inner ear hair cells can result in irreversible hearing loss. Second, damage to inner ear [[Vestibular system|vestibular]] apparatus can lead to balance problems.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity|journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1873-4286|pmid = 17266591|pages = 119–126|volume = 13|issue = 1|first = Erol|last = Selimoglu|doi=10.2174/138161207779313731}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of ototoxicity it is recommended to stay hydrated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Factors that increase risk of inner ear damage include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Uremia|High blood uric acid levels]]
* Kidney dysfunction  
* Liver dysfunction 
* Higher doses 
* Long courses of therapy
* Elderly
* Also taking strong diuretics (e.g. [[furosemide]])

==Mechanism of action==
Gentamicin is a [[bactericidal]] antibiotic that works by irreversibly binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis.  This mechanism of action is similar to other aminoglycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00798|title =DrugBank-Gentamicin|date =|accessdate =|publisher =|work =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221814/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00798|archivedate =2013-10-04|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===
Gentamicin is composed of a number of related gentamicin components and fractions which have varying degrees of antimicrobial potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Weinstein|first = Marvin J.|title = Biological Activity of the Antibiotic Components of the Gentamicin Complex|journal = Journal of Bacteriology|volume = 94.3|date = 1967|pages = 789–790|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main components of gentamicin include members of the gentamicin C complex: gentamicin C1, gentamicin C1a, and gentamicin C2 which compose approximately 80% of gentamicin and have been found to have the highest antibacterial activity. Gentamicin A, B, X, and a few others make up the remaining 20% of gentamicin and have lower antibiotic activity than the gentamicin C complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Vydrin|first = A. F.|title = Component Composition of Gentamicin Sulfate Preparations|doi = 10.1023/a:1027372416983|journal = Pharmaceutical Chemistry Journal|volume = 37|issue=8|date = 2003|pages = 448–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact composition of a given sample or lot of gentamicin is not well defined, and the level of gentamicin C components or other components in gentamicin may differ from lot-to-lot depending on the gentamicin manufacturer or manufacturing process. Because of this lot-to-lot variability, it can be difficult to study various properties of gentamicin including pharmacokinetics and microorganism susceptibility if there is an unknown combination of chemically related but different compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Isoherranen|first1 = Nina|last2 = Eran|first2 = Lavy|title = Pharmacokinetics of Gentamicin C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Beagles after a Single Intravenous Dose|url = |journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|volume = 44.6|date = 2000|pages = 1443–1447|accessdate = |doi = 10.1128/aac.44.6.1443-1447.2000|pmid = |pmc = 89894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
Gentamicin should not be used if a person has a history of [[hypersensitivity]] such as anaphylaxis shock or other serious toxic reaction to gentamicin or any other [[aminoglycosides]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Special populations ==

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Gentamicin is not recommended in pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the risks for the mother. Gentamicin can cross the [[placenta]] and several reports of [[congenital hearing loss|irreversible bilateral congenital deafness]] in children have been seen. [[Intramuscular injection|Intramuscular]] injection of gentamicin in mothers can cause [[muscle weakness]] in the [[newborn]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The safety and efficacy for gentamicin in nursing mothers has not been established. Detectable gentamicin levels are found in human breast milk and in nursing babies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Geriatrics===

[[Renal function]] should be assessed before beginning therapy and during in elderly due to a decline in [[Renal function|glomerular filtration rate]]. This population can have longer than usual gentamicin levels in the body. Use cautiously in persons with [[Kidney|renal]], [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[Vestibular system|vestibular]], or [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscular]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Pediatrics ===

Gentamicin may not be appropriate to use in children, including newborns and infants. Studies have shown higher [[Serum (blood)|serum]] levels and a longer [[half-life]] in this population. Check [[renal function]] periodically during therapy. [[Hypocalcaemia|Hypocalcemia]], [[hypokalemia]], and [[muscle weakness]] have been reported after gentamicin injection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gentamicin for injection.jpg|thumb|Gentamicin for injection]]

Gentamicin is produced by the fermentation of ''[[Micromonospora purpurea]]''. It was discovered in 1963 by Weinstein, Wagman et al. at Schering Corporation in Bloomfield, N.J. working with source material (soil samples) provided by Rico Woyciesjes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Marvin|author2=Wagman|title=Gentamicin, A New Antimicrobial Complex from Micromonospora|journal=J Med Chem|year=1963|volume=6|pages=463–464|doi=10.1021/jm00340a034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it was purified and the structures of its three components determined by Cooper, et al., also at the Schering Corporation. It was initially used as a topical treatment for burns at the Atlanta and San Antonio burn units and was introduced into IV usage in 1971. It remains a mainstay for use in sepsis.

It is synthesized by ''[[Micromonospora]]'', a genus of [[Gram-positive bacteria]] widely present in the environment (water and soil). To highlight their specific biological origins, gentamicin and other related antibiotics produced by this genus ([[verdamicin]], [[mutamicin]], [[sisomicin]], [[netilmicin]], and [[retymicin]]) generally have their spellings ending in ''~micin'' and not in ''~mycin''.

==Research==
Gentamicin is also used in [[molecular biology]] research as an antibacterial agent in tissue and cell culture, to prevent contamination of sterile cultures. Gentamicin is one of the few heat-stable antibiotics that remain active even after [[autoclave|autoclaving]], which makes it particularly useful in the preparation of some microbiological growth media.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Heather Dewey-Hagborg''' (born June 4, 1982, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]) is an information artist and [[Do-it-yourself biology|bio-hacker]].&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt; She is most noted for her project [[#Stranger Visions|''Stranger Visions'']]: a series of portraits created from [[DNA]] she recovered from discarded items, such as hair, cigarettes and chewing gum while living in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"/&gt; She sequenced the DNA at the Brooklyn open [[biotechnology]] laboratory, [[Genspace]].&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt; From the extracted DNA, she determined gender, ethnicity and other factors and then used face-generating software and a [[3D printer]] to create a speculative, algorithmically determined 3D portrait. While critical of technology and surveillance, her work has been found disturbing by some critics.&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/tech/innovation/dna-face-sculptures/ Natalie Angley, "Artist creates faces from DNA left in public"], CNN.com, September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Spurious Memories.jpg|thumb|''Spurious Memories'' (2007)]]
Dewey-Hagborg is an information and bio artist whose works explore the intersection between art and science.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colanduno|first1=Derek|authorlink=Derek Colanduno|title=Pieces of You #223|url=http://www.skepticality.com/piecesofyou|website=Skepticality|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student in the Information Arts program at [[Bennington College]],&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Alec|title=Mask Crusader|journal=New Yorker|date=July 1, 2013|volume=89|issue=19|pages=22–23|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/01/mask-crusader|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; she participated in computer science classes, which laid the groundwork for the science-based artwork she would later envision using [[algorithms]], [[electronics]], and [[computer programming]].&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; She earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 2003.

Dewey-Hagborg continued refining her work as an artist and computer programmer, studying [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; while obtaining a Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.) in Interactive Telecommunications from [[New York University]] (NYU)&lt;ref name="Schwendener1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwendener|first1=Martha|title=Populism, Technology, and Interactivity|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. It was here she curated a robotic performance art show called ''Robots on the March!'' in March 2005, and exhibited a piece called ''Lighter than Air: an experiment in constructing an autonomous flying robot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photosynthesis and Experiments in Sustainable Robotics|url=http://www.atasite.org/calendar/archive/index-24133.html|website=Artists' Television Access|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=March 25 – April 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Lighter Than Air|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJmu-AzrXH4|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a final project at NYU, Dewey-Hagborg explored the question "Can computers be creative?" in an exhibit she called Spurious Memories. She developed an autonomous face categorizing and generating software program which recognized facial components, made comparisons and adjustments, and produced unique representations of the human face through mass exposure to facial images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Spurious Memories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1elpx1rz_R0|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2014, Dewey-Hagborg resides in [[Chicago, Illinois]], teaching art and technology studies at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art and Technology Studies: Faculty|url=http://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/heatherdewey-hagborg|website=School of the Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an educator her areas of interest include art and technology, multimedia, digital photography, research-based art and programming, and computer science.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dewey-Hagborg/&gt;

==Selected projects==
===Totem===
[[File:Heather Dewey-Hagborg Totem.jpg|thumb|''Totem'' (2010)]]
Dewey-Hagborg's ''Totem'' (2010) was a site-specific multimedia sculpture characterizing her earlier work. ''Totem'', an idol, was designed to explore the implications of language and artificial intelligence using [[machine learning]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Guide July thru December 2011|url=http://issuu.com/groundsforsculpture/docs/summerfall2011|website=ISSUU.com|accessdate=August 5, 2014|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting audio surveillance techniques to eavesdrop on and record conversations at the installation site, Dewey-Hagborg wrote algorithms to then isolate word sequences and grammatical structures into commonly used units. Influenced by [[Hebbian theory]], she programmed the sculpture's computer to generate speech based on the most frequently occurring language structures in any given recording period. Over time, the least frequently elicited words or units would fade or be dropped from the sculpture's spoken vocabulary. The remaining units, stored in the sculpture's memory, were then spoken at random intervals.&lt;ref name=Totem/&gt;

The piece also reflected the writings of psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]]. According to Dewey-Hagborg, Jaynes theorized that an early form of human consciousness evolved as a result of hallucinated speech experienced by the Mari civilization of the [[Euphrates]]. The ancient people interpreted water trickling through a goddess statue as whispers or vocalizations from the goddess herself.&lt;ref name=Totem/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg saw a parallel between the "mystical and authoritative power of language in the ancient world and the force of power of technology today"&lt;ref name="Totem"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Totem|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsTu3Iv1408|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with this piece, sought to explore how technology is used to shape public opinion and behavior.

Martha Schwendener, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that ''Totem'' showed promise, but, because of audio difficulties and its fragmented, randomly generated speech, the piece "failed to connect human speech, meaning, and technology in a profound fashion."&lt;ref name="Schwendener, M."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwendener|first1=Martha|title=Populism, Technology, and Interactivity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/nyregion/at-grounds-for-sculpture-works-by-james-surls-and-daniel-henderson-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 5, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stranger Visions'' (2012&amp;ndash;2014) is a science-based, artistic exploration using DNA as a starting point for Dewey-Hagborg's lifelike, computer generated 3-D portraits.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins, M."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Mark|title=A 'Cyber' exhibit as timely as the news|work=Washington Post|date=September 18, 2013|page=E18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krulwich, R."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krulwich|first1=Robert|title=Artist plays detective: Can I reconstruct a face from a piece of hair?|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/28/196307915/artist-plays-detective-can-i-reconstruct-a-face-from-a-piece-of-hair|website=NPR|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trafics optiques a l'heure numerique: a Creteil, l'exposition "Micro Macro" interroge notre perception du reel"|work=Le Monde|date=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of her research for ''Stranger Visions'', Dewey-Hagborg took a three-week crash-course&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; in biotechnology at Genspace, a non-profit, community-based biotechnology laboratory in New York. She was astonished to learn how much an amateur biologist could learn about someone.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Linda|title=Guarding Our DNA: Art project exposes the vulnerability of the genetic material we unintentionally leave behind|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=June 24, 2013|volume=91|issue=25|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pauwels|first1=Eleanore|title=Leave me your DNA ... and I'll 3-D print your face|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/01/dna-art-recreate-faces|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began the process of extracting DNA from the samples she collected. The extraction involves treating a hair sample, for example, with a gel that dissolves the hair, and a primer specifically developed to help locate characteristics like eye color or gender along the [[genome]].&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gruber|first1=Ben|title=Artist stirs privacy debate with portraits from DNA|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2013/07/02/artist-stirs-privacy-debate-with-portrai?videoId=243713123|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=Reuters|date=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey-Hagborg might repeat this process up to 40 times,&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt; looking for genetic variants influencing traits like eye color, hair color, and racial ancestry, in order to complete a portrait.&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aldous|first1=Peter|title=Artwork highlights legal debate over 'abandoned' DNA|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23677-artworks-highlight-legal-debate-over-abandoned-dna.html#.U-N6YUi9g7A|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=New Scientist|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the DNA strands are extracted from the samples, Dewey-Hagborg then amplifies, or copies, specific regions of the genome, using a technique called [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]], or PCR, a process advanced by [[Kary Mullis]], a winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry (1993).&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; These amplified regions of the genome make it possible to identifying [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]], or SNPs (pronounced "snips"),&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt; which contain variables in the base pairs that give clues to a person's individual genetic make up (e.g., whether or not a person's eyes might be blue, brown or green). These results are then sent for analysis to a company for sequencing. Dewey-Hagborg used [[23andMe]],&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt; a DNA analysis service, for ''Stranger Visions''.

The genetic blueprint&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."/&gt; she receives in return is a text file full of coded information identifying the unique positioning of the 4 [[nucleobase]]s [[adenine]], [[thymine]], [[cytosine]], and [[guanine]], or ATC and G, that make up the sections of the genome she is interested in.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt; This data is then entered into a customized computer program she wrote.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt; The program interprets the code and provides her with a list of traits, including propensity for obesity, eye color, hair color, hair curl, skin tone, freckles, and gender.&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; She then takes these traits, as many as 50, and enters them into a face-generating program to configure the 3-D portraits.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; Her previous experience with facial recognition algorithms gave her the ability to repurpose an existing [[facial recognition system|facial recognition program]], from [[Basel]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Walters, H."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walters|first1=Helen|title=A Portrait from a Single Hair: The Work of Heather-Dewey Hagborg|url=http://ideas.ted.com/2013/06/20/generating-a-sculpture-from-a-hair-the-work-of-heather-dewey-hagborg/|website=Ideas.Ted.Com|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reworked the program to generate faces instead of just recognizing facial features.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; The resulting model changes facial dimensions (e.g., width of the nose and mouth) and characteristics with the genetic information it receives. Before making the final 3-D print,&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg generates several different versions of the face, finally choosing the one she finds most aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Kurt|title=Making Portraits out of DNA|url=http://www.studio360.org/story/267842-making-portraits-out-of-dna|website=Studio 360|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's ''Stranger Visions'' question whether or not the work crosses ethical and legal boundaries.&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aldous|first1=Peter|title=Who's looking through your discarded DNA?|journal=New Scientist|date=2013-06-15|volume=281|issue=2921|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make a distinction between an artist's right to express societal concerns through artwork and the act of collecting personal, genetic information without informed consent.&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."/&gt; The fact that DNA samples are regularly "left behind" or abandoned does not mean those people have relinquished their interest in how that information is used.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;

Some laws, like that of the [[Human Tissue Act of 2004]] in the United Kingdom, prohibit private individuals from collecting biological samples for DNA analysis.&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; What laws that exist to regulate the collection and use of DNA samples in the United States are not consistent among the states and rarely address the private sector.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt; Only some states, like New York, outlaw most DNA testing without written consent.&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"/&gt; Others worry about the misuse of the information, fearing discrimination based on existing medical or mental health issues or a predisposition for disease-related illnesses or "unreasonable" searches of DNA evidence by law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enserink, M."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enserink|first1=Martin|title=Emerging Forensics Field May Hit Legal and Ethical Obstacles|journal=Science|date=February 18, 2011|volume=331|doi=10.1126/science.331.6019.840|pages=840|pmid=21330505}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 7, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One scientist and one gallery, according to Dewey-Hagborg, turned down her proposal fearing the project would "cause a fright" among people.&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;

Other critics focus on the growing do-it-yourself or [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohacking]] movement. Supporters like Genspace's Ellen Jorgensen claim projects like ''Stranger Visions'' engage the public and make the new technology more accessible.&lt;ref name="Krulwich, R."/&gt; Detractors fear unintended or unexpected consequences from unregulated experiments conducted by D.I.Y. amateur biologists developed in non-traditional laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;

Still others, including Daniel MacArthur, an assistant professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], [[John D. Hawks]], an anthropologist at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], Michelle N. Meyer, an academic fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology &amp; Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, and [[Arthur Caplan]], PhD, Director of the Division of Medical Ethics, N.Y.U., report that the technological capability to construct an accurate likeness of a human face based on DNA evidence is not currently available.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;

Although it is possible to identify certain genetic markers linked to facial structures, scientists have yet to isolate all the genes and their variations needed to produce an accurate likeness with a computer simulation.&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt; Meyer, who analyzed the data from Dewey-Hagborg's website concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So far as I can tell, she's working with sex; ancestral groups that are usually very broad, and in any event only reflects half of the individual's DNA (from which she presumably guesses hair color and texture and bone structure); and a decent guess at eye color. There are hundreds of thousands (at least) of people who would fit these descriptions even if each of her phenotype predictions were accurate, and in many cases, one or more of the predictions are probably going to be wrong.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The environment, the probabilistic nature of interpreting the DNA data collected, and limitations of computer technology all influence the outcome.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; She likens her work to that of a sketch artist.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt; At most, her portraits bear only a vague, family resemblance to the people whose genetic information was used as a foundation for the portraits.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;

===''A Becoming Resemblance''===
In the summer of 2017 Dewey-Hagborg's collaborative exhibition with transgender activist [[Chelsea E. Manning]] opened at Fridman Gallery. The exhibition was an iteration of the artist's successful and controversial ''Stranger Visions'' project.&lt;ref name="Kobler, J."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kobler|first1=Jason|title=Don't Give Your DNA to Giant Genetic Databases|work=Vice|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''A Becoming Resemblance'', Dewey-Hagborg created a series titled ''Radical Love'', 30 3-D printed portraits of Manning, based on cheek swabs and hair clippings that Manning sent her while incarcerated for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks. While all 30 portraits were based on Manning's DNA, their variances in skin color and features presents the malleability of DNA data. The installation demonstrated how much the human genome is up for interpretation once condensed and subjectively interpreted. "&lt;ref name="Nevins, J."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nevins|first1=Jake|title=A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA.|work=The Guardian|date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Becoming Resemblance'' has since traveled to numerous institutions for exhibition, including The Transmedial in Berlin&lt;ref name="Taylor, A."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Alan|title=Photos of the Week: Super Blue Blood Moon, Starry Night, Stratofortress|work=The Atlantic|date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delaware===
[[File:Invisible-3.tif|thumb|''Invisible'' (2014)]]
In 2013, Dewey-Hagborg was contacted by an assistant medical examiner in Delaware,&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt; as a result of her work with ''Stranger Visions''. The project involved developing a portrait of an unidentified woman whose case has remained unsolved for 20 years. She agreed to be an adviser to assist with the case.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; Though the resulting portrait based on the unidentified woman's DNA could only be as accurate as existing technology allowed, leaving room for speculation, Dewey-Hagborg viewed working on the case as the only potential use for this type of face-generating technology.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt; "If you can add anything at all to her description, if you can increase the possibility her loved ones may find her even one little bit I think it's worth it."&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt; Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's involvement in the Delaware case express concern for what they call "D.I.Y. forensic science" and question the role of civilians in state investigations.&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;

Dewey-Hagborg's work with ''Stranger Visions'' and interest in issues surrounding genetic surveillance lead to the development of two products whose purpose is to eliminate DNA traces. The first, ''Erase'', is a bleaching spray that cleans surfaces (e.g., cups, silverware) of DNA evidence. The second, ''Replace'', is a spray consisting of a blend of genes designed to introduce foreign DNA evidence to the surface, therefore masking any of the original DNA remaining in that area.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg views these as a "citizens' defense against the looming DNA surveillance state."&lt;ref name="Hartnett, K."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartnett|first1=Kevin|title=How to cover your DNA trail|work=Boston Globe|date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SoborulZeitelor3Cucuteni.JPG|thumb|Possible Neolithic tattoo marks depicted on a Pre-[[Cucuteni culture]] clay figure from Romania, c. 4900–4750 BC]]
[[Tattoo]]ing has been practiced across the globe since at least [[Neolithic]] times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art and the archaeological record.&lt;ref&gt;

However, direct evidence for tattooing on mummified human skin extends only to the [[4th millennium BC]].

==Ancient and traditional practices==

===China===
Cemeteries throughout the [[Tarim Basin]] ([[Xinjiang]] of western [[China]]) including the sites of Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa have revealed [[Tarim mummies|several tattooed mummies]] with Western Asian/Indo-European physical traits and cultural materials. These date from between 2100 and 550 BC.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt;

In ancient [[China]], tattoos were considered a barbaric practice, and were often referred to in literature depicting bandits and folk heroes. As late as the [[Qing Dynasty]],{{when|date=August 2013}}&lt;!--specifically--&gt; it was common practice to tattoo [[Chinese characters|characters]] such as {{lang|zh|囚}} ("Prisoner") on convicted criminals' faces. Although relatively rare during most periods of Chinese history, [[Slavery in China|slaves]] were also sometimes marked to display ownership.

However, tattoos seem to have remained a part of southern culture.  [[Marco Polo]] wrote of [[Quanzhou]], "Many come hither from Upper India to have their bodies painted with the needle in the way we have elsewhere described, there being many adepts at this craft in the city". At least three of the main characters {{ndash}} [[Lu Zhishen]], Shi Jin (史進), and Yan Ching (燕青) {{ndash}} in the classic novel ''[[Water Margin]]'' are described as having tattoos covering nearly all of their bodies. [[Wu Song]] was sentenced to a facial tattoo describing his crime after killing Xi Menqing (西門慶) to avenge his brother. In addition, [[Chinese mythology|Chinese legend]] claimed the mother of [[Yue Fei]] (a famous [[Song Dynasty|Song]] general) tattooed the words "Repay the Country with Pure Loyalty" ({{lang|zh|精忠報國}}, ''jing zhong bao guo'') down her son's back before he left to join the army.

===Greece and Rome===
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] written records of tattooing date back to at least the 5th-century BCE.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt;{{rp|19}} The ancient Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used tattooing to penalize slaves, criminals, and prisoners of war. While known, decorative tattooing was looked down upon and religious tattooing was mainly practiced in [[Egypt#Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria#Classical antiquity|Syria]].&lt;ref name=Jones1987&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=C. P.|title=Stigma: Tattooing and branding in Graeco-Roman antiquity|journal=Journal of Roman Studies|date=1987|volume=77|pages=139–155|doi=10.2307/300578|url=https://doi.org/10.2307/300578|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} According to [[Robert Graves]] in his book ''The Greek Myths'', tattooing was common amongst certain religious groups in the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] world, which may have contributed to the prohibition of tattooing in [[Leviticus]]. The Romans of [[Late Antiquity]] also tattooed soldiers and arms manufacturers, a practice that continued into the ninth century.&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|155}}

The [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''stizein'' (στίζειν), meaning "to prick," was used for tattooing. Its derivative ''stigma'' (στίγμα) was the common term for tattoo marks in both Greek and [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|142}} During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], the verb ''kentein'' (κεντεῖν) replaced ''stizein'', and a variety of new Latin terms replaced ''stigmata'' including ''signa'' "signs," ''characteres'' "stamps," and ''cicatrices'' "scars."&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|154–155}}

===India===

In Southern [[India]], permanent tattoos are called ''pachakuthu''. It was very common in [[South India]], especially [[Tamil Nadu]], before 1980. In northern India, permanent tattoos are called ''godna''. Tattoos have been used as cultural symbols among many tribal populations, as well as the general [[Hindu]] population of India.

In India, tattoos have many names, including ''tarazwa'', ''gondan'', and ''ungkala''.

===Indonesia===

Several Indonesian tribes have tattooing in their culture. One notable example is the [[Dayak people]] of Kalimantan in Borneo ([[Bornean traditional tattooing]]). Another ethnic group that practices tattooing are the [[Mentawai people]], as well as Moi and Meyakh people in West Papua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rajaampatdoberai.com/unique-traditions-in-papua-including-raja-ampat/|title=UNIQUE TRADITIONS IN PAPUA, INCLUDING RAJA AMPAT - Raja Ampat Doberai|website=www.rajaampatdoberai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tattooing for spiritual and decorative purposes in Japan is thought to extend back to at least the [[Jōmon]] or [[Paleolithic]] period and was widespread during various periods for both the Japanese and the native [[Ainu people|Ainu]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Chinese texts from before 300 AD described social differences among Japanese people as being indicated through tattooing and other bodiapanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of World Cultures CD-ROM|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/japan.htm |access-date=10 July 2015 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese texts from the time also described Japanese men of all ages as decorating their faces and bodies with tattoos.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=Tattoo history: A source book|date=2000|publisher=Juno Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-890451-06-6|url=http://www.powerhousebooks.com/books/the-tattoo-history-source-book-paperback/|format=Paperback|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1603 and 1868, Japanese tattooing was only practiced by the ''[[ukiyo]]'' (floating world) subculture. Generally firemen, manual workers and prostitutes wore tattoos to communicate their status.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} By the early 17th century, criminals were widely being tattooed as a visible mark of punishment. Criminals were marked with symbols typically including crosses, lines, double lines and circles on certain parts of the body, mostly the face and arms. These symbols sometimes designated the places where the crimes were committed. In one area, the character for "dog" was tattooed on the criminal's forehead.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000 /&gt;{{rp|77}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A history of Japanese tattooing|url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo_museum/chinese_japanese_tattoos.html|website=vanishingtattoo.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Meiji Japan]], formed in 1868, banned the art of tattooing altogether, viewing it as barbaric and lacking respectability. This subsequently created a subculture of criminals and outcasts. These people had no place in "decent society" and were frowned upon. They could not simply integrate into mainstream society because of their obvious visible tattoos, forcing many of them into criminal activities which ultimately formed the roots for the modern Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, with which tattoos have become almost synonymous in Japan.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Nile Valley===

====Egypt and Nubia====
Despite a lack of direct textual references, tattooed human remains and iconographic evidence indicate that [[ancient Egypt]]ians practiced tattooing from at least 2000 BCE.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tassie|first=Geoffrey J.|title=Identifying the practice of tattooing in ancient Egypt and Nubia|journal=Papers from the Institute of Archaeology|date=2003|volume=14|pages=85–101|doi=10.5334/pia.200|url=https://doi.org/10.5334/pia.200|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86,89}} It is theorized that tattooing entered Egypt through [[Nubia]],&lt;ref name=Bianchi1988&gt;{{cite book|last=Bianchi|first=Robert S.|editor-last=Rubin|editor-first=Arnold|title= Marks of civilization: Artistic transformations of the human body|date=1988|chapter=Tattoo in ancient Egypt|publisher=Museum of Cultural History, University of California, Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-930741-12-9|pages=21–28|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} but this claim is complicated by the high mobility between Lower Nubia and [[Upper Egypt]] as well as Egypt's [[annexation]] of Lower Nubia during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|92}} Archeologist Geoffrey J. Tassie argues that it may be more appropriate to classify tattoo in ancient Egypt and Nubia as part of a larger [[Nile|Nile Valley]] tradition.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|93}}

The most famous tattooed mummies from this region are Amunet, a priestess of [[Hathor]], and two Hathoric dancers from [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XI]] that were found at [[Deir el-Bahari]].&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|90}} In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor from [[Cairo]], wrote an article on [[medical tattoo]]ing practices in ancient Egypt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminocorpus.org/bibliotheque/page/8912/#page|title=Archives de l'Anthropologie Criminelle (tome 13 ; 1898) — Page 270|work=criminocorpus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he describes the tattoos on these three mummies and speculates that they may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: "The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic [[pelvic peritonitis]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/researchers-in-museums/2012/12/10/tattooed-mummy-amunet/ Tattooing in Ancient Egypt Part 2: The Mummy of Amunet] by Gemma Angel, on 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian tattooing appears to have been practiced on women exclusively; with the possible exception of one extremely worn [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XII]] [[stele]], there is no artistic or physical evidence that men were tattooed.&lt;ref name=Bianchi1988 /&gt; However, by the [[Kingdom of Kush#Move to Meroë|Meroitic Period]] (300 BCE – 400 CE), it was practiced on Nubian men as well.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|88}}

Accounts of early travelers to ancient Egypt describe the tool used as an uneven number of metal needles attached to a wooden handle.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|86–87}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keimer|first=Louis|title=Remarques sur le Tatouage dans l’Égypte Ancienne|journal=Memoires Presentés à l’Institut D’Égypte|location=Le Caire|publisher=L’institut Français d’Archéologie Orientale|date=1948|language=French|volume=53|pages=55–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Copts====
Coptic tattoos often consist of three lines, three dots and two elements, reflecting the [[Trinity]]. The tools used had an odd number of needles to bring luck and good fortune.&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|87}} Many [[Copts]] have the [[Coptic cross]] tattooed on the inside of their right arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mojoey.blogspot.com/2005/01/coptic-orthodox-tattoo.html |title=Deep Thoughts: Coptic Orthodox Tattoo |publisher=Mojoey.blogspot.com |date=19 January 2005 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|145}} This may have been influenced by a similar practice tattooing religious symbols on the wrists and arms during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic period]].&lt;ref name=Tassie2003 /&gt;{{rp|91}}

===Persia===
[[Herodotus|Herodotus']] writings suggest that slaves and prisoners of war were tattooed in Persia during the [[Iran#Classical antiquity|classical era]]. This practice spread from Persia to Greece and then to Rome.&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|146–147,155}}

The most famous depiction of tattooing in [[Persian literature]] goes back 800 years to a tale by [[Rumi]] about a man who is proud to want a lion tattoo but changes his mind once he experiences the pain of the needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persian-tattoo.com/rumi-tattoo-story.html|title=Rumi's Tattoo Story - Persian tattoo designs|first=Payman|last=Hamed|website=www.persian-tattoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Turkish bath|hamam]]'' (the baths), there were ''dallaks'' whose job was to help people wash themselves. This was a notable occupation because apart from helping the customers with washing, they were massage-therapists, dentists, barbers and tattoo artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persian-tattoo.com/history-of-persian-tattoo.html|title=History - Persian tattoo designs|first=Payman|last=Hamed|website=www.persian-tattoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The history of mankind (1896) (14761627334).jpg|thumb|180px|1896 illustration of [[Igorot]] tattoo patterns which are records of war exploits and status]]
Tattooing has been a part of Filipino life since pre-[[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Hispanic colonization]] of the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]]. Tattooing in the Philippines, to some, were a form of rank and accomplishments, and some believed that tattoos had magical qualities. The more famous tattooed [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]] resided in north [[Luzon]], especially among the [[Igorot people|Bontoc, Kalinga and Ifugao peoples]]. The [[Visayans]] of the southern islands were also heavily tattooed.

Filipino tattooing was first documented by the European Spanish explorers as they landed among the islands in the late 16th century, and they called the natives ''[[Pintados|Los Pintados]]'' (The Painted Ones) as they mistook the tattoos for paint. Before European exploration, tattooing was widespread, but conversion to Christianity greatly diminished the practice as heathen or low-class.

As Lane Wilcken's ''Filipino Tattoos Ancient to Modern'' denotes, there are many similarities between the tattooing traditions of the Philippines and indigenous Polynesian designs – not only with their societal function and similar designs, but in the tools used to hand-tap them  a needle or thorn on a stick, with a hammer to pound it into the skin). While the most common modern term for indigenous tattoos is ''batok,'' an ancient [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for tattoos was ''tatak,'' extremely similar to the Samoan word ''tatau''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====New Zealand====
{{main|Tā moko}}
The [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]] practised a form of tattooing known as [[tā moko]], traditionally created with chisels.

However, from the late 20th century onward, there has been a resurgence of tā moko taking on European styles amongst Maori. Traditional tā moko was reserved for head area. There is also a related tattoo art, kirituhi, which has a similar aesthetic to tā moko but is worn by non-Maori.

====Samoa====
The traditional male tattoo in Samoa is called the [[pe'a]]. The traditional female tattoo is called the [[malu]]. The word ''tattoo'' is believed to have originated from the Samoan word ''tatau.'' {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

When the [[Samoan Islands]] were first seen by Europeans in 1722 three Dutch ships commanded by Jacob Roggeveen visited the eastern island known as Manua. A crew member of one of the ships described the natives in these words, "They are friendly in their speech and courteous in their behavior, with no apparent trace of wildness or savagery. They do not paint themselves, as do the natives of some other islands, but on the lower part of the body they wear artfully woven silk tights or knee breeches. They are altogether the most charming and polite natives we have seen in all of the South Seas..."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The ships lay at anchor off the islands for several days, but the crews did not venture ashore and did not even get close enough to the natives to realize that they were not wearing silk leggings, but their legs were completely covered in [[tattoos]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
[[File:Back view Samoan male tatau - photo Thomas Andrew - 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Back view of a [[Samoans|Samoan]] man with tattoos (c. 1890)]]
In Samoa, the tradition of applying [[tattoo]], or tatau, by hand has been unbroken for over two thousand years. Tools and techniques have changed little. The skill is often passed from father to son, each [[tattoo]] artist, or tufuga, learning the craft over many years of serving as his father's apprentice. A young artist-in-training often spent hours, and sometimes days, tapping designs into sand or tree bark using a special [[tattooing]] comb, or au. Honoring their tradition, Samoan tattoo artists made this tool from sharpened boar's teeth fastened together with a portion of the turtle shell and to a wooden handle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Traditional Samoan tattooing of the "pe'a", body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It takes many weeks to complete. The process is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a matai title; this however is no longer the case. [[Tattooing]] was also a very costly procedure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Samoan society has long been defined by rank and title, with chiefs (ali'i) and their assistants, known as talking chiefs (tulafale). The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs, typically conducted at the time of puberty, were part of their ascendance to a leadership role. The permanent marks left by the [[tattoo]] artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions. The pain was extreme and the risk of death by infection was a concern; to back down from tattooing was to risk being labeled a "pala'ai" or coward. Those who could not endure the pain and abandoned their tattooing were left incomplete, would be forced to wear their mark of shame throughout their life. This would forever bring shame upon their family so it was avoided at all cost. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Samoan tattooing process used a number of tools which remained almost unchanged since their first use. "Autapulu" is a wide tattooing comb used to fill in the large dark areas of the tattoo. "Ausogi'aso tele" is a comb used for making thick lines. "Ausogi'aso laititi" is a comb used for making thin lines. "Aumogo" small comb is used for making small marks. "Sausau" is the mallet is used for striking the combs. It is almost two feet in length and made from the central rib of a coconut palm leaf. "Tuluma" is the pot used for holding the tattooing combs. Ipulama is the cup used for holding the dye. The dye is made from the soot collected from burnt lama nuts. "Tu'I"  used to grind up the dye. These tools were primarily made out of animal bones to ensure sharpness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The tattooing process itself would be 5 sessions, in theory. These 5 sessions would be spread out over 10 days in order for the inflammation to subside.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Christian missionaries from the west attempted to purge tattooing among the Samoans, thinking it barbaric and inhumane. Many young Samoans resisted mission schools since they forbade them to wear tattoos. But over time attitudes relaxed toward this cultural tradition and tattooing began to reemerge in Samoan culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[File:Scythian tatoo.jpg|thumb|upright|A tattoo on the right arm of a [[Scythian]] chieftain whose mummy was discovered at [[Ukok Plateau|Pazyryk]], [[Russia]]. The tattoo was made between about 200 and 400 BC.]]

===Siberia===
Tattooed mummies dating to c. 500 BC were extracted from [[Pazyryk burials|burial mounds]] on the Ukok plateau during the 1990s. Their tattooing involved animal designs carried out in a [[curvilinear]] style. The Man of [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], a [[Scythian]] chieftain, is tattooed with an extensive and detailed range of fish, monsters and a series of dots that lined up along the spinal column (lumbar region) and around the right ankle.

===Solomon Islands===
Some artifacts dating back 3,000 years from the [[Solomon Islands]] may have been used for tattooing human skin. [[Obsidian]] pieces have been duplicated, then used to conduct tattoos on pig skin, then compared to the original artifacts. "They conducted these experiments to observe the wear, such as chipping and scratches, and residues on the stones caused by tattooing, and then compared that use-wear with 3,000 year old artifacts. They found that the obsidian pieces, old and new, show similar patterns, suggesting that they hadn't been used for working hides, but were for adorning human skin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/issues/235-1611/world "World Roundup"] 2016.

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], facial tattoos of the [[Atayal people]] are called ''ptasan''; they are used to demonstrate that an adult man can protect his homeland, and that an adult woman is qualified to weave cloth and perform housekeeping.&lt;ref name="citing.hohayan.net.tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citing.hohayan.net.tw/citing_content.asp?id=2725&amp;keyword=%AF%BE%AD%B1|title=紋面|work=臺灣原住民族歷史語言文化大辭典''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan is believed to be the homeland of all the [[Austronesian peoples]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=Robert|title=The prehistory of the Austronesian speaking peoples: a view from language.|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|date=1995|pages=453–510|doi=10.1007/bf02221119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago|date=1997|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|pages=384 p.|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes [[Filipinos]], [[Indonesians]], [[Polynesians]] and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] peoples, all with strong tattoo traditions. This along with the striking correlation between Austronesian languages and the use of the so-called hand-tapping method suggests that Austronesian peoples inherited their tattooing traditions from their ancestors established in Taiwan or along the southern coast of the Chinese mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robitaille|first1=Benoit|title=A Preliminary Typology of Perpendicularly Hafted Bone Tipped Tattooing Instruments Toward a Technological History of Oceanic Tattooing|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286450624_A_Preliminary_Typology_of_Perpendicularly_Hafted_Bone_Tipped_Tattooing_Instruments_Toward_a_Technological_History_of_Oceanic_Tattooing|website=researchgate.net|publisher=BAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
{{main|Yantra tattooing}}
Thai tattoos, also known as Yantra tattooing, was common since ancient times. Just as other native southeast Asian cultures, animistic tattooing was common in [[Tai peoples|Tai]] tribes that were is southern China. Over time, this animistic practice of tattooing for luck and protection assimilated Hindu and Buddhist ideas. The Sak Yant traditional tattoo is practiced today by many and are usually given either by a Buddhist monk or a [[Brahmin]] priest. The tattoos usually depict Hindu gods and use the [[Old Mon script|Mon script]] or ancient [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer script]], which were the scripts of the classical civilizations of mainland southeast Asia.

The earliest possible evidence for tattooing in Europe appears on ancient art from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period as incised designs on the bodies of humanoid figurines.&lt;ref name=Friedman2015&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Anna Felicity|title=The world atlas of tattoo|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300210-48-4|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300210484/world-atlas-tattoo|format=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lion-man|Löwenmensch figurine]] from the [[Aurignacian]] culture dates to approximately 40,000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.loewenmensch.de/lion_man.html | title = Der Löwenmensch | publisher = The Ulm Museum (Ulmer Museum)| access-date = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features a series of parallel lines on its left shoulder.

The oldest and most famous direct proof of ancient European tattooing appears on the body of [[Ötzi the Iceman]], who was found in the [[Ötztal|Ötz valley]] in the Alps and dates from the late 4th millennium BC.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt; Studies have revealed that Ötzi had 61 carbon-ink tattoos consisting of 19 groups of lines simple dots and lines on his lower spine, left wrist, behind his right knee and on his ankles. It has been argued that these tattoos were a form of healing because of their placement, though other explanations are plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scan finds new tattoos on 5300-year-old Iceman|journal=RedOrbit.com| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1113319184/scan-finds-new-tattoos-on-5300-year-old-iceman-012215/|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and other central and northern European tribes were often heavily tattooed, according to surviving accounts, but it may also have been normal paint. The [[Picts]] may have been tattooed (or [[Scarification|scarified]]) with elaborate, war-inspired black or dark blue [[woad]] (or possibly [[copper]] for the blue tone) designs. [[Julius Caesar]] described these tattoos in Book V of his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Gallic Wars]]'' (54 BC). Nevertheless, these may have been painted markings rather than tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Gillian|title=Woad, Tattooing and Identity in Later Iron Age and Early Roman Britain|journal=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|date=2005|volume=24|issue=3|pages=273–292|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0092.2005.00236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] wrote of his encounter with the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Rus' people|Rus']] tribe in the early 10th century, describing them as tattooed from "fingernails to neck" with dark blue "tree patterns" and other "figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/viktatoo.shtml|title= Viking Answers|accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may also have been paint, since the word used can mean both tattoo and painting. During the gradual process of [[Christianization of Europe|Christianization in Europe]], tattoos were often considered remaining elements of [[paganism]] and generally legally prohibited.

The significance of tattooing was long open to Eurocentric interpretations. In the mid-19th century, [[Baron Haussmann]], while arguing against painting the interior of Parisian churches, said the practice "reminds me of the tattoos used in place of clothes by barbarous peoples to conceal their nakedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Michel | last = Carmona | pages = 235–6 | title = Haussmann: His Life and Times and the Making of Modern Paris | date = 2002 | publisher = Ivan R. Dee | location = Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
British and other pilgrims to the [[Holy Lands]] throughout the 17th century were tattooed to commemorate their voyages, including [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] in 1612. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1691, [[William Dampier]] brought to London a native of the [[Western New Guinea|western part]] of [[New Guinea]] (now part of [[Indonesia]]) who had a tattooed body and became known as the "Painted Prince".

Between 1766 and 1779, Captain [[James Cook]] made three voyages to the South Pacific, the last trip ending with Cook's death in Hawaii in February 1779. When Cook and his men returned home to Europe from their voyages to [[Polynesia]], they told tales of the 'tattooed savages' they had seen. The word "tattoo" itself comes from the [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] ''tatau'', and was introduced into the [[English language]] by Cook's expedition (though the word 'tattoo' or 'tap-too', referring to a drumbeat, had existed in English since at least 1644)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Thomas Chambers|title=Nottingham: its castle: a military fortress, a royal palace, a ducal mansion, a blackened ruin, a museum and gallery of art|date=1876|publisher=Hamilton, Adams|location=London|page=Appendix|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=njp.32101075991255;orient=0;size=100;seq=253;attachment=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Tahiti aboard the ''[[HMS Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', in July 1769, that Cook first noted his observations about the indigenous body modification and is the first recorded use of the word tattoo to refer to the permanent marking of the skin. In the ship's log book recorded this entry: "Both sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language. This is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a manner as to be indelible." Cook went on to write, "This method of Tattowing I shall now describe...As this is a painful operation, especially the Tattowing of their Buttocks, it is performed but once in their Lifetimes."

Cook's Science Officer and Expedition Botanist, Sir [[Joseph Banks]], returned to England with a tattoo. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy and had acquired his position with Cook by putting up what was at the time the princely sum of some ten thousand pounds in the expedition. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed [[Raiatea]]n man, [[Omai]], whom he presented to King George and the English Court. Many of Cook's men, ordinary seamen and sailors, came back with tattoos, a tradition that would soon become associated with men of the sea in the public's mind and the press of the day.&lt;ref&gt;A description of three of the men who took part in the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] in 1789 refers to their being tattooed on the left breast, arms and 'backside' with designs such as stars, hearts, 'darts' and, in the case of a [[Isle of Man|Manxman]], the [[triskelion]] [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/additional_image_types.asp?extra_image_type_id=2&amp;image_id=39 nationalarchives.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, sailors and seamen re-introduced the practice of tattooing in Europe, and it spread rapidly to seaports around the globe.

By the 19th century, tattooing had spread to British society but was still largely associated with sailors&lt;ref&gt;"The reason why sailors tattoo themselves has often been asked." The Times (London), 30 January 1873, p. 10: The article describes recovery of bodies after a shipwreck:those of the crew were identifiable by their tattoos.&lt;/ref&gt; and the lower or even criminal class.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 3 April 1879, p. 9: "Crime has a ragged regiment in its pay so far as the outward ... qualities are concerned ... they tattoo themselves indelibly ... asserting the man's identity with the aid of needles and gunpowder. This may be the explanation of the Mermaids, the Cupid's arrows, the name of MARY, the tragic inscription to the memory of parents, the unintended pathos of the appeal to liberty."&lt;/ref&gt; Tattooing had however been practised in an amateur way by public schoolboys from at least the 1840s&lt;ref&gt;During the [[Tichborne case]], a witness, Lord Bellew, testified he and the missing Roger Tichborne tattooed each other while they were both schoolboys at [[Stonyhurst College]]. Tichborne left school in 1848. ''The Times'' (London), 2 February 1872, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A schoolboy at [[Rugby College|Rugby]] is described as self-tattooed - 'His long skinny arms all covered with anchors and arrows and letters, tattooed in with gunpowder like a sailor-boy's' - and is mildly rebuked for this by his headmaster.{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Thomas|title=Tom Brown's Schooldays|volume=2|chapter=3|year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broadwell|first=Albert H.|title=Sporting pictures on the human skin|journal=Country Life|date=27 January 1900}} Article describing work of society tattooist Sutherland Macdonald&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tattooarchive.com/tattoo_history/macdonald_sutherland.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103145504/http://www.tattooarchive.com/tattoo_history/macdonald_sutherland.html |archive-date=3 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its upmarket form, it could be a lengthy, expensive&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 18 April 1889, p. 12: "A Japanese Professional Tattooer". Article describes the activities of an unnamed Japanese tattooist based in Hong Kong. He charged £4 for a dragon, which would take 5 hours to do. The article ends "The Hong-Kong operator tattooed the arm of an English Prince, and, in Kioto, was engaged for a whole month reproducing on the trunk and limbs of an English peer a series of scenes from Japanese history. For this he was paid about £100. He has also tattooed ladies.... His income from tattooing in Hong Kong is about £1,200 per annum."&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes painful&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broadwell|first=Albert H.|title=Sporting pictures on the human skin|journal=Country Life|date=27 January 1900}} "In especially sensitive cases a mild solution of cocaine is injected under the skin, ... and no sensation whatever is felt, while the soothing solution is so mild that it has no effect ... except locally."&lt;/ref&gt; process.

Tattooing spread among the upper classes all over Europe in the 19th century, but particularly in Britain where it was estimated in Harmsworth Magazine in 1898 that as many as one in five members of the gentry were tattooed. Taking their lead from the British Court, where [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] followed [[Edward VII|Edward VII's]] lead in getting tattooed; King [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] of [[Denmark]], the King of [[Romania]], [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander of Yugoslavia]] and even [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] of [[Russia]], all sported tattoos, many of them elaborate and ornate renditions of the Royal Coat of Arms or the Royal Family Crest. [[King Alfonso XIII]] of modern [[Spain]] also had a tattoo.

The perception that there is a marked class division on the acceptability of the practice has been a popular media theme in Britain, as successive generations of journalists described the practice as newly fashionable and no longer for a marginalised class. Examples of this cliché can be found in every decade since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawley|first1=Lawrence|title=People always say the same thing about tattoos|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25330947|work=BBC News Magazine|publisher=BBC|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this evidence, a myth persists that the upper and lower classes find tattooing attractive and the broader middle classes rejecting it. In 1969, the [[House of Lords]] debated a bill to ban the tattooing of minors, on grounds it had become "trendy" with the young in recent years but was associated with crime. It was noted that 40 per cent of young criminals had tattoos and that marking the skin in this way tended to encourage self-identification with criminal groups. Two peers, [[Baron Teynham|Lord Teynham]] and the [[Dudley Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]] however rose to object that they had been tattooed as youngsters, with no ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 29 April 1969, p. 4: "Saving young from embarrassing tattoos".&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, tattoos have become more socially acceptable and fashionable among celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24296713|title=Why do people go back for more and more tattoos?|first=Jon|last=Kelly|date=1 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattoos are less prominent on figures of authority, and the practice of tattooing by the elderly is still considered remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24906132|title=Dimbleby gets first tattoo aged 75|date=12 November 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northeastern North America in the 17th century===
The [[Jesuit Relations]] of 1652 describes tattooing among the [[Petun]] and the [[Neutrals]]:
{{quote|
But those who paint themselves permanently do so with extreme pain, using,
for this purpose, needles, sharp awls, or piercing thorns, with which they
perforate, or have others perforate, the skin. Thus they form on the face, the
neck, the breast, or some other part of the body, some animal or monster, for
instance, an Eagle, a Serpent, a Dragon, or any other figure which they prefer;
and then, tracing over the fresh and bloody design some powdered charcoal, or
other black coloring matter, which becomes mixed with the blood and penetrates
within these perforations, they imprint indelibly upon the living skin the
designed figures. And this in some nations is so common that in the one which
we called the Tobacco, and in that which -- on account of enjoying peace with
the Hurons and with the Iroquois -- was called Neutral, I know not whether a
single individual was found, who was not painted in this manner, on some part
of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_38.html|title=home|date=11 August 2014|website=puffin.creighton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===North America===
[[File:Body art, 1907 black n white.jpg|thumb|[[Maud Wagner|Mrs. M. Stevens Wagner]], one of the earliest [[Tattooed Ladies]] that performed in the circus sideshows, 1907]]

In the period shortly after the [[American Revolution]], to avoid [[impressment]] by British Navy ships, sailors used government issued [[protection papers]] to establish their American citizenship. However, many of the descriptions of the individual described in the seamen's protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the [[Royal Navy]] simply paid no attention to them. "In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1992/spring/seamans-protection.html "Genealogical Fallout from the War of 1812."] By Ruth Priest Dixon. Prologue Magazine. Spring 1992. Volume 24 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of making them more specific and more effective was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal as to subject and location, and thus use that description to precisely identify the seaman. As a result, many of the official certificates also carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as any other specific identifying information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen who wanted to avoid impressment. During this period, tattoos were not popular with the rest of the country. "Frequently the "protection papers" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gene Allan. 2013. The Slave's Gamble. MacMillan. Page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, [[tattoo]]s were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the [[protection papers]] issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-[[passport]]s catalogued tattoos alongside [[birthmark]]s, [[scar]]s, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as [[pigment]]s, even [[gunpowder]] and [[urine]]. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-12/no-01/reviews/mcneur.shtml|title=Common-place › The journal of early American lifeCommon-place: The Journal of early American Life|work=common-place.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, to protect themselves, the sailors requested not only that the tattoos be described, but that they would also be sketched out on the protection certificate as well. As one researched said, "Clerks writing the documents often sketched the tattoos as well as describing them."&lt;ref&gt;Dye, Ira. "The Tattoos of Early American Seafarers, 1796-1818." Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. 133.4 (1989): 520-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous People of North America ====
[[Indigenous people of North America|Indigenous People of North America]] have a long history of tattooing.

The [[Osage people|Osage People]] used tattooing for a variety of different reasons.  The tattoo designs were based on the belief that people were part of the larger cycle of life and integrated elements of the land, sky, water, and the space in between to symbolize these beliefs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drawing with Great Needles: Ancient Tattoo Traditions of North America|last=Dye|first=David H.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Deter-Wolf|editor-first=Aaron|location=Austin|pages=215-251|chapter=Snaring Life from the Star and the Sun|editor-last2=Diaz-Granados|editor-first2=Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|222-228}}  In addition, the Osage People believed in the smaller cycle of life, recognizing the importance of women giving life through childbirth and men removing life through warfare.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|216}}  Osage men were often tattooed after accomplishing major feats in battle, as a visual and physical reminder of their elevated status in their community.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|223}}  Some Osage women were tattooed in public as a form of a prayer, demonstrating strength and dedication to their nation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|223}}

===== Haudenosaunee People =====
The [[Haudenosaunee|Haudenosaunee People]] historically used tattooing in connection to war.  A tradition for many young men was to go on a journey into the wilderness, fast from eating any food, and discover who their personal [[manitou]] was.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drawing with Great Needles: Ancient Tattoo Traditions of North America|last=Krutak|first=Lars|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Deter-Wolf|editor-first=Aaron|location=Austin|pages=95-130|chapter=Tattoos, Totem Marks, and War Clubs|editor-last2=Diaz-Granados|editor-first2=Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Rp|97}}  Scholars explain that this process of discovery likely included dreams and visions that would bring a specific manitou to the forefront for each young man to have.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{Rp|97}}  The manitou became an important element of protection during warfare and many boys tattooed their manitou onto their body to symbolize cultural significance of the manitou to their lives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{Rp|109}} As they showed success in warfare, male warriors had more tattoos, some even keeping score of all the kills they had made.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{Rp|112}}  Some warriors had tattoos on their faces that tallied how many people they had [[Scalping|scalped]] in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{Rp|115}}

==Modern Western tattooing==

==="Reintroduction" to the Western world===
The popularity of modern Western tattooing owes its origins in large part to Captain [[James Cook|James Cook's]] voyages to the South Pacific in the 1770s, but since the 1950s a false belief has persisted that modern Western tattooing originated exclusively from these voyages.&lt;ref name=Friedman2012&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|last=Friedman Herlihy|first=Anna Felicity|title=Tattooed transculturites: Western expatriates among Amerindian and Pacific Islander societies, 1500–1900|date=June 2012|publisher=University of Chicago|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedman|first1=Anna Felicity|title=The Cook Myth: Common tattoo history debunked|date=5 April 2014|url=https://tattoohistorian.com/2014/04/05/the-cook-myth-common-tattoo-history-debunked/|website=tattoohistorian.com|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattooing has been consistently present in Western society from the modern period stretching back to Ancient Greece,&lt;ref name=Friedman2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Caplan|editor-first=Jane|editor-link=Jane Caplan|title=Written on the body: The tattoo in European and American history|date=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-05723-1|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6922.html|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |Was tattooing reintroduced to Europe or not?|date=April 2017}} though largely for different reasons.

Tattoo historian Anna Felicity Friedman suggests a couple reasons for the "Cook Myth".&lt;ref name=Friedman2012 /&gt;{{rp|18–20}} First, modern European words for the practice (e.g., "tattoo", "tatuaje", "tatouage", "Tätowierung", and "tatuagem") derive from the Tahitian word "tatau", which was introduced to European languages through Cook's travels. However, prior European texts show that a variety of metaphorical terms were used for the practice, including "pricked," "marked", "engraved," "decorated," "punctured," "stained," and "embroidered." Friedman also points out that the growing print culture at the time of Cook's voyages may have increased the visibility of tattooing despite its prior existence in the West.

===Pre-1960s===
The first documented professional [[tattoo artist|tattooer]] in the [[United States]] was [[Martin Hildebrandt]], a [[Germany|German]] immigrant who arrived in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1846.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Between 1861 and 1865, he tattooed soldiers on both sides in the [[American Civil War]]. The first documented professional tattooist (with a permanent studio, working on members of the paying public) in Britain was [[Sutherland Macdonald]] in the early 1880s. Tattooing was an expensive and painful process and by the late 1880s had become a mark of wealth for the crowned heads of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 1891, [[New York City|New York]] tattooer [[Samuel O'Reilly]] patented the first electric [[tattoo machine]], a modification of [[Thomas Edison|Thomas Edison's]] [[electric pen]].

[[File:Nora Hildebrandt, by Charles Eisenmann.jpg|thumb|left|Nora Hildebrandt]]
The earliest appearance of tattoos on women during this period were in the [[circus]] in the late 19th century. These "[[Tattooed Ladies]]" were covered — with the exception of their faces, hands, necks, and other readily visible areas — with various images inked into their skin. In order to lure the crowd, the earliest ladies, like [[Betty Broadbent]] and Nora Hildebrandt told tales of captivity; they usually claimed to have been taken hostage by Native Americans that tattooed them as a form of torture. However, by the late 1920s the sideshow industry was slowing and by the late 1990s the last tattooed lady was out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osterud|first1=Amelia Klem|title=The tattooed lady: A history|date=2009|publisher=Speck Press|location=Golden, CO|isbn=978-1933108261|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tattoo Renaissance===
Although tattooing has steadily increased in popularity since the invention of the electric tattoo machine, it was not until the 1960s that the place of tattooing in popular culture radically shifted.&lt;ref&gt;Nyssen, Carmen. "Early Tinkerers of Electric Tattooing" [http://www.buzzworthytattoo.com/tattoo-history-3/early-tinkerers-of-electric-tattooing/ www.buzzworthytattoo.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028190924/http://www.buzzworthytattoo.com/tattoo-history-3/early-tinkerers-of-electric-tattooing/ |date=28 October 2016 }}. Evidence indicates that electric tattoo machines were in use by the late 1880s, at least several years prior to the first tattoo machine patent obtained by Samuel F. O'Reilly on 8 December 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schildkrout, Enid 2004"&gt;Schildkrout, Enid. "Inscribing The Body." Annual Review of Anthropology 33.1 (2004): 319-44. JSTOR. Web. 28 January  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tattoo Renaissance began in the late 1950s, and was greatly influenced by several artists in particular [[Lyle Tuttle]], [[Cliff Raven]], Don Nolan, Zeke Owens, Spider Webb and [[Don Ed Hardy]]. A second generation of artists, trained by the first, continued these traditions into the 1970s, and included artists such as Bob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and [[Jack Rudy]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne M. Velliquette, Jeff B. Murray, and Elizabeth H. Creyer (1998) ,"The Tattoo Renaissance: an Ethnographic Account of Symbolic Consumer Behavior", in NA - Advances in Consumer Research Volume 25, eds. Joseph W. Alba &amp; J. Wesley Hutchinson, Provo, UT : Association for Consumer Research, Pages: 461-467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of global and Western fashion, common among both sexes, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. The decoration of blues singer [[Janis Joplin]] with a wrist let and a small heart on her left breast, by the [[San Francisco]] tattoo artist [[Lyle Tuttle]], has been called a seminal moment in the popular acceptance of tattoos as art. Formal interest in the art of the tattoo became prominent in the 1970s through the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Deb Tattooing has also become a fad among celebrities. [[David Beckham]], an international soccer star, caught tattoo ‘fever’ beginning with the birth of his first son back in 1999 when he had Malloy ink his son’s name, "Brooklyn" at the bottom of his back. Acord. (19 November 2006). "Who knew: Mommy has a tattoo". ''Maine Sunday Telegram''.&lt;/ref&gt; For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has "undergone dramatic redefinition" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roberts, DJ. |title=Secret Ink: Tattoo's Place in Contemporary American Culture|journal= Journal of American Culture|volume= 35|number=2 |year=2012|pages= 153–65|type= Print|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.2012.00804.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, scholar Arnold Rubin created a collection of works regarding the history of tattoo cultures, publishing them as the "Marks of Civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubin|editor1-first=Arnold|title=Marks of civilization: Artistic transformations of the human body|date=1988|publisher=Museum of Cultural History, University of California, Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-930741-12-9|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the term "Tattoo Renaissance" was coined, referring to a period marked by technological, artistic and social change.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout, Enid 2004"/&gt; Wearers of tattoos, as members of the [[counterculture]] began to display their body art as signs of resistance to the values of the white, heterosexual, middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMello|first=Margo|title=Bodies of inscription: A cultural history of the modern tattoo community|date=2000|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0-8223-2467-6|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Bodies-of-Inscription/index-viewby=title.html|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clientele changed from sailors, bikers, and gang members to the middle and upper class. There was also a shift in iconography from the badge-like images based on repetitive pre-made designs known as [[Flash (tattoo)|flash]] to customized full-body tattoo influenced by Polynesian and Japanese tattoo art, known as [[Sleeve tattoo|sleeves]], which are categorized under the relatively new and popular [[avant-garde]] genre.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout, Enid 2004"/&gt; Tattooers transformed into "Tattoo Artists": men and women with fine art backgrounds began to enter the profession alongside the older, traditional tattooists.

Tattoos have experienced a resurgence in popularity in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Japan, and North and South America. The growth in tattoo culture has seen an influx of new artists into the industry, many of whom have technical and fine arts training. Coupled with advancements in tattoo pigments and the ongoing refinement of the equipment used for tattooing, this has led to an improvement in the quality of tattoos being produced.&lt;ref name=Mifflin1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Mifflin|first=Margot|authorlink=Margot Mifflin|title=Bodies of subversion: A secret history of women and tattoo|date=1997|publisher=Juno Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-89045-100-4|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Star Stowe]] (Miss February 1977) was the first [[Playboy Playmate]] with a visible tattoo on her centerfold.

During the 2000s, the presence of tattoos became evident within [[Popular culture|pop culture]], inspiring television shows such as [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[Inked]]'' and [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'s ''[[Miami Ink]]'' and ''[[LA Ink]]''. In addition, many celebrities have made tattoos more acceptable in recent years.

Contemporary art exhibitions and visual art institutions have featured tattoos as art through such means as displaying [[Flash (tattoo)|tattoo flash]], examining the works of tattoo artists, or otherwise incorporating examples of [[body art]] into mainstream exhibits. One such 2009 Chicago exhibition, ''Freaks &amp; Flash'', featured both examples of historic body art as well as the tattoo artists who produced it.&lt;ref&gt;The Chicago art exhibition, [http://www.art.org/exhibitions/archives/2009/tattoo.htm ''Freaks &amp; Flash''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227131447/http://www.art.org/exhibitions/archives/2009/tattoo.htm |date=27 February 2012 }}, for example, juxtaposed circus sideshow banners depicting tattooed performers like "The Tattooed Lady" alongside art inspired by the tattoo Renaissance of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 25% of Australians under age 30 had tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brittany |first=By |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/fashion/im-inked-therefore-i-am-why-tatts-have-left-a-mark-on-gen-y/story-e6frfn7i-1225945591327 |title=I'm inked therefore I am: Why tatts have left a mark on Gen Y |publisher=News.com.au |date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mattel]] released a tattooed [[Barbie doll]] in 2011, which was widely accepted, although it did attract some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/152414/barbie-tattoos-lead-to-predictable-media-hysteria-world-to-end-soon/ |title=Barbie Tattoos Lead to Predictable Media Hysteria, World to End Soon |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past three decades Western tattooing has become a practice that has crossed social boundaries from "low" to "high" class along with reshaping the power dynamics regarding gender. It has its roots in "exotic" tribal practices of the Native Americans and Japanese, which are still seen in present times.

As various kinds of social movements progressed bodily inscription crossed class boundaries, and became common among the general public. Specifically, the tattoo is one access point for revolutionary aesthetics of women. [[Feminist theory]] has much to say on the subject. "Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo", by [[Margot Mifflin]], became the first history of women's tattoo art when it was released in 1997. In it, she documents women's involvement in tattooing coinciding to feminist successes, with surges in the 1880s, 1920s and the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mifflin1997" /&gt; Today, women sometimes use tattoos as forms of bodily reclamation after traumatic experiences like abuse or breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Mifflin1997" /&gt; In 2012, tattooed women outnumbered men for the first time in American history - according to a [[Harris poll]], 23% of women in America had tattoos in that year, compared to 19% of men.&lt;ref&gt;Braverman, Samantha. "One in Five U.S. Adults Now Has a Tattoo." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. N.p, 23 February  2012. Web. 7 February  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Miss Kansas, [[Theresa Vail]], became the first Miss America contestant to show off tattoos during the swimsuit competition — the insignia of the U.S. Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder and one of the "[[Serenity Prayer]]" along the right side of her torso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/09/10/the-tattooed-miss-kansas-and-other-miss-america-firsts/ | work=The Washington Post | title=The Reliable Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, William Mullane of [[London]] was tattooed with a portrait of his late father which used ink mixed with a small portion of his father's [[Cremation|ashes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent_messenger/news/son-uses-dads-ashes-in-4774/ |title=Grieving son William Mullane asks Maidstone tattoo artist Brendan Mudd to create artwork from dad's ashes |author=Angela Cole |publisher=kentonline.co.uk |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status of tattoos is still developing. In recent years, various lawsuits have arisen in the United States regarding the status of tattoos as a copyrightable art form. However, these cases have either been settled out of court or are currently being disputed, and therefore no legal precedent exists directly on point.&lt;ref&gt;http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2013/1/Cummings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The process of tattooing was held to be a purely expressive activity protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by the [[Ninth Circuit]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach]], 621 F. 3d 1051 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Militaries from around the world ==
Throughout the world's different military branches, tattoos are either regulated under policies or strictly prohibited to fit dress code rules.

=== United States of America ===

==== [[United States Air Force]] ====

The United States Air Force regulates all kinds of body modification. Any tattoos which are deemed to be "prejudicial to good order and discipline", or "of a nature that may bring discredit upon the Air Force" are prohibited. Specifically, any tattoo which may be construed as "obscene or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic or religious discrimination" is disallowed. Tattoo removal may not be enough to qualify; resultant "excessive scarring" may be disqualifying. Further, Air Force members may not have tattoos on their neck, face, head, tongue, lips or scalp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AF evolves policies to access more talent, maintain high standards|url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/1045846/af-evolves-policies-to-access-more-talent-maintain-high-standards.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face tattoos are also permitted as permanent eyeliners for females as long as they are appropriately worn and not brightly colored to fit uniform dressing code. Disrespectful derogatory tattoos and sexually explicit are prohibited on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscg.mil/directives/ci/1000-1999/CI_1000_1B.pdf|title=COMMANDANT INSTRUCTION 1000.1B|last=|first=|date=31 August 2009|website=TATTOO, BODY MARKING, BODY PIERCING, AND MUTILATION POLICY|publisher=United States Coast Guard|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[United States Marines]] ====

The United States Marine Corps has disclosed a new policy meeting their new standards of professionalism in the military appearance, on the Marine Corps Bulletin 1020 released on 6 February 2016, substituting any previous policy from the past''.''&lt;ref name="Marine Corps Tattoos"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/tattoos.aspx?pid=HPTattooPolicy|title=Marine Corps Tattoos|website=www.marines.mil|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tattooed sailor aboard the USS New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Tattooed sailor aboard the {{w|USS New Jersey (BB-62)|USS ''New Jersey'' (1944).]]

The United States Navy has changed its policies{{when|date=April 2018}} and become more lenient when it comes to tattoos. For the first time the navy is allowing sailors to have neck tattoos as long as one inch. Sailors will also be allowed to have as many tattoos of any size on the arms, and legs as long as they are not deemed to be offensive tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/ftrStory.asp?id=93927|title=New Tattoo Policy|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

The Indian Army tattoo policy has been in place since 11 May 2015. The government declared all tribal communities who enlist and have tattoos, are allowed to have them all over the body only if they belong to a tribal community. Indians who are not part of a tribal community are only allowed to have tattoos in designated parts of the body such as the forearm, elbow, wrist, the side of the palm, and back and front of hands. Offensive sexist and racist tattoos are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armycalling.com/tattoo-policy-in-the-indian-army/|title=Tattoo Policy In The Indian Army|date=9 March 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Britain ===

The British army has changed its policy from restricting visible body art around the neck and other parts of the body, in an attempt to stop turning people away, and bring in new recruits, with a policy starting in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2777588/Body-art-war-Army-lifts-ban-hand-neck-tattoos-struggling-attract-new-recruits.html|title=Body art of war: Army lifts ban on hand and neck tattoos after struggling to attract new recruits|work=Daily Mail|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed and developed by the [[United States Forest Service]] to quantify and value [[ecosystem services]] provided by trees including pollution removal, [[carbon sequestration]], avoided [[carbon emissions]], avoided [[stormwater runoff]], and more. i-Tree provides baseline data so that the growth of trees can be followed over time, and is used for planning purposes. Different tools within the i-Tree Suite use different types of inputs and provide different kinds of reports; some tools use a 'bottom up' approach based on tree inventories on the ground, while other tools use a 'top down' approach based on [[remote sensing]] data. i-Tree is peer-reviewed and has a process of ongoing collaboration to improve it.

There are seven different i-Tree applications which can enhance an individual's or organization's understanding of the benefits which trees provide in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itreetools.org/applications.php|title=i-Tree Applications|website=www.itreetools.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of many years the U.S. Forest Service has developed and refined these different applications: i-Tree Eco, i-Tree Landscape, i-Tree Hydro, i-Tree Design, i-Tree Canopy, i-Tree Species, i-Tree MyTree, i-Tree Streets, and i-Tree Vue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itreetools.org/applications.php|title=i-Tree Applications|website=www.itreetools.org|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

i-Tree began in 2002 as survey of a sample of urban forest to simulate taking a [[tree inventory]] of an entire urban forest.  It then added hand held devices for efficient inventory of street trees.  The current version of i-Tree includes different tools which allow for several sources of data to be used, such as National Land Cover Data, Google Maps, and tree inventories. Some tools use continuous data on air pollution and meteorology for more accurate results.

== Research ==

Researchers using i-Tree have examined:

* The benefits of urban trees&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Selecting the best tree planting locations&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Storm damage to urban forests&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Potential bird habitats&lt;ref&gt;Lerman, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* PM2.5 removal and health effect&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">'''Imprelis''' is a selective herbicide created by [[DuPont]].  The active ingredient is [[aminocyclopyrachlor]], a synthetic [[auxin]].&lt;ref&gt;Product label: http://www2.dupont.com/Professional_Products/en_US/assets/downloads/pdfs/H65717.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MSDS: http://msds.dupont.com/msds/pdfs/EN/PEN_09004a358053f153.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprelis was registered with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;EPA site http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/chemical/pesticide-registrations/aminocyclopyrachlor.html&lt;/ref&gt; for sale in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksl.com/?nid=153&amp;sid=16681845&lt;/ref&gt;  Sale of Imprelis was voluntarily suspended&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imprelis-facts.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a week before the EPA required sales stopped.&lt;ref&gt;EPA site http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/cases/civil/fifra/dupontimprelis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksl.com/?nid=153&amp;sid=16681845&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont acknowledged it was killing or damaging evergreen trees, including [[white pine]] and [[Norway spruce]].&lt;ref name="DFP"&gt;Detroit Free Press, May 21, 2012, page A1&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont allegedly knew Imprelis would damage evergreens before seeking EPA approval.&lt;ref&gt;Detroit Free Press, Aug 12, 2011, page A1&lt;/ref&gt;

DuPont offered to compensate customers whose trees were affected. They asked that a claim be submitted, and said that they would send a claim resolution agreement, which would specify the amount DuPont would pay to settle the claim. By late May 2012, the end of the planting season, many tree owners had not heard from DuPont. Other tree owners who accepted payment agreements with DuPont had not been paid.&lt;ref name="DFP"/&gt;

Several hundred tree owners have filed lawsuits with DuPont. They are seeking [[class action]] status.&lt;ref name="DFP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3594">The '''Institute of Conservation''' ('''Icon''') is a charity and the professional body for [[Conservator-restorer|conservators and restorers]] in the United Kingdom. It has over three thousand members, including [[Conservator-restorer|professional conservators]] working with heritage objects and [[Architectural conservation|buildings]]. 

==Background==
Icon was formed in 2005 as a result of a merger between five smaller bodies: The United Kingdom Institute for Conservation, The Institute of Paper Conservation, The Scottish Society for Conservation and Restoration, the Photographic Materials Conservation Group and the Care of Collections Forum. These five organisations were known collectively as the 'Vanguard Bodies' of the National Council for Conservation-Restoration (NCCR). In 2006 a sixth organisation, the Institute of Conservation Science, which had not been part of the NCCR, merged into Icon.

Seven other bodies which were also members of the NCCR opted not to merge into Icon in 2005.  These were:
* The British Antique Furniture Restorer's Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafra.org.uk|title=Home - British Antique Furniture Restorers' Association|work=British Antique Furniture Restorers' Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The British Association of Paintings Conservator-Restorers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bapcr.org.uk|title=BAPCR Home|work=bapcr.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two Irish bodies, the Irish Professional Conservators &amp; Restorers Association (IPCRA) and The Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works in Ireland (ICHAWI) - which merged in 2013 into the Institute of Conservators-Restorers in Ireland (ICRI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icriconservation.ie/about-us/background|title=Home - Institute of Conservator-Restorers in Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three 'hybrid' bodies, combining conservators and non-conservators in their membership - [[Natural Sciences Collections Association|NatSCA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natsca.org/|title=Natural Sciences Collections Association|work=natsca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BHI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhi.co.uk/|title=British Horological Institute|work=bhi.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Society of Archivists]] which merged into the [[Archives and Records Association]] in 2010.

==Activities==
* Icon is a member of the National Heritage Science Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/member-institutions.php|title=National Heritage Science Forum - Home|work=heritagescienceforum.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Icon operates a professional  [[accreditation]] scheme for suitably trained and qualified professionals in [[conservation and restoration]] called PACR (Professional Accreditation of Conservator-Restorers.) 
* Icon operates the Conservation register&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationregister.com|title=The Conservation Register|work=conservationregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of practices with an accredited employee in the UK or Ireland
* Icon was formerly a member of the [[European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organisations]], but withdrew in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iiconservation.org/archive/www.iiconservation.org/news/index153d.html?p=106|title=International Conservation News  » Blog Archive   » Icon withdraws from ECCO|work=iiconservation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books ==
Spanish author and historian [[Cesar Vidal Manzanares]] wrote that "José de Segovia Barrón write theological opinions and culture reviews in the highest professional level, lighting the topics because of its own particular deep perception of life. Reading often his articles it's a pleasure to me, because his own intellectual approach confirms that the Christian thinking does not stunt the brain but, if it's properly used, mind is actually reinforce and encouraged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cesar Vidal Manzanares |url=http://www.entrelineas.org/contacto.asp |title=''Entrelíneas: Revista de Arte y Fe'' |language=es|publisher=Entrelineas.org |date=2015-06-27 |accessdate=2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krist Anthony Novoselic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|oʊ|v|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|ɪ|tʃ}}; {{lang-hr|'''Krist Novoselić'''}}; born May 16, 1965) is an [[Americans|American]] [[musician]] and [[Activism|political activist]], and was the [[bassist]] and founding member of the [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] alongside [[guitarist]] and [[Lead vocalist|lead singer]] [[Kurt Cobain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvana.com/|title=Official Nirvana Website: Complete Discography, Videos and more|website=www.nirvana.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana|title=Nirvana {{!}} Music|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana achieved massive success, earning multiple gold and [[Platinum (award)|platinum awards]] and touring around the world at sold-out shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7518783/nirvana-nevermind-nine-chart-facts-anniversary|title=Nirvana's 'Nevermind': 9 Chart Facts About the Iconic Album|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nirvana disbanded following the [[death of Kurt Cobain]] in 1994, Novoselic formed [[Sweet 75]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/articles/sweet75.html|title=Life After Nirvana For Krist Novoselic - Page 1|last=tsunami@luini.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the following year and [[Eyes Adrift]] in 2002, releasing one album with each band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-20020827|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2009, he played in the [[punk rock]] band [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]], and in 2011, he contributed bass and accordion to the song "[[Wasting Light|I Should Have Known]]" on the [[Foo Fighters]]' studio album ''[[Wasting Light]]'', along with playing [[bass guitar]] and [[accordion]] in his current band, Giants in the Trees since June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/giantsinthetrees/about/|title=Giants in the Trees Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/foo-fighters-375-1290502|title=Dave Grohl teams up with Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on new Foo Fighters album - NME|date=2010-10-27|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his musical endeavours, Novoselic has been active politically, including the creation of the [[political action committee]] JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/politics/career.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 through 2010 he wrote a weekly column on music and politics for ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'s'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|title=Reverb – "Krist Novoselic" Archives – Seattle Weekly|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006203927/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|archivedate=October 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 Novoselic has been board chair of the [[electoral reform]] organization [[FairVote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/tags/author_krist_novoselic|title=Author krist novoselic at FairVote|last=FairVote.org|website=FairVote|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Krist Anthony Novoselic was born on May 16, 1965 to [[Croats|Croatian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/krist-novoselic-ne-vjeruje-bushu/114008.aspx|title=Krist Novoselic ne vjeruje Bushu|publisher=index|work=index.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tportal.hr/showtime/glazba/24409/Nirvanin-basist-hrvatskog-porijekla-duboko-u-politici.html|title=Nirvanin basist hrvatskog porijekla duboko u politici|publisher=tportal|work=tportal.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zadarskilist.hr/clanci/17042010/novaselici-nismo-ni-sanjali-da-ce-nam-sin-postati-rock-zvijezda|title=Novaselići: Nismo ni sanjali da će nam sin postati rock zvijezda!|publisher=[[Zadarski list]]|work=zadarskilist.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; immigrant parents, Kristo and Maria, in [[Compton, California]]. He lived there for one year before his parents moved to the ethnically Croatian [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://serviette.ca/audio/interviews/mp3/media/krist2.mp3 Interview with Krist Novoselic – Audio file]&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained for most of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humoropedia.com/krist-novoselic/|title=5 Unreal Facts About Nirvana’s Krist Novoselic You’D Never Believe|work=Humoropedia|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic has a younger brother Robert, born in 1968, and a younger sister, Diana, born in 1973. In 1979, his family relocated to [[Aberdeen, Washington]] as a result of surging real estate costs in California. In 1980, his parents sent him to live with relatives in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Younger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/younger.php|title=Novoselic Dedication Page|publisher=novoselic.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic returned to Aberdeen in 1981. His earliest memories of listening to music was listening to [[Chuck Berry]] with his father. Growing up, he had a "severe" [[Malocclusion|underbite]], for which underwent corrective surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kristnovoselicescalators.tumblr.com/post/142188663820/novoselic-91-i-had-started-reading-michael|title=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic — Novoselic ‘91 I had started reading Michael...|website=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pavitt commodore.jpg|thumb|Novoselic with Kathleen Hanna, Bruce Pavitt and Dylan Carlson, Paramount Theater, Seattle, October 31st, 1991]]
Novoselic was already interested in [[Hard rock|hard rock bands]] such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Who]], [[Van Halen]], [[Devo]] and [[Aerosmith]]. He also enjoyed listening to Yugoslavian bands such as [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Prljavo kazalište]] and [[Azra]]. While in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], he picked up an interest in [[punk rock]], and discovered bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Ramones]] when he lived in Croatia at the age of 14 for one year.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/krist-novoselic/110291/biography|title=Krist Novoselic Biography – AOL Music|publisher=Music.aol.com|date=May 16, 1965|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goalweb.com/nirvana2/101_random_facts.htm|title=101 Random Facts|website=www.goalweb.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has cited [[Paul McCartney]], [[Geezer Butler]], [[John Entwistle]], and [[Gene Simmons]] as the fundamental influences of his bass playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|title=The Daily Weekly: Krist Novoselic: My Favorite Bass Players (Seattle Weekly)|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824080836/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|archivedate=August 24, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Novoselic's brother Robert introduced him to his friend [[Kurt Cobain]], who had noticed loud music coming from upstairs. Robert told Cobain that it was his older brother, who listened to [[punk rock]]. Cobain eventually befriended the older Novoselic, as the pair ended up sharing similar musical tastes, including a fondness for local band [[Melvins]]. The two had several mutual friends and began hanging out shortly thereafter. Krist attended [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]] and Kurt attended Montesano High School (Washington). At one point, Cobain gave Novoselic a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] of his former band [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]], and asked him to form a band together. After several months, Novoselic finally listened to the tape, liked it, and agreed to start a band with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/nirvana/biography|title=Nirvana Biography|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Novoselic worked as a [[House painter and decorator|painter and decorator]] and was eventually laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wattpad.com/301062129-nirvana-facts-krist-novoselic|title=Nirvana FACTS - Krist Novoselic  - Wattpad|website=www.wattpad.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nirvana (1987–1994) ===

{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}
	 
Cobain and Novoselic's first band lasted barely a few weeks before it disbanded, leaving the pair to move on. However, the duo eventually discovered that Melvins could pull $80 a night for one show. Inspired, Cobain and Novoselic started a [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] [[cover band]], in which Cobain played [[Drum kit|drums]] and Novoselic sang and played [[guitar]]. That band was short-lived as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|title=Come as You are: The Story of Nirvana|location=New York|publisher=Doubleday|year=1993|isbn=0-385-47199-8|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later, Cobain and Novoselic met drummer [[Aaron Burckhard]]. While the new band never used the name, it was the first incarnation of Nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1987.php|title=Nirvana Live Guide - 1987|website=www.nirvanaguide.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Burckhard lasted only a few months and Melvins' drummer [[Dale Crover]] filled in until Novoselic and Cobain met [[Chad Channing]]. The trio recorded their debut [[album]] ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.subpop.com/releases/nirvana/bleach_deluxe_edition|title=Bleach: Deluxe Edition|last=Records|first=Sub Pop|website=Sub Pop Records|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channing left the band in 1990 and was briefly replaced by Crover and [[Mudhoney]] drummer [[Dan Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternativenation.net/surprising-drummer-reveals-missed-joining-nirvana-twice/|title=Surprising Drummer Reveals How He Missed Out On Joining Nirvana Twice|last=Buchanan|first=Brett|date=2018-01-13|work=AlternativeNation.net|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/nirvana-chad-channing-no-regrets/|title=Chad Channing Recalls His Time in Nirvana Without Regrets|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic contributed to song writing of various songs, helping out Cobain, such as giving ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselic-on-kurts-writing-process-and-the-in-utero-aesthetic-20131003|title=Krist Novoselic on Kurt Cobain's Writing Process|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1990, Melvins' singer-guitarist [[Buzz Osborne]] encouraged Novoselic and Cobain to check out a punk band called [[Scream (band)|Scream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-scream-mn0001287850|title=The Scream {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were impressed by their drummer, [[Dave Grohl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/03/dave-grohls-first-band-scream-to-reissue-1988-album-no-more-censorship/|title=Dave Grohl’s first band, Scream, to reissue 1988 album No More Censorship|date=2018-03-29|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Scream disbanded, and Grohl placed a call to Osborne for advice. Osborne gave him Novoselic's phone number, and Novoselic invited Grohl up to Seattle (from [[San Francisco]], where Scream broke up). Grohl passed the audition and joined Nirvana. Grohl was Nirvana's fifth and final [[drummer]]. This was after the first few recordings of songs from their ''Bleach'' Album. Novoselic spent the following months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hardrock.com/rpm/nirvana-signs-to-a-major-or-how-kim-gordon-saved-the-world/|title=NIRVANA SIGNS TO A MAJOR (or how Kim Gordon saved the world)|work=Hard Rock presents Revolutions Per Minute|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] to record ''[[Nevermind]].'' Novoselic helped write the song "[[Polly (Nirvana song)|Polly]]". Upon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/09/howling-in-the-abyss-the-improbable-success-of-nirvanas-nevermind/|title=Howling in the Abyss: The Improbable Success of Nirvana's 'Nevermind'|date=2016-09-23|work=Observer|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=2016-09-24|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Nevermind]]'' had launched the band as a worldwide phenomenon with their hit single "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/nirvana-debuted-smells-like-teen-spirit-22-years-ago-tonight-20130417|title=Watch Nirvana Debut 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' Live in 1991|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, at the [[MTV Music Awards|MTV music awards show]], Nirvana would win awards for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist in a Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]] for "Smells Like Teen Spirit." At the show, Nirvana performed "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]". When Novoselic started playing the opening bass riff, he signaled that he could not hear his bass. Instead of continuing to play, Novoselic threw his bass guitar in the air, to perform a "Bass Toss". He failed to catch it, later stating that he misjudged the height; he further stated that he "faked like he was knocked out." Musician [[Brian May]] ran to give him medical attention; he did not suffer any injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/10/nirvanas-eight-most-rock-n-roll-moments.html|title=Paste Magazine|website=pastemagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/nirvana-181-1336070|title=Nirvana bassist reveals Brian May helped him after bass-throwing injury - NME|date=2008-11-20|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvanas-novoselic-relives-failed-1992-vma-bass-toss-20081120|title=Nirvana's Novoselic Relives Failed 1992 VMA Bass Toss|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Novoselic and the rest of Nirvana recorded a [[compilation album]] named ''[[Incesticide]]''. Novoselic helped write lyrics for the songs "[[Dive (Nirvana song)|Dive]]", "[[Hairspray Queen]]", and "[[Incesticide|Aneurysm]]" on the album. This album was produced by a joint venture between [[DGC Records|DGC]] and [[Sub Pop|Sup Pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/incesticide-19930121|title=Review: Nirvana's 'Incesticide' Delivers Emotional Honesty|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|Novoselic (left) playing bass alongside singer Cobain (right) in 1992.]]
During Nirvana's 1992 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading]] concert, Novoselic sang "The Money Will Roll Right In" with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livenirvana.com/digitalnirvana/songguide/bodyd9ac.html?songid=179|title=The Money Will Roll Right In|website=www.livenirvana.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic was an occasional [[vocalist]] and [[backing vocalist]] in Nirvana, occasionally singing "[[Scoff (song)|Scoff]]" and "[[Rape Me]]" at live shows. Novoselic stated that "I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it got."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/adrift/articles/guitar.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1993, Nirvana worked on their third album [[In Utero (album)|''In Utero'']], it debuted at number one on the [[billboard 200]] in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nirvana/chart-history/billboard-200/song/177363|title=Nirvana In Utero Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recording sessions mixed by [[Steve Albini]] were criticized by the band members, saying some songs "didn't sound perfect" as well as the Novoselic and the rest of the band agreeing that Novoselic's bass lines sounded "too low". ''In Utero'' sold 3.5 million copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5b8c/|title=BBC - Music - Review of Nirvana - In Utero|last=Stack|first=Eamonn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/in-utero-19930916|title=In Utero|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, Nirvana performed on [[MTV Unplugged]] with [[Lori Goldston]] playing [[cello]], the introduction of guitarist [[Pat Smear]], and Novoselic playing acoustic bass guitar, accordion, and acoustic rhythm guitar. This live performance was released a year later as an album, named ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]],'' which earned a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|best alternative music performance.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-nineties-20110427/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-20110517|title=100 Best Albums of the '90s|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-album-anniversary/|title=23 Years Ago: 'Nirvana: MTV Unplugged in New York' Released|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/deep-10-nirvanas-mtv-unplugged-new-york|title=Deep 10: Nirvana's MTV Unplugged In New York|date=2016-11-03|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana ended abruptly in April 1994 following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/krist-novoselic-kurt-cobain-clear-mind-wouldnt-have-killed-himself/|title=Krist Novoselic Discusses Kurt Cobain's Suicide|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the rest of that year, Novoselic retreated from the spotlight. One of a few public appearances came that September at the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, where the video for Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]" was awarded for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1994/mtvvmas.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 1994 MTV Video Music Awards|website=www.rockonthenet.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic took the opportunity to pay tribute to Cobain.

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs.

Novoselic and Grohl continued to support the Nirvana franchise. Novoselic worked on completing the ''[[With the Lights Out]]'' [[box set]] and ''[[From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]]'' album, as well as pushing for release of a [[Nevermind|20th anniversary album for ''Nevermind'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/discography.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Nirvana (1995–present) ===
After Cobain's death, Novoselic continued to dabble in musical endeavors. He co-formed the band [[Sweet 75]] with Seattle musician Yva Las Vegass in 1995, releasing a single [[Sweet 75 (album)|self-titled album]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselics-ecelctic-new-sound-19970911|title=Krist Novoselic’s Ecelctic New Sound|last=Stone|first=Rolling|date=1997-09-11|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/sweet75/info.html|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com -|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Novoselic performed uncredited background [[vocals]] on Foo Fighters' song "Walking a Line", written as a tribute to Cobain, during the ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'' album sessions. The track is included on the ''One by One'' bonus [[DVD]], as well as being a bonus track to the album. He then joined former [[Meat Puppets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themeatpuppets.com/|title=Meat Puppets|website=www.themeatpuppets.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; front man [[Curt Kirkwood]] and former [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] drummer [[Bud Gaugh]] to form [[Eyes Adrift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-20020827|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], there was another group called "Eyes Adrift", and rather than pay to license that name, the trio called the band and album "Bud, Curt &amp; Krist" in this nation. Eyes adrift released a self-titled album with twelve songs, with the [[Japan]]ese version including two extras. Eyes Adrift was the first official release in Krist's career where he sang [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], singing lead on "Inquiring Minds", "Dottie Dawn &amp; Julie Jewel" and "Pasted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-251464/|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|last=Luerssen|first=John D.|date=2002-08-27|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released a single named ''Alaska''.

Following the end of Eyes Adrift, Novoselic announced that he was quitting the music business, noting that he disliked the process of building up publicity for new records. However, in recent years, Novoselic has occasionally worked on music for a possible solo album, noting, "Right now, I'm just doing it for myself, and that's what it's all about."&lt;ref&gt;Jasmin, Earnest.

In 2009, Novoselic played a newspaper vendor in the movie ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]]. In October 2010, [[Dave Grohl]], former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bandmate of Novoselic, announced live on [[BBC]] [[radio]], that Novoselic would be joining [[Foo Fighters]] as a bassist and accordionist on their next album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', which was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/952506/foo-fighters-return-dave-grohl-recruits-krist-novoselic |title=Foo Fighters Return, Dave Grohl Recruits Krist Novoselic |work=Billboard  |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KristNovoselic2011.jpg|alt=|thumb|Novoselic performing in 2011.]]
In 2012, the Nirvana members partnered with [[Paul McCartney]] on the song "[[Cut Me Some Slack]]", which was composed specially for [[Sound City: Real to Reel|the soundtrack of the documentary]] ''[[Sound City (film)|Sound City]]'' directed by Dave Grohl.

=== Performance and recording with Foo Fighters ===
Grohl originally asked Novoselic to join [[Foo Fighters]] as a full-time [[Musical ensemble|band member]], he declined, stating they would call it "Nirvana 2".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=SiriusXM|title=Nirvana's Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl On His Joining The Band // SiriusXM // Lithium|date=2011-09-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRsvCoN__MI|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic's first experience with [[Foo Fighters]] was participating in the encore of their show on August 29, 1997 at [[Memorial Stadium (Seattle)|Memorial Stadium]] as part of the [[Bumbershoot]] [[festival]], where he played bass for the band's covers of "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]" and "[[Communication Breakdown]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bendersky|first=Ari|title=Semi-Nirvana Reunion at Bumbershoot|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 5, 1997|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/semi-nirvana-reunion-at-bumbershoot-19970905}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, Novoselic performed [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] for a non-album track titled "Walking a Line", later released on a special edition of the band's album ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-bassist-krist-novoselic-secretive-musical-project-dave-grohl/|title=Nirvana Bassist Krist Novoselic Talks About Secretive Musical Project With Dave Grohl|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the [[encore]] of Foo Fighters' secret show at Paladino's in [[Tarzana, California]] on December 22, 2010, the band, with Grohl on drums was joined onstage by Novoselic and the band's live guitarist [[Pat Smear]] for a version of Nirvana's "[[Marigold (song)|Marigold]]" a 1992 Grohl original, which was a [[B-side]] on Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]", the first single from ''In Utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=Foo Fighters Secret Show Becomes Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=December 22, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/12/22/foo-fighters-secret-show-becomes-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic also recorded bass and accordion on the song "[[I Should Have Known (Foo Fighters song)|I Should Have Known]]", appearing on Foo Fighters' seventh studio album called ''[[Wasting Light]]'', released on April 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=New Foo Fighters Album Will Be a Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/10/28/new-foo-fighters-album-will-be-a-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political and social activism ==
[[File:Krist Novoselic 15A.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Novoselic in 2008]]
Novoselic has had an interest in politics from high school. This included the [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] conflict between [[Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=garyalexw|title=Nirvana in Belfast - MTV News|date=2012-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyVYQvQPk|accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nirvana/1992/kings-hall-belfast-northern-ireland-63d67e4f.html|title=Nirvana Setlist at King's Hall, Belfast|website=setlist.fm|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state legislature attempted to pass a [[Bill (law)|bill]] called the Erotic Music Law. The [[law]] would allow courts to declare certain albums "erotic" by their content, and would make it illegal to sell those albums to those under the age of 18. A lobbying group called the Washington Music Industry Coalition formed as a response to the bill. Novoselic and Nirvana actively [[Campaigner|campaigned]] against the bill and performed a benefit concert for the [[Advocacy group|lobbying group]] in September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/nirvana-bassist-turns-politician|title=Nirvana Bassist Turns Politician|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krist appeared on [[ABC Studios|ABC]] [[KOMO-TV]]{{'}}s "Town Meeting" in March 1992 arguing his points and expressing his views with two opposing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RareNirvana|title=Krist Novoselic on Komo TV's "Town Meeting" Show in 1992|date=2015-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDrog9H-Yd0|accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With JAMPAC, Novoselic began to turn his focus more and more towards politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2011/05/icons-of-rock-krist-novoselic/|title=Icons Of Rock: Krist Novoselic|date=2011-05-01|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |title=Barack Obama For President |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=August 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130232930/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |archivedate=January 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php/ |title=Presidential Pick-A-Problem Primary |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102131705/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php |archivedate=November 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since broken with the Democratic Party, partly because "it's a top-down structure" adverse to reform from its grassroots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic?%20Run%20blog))|title=Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on Punk, FairVote, Dumping the Dems, &amp;amp; Why the GOP Should Embrace Anarchy|date=June 19, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, he made a donation to [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/krist-novoselic.asp?cycle=08|title=Krist Novoselic - $1,570 in Political Contributions for 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Grange is not actually a political party.

[[File:KristNovoselicpodium.jpg|thumb|Novoselic giving a speech during his political career.]]
Novoselic continues to support political reform, even looking at [[social network]]s such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as major factors in shaping the political future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2013011568_novoselic27web.html|title=Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic sees political potential in social networks|author=Carla Meyer|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers|date=September 27, 2010|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his support for [[Voting|fair voting]] reforms on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Washington Journal]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/309013-5|title=Krist Novoselic on Electoral Reforms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason TV]]'', Novoselic was asked how he described his [[Ideology|political views]], and he responded, "I'm an [[anarcho-capitalist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], moderate... I don't know" and continued to say that while his political views couldn't be easily categorized, he finds fault in the political philosophies of both the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic (at 11:30)&lt;/ref&gt; On his [[Twitter]] page, he announced that he had voted for 2016 [[Libertarian]] [[presidential candidate]] [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KristNovoselic/status/594881482914562048|title=Krist Novoselić on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, he supported [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|his political campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic |first=Krist |url=http://kristnovoselic.blogspot.com/2015/08/real-election-reform-enters-2016.html |title=This Is Krist Novoselić: Real Election Reform Enters The 2016 Race |publisher=Kristnovoselic.blogspot.com |date=2015-08-12 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marathon Reading''' is a yearly program put on by the [[UCLA]] department of [[English studies|English]], where a group of students, faculty, community members, [[alumni]], and often even [[celebrity|celebrities]] read a novel (or two) out loud non-stop for a 24-hour period.

Texas Tech University also hosts an annual marathon reading, coordinated by Dr. Rich Rice, Assistant Professor of English. Other higher-learning institutions that put on annual marathon readings include James Madison College at Michigan State University, Cleveland State University, Grand Valley State University, and Ball State University, Dr. Rice's doctoral alma mater.

The [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in Massachusetts hosts an annual nonstop reading aloud of [[Moby-Dick]], the novel by [[Herman Melville]]. Held each January since 1995, the event marks the anniversary of Melville’s 1841 departure from the Port of New Bedford and Fairhaven aboard the whale ship Acushnet. Hundreds attend the approximately 25-hour multimedia event, which is [[live-streamed]] on the Internet.

'''Marketing science''' is a field that approaches [[marketing]]&amp;nbsp;– the understanding of customer needs, and the development of approaches by which they might be fulfilled&amp;nbsp;– predominantly through  [[scientific method]]s, rather than through tools and techniques common with research in [[the arts]] or in [[humanities]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://greenbookblog.org/2016/07/14/what-does-marketing-science-bring-to-the-table/|title=What Exactly Is Marketing Science?|work=GreenBook|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of marketing science, in the pursuit of "truths" in marketing, is related to, but more general than [[marketing research]], which is oriented towards a specific product, service or campaign.

Before marketing science was formally labeled, its activity appeared as [[management science]] within the [[marketing]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Montgomery 2001. "Management Science in Marketing: Prehistory, Origin, and Early Years of the INFORMS Marketing College." Marketing Science 20 (4): 337–348. {{doi|10.1287/mksc.20.4.337.9762}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between academics and practitioners in marketing science dates back to 1961, with the founding of the [[Marketing Science Institute]]. Interest in marketing science as a field grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s as electronic [[point-of-sale]] data grew and  [[barcode reader]]s led to a "marketing information revolution." &lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Blattberg, Rashi Glazer, and John D.C. Little, eds. 1994. The Marketing Information Revolution. Boston Mass.: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before conferences were organized with a "marketing science" label, four meetings were convened as "Market Measurement and Analysis" conferences from 1979 to 1982, sponsored by [[The Institute of Management Sciences]] and the [[Operations Research Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Dick R. Wittink 2001. "Market Measurement and Analysis: The First ‘Marketing Science’ Conference." Marketing Science 20 (4): 349–356. {{doi|10.1287/mksc.20.4.349.9758}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first officially labeled Marketing Science Conference was hosted by the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management|School of Management at UCLA]] in 1983.

== Marketing science and Big Data ==
The marketing profession has long relied on data. But as the [[data flood]] gets bigger, progressive marketers are turning to [[big data]] analysis methods as well as systematic observation, testing and measurement to study broad [[behavioral pattern]]s, [[drill down]] from the [[Data aggregation|aggregate]] to the individual and produce new insights that improve business outcomes.

Established in 2002, the '''National Tidal and Sea Level Facility''' is responsible for monitoring sea levels in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The NTSLF comprises the [[UK National Tide Gauge Network]], [[geodesy|geodetic]] networks, and gauges in the British dependent territories of the South Atlantic and [[Gibraltar]]. Data collected is used to create tidal predictions, monitor [[climate change]] and determine extreme sea levels for navigation and coastal engineering design.

The network is funded by the UK [[Environment Agency]]. Associated scientific research is funded by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC) and the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (Defra).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4016">'''Neurometrics''' is the science of measuring the underlying organization of the brain's electrical activity.  Certain brainwave frequencies are associated with general psychological processes.  [[EEG]]s are used to measure the [[Neural oscillation|brain wave]]s.

According to [[E. Roy John]], the pioneer in the field of neurometrics, neurometrics is

{{quote|"a method of quantitative EEG that provides a precise, reproducible estimate of the deviation of an individual record from normal.  This computer analysis makes it possible to detect and quantify abnormal brain organization, to give a quantitative definition of the severity of brain disease, and to identify subgroups of pathophysiological abnormalitites within groups of patients with similar clinical symptoms.  Reliable and meaningful results require an adequate amount of good quality raw data, correlated with age, transformed for [[normal distribution|Gaussian distributions]], and corrected for intercorrelations among measures.  Neurometric analysis is able to detect consistent patterns of abnormalities in patients with subtle cognitive dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders.  These analyses may also prove useful in determining therapy and monitoring its efficacy."&lt;ref&gt;(John, E. Roy.  "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/docdel/art901173492 Principles of Neurometrics]."  In ''American Journal of EEG Technology'' 1990. 30:251-266.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1977, Roy John and Robert Thatcher&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificartsfoundation.org/page/page/3529693.htm Robert Thatcher]&lt;/ref&gt; published one of the first texts in the field of neurometrics.  The text was entitled ''Neurometrics''. &lt;ref&gt;(John, E. Roy.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=GGlvKAAACAAJ&amp;dq=neurometrics&amp;ei=YO2hR9GAN4fCtAPa1ZSvCg  ''Neurometrics: Clinical Applications of Quantitative Electrophysiology''].  1977.  New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The field of Neurometrics began to expand significantly in the 1990s.  This was due in part to the advent of inexpensive methods of linking computers to traditional EEG devices.  This allowed researchers to transform analog EEG signals into digital signals for statistical analysis.  Leading researchers in the field included Frank Duffy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthgrades.com/directory_search/physician/profiles/dr-md-reports/dr-frank-duffy-md-f985a9c8.cfm Frank Duffy] &lt;/ref&gt; E. Roy John, and Robert Thatcher.  Between the 1980s and the present time, thousands of articles in the field of neurometrics have been published.

Entrepreneurs began to take notice of the potential of neurometrics in the late 1980s.  In 1991, [[Lexicor Medical Technology]] filed one of the first [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) class two filings in the field of Neurometric software and related EEG devices, called the NeuroSearch-24.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=78217 NeuroSearch-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

NxLink Ltd. built upon the Lexicor Medical Technology 510(k)s with their filing of the Neurometric Analysis System&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=111380 Neurometric Analysis System]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998. Robert Thatcher filed a 510(k) with the FDA on his Neuroguide Analysis System&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=15180 Neuroguide Analysis System]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004.  The Thatcher filing was then followed by an FDA filing by BRC Operations PTY Limited, with their BRC Software Product&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=17414 BRC Software Product]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005.

Each of these devices represented software which was capable of comparing a subject's EEG data to a normative database; the software also allows clinicians to measure the subject's variance from normal.  This technique promises to allow clinicians to evaluate various mental and psychiatric conditions.

In electronics, '''noise temperature''' is one way of expressing the level of available noise power introduced by a component or source. The [[power spectral density]] of the noise is expressed in terms of the temperature (in [[kelvins]]) that would produce that level of [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]], thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{B} = k_B T   &lt;/math&gt;
where:

*&lt;math&gt; P&lt;/math&gt; is the power (in watts)
*&lt;math&gt; B&lt;/math&gt; is the total [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (Hz) over which that noise power is measured
*&lt;math&gt; k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (1.381×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K, joules per kelvin)
*&lt;math&gt; T&lt;/math&gt; is the noise temperature (K)

Thus the noise temperature is proportional to the power spectral density of the noise,  &lt;math&gt;P/ B&lt;/math&gt;. That is the power that would be absorbed from the component or source by a [[impedance matching|matched load]]. Noise temperature is generally a function of frequency, unlike that of an ideal resistor which is simply equal to the actual temperature of the resistor at all frequencies.

==Noise voltage and current==
A noisy component may be modelled as a noiseless component in series with a noisy voltage source producing a voltage of  ''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', or as a noiseless component in parallel with a noisy current source producing a current of  ''i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. This equivalent voltage or current corresponds to the above power spectral density &lt;math&gt;\frac{P} {B}&lt;/math&gt;, and would have a mean squared amplitude over a bandwidth ''B'' of:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{\bar{v_n^2}}{B} &amp;= 4 k_B R T \\
  \\
  \frac{\bar{i_n^2}}{B} &amp;= 4 k_B G T
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the resistive part of the component's [[electrical impedance|impedance]] or ''G'' is the conductance (real part) of the component's [[admittance]]. Speaking of noise temperature therefore offers a fair comparison between components having different impedances rather than specifying the noise voltage and qualifying that number by mentioning the component's resistance. It is also more accessible than speaking of the noise's power spectral density (in watts per hertz) since it is expressed as an ordinary temperature which can be compared to the noise level of an ideal resistor at room temperature (290&amp;nbsp;K).

Note that one can only speak of the noise temperature of a component or source whose impedance has a substantial (and measurable) resistive component. Thus it doesn't make sense to talk about the noise temperature of a capacitor or of a voltage source. The noise temperature of an [[amplifier]] refers to the noise that would be added at the amplifier's ''input'' (relative to the input impedance of the amplifier) in order to account for the added noise observed following amplification.

==Application to communication systems==
A communications system is typically made up of a [[transmitter]], a [[communication channel]], and a [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The communications channel may consist of a combination of different physical media, resulting in an electrical signal presented to the receiver. Whatever physical media a channel consists of, the transmitted signal will be attenuated and corrupted with [[Additive white Gaussian noise|additive noise]].&lt;ref&gt;Proakis, John G., and Masoud Salehi. ''Fundamentals of Communication Systems''.  Upper Saddle River, New Jersey:  Prentice Hall, 2005.  {{ISBN|0-13-147135-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The additive noise in a receiving system can be of thermal origin ([[Johnson-Nyquist noise|thermal noise]]) or can be from other noise-generating processes. Most noise processes will have a [[white noise|white]] spectrum, at least over the bandwidth of interest, identical to that of thermal noise. Since they are indistinguishable, the contributions of all noise sources can be lumped together and regarded as a level of thermal noise. The noise power spectral density generated by all these sources (&lt;math&gt; P / B&lt;/math&gt;) can be described by assigning to the noise a temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; as defined above:&lt;ref&gt;Skolnik, Merrill I., Radar Handbook (2nd Edition).  McGraw-Hill, 1990.  {{ISBN|978-0-07-057913-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{P}{B} \cdot \frac{1}{k_B}&lt;/math&gt;

In a wireless communications receiver, the  equivalent input noise temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt; would equal the sum of two noise temperatures:

:&lt;math&gt;T_\text{eq} = T_\text{ant} + T_\text{sys}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[antenna noise temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_\text{ant}&lt;/math&gt; gives the noise power seen at the output of the antenna.&lt;ref&gt;The physical temperature of the antenna generally has little or no effect on &lt;math&gt;T_\text{ant}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The noise temperature of the receiver circuitry &lt;math&gt;T_\text{sys}&lt;/math&gt; represents noise generated by noisy components inside the receiver.

Note that &lt;math&gt; T_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt; refers not to the noise at the output of the receiver after amplification, but the [[equivalent input|equivalent ''input'']] noise power. In other words, the output of the receiver reflects that of a noiseless amplifier whose input had a noise level not of &lt;math&gt;T_\text{ant}&lt;/math&gt; but of &lt;math&gt;T_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the figure of merit of a communications system is not the noise level at the speaker of a radio, for instance, since that depends on the setting of the receiver's gain. Rather we ask how much noise the receiver ''added'' to the original noise level before its gain was applied. That additional noise level is &lt;math&gt;B k_B T_\text{sys}&lt;/math&gt;. If a signal is present, then the decrease in signal to noise ratio incurred using the receiver system with a noise temperature of &lt;math&gt;T_\text{sys}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/T_\text{ant} - 1/(T_\text{ant} + T_\text{sys})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Noise figure==
{{main|Noise figure}}
One use of noise temperature is in the definition of a system's [[Noise figure|noise factor]] or [[noise figure]]. The noise factor specifies the increase in noise power (referred to the input of an amplifier) due to a component or system when its input noise temperature is &lt;math&gt; T_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{T_0 + T_\text{sys}}{T_0}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is customarily taken to be room temperature, 290&amp;nbsp;K.

The noise factor (a linear term) is more often expressed as the ''noise figure'' (in [[decibels]]) using the conversion:
:&lt;math&gt;NF = 10 \log_{10} (F)&lt;/math&gt;

The noise figure can also be seen as the decrease in [[signal to noise ratio]] (SNR) caused by passing a signal through a system if the original signal had a noise temperature of 290&amp;nbsp;K. This is a common way of expressing the noise contributed by a radio frequency amplifier regardless of the amplifier's gain. For instance, assume an amplifier has a noise temperature 870&amp;nbsp;K and thus a noise figure of 6&amp;nbsp;dB. If that amplifier is used to amplify a source having a noise temperature of about room temperature (290&amp;nbsp;K), as many sources do, then the insertion of that amplifier would reduce the SNR of a signal by 6&amp;nbsp;dB. This simple relationship is frequently applicable where the source's noise is of thermal origin since a passive transducer will often have a noise temperature similar to 290&amp;nbsp;K.

However, in many cases the input source's noise temperature is much higher, such as an antenna at lower frequencies where atmospheric noise dominates. Then there will be little degradation of the SNR. On the other hand, a good satellite dish looking through the atmosphere into space (so that it sees a much lower noise temperature) would have the SNR of a signal degraded by ''more'' than 6&amp;nbsp;dB. In those cases a reference to the amplifier's noise temperature itself, rather than the noise figure defined according to room temperature, is more appropriate.

==Noise temperature of an amplifier chain==
The noise temperature of an amplifier is commonly measured using the [[Y-factor]] method. If there are multiple amplifiers in cascade, the noise temperature of the cascade can be calculated using the [[Friis formulas for noise|Friis equation]]:&lt;ref name="mcclaning"&gt;McClaning, Kevin, and Tom Vito. ''Radio Receiver Design.''  Atlanta, GA:  Noble Publishing Corporation, 2000.  {{ISBN|1-884932-07-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_\text{eq} = T_1 + \frac{T_2}{G_1} + \frac{T_3}{G_1 G_2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt; T_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt; = resulting noise temperature referred to the input
*&lt;math&gt; T_1&lt;/math&gt; = noise temperature of the first component in the cascade
*&lt;math&gt; T_2&lt;/math&gt; = noise temperature of the second component in the cascade
*&lt;math&gt; T_3&lt;/math&gt; = noise temperature of the third component in the cascade
*&lt;math&gt; G_1&lt;/math&gt; = power gain of the first component in the cascade
*&lt;math&gt; G_2&lt;/math&gt; = power gain of the second component in the cascade

Therefore, the amplifier chain can be modelled as a [[black box]] having a gain of &lt;math&gt;G_1 \cdot G_2 \cdot G_3 \cdots&lt;/math&gt; and a noise figure given by &lt;math&gt;NF = 10 \log_{10} (1 + T_\text{eq}/290)&lt;/math&gt;. In the usual case where the gains of the amplifier's stages are much greater than one, then it can be seen that the noise temperatures of the earlier stages have a much greater influence on the resulting noise temperature than those later in the chain. One can appreciate that the noise introduced by the first stage, for instance, is amplified by all of the stages whereas the noise introduced by later stages undergoes lesser amplification. Another way of looking at it is that the signal applied to a later stage already has a high noise level, due to amplification of noise by the previous stages, so that the noise contribution of that stage to that already amplified signal is of less significance.

This explains why the quality of a [[preamplifier]] or [[Low-noise amplifier|RF amplifier]] is of particular importance in an amplifier chain. In most cases only the noise figure of the first stage need be considered. However one must check that the noise figure of the second stage is not so high (or that the gain of the first stage is so low) that there is SNR degradation due to the second stage  anyway. That will be a concern if the noise figure of the first stage plus that stage's gain (in decibels) is not much greater than the noise figure of the second stage.

One corollary of the [[Friis formulas for noise|Friis equation]] is that an [[attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] prior to the first amplifier will degrade the noise figure due to the amplifier. For instance, if stage 1 represents a 6&amp;nbsp;dB attenuator so that &lt;math&gt;G_1 = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T_\text{eq} = T_1 + 4 T_2 +  \cdots&lt;/math&gt;. Effectively the noise temperature of the amplifier  &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; has been quadrupled, in addition to the (smaller) contribution due to the attenuator itself  &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; (usually room temperature if the attenuator is composed of [[resistor]]s). An antenna with poor [[antenna efficiency|efficiency]] is an example of this principle, where &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; would represent the antenna's efficiency.

[[File:NouveauRealsime1960.jpg|thumb|The ''Nouveau Réalisme Manifesto'', signed by all of the original members in Yves Klein's apartment, 27 October 1960]]

'''Nouveau réalisme''' ('''new realism''') refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p. 518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the painter [[Yves Klein]] during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in [[Milan]].  Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," in April 1960, proclaiming, "Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real."&lt;ref name=Stremmel13&gt;Kerstin Stremmel, ''Realism'', Taschen, 2004, p. 13. {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s, [[Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=Stremmel13/&gt;

Contemporary of American [[pop art]], and often conceived as its transposition in France, new realism was, along with [[Fluxus]] and other groups, one of the numerous tendencies of the [[avant-garde]] in the 1960s. The group initially chose [[Nice (France)|Nice]], on the [[French Riviera]], as its home base since [[Yves Klein|Klein]] and [[Arman]] both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the {{Ill|École de Nice|fr}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary M. O'Neill, ''Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956–1971: The Ecole de Nice'', Ashgate, 2012, p. 93. &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hains-TravailleursCommunistes.jpg|thumb|left|''Travailleurs Communistes'' by Raymond Hains]]
The term "new realism" was first used in May 1960 by Pierre Restany, to describe the works of Omiros, Arman, François Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely and Jacques Villeglé as they exhibited their work in Milan. He had discussed this term before with Yves Klein (who died prematurely in 1962), who preferred the expression "today's realism" (''réalisme d'aujourd'hui'') and criticized the term "New". After the first "Manifesto of New Realism", a second manifesto, titled "40° above [[Dada]]" (''40° au-dessus de Dada'') was written between 17 May and 10 June 1961. [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] (then practicing "shooting paintings") Omiros with his "free space" and [[Gérard Deschamps]] then joined the movement, followed by [[Christo]] in 1963. Klein, however, started to distance himself from the group around 1961, disliking Restany's insistence on a [[Dadaist]] heritage. 

The first exposition of the ''nouveaux réalistes'' took place in November 1960 at the Paris "''Festival d'avant-garde''".  This exposition was followed by others: in May 1961 at the Gallery J. in Paris; ''Premier Festival du Nouveau Réalisme'' in [[Nice, France|Nice]] from July til September 1961 at the Muratore Gallery and the Abbaye de Roseland; ''International Exhibition of the New Realists'', a survey of contemporary American [[pop art]] and the Nouveau Réalisme movement at the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]] in New York at the end of 1962; and at the Biennale of San Marino in 1963 (which would be the last collective show by the group). The movement had difficulty maintaining a cohesive program after the death of Yves Klein in June, 1962 and when Omiros abandonned it and decided to go in his own path experimenting with perspective and space.

==Ideas and techniques==
The members of the '''nouveaux réalistes''' group tended to see the world as an image from which they could take parts and incorporate them into their works—as they sought to bring life and art closer together. They declared that they had come together on the basis of a new and real awareness of their "collective singularity", meaning that they were together in spite of, or perhaps because of, their differences. But for all the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Pierre Restany, to a "poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality".&lt;ref&gt;60/90. ''Trente ans de Nouveau Réalisme, La Différence'', 1990, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the nouveaux réalistes advocated a return to "reality" in opposition to the lyricism of [[abstract painting]]. They also wanted to avoid what they saw as the traps of figurative art, which was seen as either [[petty-bourgeois]] or as Stalinist [[socialist realism]]. Hence the Nouveau Réalistes used exterior objects to give an account of the reality of their time. They were the inventor of the ''[[décollage]]'' technique (the opposite of collages), in particular through the use of lacerated posters—a technique mastered by François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously.

Nouveau réalistes made extensive use of [[collage]] and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], using real objects incorporated directly into the work and acknowledging a debt to the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. But the New Realism movement has often been compared to the pop art movement in New York for their use and critique of mass-produced commercial objects ([[Jacques de la Villeglé|Villeglé]]'s ripped cinema posters, [[Arman]]'s collections of detritus and trash), although Nouveau Réalisme maintained closer ties with Dada than with pop art.

==The new realists in architecture==
"The new realists" is also a term applied to a group of Australian architects determined to create a "New Realism" in architecture, based on the understanding of past developments in the discipline of architecture and modern day explorations of new technologies in the fields of design and building technology.

==Analyse critique==
Les artistes reprennent les objets de la société pour en faire des reliques, des symboles puissants de la consommation.

Exemple : Les compressions de César qui mettent en scène des automobiles, le but étant de transformer un objet culte de notre société et d’en faire quelque chose d'autre, à travers ses formes géométriques, l’œuvre sent la conception par l’intermédiaire d’une machine, c’est la disparition de l’habileté manuelle qui était à l’époque un facteur important dans la reconnaissance de la valeur d’un artiste.

On constate également la disparition du matériau noble, les nouveaux réalistes n’utilisent plus de bronze, de pierre, mais de la tôle ou du ciment, des matériaux industriels.

:« L’école niçoise veut nous apprendre la beauté du quotidien. Faire du consommateur un producteur d’art. Une fois qu'un être s'est intégré dans cette vision, il est très riche, pour toujours. Ces artistes veulent s'approprier le monde pour vous le donner. A vous de les accueillir ou de les rejeter. »&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, ''Avec le nouveau réalisme, sur l’autre face de l’art'', Nîmes, Éditions Jacqueline Chambrons, 2000, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

===L'objet comme matériau===
L’accumulation d’Arman, est un agglomérat de voitures de marque [[Renault (Groupe)|Renault]], chez qui il est directement allé travailler pour trouver sa matière première.

Son œuvre n’a pas d’utilité particulière mais il veut surtout le mouvement et la couleur, on ne retient plus que les effets plastiques.

Le matériel n’est pas détourné, il est utilisé pour travailler un mouvement et devient matériau.
Une autre manière de transformer un matériel en matériau selon César, c’est sa mousse de polyuréthane, c’est un matériau presque vivant qui échappe au contrôle de l’artiste, la matière se fixe ses propres limites, et l’œuvre devient indépendante du projet plastique.

Gérard Deschamps, lui, assemble des chiffons, des sous-vêtements feminins (ce qui lui vaudra d'être censuré à de nombreuses reprises) ou expose des bâches de signalisation de l'armée américaine, des plaques de blindage, des tôles irisées par la chaleur, des patchworks, des ballons dans des boîtes en plexiglas ou dans des filets, des skateboards, des « pneumostructures » faites de bouées ou de matelas pneumatiques..et des voiles de planches....a voiles.

===L’objet comme rebut===
L’œuvre de Daniel Spoerri rend compte de la société de consommation qui mange, il se sert dans les poubelles de ses voisins, de ses congénères. Il s’agit du détournement d’un moment important de la journée, qui est figé et réinvesti dans l’art. La résine est affichée contre le mur comme une toile.

Il a la volonté de fixer le temps d’un moment sensé être agréable alors que la société veut de plus en plus nous le marchandiser, et nous presser. Le repas n’est plus le moment convivial qu’il était avant, il devient la nouvelle cible des grosses sociétés de consommation, on se retrouve presque dans une succursale d’une enseigne de la restauration rapide alors que l’on est chez soi. Faire vite, faire simple, peu importe que ce soit vraiment bon. Il faut faire vite, se nourrir, manger, boulimiquement, pour se remplir, Spoerri met ici l’accent sur la nécessité d’un retour aux sources, et d’une société de consommation qui influencerait moins de ses codes, et qui submergerait moins de ses produits, la société actuelle.

Renvoyant à l'univers de la [[publicité]] et de la [[société de consommation]], les [[affiche]]s, décollées, superposées, lacérées, inspirent Jacques Villeglé, Raymond Hains et François Dufrêne ainsi que Mimmo Rotella, qui suit un itinéraire parallèle mais distinct.

===Les « Actions-spectacles »===
Il s'agit de ce qu'on appelera plus tard des "performances" où l'œuvre d'art se construit (ou se détruit) devant le public. L'un des exemples les plus connus sont les ''anthropométries'' d'Yves Klein où ce dernier enduit de jeunes femmes dénudées de peinture et leur commande de se rouler sur une toile blanche, crant ainsi la trace visuelle de leurs mouvements.--&gt;

'''Perceptual computing''' is an application of [[Lotfi A. Zadeh|Zadeh]]'s theory of [[Computing with words and perceptions|computing with words]] on the field of assisting people to make subjective judgments.

==Perceptual computer==

The ''perceptual computer'' – ''Per-C'' – an instantiation of perceptual computing – has the architecture that is depicted in Fig. 1 [2]–[6]. It consists of three components: encoder, CWW engine and decoder. Perceptions – words – activate the Per-C and are the Per-C output (along with data); so, it is possible for a human to interact with the Per-C using just a vocabulary.

[[File:PerC.jpg|below|Figure 1. Architecture for the perceptual computer.]]

A vocabulary is application (context) dependent, and must be large enough so that it lets the end-user interact with the Per-C in a user-friendly manner. The encoder transforms words into [[fuzzy set]]s (FSs) and leads to a ''codebook'' – words with their associated FS models. The outputs of the encoder activate a Computing With Words&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi Zadeh [7], the father of fuzzy logic, coined the phrase computing with words, and stated: ''“CWW is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. [It is] inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. CWW may have an important bearing on how humans … make perception-based rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth.”'' He did not mean that computers would actually compute using words—single words or phrases—rather than numbers. He meant that computers would be activated by words, which would be converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets (FSs), and that these FSs would be mapped by a CWW engine into some other FS, after which the latter would be converted back into a word. Zadeh’s definition of CWW is very general and does not refer to a specific field in which CWW would be used. ''Perceptual computing'' focuses on CWW for making subjective judgments.&lt;/ref&gt; (CWW) engine, whose output is one or more other FSs, which are then mapped by the decoder into a recommendation (subjective judgment) with supporting data. The recommendation may be in the form of a word, group of similar words, rank or class.

Although there are lots of details needed in order to implement the Per-C’s three components – encoder, decoder and CWW engine – and they are covered in [5], it is when the Per-C is applied to specific applications, that the focus on the methodology becomes clear. Stepping back from those details, the ''methodology of perceptual computing'' is:

# Focus on an application (''A'').
# Establish a vocabulary (or vocabularies) for ''A''.
# Collect interval end-point data from a group of subjects (representative of the subjects who will use the Per-C) for all of the words in the vocabulary.
# Map the collected word data into word-FOUs by using the ''Interval Approach'' [1], [5, Ch. 3]. The result of doing this is the ''codebook'' (or codebooks) for ''A'', and completes the design of the encoder of the Per-C.
# Choose an appropriate CWW engine for ''A''. It will map IT2 FSs into one or more IT2 FSs. Examples of CWW engines are: IF-THEN rules [5, Ch. 6] and Linguistic Weighted Averages [6], [5, Ch. 5].
# If an existing CWW engine is available for ''A'', then use its available mathematics to compute its output(s). Otherwise, develop such mathematics for the new kind of CWW engine. The new CWW engine should be constrained&lt;ref&gt;This (new) constraint is the major difference between perceptual computing and function approximation applications of FSs and systems.&lt;/ref&gt; so that its output(s) resemble the FOUs in the codebook(s) for ''A''.
# Map the IT2 FS outputs from the CWW engine into a recommendation at the output of the decoder. If the recommendation is a word, rank or class, then use existing mathematics to accomplish this mapping [5, Ch. 4]. Otherwise, develop such mathematics for the new kind of decoder.

==Applications of Per-C==

To-date a Per-C has been implemented for the following four applications: (1) investment decision-making, (2) social judgment making, (3) distributed decision making, and (4) hierarchical and distributed decision-making. A specific example of the fourth application is the so-called ''Journal Publication Judgment Advisor'' [5, Ch. 10] in which for the first time only words are used at every level of the following hierarchical and distributed decision making process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''n'' reviewers have to provide a subjective recommendation about a journal article that has been sent to them by the Associate Editor, who then has to aggregate the independent recommendations into a final recommendation that is sent to the Editor-in-Chief of the journal. Because it is very problematic to ask reviewers to provide numerical scores for paper-evaluation sub-categories (the two major categories are ''Technical Merit'' and ''Presentation''), such as importance, content, depth, style, organization, clarity, references, etc., each reviewer will only be asked to provide a linguistic score for each of these categories. They will not be asked for an overall recommendation about the paper because in the past it is quite common for reviewers who provide the same numerical scores for such categories to give very different publishing recommendations. By leaving a specific recommendation to the associate editor such inconsistencies can hope to be eliminated. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How words can be aggregated to reflect each reviewer’s recommendation as well as the expertise of each reviewer about the paper’s subject matter is done using a linguistic weighted average. Although the journal publication judgment advisor uses reviewers and an associate editor, the word “reviewer” could be replaced by judge, expert, low-level manager, commander, referee, etc., and the term “associate editor” could be replaced by control center, command center, higher-level manager, etc. So, this application has potential wide applicability to many other applications.

Recently, a new Per-C based [[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) methodology was developed, with its application to [[edible bird's nest]] farming, in [[Borneo]], has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chai K.C.|author2=Tay K. M.|author3=Lim C.P. | title=A perceptual computing-based method to prioritize failure modes in failure mode and effect analysis and its application to edible bird nest farming |journal=Applied Soft Computing |volume=49|year=2016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494616304379 |doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2016.08.043
 |pages= 734–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Per-c fmea.png|center|thumb|A Perceptual Computing Based Failure Mode and Effect Analysis Methodology]]

In summary, the Per-C (whose development has taken more than a decade) is the first complete implementation of Zadeh’s CWW paradigm, as applied to assisting people to make subjective judgments.

'''Philosophy of science''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [[truth]].

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the [[scientific realism|truth about unobservable things]] and [[problem of induction|whether scientific reasoning can be justified]] at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as [[philosophy of biology|biology]] or [[philosophy of physics|physics]]). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the [[logical positivism]] movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was also formative, challenging the view of [[scientific progress]] as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[[paradigm]]," the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324460/Thomas-S-Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn.] "Instead, he argued that the paradigm determines the kinds of experiments scientists perform, the types of questions they ask, and the problems they consider important."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.

Subsequently, the [[Coherentism|coherentist]] approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and others. Some thinkers such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] seek to ground science in [[axiomatic]] assumptions, such as the [[uniformity of nature]]. A vocal minority of philosophers, and [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the "[[scientific method]]", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [[supernatural]] ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [[Constructivist epistemology|knowledge is created]] from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [[David Bloor]] and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]]. Finally, a tradition in [[continental philosophy]] approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|time]] raised by Einstein's [[general relativity]], to the implications of [[Philosophy and economics|economics]] for [[public policy]]. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be [[Reductionism|reduced]] to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [[Philosophy of psychology|psychology]]? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [[foundations of statistics]]. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [[philosophy of medicine]]. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the [[Philosophy of social science|social sciences]] explore whether the scientific studies of [[human nature]] can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and by social relations.

==Introduction==

===Defining science===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Popper in the 1980s]]
Distinguishing between science and [[non-science]] is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should [[psychoanalysis]] be considered science? How about so-called [[creation science]], the [[Multiverse|inflationary multiverse]] hypothesis, or [[macroeconomics]]? [[Karl Popper]] called this the central question in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Thornton2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|title = Karl Popper|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Thornton|first = Stephen|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laudan | first = Larry | editor = Adolf Grünbaum |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |editor3=Larry Laudan | title = Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum | year = 1983 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-90-277-1533-3 | chapter = The Demise of the Demarcation Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] has argued for the use of a [[Potter Stewart standard]] ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pseudoscience+potter+stewart#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudoscience%20potter%20stewart&amp;f=false|pages = 12–13|title = The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|first = Michael D.|last = Gordin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780226304427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts by the [[logical positivists]] grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless.&lt;ref name="Uebel2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/|title = Vienna Circle|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Uebel|first = Thomas|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper argued that the central property of science is [[falsifiability]]. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{cite book | last = Popper | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Popper | title = The logic of scientific discovery | year = 2004|edition=reprint| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = London &amp; New York | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yq6xeupNStMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+logic+of+scientific+discovery | isbn=978-0-415-27844-7 | postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published 1959 by Hutchinson &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

===Scientific explanation===
{{Main|Scientific explanation}}

A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide [[explanation]]s for events that occur regularly or have already occurred.  Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has [[explanatory power]].

One early and influential theory of scientific explanation is the [[deductive-nomological]] model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name="Hempel1948"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wesley C. Salmon|Wesley Salmon]] developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained.&lt;ref name="Salmon1971"&gt;{{cite book

===Justifying science===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
[[File:Chicken farmer in Ghana (5926941911).jpg|thumb|The expectations chickens might form about farmer behavior illustrate the "problem of induction."]]
Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests.&lt;ref name="StanInduction"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/|title = The Problem of Induction|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Vickers|first1 = John|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use [[inductive reasoning]] to infer that the farmer will bring food ''every'' morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?

One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more [[Probability|probable]]. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are [[Bayesian probability|subjective]], or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.&lt;ref name=StanInduction/&gt;

Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather [[abductive reasoning]], or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the "best explanation." [[Ockham's razor]], which counsels choosing the [[Simplicity|simplest]] available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this [[heuristic]] principle more precise in terms of theoretical [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.&lt;ref name="StanSimple"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/|title = Simplicity|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Baker|first1 = Alan|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature.  In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1998) [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press; (2017) [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress: Aim-Oriented Empiricism], Paragon House, St. Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation inseparable from theory===
[[Image:Einstein cross.jpg|thumb|right|A celestial object known as the [[Einstein Cross]].]]
When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], observers would have likely interpreted the image at right as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and [[Gravitational lens|four different images]] of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be [[theory-laden]].&lt;ref name="StanTheoryObs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/|title = Theory and Observation in Science|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Bogen|first1 = Jim|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All observation involves both [[philosophy of perception|perception]] and [[cognitive process|cognition]]. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.&lt;ref name=StanTheoryObs/&gt;

===The purpose of science===
{{See also|Scientific realism|Instrumentalism}}

Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science [[Empirical limits in science|cannot answer]]?  ''Scientific realists'' claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard [[scientific theories]] as true, approximately true, or likely true.  Conversely, ''scientific anti-realists'' argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about [[unobservable]]s like electrons or other universes.&lt;ref name="Levin1984"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalists]] argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.

Realists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories.&lt;ref name="Boyd2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specific examples include:

===Values and science===
Values intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society.

If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="StanSocial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title = The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|accessdate = 2014-03-06|last1 = Longino|first1 = Helen|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on [[evolution]], and values concerning [[social class]] influenced debates on [[phrenology]] (considered scientific at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allchin, "Values in Science and in Science Education," in International Handbook of Science Education, B.J. Fraser and K.G.

==History==
{{See also|History of scientific method|History of science|History of philosophy}}

===Pre-modern===
The origins of philosophy of science trace back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also analyzed reasoning by [[analogy]]. The eleventh century Arab polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in Latin as [[Alhazen]]) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied [[geometry]], especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the [[Catoptrics|reflection]] and [[Dioptrics|refraction]] of light. [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=350–351|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=alhazen+philosophy+of+science#v=onepage&amp;q=alhazen%20philosophy%20of%20science&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

===Modern===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]
[[Francis Bacon]] (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]]. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) – an allusion to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' – Bacon outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old philosophical process of [[syllogism]]. Bacon's method relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential,&amp;nbsp;..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', advocating the central role of [[rationalism|reason]] as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' argued that "...&amp;nbsp;hypotheses&amp;nbsp;... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. "&lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paricenter.com/library/papers/mullin02.php |title= The Impact of Newton's Principia on the Philosophy of Science  |last1= McMullin |first1= Ernan |last2= |first2= |date= |website= www.paricenter.com |publisher= Pari Center for New Learning |access-date=29 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage influenced a "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy."  &lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"/&gt; In particular, later in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] would famously articulate [[skepticism]] about the ability of science to determine [[causality]] and gave a definitive formulation of the [[problem of induction]].  The 19th century writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name="mill"&gt;

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
[[Instrumentalism]] became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces [[verificationism]] (a set of [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]] that combines [[logicism]], [[empiricism]], and [[linguistics]] to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the [[empirical sciences]]). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new ''scientific philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and the [[Vienna Circle]] propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.

Interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|philosophy of language]], logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness.  From [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and [[Percy Bridgman]]'s [[operationalism]]. Thereby, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific and ''cognitively meaningful'', whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements"—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.

Logical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration.  Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional.  ''Theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws'', while ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules''.   Mathematics in physics would reduce to [[symbolic logic]] via logicism, while [[rational reconstruction]] would convert [[natural language|ordinary language]] into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could verify its falsity or truth.

In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of "causation".  The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated [[Anglosphere]] philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1301-6 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06606-7 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C.

Nevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Epicycle and deferent.svg|thumb|For [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], the addition of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal science" within a paradigm, whereas the [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions#The Copernican Revolution|Copernican revolution]] was a paradigm shift.]]

===Thomas Kuhn===
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}

In the 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure [[scientific progress]] across paradigms.

For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

==Current approaches==
===Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions===
All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Priddy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1997|p=135}} ,  “All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.”&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strahler|1992|p=3}} The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;/ref&gt; The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed." "Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves.  As infants we made this assumption unconsciously.   People are happy to make this assumption that adds meaning to our sensations and feelings, than live with [[solipsism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

#''that reality can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.''{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} Stanley Sobottka said, "The assumption of external reality is necessary for science to function and to flourish.

===Coherentism===

[[File:JeremiahHorrocks.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremiah Horrocks]] makes the first observation of the transit of Venus in 1639, as imagined by the artist [[William Richard Lavender|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Lavender]] in 1903]]

In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/justep-coherence/|title = Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Olsson|first = Erik|year = 2014|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a [[transit of Venus]] is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the [[optics]] of telescopes, the [[mechanics]] of the telescope mount, and an understanding of [[celestial mechanics]]. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Dunhem–Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets.  Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of [[Uranus]] in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, [[Neptune]]. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ''ad hoc'' hypotheses. [[Karl Popper]] accepted this thesis, leading him to reject [[Falsifiability#Naïve falsification|naïve falsification]]. Instead, he favored a "survival of the fittest" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.&lt;ref name="Popper 2005ch3-4"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Popper

===Anything goes methodology===

{{Main|Epistemological anarchism}}

[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]]]]

[[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the progress of science. He argued that "the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: ''anything goes''".&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;Paul Feyerabend, ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' (1975), {{ISBN|0-391-00381-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-222-1}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-481-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-646-4}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-934-X}}, {{ISBN|0-902308-91-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an [[ideology]]. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;

===Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community.&lt;ref name="KuhnPostParadigm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kuhn, T. S.| chapter = [Postscript] | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd. ed | publisher = [Univ. of Chicago Pr] | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | authorlink = Thomas Samuel Kuhn|page = 176|quote = A paradigm is what the members of a community of scientists share, ''and'', conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].

However, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer&amp;nbsp;... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as ''cultural posits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Quine, Willard Van Orman| chapter = Two Dogmas of Empiricism | title = From a Logical Point of View | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1980 | isbn = 978-0-674-32351-3 | url = http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the [[science wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Ashman|editor1-first= Keith M.|editor2-last= Barringer|editor2-first= Philip S.|title= After the Science Wars|date= 2001|publisher= Routledge|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-415-21209-0|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=After+the+science+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20science%20wars&amp;f=false|accessdate= 29 October 2015|quote= The 'war' is between scientists who believe that science and its methods are objective, and an increasing number of social scientists, historians, philosophers, and others gathered under the umbrella of Science Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including [[David Bloor]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Anselm Strauss]]. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from [[Economics of scientific knowledge|economics have also been applied]]{{by whom|date=October 2017}} for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.

===Continental philosophy===
Philosophers in the [[continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]] are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] advanced the thesis in his "The Genealogy of Morals" that the motive for search of truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatab|first1=Lawrence J.|title=How Does the Ascetic Ideal Function in Nietzsche's ''Genealogy''?|journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies|date=2008|issue=35/36|page=107|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v035/35.hatab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In general, science in continental philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective.  One of the first philosophers who supported this view was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Gaston Bachelard]] also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the late works of [[Merleau-Ponty]] (''Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France'', 1956–1960), and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Gutting"&gt;Gutting, Gary (2004), ''Continental Philosophy of Science'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the [[present-at-hand|theoretical attitude]] in general which of course includes the scientific attitude.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/|title = Martin Heidegger|accessdate = 2015-10-29|last = Wheeler|first = Michael|year = 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, [[Alexandre Koyré]].  Another important development was that of Michel [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s analysis of the historical and scientific thought in ''[[The Order of Things]]'' and his study of power and corruption within the "science" of [[Insanity|madness]]. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include [[Jürgen Habermas]] (e.g., "Truth and Justification", 1998), [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]] ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).

==Other topics==
===Reductionism===

[[Analysis]] is the activity of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. [[Reductionism]] can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="StanUnity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/|title = The Unity of Science|accessdate = 2014-03-01|last1 = Cat|first1 = Jordi|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls ''[[greedy reductionism]],'' which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=George|title=Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13639-4|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=koy-zqecyewC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=dennett+%22greedy+reductionism%22+%22bad+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dennett%20%22greedy%20reductionism%22%20%22bad%20science%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social accountability===
{{See also|The Mismeasure of Man}}
A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and man is studied by science. [[Philip Kitcher]] in his "Science, Truth, and Democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. Science, Truth, and Democracy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.

==Philosophy of particular sciences==
{{quote|''There is no such thing as philosophy-free science; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-2629-5|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y77BAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22there+is+only+science+whose+philosophical+baggage+is+taken+on+board%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22there%20is%20only%20science%20whose%20philosophical%20baggage%20is%20taken%20on%20board%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel Dennett|''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', 1995}}
In addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.&lt;ref name="StanPhilNeuro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/neuroscience/ |title = The Philosophy of Neuroscience |last1 = Bickle|first1 = John|last2 = Mandik|first2 = Peter|last3 = Landreth|first3 = Anthony|year = 2010 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|postscript= (Summer 2010 Edition) |editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of statistics===
{{Main|Philosophy of statistics}}
The problem of induction discussed above is seen in another form in debates over the [[foundations of statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Instead, the typical test yields a [[p-value]], which is the probability of the ''evidence'' being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is true. If the ''p''-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, [[Bayesian inference]] seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include [[probability interpretations]], [[overfitting]], and the difference between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].

Is asking whether "1+1=2" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was [[calculus]] invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires [[A priori and a posteriori|experience or reason alone]]. What does it mean to prove a mathematical [[theorem]] and how does one know whether a [[mathematical proof]] is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and [[logic]], human capabilities such as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]], and the [[material universe]].

===Philosophy of physics===
{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
{{unsolved|physics|How does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the "[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states" and "[[wavefunction collapse]]", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}
Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions underlying modern [[physics]], the study of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and how they [[interaction|interact]]. The main questions concern the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]], [[atom]]s and [[atomism]]. Also included are the predictions of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]], [[causality (physics)|causality]], [[determinism]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Philosophy of chemistry===
{{Main|Philosophy of chemistry}}
Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the [[methodology]] and content of the science of [[chemistry]]. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by [[quantum mechanics]] or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of [[Philosophy of science#Confirmation of theories|how theories are confirmed]] in the context of confirming [[reaction mechanism]]s. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of.&lt;ref name="WeisbergEtal2011"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chemistry/|title = Philosophy of Chemistry|accessdate = 2014-02-14|last1 = Weisberg|first1 = Michael|last2 = Needham|first2 = Paul|last3 = Hendry|first3 = Robin|year = 2011|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as [[chemical bonds]].

===Philosophy of Earth sciences===
The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.

===Philosophy of biology===
{{Main|Philosophy of biology}}
Philosophy of biology deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the [[Biology|biological]] and [[Medical research|biomedical]] sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hull D. (1969), What philosophy of biology is not, Journal of the History of Biology, 2, p.&amp;nbsp;241–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].  Other key ideas such as the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions as well as the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]] are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]]'s work),&lt;ref&gt;Recent examples include Okasha S. (2006), ''Evolution and the Levels of Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, and Godfrey-Smith P. (2009), ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany G.

===Philosophy of medicine===
{{Main|Philosophy of medicine}}

Beyond [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]], the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]] of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation,&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papineau | first1 = D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena.

===Philosophy of psychology===
{{Main|Philosophy of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]
Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of [[behaviorism|behavior]] to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on [[mentalism (psychology)|mental perception and thought processes]]?&lt;ref name="Routpsych"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mason|first1 = Kelby|first2 = Chandra Sekhar|last2 = Sripada|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Stich|title = Routledge Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Psychology|chapterurl = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/PHILOSOPHYofPSYCHOLOGY.pdf|editor-last = Moral|editor-first = Dermot|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a [[Likert scale]], they may be experiencing very different things.

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]]. For example, are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?&lt;ref name="Routpsych" /&gt; Is there any sense in which they have [[free will]], and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, [[neurophilosophy]] has just recently become its own field with the works of [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref name=StanPhilNeuro/&gt; Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]]. Another related field is [[philosophy of language]].

A notable recent development in Philosophy of Psychology is [[Functional contextualism|Functional Contextualism]] or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general, the field of [[behavior analysis]], and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT).&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

===Philosophy of psychiatry===
{{main|Philosophy of psychiatry}}
Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/psychiatry/ Philosophy of Psychiatry]". ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', edited by Edward N. Zalta. Accessed 18 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Amartya Sen]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for "combining tools from economics and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Prize in Econimic Sciences 1998 |website=NobelPrize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/press.html |date=1998-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Philosophy of economics===
{{Main|Philosophy and economics}}
Philosophy of economics is the branch of philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to [[economics]]. It can also be defined as the branch of economics which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/ |title=Philosophy of Economics|last1=Hausman |first1=Daniel |last2= |first2= |date= December 18, 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods rise to the level of epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society?

===Philosophy of social science===
{{Main|Philosophy of social science}}
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Hollis |author-link=Martin Hollis (philosopher)|year=1994 |title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5 |url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

The French philosopher, [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of [[positivism]] in ''The Course in Positivist Philosophy'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]: "''[[sociology|sociologie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt; For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. These are (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and [[social research]]. [[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivist perspective has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer [[bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as [[Thomas Kuhn]], and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]].  The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Producerism''' is an ideology which holds that those members of society engaged in the production of tangible wealth are of greater benefit to society than, for example, [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] who inherit their wealth and station.

==History==
Robert Ascher traces the history of producerism back as early as the [[Diggers]] in the 1640s. This outlook was not widespread among artisans of the time because they owed their livelihoods to the patronage of the aristocracy, but by the time of the [[American Revolution]], the producerist view was dominant among American artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Ascher, Robert, "Producerism is consciousness of class," ''Organized labor and American politics : 1894-1994 : the labor-liberal alliance'', Albany : State Univ. of New York Press, 1998, pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosanne Currarino identifies two varieties of producerism in the mid-19th Century: "proprietary producerism," which is popular among self-employed farmers and urban artisans, and "industrial producerism," which spoke to wage-laborers and is identified in particular with the [[Knights of Labor]] and the rise of [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Currarino, Roseanne, ''The Labor Question in America: Economic Democracy in the Gilded Age'', University of Illinois Press, 2011, pp. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

For some commentators, the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, led by [[Eugene V. Debs]], was a high-water mark in the history of American producerism.&lt;ref&gt;Stromquist, Shelton, "The crisis of 1894 and the legacies of producerism, ''The Pullman Strike and the crisis of the 1890s : essays on labor and politics'', Urbana, Ill. [u.a.] University of Illinois Press 1999, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Currarino, Roseanne, ''The Labor Question in America: Economic Democracy in the Gilded Age'', University of Illinois Press, 2011, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westbrook, Robert B., ''Democratic hope : pragmatism and the politics of truth'', Ithaca, N.Y : Cornell University Press, 2005, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, producerism was historically influential in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], especially its [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] wing, until the early 20th century, pitting "the many against the few" - i.e. the working and middle classes against the landed aristocracy, expressed in support of ideas such as the [[Single tax|single land tax]] advocated by [[Georgist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Anthony |date=1 April 2011 |title=The Political Life of Josiah C. Wedgwood: Land, Liberty and Empire, 1872-1943 |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1065 |journal=[[Reviews in History]]|access-date=29 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day producerism==
Producerism has seen a contemporary revival, sparked by popular opposition to the machinations of globalized [[financial capital]] and large, politically connected corporations. Critics of producerism see a correlation between producerist views, and views that are antagonistic toward lower income people and immigrants, such as [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]. These critics see producerism as analogous to [[populism]].&lt;ref name=Berlet&gt;{{Citation |last=Berlet |first=Chip |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Matthew N. |last2=Lyons |year=2000 |title=Right-wing populism in America: Too close for comfort |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=1-57230-562-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Betz&gt;{{Citation |last=Betz |first=Hans-Georg |year=1994 |title=Radical Right-wing Populism in Western Europe |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-08390-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of politicians or groups that are cited by these critics include the [[Reform Party of the United States of America]], [[Ross Perot]], [[Pat Buchanan]], and [[Lou Dobbs]], as well as [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in [[France]], [[Björn Höcke]] in [[Germany]] and similar dissident politicians across Europe.&lt;ref name=Betz/&gt;

==Religion and social issues==
{{cite check|date=December 2013}}
Although producerism is primarily economic in emphasis, it also has a perspective on social issues. Namely it upholds the traditional values of the middle class as the only true national values. It defends those values against the corruption of decadent inherited wealth, and against the dangerous apathy and sloth it sees as being the inevitable consequence of dependency on a [[welfare state]]. Therefore, producerists tend to be patriotic but at the same time intensely distrustful of the State, which they believe to be under the control of forces hostile to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Canovan, Stock, Kazin&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=December 2013}}

Some have pointed out a similarity between producerism and certain Christian [[End Times]] narratives that prophesize betrayal by trusted political and religious leaders, with many citizens drifting into laziness and sin. The producerist emphasis on the inherent value of hard work is directly related to the [[Protestant work ethic]], outlined by Weber. In the United States and in Europe it is often sympathetic towards conservative or Fundamentalist/Primitive Christianity, seen as a defender against both the moral degeneracy of the poor and the rapaciousness of unbridled capitalism. But producerism is not tied to a specific religious world view, and its emphasis on economics, labor, and class resentments embues it with a materialism not entirely compatible with a purely religious outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin, Berlet &amp; Lyons&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=December 2013}}

RMIT's '''School of Business IT and Logistics''' (also referred to as SBITL) is an [[Australian]] [[tertiary education]] school within the College of Business at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ([[RMIT University]]), located in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name=business_portfolio&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/bus/schools&amp;groups RMIT Business Schools and Groups]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SBITL has been a part of RMIT for more than 20 years. The Master of Business (IT) program has been delivered in Singapore for 20 years and it is likely that it has been delivered for more than that at their campus in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=MBIT_birthday&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/bus/bit/mbit_birthday; RMIT’s MBIT SIM alumni contemplate “Brain Conditioning”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student Clubs==
The school recognises two [[Student society|student societies]] falling under its academics. The [http://www.su.rmit.edu.au/clubs/academic-clubs/rmit-business-information-systems-student-association-bissa/ Business Information Systems Students Association] serves as the academic society for the [[information system]]s students, and the [http://www.su.rmit.edu.au/clubs/academic-clubs/rmit-supply-chain-student-association/ Supply Chain Student Association] serves the [[logistics]] &amp; [[Supply chain|supply chain management]] students. Both societies are affiliates of the [http://www.su.rmit.edu.au/clubs/academic-clubs/rmit-business-student-association-bsa-rmit/ RMIT Business Student Association].

==Location==
SBITL is located in building 80.

==Programs==
SBITL offers programs from [[undergraduate]] to doctor levels, most of the programs are delivered at the [[RMIT University]] City Campus. Some of the programs are delivered at the [[RMIT International University, Vietnam|RMIT University International Campus Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=Programs&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=i7l61p4f90ay;STATUS=A;PAGE_AUTHOR=Minh%20Vu;SECTION=1; RMIT University School of Business Information Technology Academic Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry links==
SBITL has strong links to the industry with partners including [[IBM|IBM Australia]], [[GS1|GS1 Australia]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]] and [[SAP AG|SAP]]. Partners contribute differently. Examples include guest lectures from Ernst &amp; Young and IBM Australia for research and education purposes. SBIT also have relationships with other professional associations such as [[Association for Information Systems|AIS]], [[Australian Computer Society|ACS]] and [[ALIA]].&lt;ref name=Industry_links&gt;[http://www.rmit.edu.au/bus/bit/industry; SBIT Industry Links]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rape fantasy''' (sometimes referred to as '''rapeplay''') or a '''ravishment''' is a [[sexual fantasy]] involving imagining or pretending being coerced or coercing another into [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. In [[sexual roleplay]], it involves acting out roles of [[Rape|coercive sex]]. [[Rape pornography]] is literature or images associated with rape and sometimes [[Stockholm syndrome]] as a means of [[sexual arousal]].

== Fantasy ==
Studies have found rape fantasy is a common sexual fantasy among both men and women. The fantasy may involve the fantasist as either the one being forced into sex or being the perpetrator. A 1974 study by Hariton and Singer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Specific Sexual Fantasy Themes: A Multidimensional Study |author1=William B. Arndt, Jr. |author2=John C. Foehl |author3=F. Elaine Good |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.48.2.472 |date=1985 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=472–480 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that being "overpowered or forced to surrender" was the second most frequent fantasy in their survey; a 1984 study by Knafo and Jaffe ranked being overpowered as their study's most common fantasy during intercourse. In 1985, Louis H. Janda who is an associate professor of psychology at [[Old Dominion University]]&lt;ref&gt;no author. (2005, April 6) Louis H. Janda Associate Professor of Psychology. Retrieved on August 9, 2015, from [http://ww2.sci.odu.edu/psychology/directory/janda.shtml link]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the sexual fantasy of being raped is the most common sexual fantasy for women.&lt;!-- This is in the middle of page 334.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janda, L.H. (1985). How to live with an imperfect person. USA: Wellness Institute, Inc. {{ISBN|1-58741-007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1988 study by Pelletier and Herold found that over half of their female respondents had fantasies of forced sex.&lt;!--This is in the left-middle of page 125.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. (2001). Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings. Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press. {{ISBN|1-84169-018-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequently cited hypothesis for why women fantasize of being forced and coerced into some sexual activity is that the fantasy avoids societally induced guilt—the woman does not have to admit responsibility for her sexual desires and behavior. A 1978 study by Moreault and Follingstad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://uknowledge.uky.edu/crvaw_facpub/53/ |title=Sexual Fantasies of Females as a Function of Sex Guilt and Experimenta |author1=Denise Moreault |author2=Diane R. Follingstad |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.46.6.1385 |date=1978 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1385–1393 |pmid=730888 |accessdate=2014-06-16 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was consistent with this hypothesis, and found that women with high levels of sex guilt were more likely to report fantasy themed around being overpowered, dominated, and helpless. In contrast, Pelletier and Herold used a different measure of guilt and found no correlation. Other research suggests that women who report forced sex fantasies have a more positive attitude towards sexuality, contradicting the guilt hypothesis.{{sfn|Strassberg|Lockerd|1998|p=405}} A 1998 study by Strassberg and Lockerd found that women who fantasized about force were generally less guilty and more [[erotophilia|erotophilic]], and as a result had more frequent and varied fantasies. However, it said that force fantasies are not the most common or the most frequent.{{sfn|Strassberg|Lockerd|1998|p=416}}

45.8% of men in a 1980 study reported fantasizing during heterosexual [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] about "a scene where [they had] the impression of being raped by a woman" (3.2% often and 42.6% sometimes), 44.7% of scenes where a seduced woman "pretends resisting" and 33% of raping a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crépault C, Couture M |title=Men's erotic fantasies |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |year=1980 |pmid=7458662 |doi=10.1007/BF01542159 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male sexual fantasy of raping a woman may bring sexual arousal either from imagining a scene in which first a woman objects but then comes to like and eventually participate in the intercourse, or else one in which the woman does not like it and arousal is associated with the idea of hurting the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Arousal: The Secret Logic of Sexual Fantasies |last=Bader |first=Michael J. |year=2003 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |location= |isbn=0-312-30242-8 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of college-age women in 1998 found over half had engaged in fantasies of rape or coercion which, another study suggests, are simply "open and unrestricted" expressions of [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Force in Women's Sexual Fantasies |last=Strassberg |first=Donald S. |last2=Locker |first2=Lisa K. |year=1998 |journal=Arch Sex Behav |issn=1573-2800 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=403–414 |doi=10.1023/A:1018740210472 |pmid=9681121 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roleplay ==
One form of [[sexual roleplay]]ing is the rape fantasy, also called ravishment or forced sex roleplay. In [[BDSM]] circles (and occasionally outside these circles as well), some people choose to roleplay rape scenes—with communication, consent and safety being especially crucial elements. Though consent is a crucial component of any sexual roleplay, the illusion of non-consent (i.e. rape) is important to maintaining this type of fantasy. Due to this, the usage of a [[safeword]] is a logical safety measure, given that words that would normally halt sexual activity (i.e. stop) are often disregarded in these scenes. Continuing with the sexual roleplay after a safeword has been used constitutes [[sexual assault|assault]], as the use of a safeword indicates the withdrawal of consent.

'''Renaissance art''' is the painting, sculpture and decorative arts of the period of European history, emerging as a distinct style in Italy in about 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]], [[Renaissance literature|literature]], [[Renaissance music|music]], and [[Renaissance science|science]]. Renaissance art, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of [[Classical antiquity]], but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with [[Renaissance Humanism|Renaissance Humanist philosophy]], spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the [[Early Modern]] age.

In many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with [[Gothic art|Late Medieval art]].
Renaissance art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man. Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, literally “rebirth.” Rather, historical sources suggest that interest in nature, humanistic learning, and individualism were already present in the late medieval period and became dominant in 15th- and 16th-century Italy concurrently with social and economic changes such as the secularization of daily life, the rise of a rational money-credit economy, and greatly increased social mobility.
The influences upon the development of Renaissance men and women in the early 15th century are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government, and other aspects of society. The following list presents a summary, dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.
* Classical texts, lost to European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Prose, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts, and Early Christian Theology.
* Simultaneously, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of Islamic scholars.
* The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public.
* The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]].
* [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy.
* [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church.
* A revived interest in the [[Classical literature|Classics]] brought about the first archaeological study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and sculptor [[Donatello]]. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting and sculpture, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of [[Masaccio]] and [[Uccello]].
* The improvement of [[oil paint]] and developments in oil-painting technique by Dutch artists such as [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]] led to its adoption in Italy from about 1475 and had ultimately lasting effects on painting practices, worldwide.
* The [[serendipity|serendipitous]] presence within the region of [[Florence]] in the early 15th century of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] formed an ethos out of which sprang the great masters of the High Renaissance, as well as supporting and encouraging many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in [[Venice]] through the talented [[Jacopo Bellini|Bellini]] family, their influential in-law [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''The Fifteenth Century, the Prospect of Europe'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-Renaissance in Italy, 1280–1400===

{{main article|Italian Renaissance painting}}
In Italy in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the sculpture of [[Nicola Pisano]] and his son [[Giovanni Pisano]], working at [[Pisa]], [[Siena]] and [[Pistoia]] shows markedly classicising tendencies, probably influenced by the familiarity of these artists with ancient Roman [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]]. Their masterpieces are the pulpits of the Baptistery and [[Pisa Cathedral|Cathedral of Pisa]]. 

Contemporary with Giovanni Pisano, the Florentine painter [[Giotto]] developed a manner of figurative painting that was unprecedentedly naturalistic, three-dimensional, lifelike and classicist, when compared with that of his contemporaries and teacher [[Cimabue]]. Giotto, whose greatest work is the cycle of the ''Life of Christ'' at the [[Arena Chapel]] in [[Padua]], was seen by the 16th century biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] as "rescuing and restoring art" from the "crude, traditional, Byzantine style" prevalent in Italy in the 13th century.

===Early Netherlandish art, 1425–1525===
{{main article|Early Netherlandish painting}}
[[File:El Descendimiento, by Rogier van der Weyden, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rogier van der Weyden)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' (c. 1435), oil on oak panel, {{convert|220|×|262|cm|0|abbr=on}}. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid]]
The painters of the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]] in this period included [[Jan van Eyck]], his brother [[Hubert van Eyck]], [[Robert Campin]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]]. Their painting developed partly independently of Early Italian Renaissance painting, and without the influence of a deliberate and conscious striving to revive antiquity. 

The style of painting grew directly out of medieval painting in [[tempera]], on panels and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and other forms such as [[stained glass]]; the medium of [[fresco]] was less common in northern Europe.  The medium used was [[oil paint]], which had long been utilised for painting leather ceremonial shields and accoutrements, because it was flexible and relatively durable. The earliest Netherlandish oil paintings are meticulous and detailed like tempera paintings. The material lent itself to the depiction of tonal variations and texture, so facilitating the observation of nature in great detail.  

The Netherlandish painters did not approach the creation of a picture through a framework of linear perspective and correct proportion. They maintained a medieval view of hierarchical proportion and religious symbolism, while delighting in a realistic treatment of material elements, both natural and man-made. Jan van Eyck, with his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]], painted ''[[Ghent Altarpiece|The Altarpiece of the Mystical Lamb]]''. It is probable that [[Antonello da Messina]] became familiar with Van Eyck's work, while in Naples or Sicily. In 1475, Hugo van der Goes' ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'' arrived in Florence where it was to have a profound influence on many painters, most immediately [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] who painted an altarpiece imitating its elements.

A very significant Netherlandish painter towards the end of the period was [[Hieronymus Bosch]], who employed the type of fanciful forms that were often utilized to decorate borders and letters in illuminated manuscripts, combining plant and animal forms with architectonic ones. When taken from the context of the illumination and peopled with humans, these forms give Bosch's paintings a surreal quality which have no parallel in the work of any other Renaissance painter. His masterpiece is the triptych ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.

{{main article|Italian Renaissance painting}}
Although both the Pisanos and Giotto had students and followers, the first truly Renaissance artists were not to emerge in Florence until 1401 with the competition to sculpt a set of [[Florence Baptistry#Lorenzo Ghiberti|bronze doors]] of the Baptistery of [[Florence Cathedral]] which drew entries from seven young sculptors including [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and the winner, [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]. Brunelleschi, most famous as the architect of the dome of Florence Cathedral and the Church of San Lorenzo, created a number of sculptural works, including a lifesized Crucifix in [[Santa Maria Novella]], renowned for its naturalism. His studies of perspective are thought to have influenced the painter [[Masaccio]]. [[Donatello]] became renowned as the greatest sculptor of the Early Renaissance, his masterpieces being his Humanist and unusually erotic statue of [[David (Bible)|David]], one of the icons of the Florentine republic, and his great monument to [[Gattamelata]], the first large equestrian bronze to be created since Roman times.

The contemporary of Donatello, [[Masaccio]], was the painterly descendant of Giotto and began the Early Renaissance in Italian Painting in 1425, furthering the trend towards solidity of form and naturalism of face and gesture that Giotto had begun a century earlier.  From 1425-28, Masaccio completed several panel paintings but is best known for the fresco cycle that he began in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] with the older artist [[Masolino]] and which had profound influence on later painters, including [[Michelangelo]]. Masaccio's developments were carried forward in the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], particularly in his frescos at the Convent of San Marco in Florence.

The treatment of the elements of perspective and light in painting was of particular concern to 15th-century Florentine painters. [[Uccello]] was so obsessed with trying to achieve an appearance of perspective that, according to Vasari, it disturbed his sleep. His solutions can be seen in his masterpiece set of three paintings, the [[Battle of San Romano]] which is believed to have been completed by 1460. [[Piero della Francesca]] made systematic and scientific studies of both light and linear perspective, the results of which can be seen in his fresco cycle of ''[[The History of the True Cross]]'' in [[San Francesco, Arezzo]].

In [[Naples]], the painter [[Antonello da Messina]] began using oil paints for portraits and religious paintings at a date that preceded other Italian painters, possibly about 1450. He carried this technique north and influenced the painters of [[Venice]]. One of the most significant painters of Northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]], who decorated the interior of a room, ''the [[Camera degli Sposi]]'' for his patron [[Ludovico III Gonzaga|Ludovico Gonzaga]], setting portraits of the family and court into an illusionistic architectural space.

The end period of the Early Renaissance in Italian art is marked, like its beginning, by a particular commission that drew artists together, this time in cooperation rather than competition. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] had rebuilt the Papal Chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, and commissioned a group of artists, [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] to decorate its wall with fresco cycles depicting ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of Moses''. In the sixteen large paintings, the artists, although each working in his individual style, agreed on principals of format, and utilised the techniques of lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation that had been carried to a high point in the large Florentine studios of Ghiberti, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio and Perugino.

===Early Renaissance in France, 1375–1528===
The artists of France, (including duchies such as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]) were often associated with courts, providing illuminated manuscripts and portraits for the nobility as well as devotional paintings and altarpieces.  Among the most famous were the [[Limbourg brothers]], Flemish illuminators and creators of the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]. [[Jean Fouquet]], painter of the royal court, visited Italy in 1437 and reflects the influence of Florentine painters such as [[Paolo Uccello]]. Although best known for his portraits such as that of [[Charles VII of France]] Fouquet also created illuminations, and is thought to be the inventor of the portrait miniature. There were a number of artists at this date who painted famed altarpieces, that are stylistically quite distinct from both the Italian and the Flemish. These include two enigmatic figures, [[Enguerrand Quarton]] to whom is ascribed the ''Pieta of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon'', and [[Jean Hey]], otherwise known as "the Master of Moulins" after his most famous work, ''the Moulins Altarpiece''. In these works realism and close observation of the human figure, emotions and lighting are combined with a Medieval formality, which includes gilt backgrounds.

===High Renaissance in Italy, 1495-1520===
{{main article|High Renaissance|Italian Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo, (c. 1511) ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', from the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]]]
The "universal genius" [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was to further perfect the aspects of pictorial art (lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation) that had preoccupied artists of the Early Renaissance, in a lifetime of studying and meticulously recording his observations of the natural world. His adoption of oil paint as his primary media meant that he could depict light and its effects on the landscape and objects more naturally and with greater dramatic effect than had ever been done before, as demonstrated in the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. His dissection of cadavers carried forward the understanding of skeletal and muscular anatomy, as seen in the unfinished ''St Jerome''.  His depiction of human emotion in ''The Last Supper'', completed 1495-1498, set the benchmark for religious painting.

The art of Leonardo's younger contemporary [[Michelangelo]] took a very different direction. Michelangelo, in neither his painting nor his sculpture demonstrates any interest in the observation of any natural object except the human body. He perfected his technique in depicting it, while in his early twenties, by the creation of the enormous marble statue of ''David'' and the group ''the Pieta'', in [[St Peter's Basilica]], Rome. He then set about an exploration of the expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. His commission by [[Pope Julius II]] to paint the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] resulted in the supreme masterpiece of figurative composition, which was to have profound effect on every subsequent generation of European artists&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laetitiana.co.uk/2014/07/introduction-to-renaissance-movement.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  His later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541 shows a Mannerist (also called Late Renaissance) style with generally elongated bodies which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

Standing alongside Leonardo and Michelangelo as the third great painter of the High Renaissance was the younger [[Raphael]], who in a short life span painted a great number of lifelike and engaging portraits, including those of Pope Julius II and his successor [[Pope Leo X]], and numerous portrayals of the Madonna and Christ Child, including the [[Sistine Madonna]].  His death in 1520 at age 37 is considered by many art historians to be the end of the High Renaissance period, although some individual artists continued working in the High Renaissance style for many years thereafter.

In Northern Italy the High Renaissance is represented by the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], especially religious paintings, which include several large altarpieces of a type known as "[[Sacred Conversation]]" which show a group of saints around the enthroned Madonna. His contemporary [[Giorgione]], who died at about the age of 32 in 1510, left a small number of enigmatic works, including ''[[The Tempest (painting)|The Tempest]]'', the subject of which has remained a matter of speculation. The earliest works of [[Titian]] date from the era of the High Renaissance, including a massive altarpiece ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|The Assumption of the Virgin]]'' which combines human action and drama with spectacular colour and atmosphere.  Titian continued painting in a generally High Renaissance style until near the end of his career in the 1570s, although he increasingly used colour and light over line to define his figures.

===German Renaissance art===

{{main article|German Renaissance}}
German Renaissance art falls into the broader category of the Renaissance in Northern Europe, also known as the [[Northern Renaissance]]. 
Renaissance influences began to appear in German art in the 15th century, but this trend was not widespread. Gardner's ''Art Through the Ages'' identifies [[Michael Pacher]], a painter and sculptor, as the first German artist whose work begins to show Italian Renaissance influences. According to that source, Pacher's painting, ''St. Wolfgang Forces the Devil to Hold His Prayerbook'' (c.1481), is Late Gothic in style, but also shows the influence of the Italian artist, [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|page=555|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artisans, such as engravers, became more concerned with aesthetics rather than just perfecting their craft. Germany had master engravers, such as [[Martin Schongauer]], who did metal engravings in the late 1400s. Gardner relates this mastery of the graphic arts to advances in printing which occurred in Germany, and says that metal engraving began to replace the woodcut during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=555–556|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some artists, such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], continued to do woodcuts. Both Gardner and Russell describe the fine quality of Dürer's woodcuts, with Russell stating, in ''The World of Dürer'', that Dürer "elevated them into high works of art."&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Francis|title=The World of Dürer|date=1967|publisher=Time Life Books, Time Inc.|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 1500s, Renaissance art in Germany became more common as, according to Gardner, "The art of northern Europe during the sixteenth century is characterized by a sudden awareness of the advances made by the Italian Renaissance and by a desire to assimilate this new style as rapidly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=556–557|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best known practitioners of German Renaissance art was Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Dürer's fascination with classical ideas led him to Italy to study art. Both Gardner and Russell recognized the importance of Durer's contribution to German art in bringing Italian Renaissance styles and ideas to Germany.&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=561|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell calls this "Opening the Gothic windows of German art,"&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"/&gt; while Gardner calls it Dürer's "life mission."&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; Importantly, as Gardner points out, Dürer "was the first northern artist who fully understood the basic aims of the southern Renaissance,"&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; although his style did not always reflect that. The same source says that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (1497–1543) successfully assimilated Italian ideas while also keeping "northern traditions of close realism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=564|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted against Dürer's tendency to work in "his own native German style"&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; instead of combining German and Italian styles.
Other important artists of the German Renaissance were [[Matthias Grünewald|Grünewald]], [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=557|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
Britain was very late to develop a Renaissance style and most [[artists of the Tudor court]] were imported foreigners, usually from the [[Low countries]], including [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], who died in England.  One exception was the [[portrait miniature]], which artists including [[Nicholas Hilliard]] developed into a distinct genre, well before it became popular in the rest of Europe. [[Renaissance_in_Scotland#Art|Renaissance art in Scotland]] was similarly dependent on imported artists, and largely restricted to the court.

==Themes and symbolism==
[[File:Magnificatio.jpg|thumb|[[Sandro Botticelli]], ''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'', 1480–81, tempera on panel, [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]
Renaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious [[altarpiece]]s, [[fresco]] cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. For inspiration, painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (1260), a highly influential source book for the lives of [[saint]]s that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. The rebirth of classical antiquity and [[Renaissance humanism]] also resulted in many [[Mythology|Mythological]] and [[history painting]]s. [[Ovidian]] stories, for example, were very popular. Decorative [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.

==Techniques==
* The use of [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] – The first major treatment of the painting as a window into space appeared in the work of [[Giotto di Bondone]], at the beginning of the 14th century.  True linear perspective was formalized later, by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]].  In addition to giving a more realistic presentation of art, it moved Renaissance painters into composing more paintings.
* [[Foreshortening]] – The term foreshortening refers to the artistic effect of shortening lines in a drawing so as to create an illusion of depth.
* [[Sfumato]] – The term sfumato was coined by Italian Renaissance artist, Leonardo da Vinci, and refers to a fine art painting technique of blurring or softening of sharp outlines by subtle and gradual blending of one tone into another through the use of thin glazes to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This stems from the Italian word sfumare meaning to evaporate or to fade out. The Latin origin is fumare, to smoke.
* [[Chiaroscuro]] – The term chiaroscuro refers to the fine art painting modeling effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This comes from the Italian words meaning light (chiaro) and dark (scuro), a technique which came into wide use in the Baroque Period.

{{wiktionary|seta}}

In [[biology]], '''setae''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|iː}} (singular  '''seta''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|ə}}; from the Latin word for "[[bristle]]") are any of a number of different bristle- or [[hair]]-like structures on living [[organism]]s.

==Animal setae==

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Isonychia Foreleg.jpg|thumb|Setae on the foreleg of a [[mayfly]]]]

[[Annelid]] setae are stiff bristles present on the body. They help, for example, [[earthworm]]s to attach to the surface and prevent backsliding during [[peristaltic]] motion. These hairs make it difficult to pull a worm straight from the ground. Setae in [[oligochaetes]] (a group including earthworms) are largely composed of [[chitin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyman | first1 = H.L. | year = 1966 | title = Further Notes on the Occurrence of Chitin in Invertebrates | url = http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/reprint/130/1/94.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Biological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 1–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are classified according to the limb to which they are attached; for instance, notosetae are attached to [[notopodia]]; neurosetae to [[neuropodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J.| title = A reassessment of the enigmatic Burgess Shale fossil ''Wiwaxia corrugata'' (Matthew) and its relationship to the polychaete ''Canadia spinosa'' Walcott| jstor = 2400789| journal = Paleobiology| volume = 16| issue = 3| pages = 287–303| year = 1990| doi = 10.2307/2400789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crustacean]]s have mechano- and chemosensory setae.&lt;ref name="isopods.nhm.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garm | first1 = A | year = 2004 | title = Revising the definition of the crustacean seta and setal classification systems based on examinations of the mouthpart setae of seven species of decapods | url = http://isopods.nhm.org/pdfs/12763/12763.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 142 | issue = | pages = 233–252 | doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00132.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setae are especially present on the mouthparts of crustaceans&lt;ref name="isopods.nhm.org"/&gt; and can also be found on grooming limbs.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keiler | first1 = J. | last2 = Richter | first2 = S. | year = 2011 | title = Morphological diversity of setae on the grooming legs in Anomala (Decapoda: Reptantia) revealed by scanning electron microscopy | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044523111000301 | journal = Zoologischer Anzeiger | volume = 250 | issue = 4| pages = 343–366 | doi=10.1016/j.jcz.2011.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, setae are modified into scale like structures.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Setae on the legs of [[krill]] and other small crustaceans help them to gather [[phytoplankton]]. It captures them and allows them to be eaten.

Setae on the [[integument]] of insects are unicellular, meaning that each is formed from a single epidermal cell of a type called a trichogen, literally meaning "bristle generator".  They are at first hollow and in most forms remain hollow after they have hardened.  They grow through and project through a secondary or accessory cell of a type called a tormogen, which generates the special flexible membrane that connects the base of the seta to the surrounding [[integument]]. Depending partly on their form and function, setae may be called hairs, '''macrotrichia''', '''[[chaeta]]e''', or '''[[Scale (insect anatomy)|scales]]'''. The setal membrane is not cuticularized and movement is possible. Some insects, such as ''Eriogaster lanestris'' larvae, use setae as a defense mechanism, as they can cause dermatitis when they come into contact with skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1841743/pdf/brmedj02134-0044.pdf|title=Caterpillar Dermatitis | pmc=1841743 | pmid=6023131|volume=2|year=1967|journal=Br Med J|pages=346–8 | last1 = Hellier | first1 = FF | last2 = Warin | first2 = RP | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5548.346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Gecko foot on glass.JPG|thumb|right|Close-up of the underside of a gecko's foot as it walks on vertical glass]]

The pads on a [[gecko]]'s feet are small hair-like [[process (anatomy)|process]]es that play a role in the animal's ability to cling to vertical surfaces.  The micrometer-scale setae branch into nanometer-scale projections called [[Spatulae (biology)|spatulae]].&lt;ref name=Santos2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Santos |first=Daniel |author2=Matthew Spenko |author3=Aaron Parness |author4=Kim Sangbae |author5=Mark Cutkosky|title=Directional adhesion for climbing: theoretical and practical considerations  |journal=Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology  |year=2007 |volume=21 |issue=12–13 |pages=1317–1341|issn=0169-4243|doi=10.1163/156856107782328399 |quote=''Gecko "feet and toes are a hierarchical system of complex structures consisting of lamellae, setae, and spatulae. The distinguishing characteristics of the gecko adhesion system have been described [as] (1) anisotropic attachment, (2) high pulloff force to preload ratio, (3) low detachment force, (4) material independence, (5) self-cleaning, (6) anti-self sticking and (7) non-sticky default state. ... The gecko’s adhesive structures are made from ß-keratin (modulus of elasticity [approx.] 2 GPa). Such a stiff material is not inherently sticky; however, because of the gecko adhesive’s hierarchical nature and extremely small distal features (spatulae are [approx.] 200 nm in size), the gecko’s foot is able to intimately conform to the surface and generate significant attraction using van der Waals forces.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gekko's seta: According to Kellar Autumn, "Two front feet of a tokay gecko (''[[Gekko gecko]]'') can withstand 20.1 N of force parallel to the surface with 227 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of pad area (Irschick et al. 1996). The foot of a tokay bears approximately 3600 tetrads of setae per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 14,400 setae per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (Schleich and Kastle 1986; pers- obs-)- Consequently, a single seta should produce an average force of 6-2 pN, and an average shear stress of 0-090 N mm&lt;sup&gt;−l&lt;/sup&gt; (0.9 atm). However, single setae proved both much less sticky and much more sticky than predicted by whole animal measurements, under varying experimental conditions, implying that attachment and detachment in gecko setae are mechanically controlled (Autumn et al. 2000)."&lt;ref&gt;Properties, Principles, and Parameters of the Gecko Adhesive System&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fungal setae==
In [[mycology]], "setae" refer to dark brown, thick-walled, thorn-like [[cystidia]] found in [[corticioid fungi|corticioid]] and [[polypores|poroid fungi]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Hymenochaetaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CABI |location=Wallingford |year=2008|page=116|isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though mainly microscopic, the setae of some species may be sufficiently prominent to be visible with a hand lens.

==Plant setae==
In [[botany]], "seta" refers to the stalk supporting the [[sporangium|capsule]] of a [[moss]] or [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]], and supplying it with nutrients. The seta is part of the [[sporophyte]] and has a short foot embedded in the [[gametophyte]] on which it is [[parasitic]]. Setae are not present in all mosses, but in some [[species]] they may reach 15 to 20 centimeters in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Peter H. Raven|Raven, Peter H.]]; Evert, R.F. &amp; Eichhorn, S.E.}} (2005): ''[[Biology of Plants]]'' (7th ed.). W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaetoceros setae==
In the diatom family [[Chaetocerotaceae]], "seta" refers to the hairlike outgrowths of the valve, i.e. of the face of the cells.&lt;ref name=Tomas97&gt;Tomas, C. R., Hasle G. R., Syvertsen, E. E., Steidinger, K. A., Tangen, K., Throndsen, J., Heimdal, B. R., (1997).  ''Identifying Marine Phytoplankton'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These setae have a different structure than the valve. Such setae may prevent rapid sinking and also protect the cells from grazing.

==Synthetic setae==
[[Synthetic setae]] are a class of synthetic [[adhesive]]s that detach at will, sometimes called resetable adhesives, yet display substantial stickiness.  The development of such synthetic materials is a matter of current research.&lt;ref name=Santos2007/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9976">'''Siltation''' or '''siltification''' is the [[water pollution|pollution of water]] by particulate [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] [[Clastic rock|clastic]] material, with a particle size dominated by [[silt]] or [[clay]]. It refers both to the increased concentration of suspended sediments, and to the increased accumulation (temporary or permanent) of fine sediments on bottoms where they are undesirable. Siltation is most often caused by [[soil erosion]] or sediment spill.

Sometimes siltation is called ''sediment pollution'', although that is an undesirable term since it is ambiguous, and can also be used to refer to a chemical contamination of sediments accumulated on the bottom, or pollutants bound to sediment particles. Siltation is the preferred term for being unambigiuous, even if not entirely stringent since it also includes other particle sizes than silt.

==Causes==
[[File:Dumping of faecal sludge into the river.jpg|thumb|250px|Siltation caused by [[septage|fecal sludge]] collected from pit latrines and dumped into a river at the Korogocho slum in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].]]
[[File:Nrborderborderentrythreecolorsmay05-1-.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Siltation caused by [[Sewage sludge|raw sewage sludge]] and [[industrial waste]] in the [[New River (California)|New River]] as it passes from [[Mexicali]] to [[Calexico, California]].]]
[[File:Jacuecanga Angra dos Reis Rio de Janeiro Brazil Brasfels.JPG|thumb|Siltation caused by sewage sludge from [[shipyard]] – [[Rio de Janeiro]].]]

The origin of the increased sediment transport into an area may be erosion on land, or activities in the water.

In rural areas the erosion source is typically soil degradation due to intensive or inadequate agricultural practices, leading to [[soil erosion]], especially in fine-grained soils such as [[loess]]. The result will be an increased amount of silt and clay in the water bodies that drain the area. In urban areas the erosion source is typically construction activities, since this involves clearing the original land-covering vegetation and temporarily creating something akin to an urban desert from which fines are easily washed out during rainstorms.

In water the main pollution source is sediment spill from [[dredging]], from the transportation of dredged material on barges, and the deposition of dredged material in or near water. Such deposition may be made to get rid of unwanted material, such as the [[offshore dumping]] of material dredged from harbours and navigation channels. The deposition may also have as purpose to build up the coastline, [[artificial island]]s, or for [[beach replenishment]].

[[Climate change]] also affect siltation rates.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important cause of siltation is the [[septage]] and other [[sewage sludge]]s that are discharged from households or business establishments with no [[septic tank]]s or [[wastewater treatment facility|wastewater treatment]] facilities to bodies of water.

==Vulnerabilities==
[[File:Siltation or Sedimentation.jpg|thumb|Siltation of a waterway]]
[[File:muddy USGS.jpg|thumb|right|Silted river polluted by sediment.]]
While the [[sediment]] in [[sediment transport|transport]] is in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], it acts as a pollutant for those who require clean water. This includes uses such as for cooling or in industrial processes, and it includes aquatic life that are sensitive to suspended material in the water. While [[nekton]] have been found to avoid spill plumes in the water (e.g. the environmental monitoring project during the building of the [[Øresund Bridge]]), filtering [[benthic]] organisms have no way of escape. Among the most sensitive organisms are [[coral]] polyps. Generally speaking, hard bottom communities and mussel banks (including oysters) are more sensitive to siltation than sand and mud bottoms. Unlike in the sea, in a stream the plume will cover the entire channel, except possibly for backwaters, which is why fish will also be directly affected in most cases.

Siltation can also affect navigation channels, or irrigation channels. It refers to the undesired accumulation of sediments in channels intended for vessels, or for distributing water.

==Measurement and monitoring==
[[File:SediMeter sensor.jpg|thumb|A sensor for measuring siltation ''in situ''.]]
One may distinguish between measurements at the source, during transport, and within the affected area. Source measurements of erosion may be very difficult, since the lost material may be a fraction of a millimeter per year. Therefore, the approach taken is typically to measure the sediment in transport in the stream, by measuring the sediment concentration and multiplying that with the [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]; for example, 50&amp;nbsp;mg/L times 30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s gives 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg/s.

Also sediment spill is better measured in transport than at the source. The sediment transport in open water is estimated by measuring the [[turbidity]], correlating turbidity to sediment concentration (using a regression developed from water samples that are filtered, dried, and weighed), multiplying the concentration with the discharge as above, and integrating over the entire plume. To distinguish the spill contribution, the background turbidity is subtracted from the spill plume turbidity. Since the spill plume in open water varies in space and time, an integration over the entire plume is required, and repeated many times to get acceptably low uncertainty in the results. These measurements are made close to the source, in the order of a few hundred meters.

Anything beyond a work area buffer zone for sediment spill is considered the potential impact area. In the open sea the impact of concern is almost exclusively with the [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] bottom communities, since empirical data show that fish effectively avoid the impacted area. The siltation chiefly affects the bottom community in two ways: The suspended sediment may interfere with the food gathering of filtering organisms, and the sediment accumulation on the bottom may bury organisms to the point that they starve or even die. Only if the concentration is extreme will it decrease the light level sufficiently for impacting primary productivity. An accumulation of as little as 1&amp;nbsp;mm may kill coral polyps.

While the effect of the siltation on the biota (once the harm is already done) can be studied by repeated inspection of selected test plots, the magnitude of the siltation process in the impact area may be measured directly by monitoring in real time. Parameters to measure are sediment accumulation, turbidity at the level of the filtering biota, and optionally incident light.&lt;ref&gt;Siltation Monitoring Plan excerpt, retrieved 2010-07-11, http://lindorm.com/beaches/sedmon2.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Siltation of the magnitude that it affects shipping can also be monitored by repeated [[bathymetry|bathymetric surveys]].

==Mitigation==
[[File:Key Biscayne Crandon Park beach.jpg|thumb|Resuspension of fines from a replenished beach causing siltation offshore]]
In rural areas the first line of defense is to maintain land cover and prevent soil erosion in the first place. The second line of defense is to trap the material before it reaches the stream network (known as [[sediment control]]). In urban areas the defense is to keep land uncovered for as short a time as possible during construction, and to use silt screens to prevent the sediment from getting released in water bodies. During dredging the spill can be minimized but not eliminated completely through the way the dredger is designed and operated. If the material is deposited on land, efficient sedimentation basins can be constructed. If it is dumped in relatively deep water there will be a significant spill during dumping, but not thereafter, and the spill that does arise will have minimal impact if there are only fine-sediment bottoms nearby.

One of the most difficult conflicts of interest to resolve, as regards siltation mitigation, is perhaps [[beach nourishment]]. When sediments are placed on or near beaches in order to replenish an eroding beach, any fines in the material will continue to be washed out for as long as the sand is being reworked. Given that all replenished beaches are eroding (or else they would not need replenishment), they will contribute to nearshore siltation almost for as long as it takes to erode away what was added, albeit with somewhat decreasing intensity over time. Since this leakage is detrimental to coral reefs, the practice leads to a direct conflict between the public interest of saving beaches, and preserving any nearshore coral reefs. To minimize the conflict, beach replenishment should only be done with sand not containing any silt or clay fractions. In practice the sand is often taken from offshore [[borrow area|borrowing areas]], and since the proportion of fines in sediments typically increases in the offshore direction, the deposited sand will inevitably contain a significant percentage of siltation-contributing fines.

It is desirable to minimize the siltation of irrigation channels by hydrologic design, the objective being not to create zones with falling sediment transport capacity, as that is conducive to sedimentation. Once sedimentation has occurred, in irrigation or navigation channels, dredging is often the only remedy.

[[File:Development-Entertainment Continuum.png|thumb|SBCC on the Development-Entertainment spectrum.]]
'''Social and behavior change communication''' ('''SBCC'''), often also only "'''BCC'''" or "'''Communication for Development''' ('''C4D''')" is an interactive process of any intervention with [[individuals]], [[communities]] and/or societies (as integrated with an overall program) to develop [[communication]] strategies to promote positive behaviors which are appropriate to their settings and there by solve world's most pressing health problems. This in turn provides a supportive environment which will enable people to initiate, sustain and maintain positive and desirable [[behavior]] outcomes.&lt;ref name="UNFPA"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | title = COMMUNICATION/BEHAVIOR CHANGE TOOLS

SBCC is the strategic use of communication to promote positive health outcomes, based on proven theories and models of [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]]. SBCC employs a systematic process beginning with formative research and behavior analysis, followed by communication planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Audiences are carefully segmented, messages and materials are pre-tested, and mass media (which include radio, television, billboards, print material, internet), interpersonal channels (such as client-provider interaction, group presentations) and community mobilisation are used to achieve defined behavioral objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.measureevaluation.org/prh/rh_indicators/crosscutting/bcc|title=Behavior Change Communication — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.measureevaluation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCC should not be confused with [[behavior modification]], a term with specific meaning in a [[clinical psychiatry]] setting.

== Background ==
Providing people with information and teaching them how they should behave does not lead to desirable change in their response/behavior. However, when there is a supportive environment with information and communication (teaching) then there is a desirable change in the behavior of the target group. Thus, SBCC is proved to be an instructional intervention which has a close interface with education and communication. It is a strategic and group oriented form of communication to perceive a desired change in behavior of target group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is not as easy as it sounds, as there is no one-size-fits all strategy for any intervention. Interventions are context specific. Therefore, there is a need for proper information management and sharing. It is advised to document and report the interventions that worked somewhere, for example, the kind of messages, the medium and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|displayauthors=etal|first=|date=|year=2003|title=Evidence-based behaviour change medicine: what is it and how do we achieve it?|url=|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|volume=26|pages=161–171|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps==
SBCC is the comprehensive process in which one passes through the stages:

Unaware
&gt; Aware
&gt; Concerned
&gt; Knowledgeable
&gt; Motivated to change
&gt; Practicing trial behavior change
&gt; Sustained behavior change[[Image:Behavior Change Communication.jpg|thumb|SBCC in classroom practices]]

It involves the following steps:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# State program goals
# Involve stakeholders
# Identify target populations
# Conduct formative BCC assessments
# Segment target populations
# Define behavior change objectives
# Define SBCC strategy &amp; monitoring and evaluation plan
# Develop communication products
# Pretest
# Implement and monitor
# Evaluate
# Analyze feedback and revise

== Enabling factors ==
Behavior change is influenced by motivation from others (external influence) as well as from within oneself (internal influence). Internal influence plays a significant role in creating more enjoyment of a behavior change, instilling a sense of ownership of the new behavior, which in turn instills a sense of ownership of the changed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osbaldiston|first=R|last2=Sheldon|first2=K|year=2002|editor-last=Schmuck|editor-first=A|editor2-last=Schultz|editor2-first=W|title=Social dilemmas and sustainable development: Promoting the motivation to cooperate with the future.|url=|journal=Psychology of Sustainability|publisher=Boston: Kluwer|volume=|pages=37–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When designing SBCC strategies, enabling factors that affect the outcome must be considered. The following are some of the factors:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Effective communication
* Enabling environment, which include policies, human rights community values and norms
* User-friendly, accessible services and commodities

==Theories==
SBCC has several levels at which it can be implemented. Each level includes several theories. Each level (and each theory) employs specific communication channels.

;Individual level
* Health belief theory
* Theory of reasoned action and planned behavior
* Stages of change
* Social learning

;Community level
* Diffusion of innovations theory
* Community mobilization

;Change in organizations 
* 4 stage change

;Public policy Level
* Distinct stages of initiation, action, implementation, evaluation and re-formulation

[[File:SBCC Summit 2018 Crowd in Nusa Dua, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|Over 1,200 attendees came to the 2018 SBCC Summit, where Entertainment-Education was a main topic among Social and Behavior Chance Communications professionals.]]

==Strategies==
SBCC is different from the ordinary instructional method of communication and is target specific. A society consists of many sub-groups. The strategy for SBCC will vary from group to group. The following points are important while considering the SBCC strategy.&lt;ref name="BCC_AIDS"&gt;{{Cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vulnerability/risk factor of the target group
* The vulnerability/risk factor of the group which is to be addressed
* The conflict and obstacles in the way to desired change in behavior
* Type of message and communication media which can best be used to reach the target group
* Type of resources available and assessment of existing knowledge of the target group about the issue which is going to be dealt with

There can be several more points in this list. A successful SBCC requires lots of research and meticulous planning about the knowledge content of the subject and behavior/attitude pattern of the target group.&lt;ref name="UNFPA" /&gt;

[[Social marketing]] has been described as a tool for [[sustainable behaviour]] change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merritt|first1=Rowena|last2=Truss|first2=Aiden|last3=Hopwood|first3=Toby|title=Social marketing can help achieve sustainable behaviour change|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/social-marketing-behaviour-change|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
SBCC has proven effective in several health areas, such as increasing the use of family planning methods,reducing the spread of malaria and other infectious diseases, and improving newborn and maternal health.

SBCC is an effective tool for dealing with many community and group related problems. BCC has been adapted as an effective strategy for [[community mobilization]], health  and environment education and various public outreach programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Enhanced knowledge about the behavior change process has facilitated the design of communications programs to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and AIDS. A wide variety of health promotion strategies use communication as either an educational or norm-forming strategy. In addition, specific strategies must be designed for high-risk groups such as women, young people, injecting drug abusers, homosexuals and HIV positive groups.&lt;ref name="BCC_AIDS" /&gt;

It "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations official website on SDGs: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16&lt;/ref&gt; The Goal has 12 targets to be achieved by 2030.

== Background ==

=== The Sustainable Development Goals ===
{{See also|Sustainable Development Goals}}
The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the [[United Nations]]. The broad goals are interrelated though each has its own targets to achieve. The total number of targets is 169. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[climate change]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDGs replace the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2002 to end poverty, achieve universal [[education]], [[Women's empowerment|empower women]], reduce [[child mortality]], improve [[maternal health]], combat diseases such as [[HIV]], ensure environment sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Outcome Document of the UN Summit on the 2030 Agenda, ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, includes an emphasis on the importance of achieving progress on peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and rule of law, and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual report is prepared by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] evaluating the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;See the 2017 report: http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2017/66&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt; SDG 16 is going to be reviewed at the High-Level Political Forum in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf|title=High-level Political Forum .:.

== Links with other SDGs ==
The Sustainable Development Goals are not taken as being completely independent one from the other, but rather as being closely linked. In this way, [[media development]] enhances freedom of speech, peace, but also contributes to [[sustainability]], poverty eradication and [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/fostering-freedom-expression|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fostering peace and inclusive societies can help reduce inequalities (SDG10) and help economies prosper (SDG8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/background.html|title=Background of the Sustainable Development Goals|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 outcome document of the United Nations Summit on the 2030 Agenda considers that sustainable development can not be achieved without building peaceful, just and inclusive societies and addressing issues of corruption, poor governance, insecurity and injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some SDGs can be considered as cross-cutting as a whole. It is the case for [[gender equality]] and [[Africa]], which are considered a global priority for UNESCO and a "critical factor for the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/africa/

== Achievements ==

=== UNDP ===
The [[United Nations Development Programme]] is the United Nations [[International development|global development]] network who is also concerned with SDG 16 as the Programme focuses on [[Democracy|democratic governance]] and peace building.&lt;ref&gt;See official website: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding.html&lt;/ref&gt; The UNDP also works on conflict prevention by supporting empowering women and youth, and supporting regulatory frameworks and mechanisms and by acting as mediators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding/conflict-prevention.html|title=Conflict prevention - UNDP|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNDP has provided electoral assistance in over 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org/|title=EC-UNDP Joint Task Force - Partnership on Electoral Assistance|website=www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
UNESCO’s work on freedom of expression and the [[Safety of Journalists|safety of journalists]] contributes to Goal 16. UNESCO’s approach to media development tries to be knowledge-driven and context-sensitive. The Organization also wants to take into account the new challenges and opportunities of the media environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sdgs/ci|title=Sustainable Development Goals for Communication and Information|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO's communication and information sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/|title=Communication and Information - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for targets 16.3 (access to justice), 16.5 (anti-corruption and transparent and accountable institutions). It aims to: "foster intercultural dialogue, culture of peace and non-violence, and prevent [[violent extremism]] through global citizenship education; support free, independent and pluralistic media, ensure the safety of journalists; protect cultural and natural heritage, strengthen [[Multi-stakeholder governance|governance]] systems for culture and enhance fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247785e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preventing violent extremism ====
Preventing [[violent extremism]] is a way to promote, in official wording, a "culture of peace and non-violence" for UNESCO. The Organization aims to prevent violent extremism by using education as a tool to strengthen [[global citizenship]], by mobilizing youth, women and other stakeholders - such as [[policy]]-makers, researchers and media actors -  to take actions, online and offline, to prevent and respond to violent extremism and [[radicalization]] on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002603/260382e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and to promote cultural diversity to foster more fair, inclusive and peaceful societies, through the #Unite4Heritage campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unite4heritage.org/|title=#Unite4Heritage – Celebrating &amp; Safeguarding Cultural Heritage - u4h|website=www.unite4heritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Educational Programmes on Heritage and Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity|title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"/&gt;

==== Freedom of expression ====
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}
Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or sanction.&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1859 |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html |chapter=Introductory |url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/ |title=On Liberty |edition=4th |location=London |publisher=Longman, Roberts &amp; Green |publication-date=1869 |at=para. 5 |quote=Society can and does execute its own mandates ... it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.

The '''Taiwan Forestry Research Institute''' ('''TFRI'''; {{zh|c=林業試驗所|p=Línyè Shìyàn Suǒ}}) a research institute under the [[Council of Agriculture (Taiwan)|Council of Agriculture]] of the [[Taiwan|Taiwan (ROC)]] dealing with forest.

==History==

===Empire of Japan===
TRFI was originally established as a nursery on 6 January 1896 during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule of Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfri.gov.tw/main/index.aspx|title=About Us|publisher=Taiwan Forestry Research Institute|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1900, a new plot of land was purchased at the present location of [[Taipei Botanical Garden]] and the nursery was named the '''Taipei Nursery'''. In 1911, on the foundation of Taipei Nursery, the '''Forestry Experimental Station''' was established to handle the management of forest in Taiwan. In 1921, the Japanese government unified all research institutes in Taiwan and established the Central Research Institute which included the Forestry Experimental Station but was named the '''Forestry Division''' of the Central Research Institute. In 1939, the Central Research Institute was reorganized and the Forestry Division was made independent named '''Forestry Research Institute'''.

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession Day|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the Republic of China, it was later renamed to '''Taiwan Forestry Research Institute''' on 1 November 1945 and placed under the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]]. In September 1949, the research institute was transferred under the [[Council of Agriculture (Taiwan)|Agriculture and Forestry Administration]]. In July 1999, the research institute was formally renamed '''Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, Council of Agriculture (COA), Executive Yuan'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfri.gov.tw/main/page_view.aspx?siteid=&amp;ver=&amp;usid=&amp;mnuid=5174&amp;modid=1341&amp;mode=|title=About Us|publisher=Taiwan Forestry Research Institute|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
