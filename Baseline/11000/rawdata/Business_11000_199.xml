      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7173">The '''2005 Hong Kong electoral reform''' was carried out in late 2005 for the selection of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] (CE) in 2007 and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) in 2008. The reform proposals were ultimately voted down by the [[pro-democracy camp]].&lt;ref name="Fong"/&gt;

==Background==
The  [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] established in 1997 was governed by the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], the "mini-constitution" of the region. The Basic Law set out the selecting method of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] (CE) for the first two terms and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) for the first three terms. The selection method of the CE and LegCo was left blank for the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2007|2007 Chief Executive]] and [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2008|2008 Legislative Council]] elections. [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]] promised that "the ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by [[universal suffrage]]" while Article 68 stipulated that "the ultimate aim is the election of all members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage".

The politics of the constitutional reforms have dominated Hong Kong agenda since the handover, as the [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democrats]] demanded all along an early implementation of universal suffrage for the CE and LegCo elections.&lt;ref name="Fong"&gt;{{cite book|title= Hong Kong’s Governance Under Chinese Sovereignty: The Failure of the State-Business Alliance After 1997|first=Brian C. H.|last=Fong|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2004, the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) reached a verdict stating that the elections of the 2007 CE and 2008 LegCo would not be returned by universal suffrage, thereby defeating the democrats' appeal for 2007/08 universal suffrage.&lt;ref name="Fong"/&gt;

==2005 blueprint==
In March 2005, the unpopular [[Tung Chee-hwa]] resigned as Chief Executive, citing health reasons. [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Donald Tsang]] succeeded in an [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2005|uncontested election]] with the controversy over NPCSC's constitutional interpretation.

On 28 October, the [[First term of Donald Tsang as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Donald Tsang administration]] announced a blueprint for reforming the 2007/08 methods.&lt;ref name="Fong"/&gt; The Fifth Report of the Task Force on Constitutional Development proposed limited reforms to the electoral methods for the 2007 and 2008 CE elections as constrained by the April 2004 NPCSC verdict.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

The report proposed to expand the 800-member [[Election Committee]] to 1,600, in the process of which including all 529 [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Councillors]], including the appointed members by the government, in order to widen the base of the indirect electorate. The government also proposed to add 10 seats to the 2008 LegCo, with five directly-elected through [[geographical constituencies]] and five [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]] elected by District Councillors. The government claimed that this was the best deal they could muster given the constraints of the NPCSC verdict.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

==LegCo voting==
According to Annex I and II of the Basic Law, an amendment of the electoral methods of CE and LegCo requires the consent of two-thirds majority of the LegCo, which means the 25 pro-democrats in the LegCo could veto the proposal if they vote ''en bloc'' against it.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

Initially, the mainstream democrats, represented by the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Article 45 Concern Group]] which combined for 12 votes in the legislature indicated their willingness to approve the proposal on the condition that the 159 appointed members of the District Councils would be excluded in the expanded Election Committee. Many in the pro-democracy were ready to approve the proposal if the amendment be made, which included the Article 45 Concern Group. Although hardliners in the camp refused to make any concession&lt;ref name="Poon"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kit|last=Poon|title=The Political Future of Hong Kong: Democracy Within Communist China|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|pages=76–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following weeks, the political winds shifted abruptly to a radical direction.&lt;ref name="Poon"/&gt; The radical wing stepped up the call for full democracy by launching a signature campaign in newspapers. A dozen political parties and civil groups began for another mass rally just before the voting on the proposal. On 4 November, several democratic leaders met with religious leaders Bishop [[Joseph Zen]] and Reverend [[Chu Yiu-ming]] who persuaded them to vote ''en bloc'' against the government proposal. A week later, a [[Tell me (advertisement)|political advertisement]] appeared on front pages of several newspapers showing a sandglass in black background with one written phrase: "Tell me, would I live to see universal suffrage?", addressed by "a 78-year-old man."&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

As a result, the pro-democrats raised their stakes by demanding a clear road and timetable to full democracy. The claimed to veto the proposal unless the appointment system in the District Councils was abolished and a clear road map and timetable were offered.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt; The representatives from the NPCSC and [[Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office]] (HKMAO) invited social notables and legislators from the Article 45 Concern Group to a meeting but was turned down by the group. The Chief Executive also repeatedly appealed to the public for support on television and radio programmes.&lt;ref name="Poon"/&gt;

The democrats launched [[December 2005 protest for democracy in Hong Kong|a rally on 4 December demanding universal suffrage]] drew estimated 100,000 people. The high turnout strengthened the cause of the democrats to veto the proposal. On 21 December 2005, the proposal was turned down with 24 democrats voted ''en bloc'' against it, although there were continuing rumours that some might switch their position and supported it, except for [[Lau Chin-shek]] who abstained.&lt;ref name="Cheng"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Its First Decade|pages=64–8|first=Joseph Y. S. |last=Cheng|publisher=City University of HK Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polling==
A survey in late October 2005 showed that 58.8% of respondents accepted the government proposals while 23.6% disapproved, although 66% of the respondents supported a timetable for full democracy in the reform proposal . After the 3 December rally, a survey showed 49.9% accepted the proposal.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poon"/&gt;

[[File:Kordelinin kappeli.JPG|thumb|Alfred Kordelin's burial site, the ''Kordelin Chapel''.]]
'''Alfred Kordelin''' (6 November 1868, [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] – 7 November 1917, [[Mommila]], [[Hausjärvi]]) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[industrialist]], [[businesspeople|businessman]], entrepreneur, and a major philanthropist. Kordelin was one of the richest Finnish entrepreneurs of his time.

Kordelin had little formal education. He was the son of a poor seaman from Rauma. Kordelin invested wisely in the fields of weaving, shipbuilding and metalworking, becoming one of Finland's richest men. [[Risto Ryti]], who later became [[President of Finland]], was Alfred Kordelin's legal advisor and close friend. Kordelin owned the [[Mommila]] and [[Jokioinen]] manor houses and a [[steammill]] in [[Reposaari]]. He invested a large amount of money in different companies. He built a summerhouse in [[Naantali]], called [[Kultaranta]]. Kultaranta is currently owned by the [[Government of Finland]], and used as the President's summer residence. Kordelin himself spent only one summer at Kultaranta. On 7 November 1917, Kordelin was kidnapped  by a group of [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] and was murdered by a Russian sailor in the so-called Mommila skirmish that followed.

Kordelin never married and was childless. Upon his death he bequeathed all his property to a Finnish cultural foundation in his will. With this money the [[Alfred Kordelin Foundation]] was later founded. The foundation gives out several million euros annually in grants and awards to promote literature, science, art, and public education in Finland.

He was buried in Rauma on a chapel which was drawn by Finnish architect [[Lars Sonck]].

'''Organizational ambidexterity''' refers to an organization's ability to be efficient in its [[management]] of today's business and also adaptable for coping with tomorrow's changing demand. Just as being [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] means being able to use both the left and right hand equally, organizational ambidexterity requires the organizations to use both [[exploration]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] techniques to be successful.

== Origin and development ==

Organizational ambidexterity was defined as an organization's ability to be aligned and efficient in its management of today's business demands as well as being [[adaptive]] to changes in the environment at the same time.&lt;ref name=duncan1976&gt;Duncan, R. (1976). ''The ambidextrous organization: Designing dual structures for innovation''. Killman, R. H., L. R. Pondy, and D. Sleven (eds.) The Management of Organization. New York: North Holland. 167-188.&lt;/ref&gt; This term of organizational ambidexterity was first used by Duncan,&lt;ref name=duncan1976/&gt; however, it was [[James G. March|March]]&lt;ref name=march1991&gt;March, J. G. (1991). Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning. ''Organization Science, 2'', 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; that had been credited for developing and generating greater interest in this concept, especially in the late 20th and early 21st century. [[Ambidexterity]] in an organization is achieved by balancing [[exploration]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], which allows the organization to be [[creativity|creative]] and [[Adaptability|adaptable]], while also continuing to rely on more traditional, proven methods of business.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt; [[Exploration]] includes things such as search, variation, [[Risk|risk taking]], [[experiment]]ation, [[Stiffness|flexibility]], discovery or [[innovation]], whereas exploitation includes such things as refinement, [[choice]], [[production (economics)|production]], [[efficiency]], [[Selection (biology)|selection]], [[implementation]], and [[execution]].&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt; Companies that focus only on exploration face the risk of wasting resources on ideas that may not prove useful or never be developed. On the other hand, companies that focus only on exploitation may accept [[status quo]] performance and products and fail to reach optimal levels of success.

Organizational ambidexterity is defined broadly, and several other terms are also highly related or similar to the construct of ambidextrous organization, including [[organizational learning]], technological innovation, organizational [[adaptation]], [[strategic management]], and [[Organizational structure|organizational design]]. Things such as reconciling exploitation and exploration, the [[simultaneity]] of induced and autonomous strategy processes, synchronizing incremental and discontinuous innovation, and balancing search and stability also tend to refer to the same underlying construct as ambidextrous organization.&lt;ref name=raisch2008&gt;Raisch, S., &amp; Birkinshaw, J. (2008). Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators. ''Journal of Management, 34'', 375-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are studies on how structural and behavioral mechanisms affect organizational ambidexterity and studies on how ambidextrous organizational designs affect organizational ambidexterity. Whereas earlier studies on structural and behavioral mechanisms regarded the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation to be insurmountable, more recent research has paid attention to a range of organizational solutions to engender the existence of ambidexterity. One recent hot research topic in this area focused on the [[leadership]] characteristics that enable organizations to manage the contradictions that they face and achieve ambidexterity,&lt;ref name=beckman2006&gt;Beckman, C.

== Ambidextrous organizational designs and organizational ambidexyerity==

The studies on "ambidextrous organizations" take the organization as the unit of analysis and ambidextrous organizing is conceptualized as the simultaneous pursuit and combination of incremental and discontinuous innovation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization|title=The Ambidextrous Organization|date=2004-04-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=Michael|last2=O'Reilly|first2=C.|date=1997-01-15|title=Winning through Innovation: A Practical Guide to Leading Organizational Change and Renewal|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=200|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=M.|last2=Smith|first2=W.|date=2002-02-01|title=Organizational Technology: Technological Change, Ambidextrous Organizations and Organizational Evolution|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=11641|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ambidextrous organizations" are needed if the failure to balance exploitation and exploration is to be overcome: "the ability to pursue simultaneously both incremental and discontinuous innovation results from hosting multiple contradictory structures, processes, and cultures" (Tushman and O'Reilly, 1996: page 24).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=Michael|last2=O'Reilly|first2=C.|date=1996-07-01|title=Ambidextrous Organizations: Managing Evolutionary and Revolutionary Change|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=2045|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been empirically found that competence exploitation is negatively related to radical innovation performance whereas the effect for competence exploration is positive; competence exploration will be more valuable to the firm when it is matched with lower levels of competence exploitation, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atuahene-Gima|first=Kwaku|date=2005|title=Resolving the Capability: Rigidity Paradox in New Product Innovation|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30166552|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=69|issue=4|pages=61–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that the "ambidextrous organization" does not solve the tension between alignment and adaptability but allows for coping with the tension between different types of alignment in order to produce incremental and discontinuous innovation.

== Structural and behavioral mechanisms that lead to organizational ambidexterity==

Organizational ambidexterity can be considered primarily from two angles. One is architectural or structural ambidexterity, which uses dual [[organizational structure]]s and strategies to differentiate efforts towards exploitation and exploration.&lt;ref name=adler1999&gt;Adler, P., Goldoftas, B., &amp; Levine, D. (1999). Flexibility versus efficiency? A case study of model changeovers in the Toyota production system. ''Organization Science, 10'', 43-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcdonough1983&gt;McDonough, E.

L.]], &amp; O’Reilly, C. A. (1996). Ambidextrous organizations: Managing evolutionary and revolutionary change. ''California Management Review, 38'', 8-30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Structural]] ambidexterity includes dual parts, with one part focusing on exploitation and the other focusing on exploration. It's also known as the spatial separation of the dual strategies concepts outlined above. The other approach is contextual ambidexterity, which uses [[behavioral]] and [[social]] means to integrate exploitation and exploration at the organizational unit level.&lt;ref name=gibson2004&gt;Gibson, C. B., &amp; Birkinshaw, J. (2004). The antecedents, consequences and mediating role of organizational ambidexterity.  ''Academy of Management Journal, 47'', 209-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarthy2011&gt;McCarthy, I.P., &amp; Gordon, B.R. (2011).

R&amp;D Management, 41, 240-258.&lt;/ref&gt; Contextual ambidexterity is a balanced type that takes a mid-level position between exploitation and exploration, also known as parallel structures or hybrid strategies.

Although both angles are related to the theme of organizational ambidexterity, they strongly differ in the way how they are configured. There has always been a debate of which of the two different approaches is right.  The dual type allows both discrete orientations and fit across dimensions at the unit level but creates a misfit between organizational units. Some researchers argued that inconsistent structures may lead to low performance.&lt;ref name=doty1986&gt;Doty, H. D., Glick, W. H., &amp; Huber, G. P. (1993).

''Organization Studies, 7'', 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some researchers trying to investigate the external and internal [[Contingency theory|contingencies]] under which different configurations can be found. One factor would be the speed and type of [[technological change]] that organizations confront. On the other hand, the balanced type (i.e. contextual ambidexterity) is consistent with the systems approach of fit across multiple dimensions,&lt;ref name=drazin1985&gt;Drazin, R., &amp; Van de Ven, A. H. (1985). Alternative forms of fit in contingency theory. ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 30'', 514-539.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nadler1997&gt;Nadler, D., &amp; [[Tushman, M. L.]] (1997).

However, in a high-competitive environment, balanced structures may be better prepared to deal with the constant need for alignment.&lt;ref name=raisch2008/&gt; In future studies, the different organizational ambidexterity configurations can be compared to find a better solution for dealing with the exploitation and exploration paradox.

==Antecedents of organizational ambidexterity==

Ambidexterity is often considered a capacity or skill and can therefore be facilitated by either the organization as a whole or managers / [[CEO]]s.&lt;ref name=cantarello2012&gt;Cantarello, S., Martini, A., &amp; Nosella, A. (2012). A multi-level model for organizational ambidexterity in the search phase of the innovation process. ''Creativity and Innovation Management, 21'', 28-48.&lt;/ref&gt; From the structural ambidexterity's view, organizations can solve the paradox by temporarily cycling through periods of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and periods of [[exploration]].&lt;ref name=nickerson2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=brown1998&gt;Brown, S. L., &amp; Eisenhardt, K. (1998). ''Competing on the edge: Strategy as structured chaos''.

Temporarily divide to conquer: Centralized, decentralized, and reintegrated organizational approaches to exploration and adaptation.  ''Organization Science, 14'', 650-669.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=venkatraman2007&gt;Venkatraman, N., Lee, C. H., &amp; Iyer, B. (2007). ''Strategic ambidexterity and sales growth: A longitudinal test in the software sector''. Unpublished Manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; From the other point of view (contextual ambidexterity), firms ought to address exploitation and exploration simultaneously and internally to achieve the goal ambidexterity.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; Contextual ambidexterity is more difficult to achieve than structural ambidexterity because managing two inconsistent alignments within an organization simultaneously is far more complex than managing one consistent strategy after another.&lt;ref name=gupta2006&gt;Gupta, A. K., Smith, K. G., &amp; Shalley, C. E. (2006). The interplay between exploration and exploitation. ''Academy of Management Journal, 4'', 693-706.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus most studies on how to build ambidextrous organizations in literature focused on contextual ambidexterity rather than structural ambidexterity.

The role of [[leadership|leaders]] (or managers) is always highlighted towards building an ambidextrous organization. Several recommendations have been made to organizations on how to achieve contextual ambidexterity, including using of meta-routines and [[Job enrichment|job-enrichment]] schemes,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; building [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] with supervisees,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; being supportive,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; using complex behavioral repertoires,&lt;ref name=denison1995&gt;Denison, D., Hooijberg, R., &amp; Quinn, R. E. (1995). Paradox and performance: Toward a theory of behavioral complexity in managerial leadership. ''Organization Science, 6'', 524-540.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis2000&gt;Lewis, M. W. (2000). Exploring paradox: Toward a more comprehensive guide. ''Academy of Management Review, 25'', 760-776.&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of a shared vision.&lt;ref name=bartlett1989&gt;Bartlett, C. A., &amp; Ghoshal, S. (1989). ''Managing across borders: The transnational solution''. Boston: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several characteristics of [[organizational culture]] are also emphasized on building an ambidextrous organization. Successful organizations should be able to balance the hard elements ([[discipline]] and stretch) and the soft elements ([[support group|support]] and [[trust (social sciences)|trust]]) in their organizational contexts.&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; It was also suggested that establishing shared goals, developing a [[collective identity]], creating a culture of support, and giving personal meaning to individuals’ contributions to the overall purpose of an organization all contributes to ambidexterity.&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; A decentralized structure&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt; and a culture of excellence, [[recruitment]] and [[training]]&lt;ref name=bartlett1989/&gt; are also important aspects of establishing an ambidextrous organization.

== Outcomes of organizational ambidexterity==

Ambidexterity is beneficial to organizations in many aspects. As it is the ability to keep a balance between explorative and exploitative processes, the most core outcome of ambidexterity is innovation because innovation needs both explorative and exploitative aspects. [[Innovation]] is defined as "the sequence of activities by which a new element is introduced into a [[Level of analysis|social unit]], with the intention of benefiting the unit, some part of it, or the wider society" (West &amp; Farr, 1990). The new element need not be entirely novel or unfamiliar to members of the unit, but it must involve some discernible change or challenge to the [[status quo]] (West &amp; Farr, 1990).  Most theoretical models of innovation differentiate at least two processes: idea generation and idea [[implementation]] (e.g., Amabile, 1988; West, 2002). The generation phase is closely linked to explorative activities while the implementation phase is highly linked to exploitative activities. An ambidextrous organization is able to pursue innovation (creating new products/services) while also maintaining itself through the continued use of proven techniques/products.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt;

In addition, ambidexterity can promote some other positive organizational outcomes besides innovation. It has been proved in literature that the interaction between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies (in other words, ambidexterity) is positively related to sales [[Exponential growth|growth rate]], and imbalance between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is negatively related to sales growth rate (He &amp; Wong, 2004). Various organizations have been able to overcome organizational challenges and become more innovative because of ambidexterity.  A study looking at 41 businesses found that ambidexterity was highly correlated with [[performance]].&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; Similarly, another study of 34 high-tech organizations showed that their ability to simultaneously execute exploration and exploitation was associated with higher performance (Chandrasekaran et al. 2012).

Companies such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[General Radio]], [[Nordstrom]] and [[British Airways]] have all had continued success throughout the years because of their capacity for ambidexterity. From 1981 to 1986, [[British Airways]] experienced increased profits and customer satisfaction. The top executives of [[British Airways]] credited the formation of a more ambidextrous [[culture]] and [[leadership]] with the company's improved performance.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt;

==Related moderators between organizational ambidexterity and organizational outcomes==

Moderators exist in the relationship between organizational ambidexterity and organizational outcomes. Environmental [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] and [[competitiveness]] moderate the relationship between exploitation/ [[exploration]] and [[performance]] (Levinthal &amp; March, 1993; Lewin, Long &amp; Carroll, 1999). Empirical studies also showed that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit's financial performance in more competitive environments (Jansen, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2006). Although they were not directly testing an ambidextrous orientation, results indicated a positive performance effect of simultaneously pursuing exploitative and exploratory innovation under high dynamic and competitive environments. The effects of exploitative, [[exploration|explorative]] and balanced corporate alignment activities on performance were compared under varying environmental conditions (Raisch &amp; Hotz, 2008). The construct of "environmental munificence" was developed to reflect an organization's opportunities and dynamism (Zahra, 1993). They found that, although exploration was positively related to performance under high environmental munificence, a balanced orientation failed to significantly affect performance in times of low environmental munificence (Raisch &amp; Hotz, 2008).

[[Market orientation]] was also proved to moderate the relationship between exploitation/ [[exploration]] and performance. [[Market orientation]] was defined as "the capability to generate, disseminate, and respond to intelligence pertaining to current and future customers" (Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990). A longitudinal study by Kyriakopoulos and Moorman (2004) showed that market orientation positively moderates the impact of pursuing high levels of exploitative and exploratory marketing strategies on new product performance; however, firms that pursue an ambidextrous orientation without strong market orientation display a significant reduction in new product financial performance.

Another factor that may moderate ambidexterity's effect on performance is firm [[resource]]s (Kyriakopoulos &amp; Moorman, 2004).&lt;ref name=venkatraman2007/&gt; Firms with rich resources have the ability to exploit and explore simultaneously, whereas firms with less resources may not be able to afford such a complex strategy. Similarly, Lubatkin et al.&lt;ref name=lubatkin2006/&gt; stated that small firms "lack the amount of slack resources and the kind of [[hierarchical]] administration systems that can help or impede larger firms in managing their contradictory knowledge processes and, thus, affect the attainment of ambidexterity" (p.&amp;nbsp;647). This idea was supported by empirical evidence that small firms may benefit more from a one-sided orientation than from mixed strategies (Ebben &amp; Johnson, 2005).

Boundary conditions were also addressed on choosing between [[structural]] and contextual ambidexterity. For example, spatial separation was suggested as an appropriate solution for environments characterized by long periods of stability, disrupted by rare events of discontinuous change.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt; Research also found that firms operating in dynamic competitive environments rely on contextual ambidexterity rather than developing spatially separated units (Jansen, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2005).

== Levels of ambidexterity ==

The functional definition of ambidexterity was originally used to describe organizations, but recently this concept was extended to multiple organizational levels, including individuals, teams, and leaders. On the most general level, the concept of ambidexterity implies successfully managing the [[dichotomy]] of explorative variability creation and exploitative variability reduction.

Whenever there are needs to be both explorative and exploitive, [[conflict (process)|conflict]] occurs (Bledow, Frese, Anderson, Erez, &amp; Farr, 2009). That's when ambidexterity is necessary. Actually, regulating the conflicting demands of innovation is not only a challenge for the upper echelon of an organization but also a phenomenon that spans all levels of an organization. Employees as individuals, collectives of employees such as work teams, and the organization as a whole all have to find strategies to deal with conflicting demands in order to succeed in innovation and adaption to changing markets. Some examples of strategies and tactics that could be implemented at all three levels of analysis were also listed out (Bledow et al., 2009). These examples are presented in Table 1, including a separation strategy (in the Separation column) or an integration strategy (in the last two columns).

== Ambidextrous leadership ==

Recently the focus on organizational ambidexterity has become more concentrated on how leaders act ambidextrously to achieve organizational ambidexterity. Senior managers may be the key for facilitating the context and social base for ambidexterity. Noting that ambidextrous organizations require significant amounts of mobilization, coordination, and integration activities to maintain both exploitation and exploration, informal and social integration of the senior team as well as the cross-functional interfaces of the formal organization contribute to the success of organizational ambidexterity significantly (Jansen, Tempelaar, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2009). A recent model of ambidexterity and leadership suggests that [[CEO]]s and top management teams (TMT) play an integral role in establishing ambidexterity in small-to-medium-sized organizations (Cao, Simsek, &amp; Zhang, 2010). The model suggests TMTs are where processes such as information sharing and knowledge processing, which influence ambidexterity, are likely to occur. Furthermore, it is the CEO who has the ability to access the most valuable and diverse information needed to avoid separation of explorative and exploitative behaviors. The greater the interface between TMTs and CEOs in small-to-medium-sized organizations, the greater the amount of ambidexterity.

The concept of ambidexterity was first formally introduced into the leadership area by the Rosing, Frese and Bausch (2011) paper, holding the idea that leaders should be able to lead their team to match the complexity and the pace of innovation (Ancona, Goodman, Lawrence, &amp; Tushman, 2001). Ambidextrous leadership was defined as the leaders’ ability to foster both explorative and exploitative behaviors in followers by increasing or reducing variance in their behavior and flexibly switching between those behaviors (Rosing et al., 2011).

The construct of ambidextrous leadership has also been linked to the combination of [[leadership styles]] (Jansen et al., 2009). Leaders who are transformational encourage "out of the box thinking", information sharing and question assumptions.[[Transformational leadership|Transformational leaders]] promote exploration and innovative thinking. [[Transactional leadership|Transactional leaders]] focus on making incremental improvements and making the best use of existing process. The transactional leadership style promotes exploitative behaviors. An ambidextrous leader is able to switch back and forth between transformation/exploration and transaction/exploitation as needed, in other words, being able to switch between different leadership styles at the appropriate time, in order to foster innovation and then implement plans. Ambidextrous leadership consists of three elements (1) opening leader behaviors to foster exploration, (2) closing leader behaviors to foster exploitation, (3) and the temporal flexibility to switch between both as the situation requires (Rosing et al., 2011). Opening leadership behaviors include: allowing for multiple ways to accomplish a task, experimentation and errors, whereas closing behaviors include; monitoring routines, sticking to plans and minimizing errors. The Rosing et al. (2011)'s model of leadership and innovation was shown in Figure 1.

==Controversy and future directions==

Some scholars as well as practitioners have argued that established companies simply lack the flexibility to explore new territories.&lt;ref name=lewis2000/&gt; One contributing reason could be the so-called [[success trap]] (i.e. the focus on their, historically successful, current business activities) (Walrave, Van Oorschot, &amp; Romme, 2011). A possible solution for big companies is to adopt a venture capital model – funding exploratory expeditions but otherwise not interfering too much with their operations. Another suggestion is for the use of [[cross-functional team]]s to achieve breakthrough innovations. Still others have suggested that a company may be able to alternate between different organizational models, focusing on exploitation and [[exploration]] at different time periods. For example, in a study of biotechnology firms it is shown how an organization's [[management control system]] can be adjusted periodically to achieve this changing focus on exploitation and exploration.&lt;ref name="mccarthy2011"/&gt; Researchers also debate if [[ambidexterity]] can be attained because [[exploration]] and exploitation tend to emerge from contradictory information and knowledge inputs and because success due to [[exploration]]/exploitation tends to be self-reinforcing leading to the use of the same methods in the future.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=floyd2000&gt;Floyd, S. W. &amp; Lane, P. J. (2000). "Strategizing throughout the Organization: Managing Role Conflict in Strategic Renewal". ''The Academy of Management Review, 25'', 154-177.&lt;/ref&gt; An empirical study of [[ambidexterity]] in organizations (He &amp; Wong, 2004) further cautions that very low levels of both [[exploration]] and exploitation are not sufficient to contribute to superior firm performance. High firm performance may however need to be sustained through continuous exploitation both on the market side, through [[business model]] innovation and technology innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaulio|first=Matti|last2=Thorén|first2=Kent|last3=Rohrbeck|first3=René|date=2017-12-01|title=Double ambidexterity: How a Telco incumbent used business-model and technology innovations to successfully respond to three major disruptions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/caim.12246/abstract|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=339–352|doi=10.1111/caim.12246|issn=1467-8691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambidexterity can also be hampered by employee desire to receive [[work motivation|organizational rewards]]. If organizations base their evaluation and [[reward system]]s on the completion of routine tasks, employees will be more likely to conform to standardized procedures.&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; To avoid hindering ambidexterity, organizations should be sure to reward innovative thinking as well as completion of routine tasks.

Despite the controversy surrounding the possibility of organizational ambidexterity, it is likely to continue to be a highly researched concept in the future. Future research is likely to focus on the role of ambidextrous leaders, ambidextrous teams and the [[Social environment|social context]] of organizational ambidexterity. (Rosing et al., 2011).

The '''Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy''' (also known as the '''circular transactions controversy''') began in Dublin in December 2008 when [[Seán FitzPatrick]], the chairman of [[Anglo Irish Bank]] (the state's third-largest bank), admitted he had hidden a total of [[Euro|€]]87 million in loans from the bank, triggering a series of incidents which led to the eventual [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of Anglo on 21 January 2009. FitzPatrick subsequently resigned his position and was followed within twenty-four hours by the bank's non-executive director, [[Lar Bradshaw]] and chief executive, [[David Drumm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/anglo-business.html|title=Drumm quits Anglo in loans fall-out|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new chairman of Anglo, [[Donal O'Connor]], was quickly appointed from the board, a move welcomed by the Irish [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]], [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]]. A number of investigations have been launched into the reasons behind the three resignations. The [[Central Bank of Ireland]] is carrying out a review of the bank's dealings, although its [[Financial Regulator]], [[Patrick Neary]], has also since resigned his position. So too did a number of other chairmen, directors and executives involved with Anglo, [[Irish Life and Permanent]] and [[Irish Nationwide]].

Within days of the initial admission, an announcement was made that Anglo Irish Bank would be one of three (alongside [[Allied Irish Bank]] and [[Bank of Ireland]]) that would be recapitalised by the [[Irish government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/bank.html|title=Bank move a good deal for taxpayers: Lenihan|date=22 December 2008|accessdate=22 December 2008|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222215745/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/bank.html|archivedate= 22 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was expected to be effected in mid-January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialregulator.ie/frame_main.asp?pg=%2Fnews%2Fnw%5Farticle%2Easp%3Fid%3D440&amp;nv=%2Fnews%2Fnw%5Fnav%2Easp |title=Bank Government Announcement on Recapitalisation |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |publisher=[[Financial Regulator]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129125817/http://www.financialregulator.ie/frame_main.asp?pg=%2Fnews%2Fnw_article.asp%3Fid%3D440&amp;nv=%2Fnews%2Fnw_nav.asp |archivedate=29 January 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; following an [[Extraordinary General Meeting]] (EGM). Lenihan instead unexpectedly announced the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank the night before the EGM due to difficulties he encountered with the recapitalisation process. Recapitalisations of the other two banks mentioned were expected by the end of March 2009 but, according to [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]], were expected to be finalised in early February 2009 at a total of €7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0207/economy.html|title=Bank recapitalisation finalised soon - Cowen|date=7 February 2009|accessdate=7 February 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208193317/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0207/economy.html|archivedate=8 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank on 21 January 2009 followed two more resignations earlier that month. On 7 January 2009, another director, [[Willie McAteer]], resigned, becoming the fourth casualty of the controversy. Two days later the Financial Regulator Patrick Neary retired amidst much criticism over his handling of the affair. After the nationalisation, the Chairman of Irish Nationwide, Dr Michael Walsh, resigned on 17 February, one week to the day that government-appointed directors announced they were investigating a deposit of billions of euro by Irish Life and Permanent, placed in Anglo Irish Bank before the end of its financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0210/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo directors probe 'billions' deposit|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=10 February 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoiseach Brian Cowen denied claims that he was protecting a "[[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy#The "Golden Circle"|Golden Circle]]" of wealthy financiers from being identified. This mysterious group of ten businessmen is said{{By whom|date=March 2011}} to have received loans from Anglo Irish Bank in return for buying shares, in a move designed to keep the bank afloat.

==Background==
Starting in 1986, Seán "Seanie" FitzPatrick spent eighteen years as chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, during which time the bank grew from a small operator into the third-largest bank in Ireland. When he became the bank's chairman in 2005, handing over the position of chief executive to David Drumm, the bank was recording annual profits of over €500 million. The Anglo share price peaked at €17.60 in May 2007, an increase from under €1 ten years previously. Anglo was valued at nearly €13 billion and FitzPatrick's 4.5 million Anglo shares were worth nearly €80 million at this time. Prior to FitzPatrick's resignation, the Anglo share price had already dropped to €0.32, a drop of 98% with the entire bank valued at a low €242 million and FitzPatrick's stake reduced to €1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/seanie-turned-a-struggling-minnow-into-a-banking-giant-1580520.html|title='Seanie' turned a struggling minnow into a banking giant|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Financial Regulator first uncovered the €87 million loans in January 2008 when inspectors from the regulator's offices carried out an inspection into the loan book of rival lender, [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]]. The inspectors noticed that a large loan was provided to FitzPatrick at Anglo Irish Bank and later repaid. The Regulator discovered at a later date that similar loans were provided to FitzPatrick in September 2008 and repaid by him in October 2008. When the issue was raised with Anglo Irish Bank it was discovered that there were further loans between the two banks over an extended period of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1220/1229725700584.html|title=Regulator stumbled on loans during inspection of rival bank's books|date=20 December 2008|accessdate=20 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain which officials, if any, within the bank knew about the loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1220/1229725700319.html?via=rel|title=Anglo stays silent over who knew of loans|date=20 December 2008|accessdate=20 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Anglo annual report contained a note displaying the total loans given to directors of the bank. This total was measured at a single point in time. In the case of Anglo this occurred on 30 September. FitzPatrick, instead of revealing the true figures of his loans, transferred some of them to [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]], returning them to Anglo at a later date. He acted in a manner that thwarted transparency of Anglo's loan book. Financial authorities investigated if there were breaches of corporate governance. The Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator said that "a lay person would expect that issues of this nature and this magnitude would have been picked up" by the external auditors, [[Ernst &amp; Young]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0114/1231738222989.html FitzPatrick Anglo loans were more than €87m]&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving legal advice Ernst &amp; Young declined to appear before a parliamentary committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0202/anglo-business.html|work=RTÉ News|title=Anglo auditors won't be at committee|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This in turn led to inaccurate figures for the total directors' loans given for eight consecutive years in the end of year Anglo accounts. 2008 was the first occasion on which FitzPatrick revealed his true figure, that of €87 million or twice the total of the other twelve directors' loan figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/why-directors-loans-fell-below-the-radar-1580570.html|title=Why directors' loans fell below the radar|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|first=Maeve|last=Dineen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation was described as Ireland's version of [[Enron]], the American energy company which went bankrupt in 2001, and it was said that the principals would have been immediately arrested if this had occurred in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/financial-crisis/if-fitzpatrick-lived-in-new-york-hed---have-been-arrested-1605179.html If FitzPatrick lived in New York, he'd have been arrested]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resignations ==

=== Anglo Irish Bank ===
FitzPatrick issued a statement on the evening of 18 December 2008, linking his resignation with a €87 million loan he had from the bank. Ireland's Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan welcomed the appointment of a new chairman, Donal O'Connor, an official with a substantial commercial track record, saying he "seems a natural choice" for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1218/fitzpatricks.html|title=Chairman of Anglo Irish Bank resigns|date=18 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220080431/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1218/fitzpatricks.html|archivedate=20 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzPatrick's resignation came little over two months after he had admitted that his former bank had made mistakes but insisted it had not been "reckless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1004/bank.html|title=Mistakes made says Anglo Irish Bank chairman|date=4 October 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081223092341/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1004/bank.html|archivedate=23 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside FitzPatrick's resignation came that of Bradshaw who had held a loan jointly with FitzPatrick, a loan that was temporarily transferred to another bank prior to a year end audit without the knowledge of Bradshaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/anglo-chief-quits-after-hiding-euro87m--bank-loans-1580513.html|title=Anglo chief quits after hiding €87m bank loans|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=Irish Independent|first1=Maeve|last1=Dineen|first2=Brendan|last2=Keenan|first3=John|last3=Mulligan}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of 19 December, Drumm announced he would step down with immediate effect, but said he will continue to work with the chairman through a transition phase until a replacement chief executive is agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/angloirish.html|title=Anglo Irish chief third to resign|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221123534/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/angloirish.html|archivedate=21 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is appropriate for me to step down today given last evening's announcement in relation to the resignation of Seán FitzPatrick and given the strong statement of support for the Bank and its recapitalisation programme by the Minister for Finance. Good progress is being made on the recapitalisation. It is undoubtedly in the best interests of Anglo that a new Chief Executive is appointed to lead the Bank through its next phase of development. The appointment of Donal O'Connor as Chairman together with a new Chief Executive augurs well for the Bank and for all its stakeholders. It gives the Bank fresh impetus and an upward trajectory. I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their intense commitment and honest endeavour and for their friendship over the last 15 years.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1219/breaking45.html?via=rel|title=Anglo Irish Bank statement on Drumm resignation|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''The Irish Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 7 January 2009, Willie McAteer resigned his position as finance director and chief risk officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0107/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo Irish loses another director|date=7 January 2009|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2009 the Government of Ireland nationalised&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/taxpayer-is-picking-up--ailing-anglo-irish-bank-1603950.html Taxpayer is picking up ailing Anglo Irish Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/what-the-implications-are-for-savers-and-investors-as-state-takes-over-anglo-1603883.html What the implications are for savers and investors as State takes over Anglo]&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo Irish Bank and its shares were suspended on the Dublin and London Stock Exchanges.

On 19 January 2009, the balance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0119/breaking19.html Anglo Irish directors step down, bank downgraded]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Board, who had served while FitzPatrick was chairman, resigned.

===Financial Regulator===
Following reports of a communication breakdown at the office of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the [[Financial Regulator]] Patrick Neary on 9 January 2009 announced his decision to retire as of 31 January that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0109/nearyp.html|title=Neary to retire as Financial Regulator|date=9 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111100225/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0109/nearyp.html|archivedate= 11 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neary's weakness in dealing with the issue has received much criticism, with [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] Senator [[Dan Boyle (politician)|Dan Boyle]] calling for a strengthening of powers within the organisation and saying that confidence in Irish financial services had been eroded by events of the previous six months. Financial observers indicated that a replacement for Neary might have to be located in the United States or in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0110/finance.html|title=Greens call for stronger finance regulator|date=10 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110204138/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0110/finance.html| archivedate=10 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also reports that the Financial Regulator may have known of the loans for eight years prior to their revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0124/1232474679328.html?via=mr|title=Regulator may have known of loans to FitzPatrick for eight years|date=24 January 2009|accessdate=24 January 2009|publisher=''The Irish Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton called for the board and senior management of the Financial Regulator to be sacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0222/breaking46.htm|work=The Irish Times|title=Financial Regulator board should be sacked|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Regulator hired a partner from Ernst &amp; Young, to advise on the €440 billion bank guarantee scheme in January 2009, despite the fact that serious questions have been asked about why Ernst &amp; Young did not spot the massive loans that former chief executive Seán FitzPatrick concealed from his shareholders for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/01/18/story38836.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914154355/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/01/18/story38836.asp |archivedate=14 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consultants [[Mazars]], which reviewed their operations said "that regulatory expertise was lacking in some areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/top-watchdog-job-to-be-split-three-ways-in-regulatory-overhaul-1793401.html|work=Irish Independent|first=Joe|last=Brennan|title=Top watchdog job to be split three ways in regulatory overhaul|date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish Nationwide===
On the evening of 17 February 2009, the Chairman of the building society [[Irish Nationwide]], Dr Michael Walsh, resigned his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/irishnationwide.html|title=Irish Nationwide Chairman resigns|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=17 February 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219161741/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/irishnationwide.html|archivedate=19 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish Stock Exchange===
On 23 February 2009, the former Anglo Irish Bank director Anne Heraty unexpectedly resigned from the board of the [[Irish Stock Exchange|ISEQ]].&lt;ref name="Anglo Irish Bank offices were searched"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0224/angloirish.html|title=Anglo Irish Bank offices were searched|date=24 February 2009|accessdate=24 February 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226193252/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0224/angloirish.html|archivedate=26 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following morning, Dublin's ISEQ index fell over 3% to stand at 1,987, a 14-year low.&lt;ref name="ISEQ falls to 14-year low"/&gt; The last time it stood under the 2,000 level was the middle of 1995.&lt;ref name="ISEQ falls to 14-year low"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0224/markets.html|title=ISEQ falls to 14-year low|date=24 February 2009|accessdate=24 February 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225033929/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0224/markets.html|archivedate=25 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dublin Airport Authority===
On the evening of 24 February 2009, the chairman of the [[Dublin Airport Authority]] (DAA), [[Gary McGann]], announced his decision to step down from the board, stating that his decision had been influenced by his former non-executive directorship of Anglo Irish Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0224/breaking76.htm|title=McGann steps down as chairman of DAA|date=24 February 2009|accessdate=24 February 2009|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome and nationalisation==
Anglo Irish Bank has said it would review its policy on directors' loans following FitzPatrick's resignation. The [[Financial Regulator]] announced he would be examining the loans issued by Anglo Irish Bank to all its directors, claiming he became aware of the existence of the loans "following an inspection earlier this year". Ultimately he became a victim of the controversy and subsequently announced his retirement.

The [[Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board]] (CARB) undertook an investigation into the "circumstances around the issue of inappropriate directors' loans at Anglo Irish"and into the performance of Ernst and Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carb.ie/uploads/John%20Purcell%20Appointment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317220157/http://www.carb.ie/uploads/John%20Purcell%20Appointment.pdf |archivedate=17 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Association of Investment Managers]] expressed how it was "surprised and disappointed" at the controversy and announced it would be writing to Anglo's new chairman to describe its worries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1219/breaking13.html?via=mr|title=Drumm resigns as chief executive of Anglo Irish|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
{{further|Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009}}
Emergency legislation to nationalise the bank, titled the [[Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009]], was voted through [[Dáil Éireann]], being approved by 79 &amp;ndash; 67 before passing in [[Seanad Éireann]] without a vote on 20 January 2009. During the Seanad's debate on the bill, Senator [[Shane Ross]] claimed that "no-one was being told the truth about Anglo Irish Bank" and called the EGM of the previous Friday "a disgrace show[ing] corporate Ireland at its worst, as there were no answers to any questions". Senator [[Joe O'Toole]] advocated the chasing of those responsible for the bank's nationalisation "even into the courts", saying that a person could be imprisoned for failure to pay a household bill, yet those who caused the loss of jobs and pensions might not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0120/angloirish.html|title=Dáil votes to nationalise Anglo Irish|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203113936/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0120/angloirish.html|archivedate=3 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Mary McAleese then signed the Anglo Irish Bank Bill at Áras an Uachtaráin the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0121/angloirish.html|title=McAleese signs Anglo Irish Bank Bill|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090124000047/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0121/angloirish.html|archivedate=24 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discussion ===
The bank's internal auditors appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs on 3 February 2009 to discuss the nationalisation of [[Anglo Irish Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0129/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo Irish auditors to be questioned|date=2009-01-29|accessdate=2009-02-05|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank's head of internal audit, Walter Tyrrell, told the Oireachtas committee that the movement of loans by Seán FitzPatrick into the bank and back out again could only have been known by FitzPatrick himself and the executive of his account, claiming that loans were tested by means of random sampling and that FitzPatrick's loans had not once been selected - however one loan he held with a partner was chosen. Fine Gael's [[Kieran O'Donnell]] expressed his amazement that each of the directors' loans were not tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0203/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo director loans 'tested randomly'|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-02-05|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2009, Lenihan revealed plans under which €3.5 billion ($4.5 billion, £3.1 billion) each would be provided by the government's purchase of [[Option (finance)#Long call|options]] intended to re-capitalise Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7884925.stm|title=Rescue plan for Ireland's banks|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2009-02-12|publisher=[[BBC]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090213134314/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7884925.stm| archivedate= 13 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

=== Review ===
The Financial Regulator, on the recommendation of the Irish Finance Minister, ordered an "urgent review" of directors' loans at Anglo Irish Bank, saying it has a "very serious view" of the issue. It claimed the loans were "first brought to its attention on December 17th 2008" and that a committee had been established to investigate the matter. Irish [[Minister for Social Protection|Minister for Social and Family Affairs]] [[Mary Hanafin]] said the Financial Regulator had "serious questions" to answer over its supposed lack of knowledge of the loans and the Irish [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] [[John Gormley]] asked the Financial Regulator to explain what he termed "extraordinary complacency" in relation to the situation at Anglo Irish Bank. The opposition party [[Fine Gael]]'s deputy leader and finance representative [[Richard Bruton]] quizzed the Minister for Finance on his announcement that he would provide the necessary capital to Anglo Irish Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1220/breaking24.htm|title=IFSRA board orders urgent review into Anglo loans|date=2008-12-20|accessdate=2008-12-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further Hidden Loans (Deposits) Controversy Involving Irish Life &amp; Permanent ===
On 12 February 2009, details of a further controversial transaction which had the effect of misrepresenting the end-of-year accounts of Anglo-Irish Bank came into the public domain. Anglo-Irish Bank lent €4bn to Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P) for 1 day by way of inter-bank loan, and a subsidiary of Irish Life placed a deposit of a similar amount with Anglo, which was recorded as a customer deposit.  Following a discussion with the Minister for Finance, a board meeting of IL&amp;P accepted the resignation of two senior IL&amp;P executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0213/breaking12.html?via=rel|title=Statement by Irish Life &amp; Permanent|date=2009-02-13|accessdate=2009-02-13|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Golden Circle" ===
On 17 February, Taoiseach Brian Cowen informed Dáil Éireann of his knowledge of a group of ten wealthy businessmen who had come together to buy shares in Anglo Irish Bank in 2008 in a transaction which is now at the centre of an investigation by the Office of Corporate Enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/angloirish.html|title=Anglo share purchases raised in Dáil|date=2009-02-17|accessdate=2009-02-18|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090218130912/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/angloirish.html| archivedate= 18 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowen has since denied suggestions put forth by the Opposition that he was attempting to protect anyone involved in this so-called "Golden Circle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0218/banks.html|title='Golden Circle' dominates Dáil proceedings|date=2009-02-18|accessdate=2009-02-18|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219201336/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0218/banks.html| archivedate= 19 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mystery has been discussed in Dáil Éireann since its revelation, with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] leader [[John Gormley]] calling for the names to be made public if a legal way of doing so could be found.&lt;ref name="Golden Circle names should be public - Gormley"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0219/angloirish.html|title=Golden Circle names should be public - Gormley|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2009-02-19|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221035523/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0219/angloirish.html| archivedate= 21 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo Irish Bank's annual report alongside the PricewaterhouseCooper report on the bank were both published on 20 February but [[Tánaiste]] [[Mary Coughlan (politician)|Mary Coughlan]] stated beforehand that the ten would not be named in either report.&lt;ref name="Golden Circle names should be public - Gormley"/&gt; The Anglo report revealed that the bank lent €451 million to the ten "Golden Circle" clients, a 50% increase on previous estimates of €300 million.&lt;ref name="Anglo loaned €451m to 10 clients to buy bank shares"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0220/breaking14.html?via=mr|title=Anglo loaned €451m to 10 clients to buy bank shares|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2009-02-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same evening, Brian Lenihan also issued a statement containing extracts from the report carried out by PricewaterhouseCooper for the Financial Regulator.&lt;ref name="Lenihan statement on the PWC report"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0220/breaking86.htm|title=Lenihan statement on the PWC report|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2009-02-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The morning before its publication, [[Ulick McEvaddy]] appeared on [[RTÉ Radio 1]] alongside the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]]'s [[Joe Higgins]], where he stated that the ten were "heroes" in his opinion (Joe Higgins disagreed).&lt;ref name="McEvaddy praises Golden Circle 'heroes'"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0220/banks.html |title=McEvaddy praises Golden Circle 'heroes' |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2009-02-20 |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224073335/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0220/banks.html |archivedate=24 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McEvaddy defends Anglo Irish investor 'heroes'"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0220/breaking43.htm|title=McEvaddy defends Anglo Irish investor 'heroes'|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2009-02-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' published the names of four of the Golden Circle members on 22 February.&lt;ref name="Four 'Golden Circle' named by newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0222/anglo.html|title=Four 'Golden Circle' named by newspaper|date=2009-02-22|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226105556/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0222/anglo.html| archivedate= 26 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four members of the elite are [[Gerry Gannon]], [[Joe O'Reilly (builder)|Joe O'Reilly]], Seamus Ross and [[Jerry Conlan]].

'''Barry Cohen''' [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (3 April 1935 – 18 December 2017) was an Australian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] politician.  He was a minister in the government of [[Bob Hawke]].

==Biography==
Cohen was born in [[Griffith, New South Wales]] and educated at Griffith High School, [[Sydney Grammar School]] and [[North Sydney Technical High School]]. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the [[Australian National University]]. He was a businessman before entering politics.

He was the federal member for the seat of [[Division of Robertson|Robertson]] from [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969]] until his retirement before the [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 election]]. Following the [[Australian Labor Party]]'s win under [[Bob Hawke]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]], he was Minister for [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Home Affairs]] and [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|the Environment]] from 1983 to 1984 and then [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Environment]] until 1987.&lt;ref name=aph&gt;{{cite web

In 2015, Cohen and three other former MPs brought a case before the [[High Court of Australia]], purporting that reductions to their retirement allowances and limitations on the number of "domestic return trips per year" under the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 were unconstitutional under S51(xxxi) of the [[Constitution of Australia]]. They lost the case in 2016, with the court finding that Parliament was entitled to vary the terms of allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Former MPs lose High Court challenge over entitlements | date=12 Oct 2016 | publisher=ABC News | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-12/high-court-rules-on-entitlements-gold-pass/7924916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ball State University]] '''''Center for Business and Economic Research (CBER)''''', formerly the Bureau of Business Research, is an economic policy and forecasting research center housed within the [[Miller College of Business]] at [[Ball State University]] in [[Muncie, Indiana]], USA. CBER research encompasses health care, public finance, regional economics, transportation, and energy sector studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CentersandInstitutes/BBR.aspx |title=Center for Business and Economic Research, Ball State University - Ball State University |publisher=Cms.bsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to research, CBER serves as the forecasting element in the [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]] area – hosting five state and federal economic forecasting roundtables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CentersandInstitutes/BBR/Forecasts/BSUForecastingRoundtable.aspx|title=Search Results: academics centersandinstitutes bbr forecasts bsuforecastingroundtable|work=bsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Center for Business and Economic Research was founded the late 1960s as the Bureau of Business Research at Ball State University. The founding was initiated by Dr. Robert P. Bell soon after being hired as the first dean of the College of Business. Dr. Joseph Brown from the University of Georgia became the first director of the bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bsurentalhouses.com/about.htm |title=About Us |publisher=Bsurentalhouses.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the bureau was to look for research opportunities and provide faculty with help pursuing those opportunities. Also, focus was placed on using faculty in applied business research.&lt;ref&gt;E. Bruce Geelhoed (1990), ''The First 25 Years'', Ball State University Bureau of Business Research p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of the center has changed significantly since its inception. An official name change from the Bureau of Business Research to the Center for Business and Economic Research occurred in 2008. Currently, the center works in the community through services of economic policy research, national, state, and local forecasting, and data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CentersandInstitutes/BBR/AboutUs.aspx|title=Search Results: academics centersandinstitutes bbr aboutus|work=bsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent studies==
CBER regularly releases studies and publications on various topics including health care, public finance, regional economics, transportation, and energy.

The '''Cook–Craigie plan''' is an approach to the development process of civil and military aircraft that can dramatically reduce the time needed to bring a new design into service. In the late 1940s, USAF Major Generals [[Laurence C. Craigie]], deputy chief of staff for development, and [[Orval R. Cook]], deputy chief of staff for materiel, proposed that new designs should move directly into the production phase without the construction of prototypes.&lt;ref name="Pike"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-58-pc.htm|title = B-58 Primary Construction|accessdate = 2 July 2014|last = Pike|first = John|date = 24 July 2011| work = globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this approach has been used in an increasing number of aviation projects.

Traditional aircraft design follows a time-honored formula. After the design drawings (or "[[blueprints]]") are prepared, a small series of prototype aircraft are constructed in order to test the concept. Data from the flight tests influences the revisions that are made to the design. If these changes are wide-ranging and/or significant, more prototypes will need to be built. Once the prototype cycle is complete, the development can enter the "pre-production" stage and further evaluation. Once this stage is completed satisfactorily, series production can begin.

The Cook–Craigie plan promoted the elimination of the entire prototype cycle and entering straight into the pre-production stage. If these examples flew as expected, production could start immediately. The plan required considerable confidence in the design from the outset; if the design had an inherent flaw, the jigs used during pre-production would have to be replaced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The plan seems inherently more risky than the traditional prototype cycle, but Cook and Craigie pointed out that for the advanced designs that were entering service in the late 1940s, any prototype was likely to be so different from the production variant that any data collected could be entirely misleading.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Moreover, since several aircraft designs are typically ordered for competitive testing, the chance that all of the designs would fail is extremely low, and if even one design passes testing, it can immediately enter production.

One of the first designs to use the plan was the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]]&lt;ref name="Combat"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://airtoaircombat.com/background.asp?id=52&amp;bg=225|title = Convair F-106A Delta Dart|accessdate = 15 July 2014|last = Baugher|first = Joseph|date = 18 December 1999 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204033724/http://www.airtoaircombat.com/background.asp?id=52&amp;bg=225 |archivedate = 4 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}. Although this design had a number of new features, it was based to a large degree on the earlier [[Xf-92|XF-92]] prototype, and thus considered to be a fairly "well understood" design. This confidence proved to be misplaced, as the F-102 underwent a lengthy series of upgrades, and was eventually replaced in service by a redesigned version, the [[F-106 Delta Dart]]. Another example of the Cook–Craigie method is the development of the [[Avro CF-105 Arrow]], which passed through the testing phase with few required changes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

As the potential of [[computer-aided design]] has increased since the 1950s, aircraft designs have generally performed much closer to their original goals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For example, the production specification of the [[Boeing 777]] was within 20&amp;nbsp;lb of its predicted weight. Today the Cook–Craigie plan is so common that it no longer even has a name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6969">In [[economics]], the '''cost-of-production theory of value''' is the theory that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the [[factors of production]] (including labor, capital, or land) and [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|taxation]].

The theory makes the most sense under assumptions of [[constant returns to scale]] and the existence of just one non-produced factor of production. These are the assumptions of the so-called [[non-substitution theorem]] {{clarify|date=April 2014}}. Under these assumptions, the long-run price of a commodity is equal to the sum of the cost of the inputs into that commodity, including interest charges.

==Historical development of theory==
Historically, the best-known proponent of such theories is probably [[Adam Smith]]. [[Piero Sraffa]], in his introduction to the [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation|first volume of the "Collected Works of David Ricardo"]], referred to Smith's "adding-up" theory. Smith contrasted [[prices of production|natural prices]] with [[market price]]. Smith theorized that market prices would tend toward natural prices, where outputs would stand at what he characterized as the "level of effectual demand". At this level, Smith's natural prices of commodities are the sum of the natural rates of wages, profits, and rent that must be paid for inputs into production. (Smith is ambiguous about whether rent is price determining or price determined. The latter view is the consensus of later [[classical economics|classical economists]], with the Ricardo-Malthus-West theory of rent.)

[[David Ricardo]] mixed this cost-of-production theory of prices with the [[labor theory of value]], as that latter theory was understood by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and others. This is the theory that prices tend toward proportionality to the socially necessary labor embodied in a commodity. Ricardo sets this theory at the start of the first chapter of his ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]''. He also refutes the labor theory of value in later sections of that chapter. Taknaga advances a new interpretation that Ricardo had cost-of-production theory of value from the start and presents a more coherent interpretation based on texts of ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susumu_Takenaga?_sg=wZ0M45WMDO-NGFdnr86xTXB9yrOIWd6RUaG122hAOL8FC4cpcY59V7FV9KDk7WOStLcm8y1IxKyPo-f8wucSgQ Structure of the theory of value of David Ricardo]&lt;/ref&gt; This alleged refutation leads to what later became known as the [[transformation problem]]. [[Karl Marx]] later takes up that theory in the first volume of ''Capital'', while indicating that he is quite aware that the theory is untrue at lower levels of abstraction. This has led to all sorts of arguments over what both David Ricardo and Karl Marx "really meant". Nevertheless, it seems undeniable that all the major classical economics and Marx explicitly rejected the labor theory of price&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Donald F. Gordon, "What was the Labor Theory of Value", ''American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings'', V. 49, n. 2 (May 1959): 462–472&lt;/ref&gt;([https://www.jstor.org/stable/1816138]).

A somewhat different theory of cost-determined prices is provided by the "[[Neo-Ricardianism|neo-Ricardian School]]" [http://homepage.newschool.edu/~het/schools/neoric.htm] of [[Piero Sraffa]] and his followers. Shiozawa presented a modern interpretation of Ricardo's cost-of-production theory of value.&lt;ref&gt;Shiozawa, Y. (2016) The revival of classical theory of values, in Nobuharu Yokokawa et als. (Eds.) ''The Rejuvenation of Political Economy'', May 2016, Oxon and New York: Routledge. Chapter 8, pp.151-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish economist [[Michał Kalecki]] [http://homepage.newschool.edu/~het/profiles/kalecki.htm] distinguished between sectors with "cost-determined prices" (such as manufacturing and services) and those with "demand-determined prices" (such as agriculture and raw material extraction).

==Market price==
{{main|Market price}}
Market price is a familiar economic concept: it is the price that a good or service is offered at, or will fetch, in the marketplace. It is of interest mainly in the study of microeconomics. Market value and market price are equal only under conditions of market efficiency, equilibrium, and [[rational expectations]].

In economics, ''returns to scale'' and ''economies of scale'' are related terms that describe what happens as the scale of production increases. They are different, non-interchangeable concepts.

==Labor theory of value==
{{main|Labor theory of value}}
The labor theories of value are economic theories according to which the true values of commodities are related to the labor needed to produce them.

There are many accounts of labor value, with the common element that the "value" of an exchangeable good or service is, or ought to be, or tends to be, or can be considered as, equal or proportional to the amount of labor required to produce it (including the labor required to produce the raw materials and machinery used in production).

Different labor theories of value prevailed among classical economists through the mid-19th century. This theory is especially associated with Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Since that time, it has been most often associated with Marxian economics, while among modern mainstream economists it is considered to be superseded by the marginal utility approach.

==Taxes and subsidies==
[[File:Tax supply and demand.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|A [[supply and demand]] diagram illustrating taxes' effect on prices.]] 
{{main|Effect of taxes and subsidies on price}}
[[Tax]]es and [[subsidy|subsidies]] change the price of goods and services. A marginal tax on the sellers of a good will shift the supply curve to the left until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit tax; other things remaining equal, this will increase the [[price]] paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and decrease the price received by the sellers. Marginal subsidies on production will shift the supply curve to the right until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit subsidy; other things remaining equal, this will decrease price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and increase the price received by the producers.

The '''Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009''' is a [[U.S. federal law|federal statute]] passed by the [[United States Congress]] and signed by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] on May 22, 2009. It is comprehensive credit card reform legislation that aims "...to establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan, and for other purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr627/text|title=Text of H.R. 627 (111th)|publisher=Govtrack.us|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed with [[bipartisan]] support by both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

==Introduction and votes==
The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights was introduced in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] as {{USBill|110|H.R.|5244}} in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by Representative [[Carolyn Maloney]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] and the chair of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]]'s [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit|Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit]]. The bill had passed 312 to 112 but was never given a vote in the Senate.

In the [[111th United States Congress]], the bill was reintroduced as {{USBill|111|H.R.|627}} and on April 30, 2009, the House passed 357 yes votes to 70 no votes. The Senate followed suit and passed an amended version on May 19 with 90 yes votes and 5 no votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s2009-194 |title=H.R. 627 (111th): Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (On Passage of the Bill) |publisher=GovTrack.us |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Should note that one of the amendments was an unrelated measure to allow guns in National Parks (see section below).--&gt; The House passed the amended bill the next day by a vote of 279 to 147 and it was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on May 22, 2009.

The bill went into effect on February 22, 2010, nine months after it was enacted.

==Provisions==
The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights includes several provisions aimed at limiting how credit card companies can charge consumers but does not include [[price control]]s, rate caps, or fee settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00627:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; Public Law Summary by Congressional Research Service], THOMAS, Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

Key provisions include:
* '''Giving consumers enough time to pay their bills.''' Credit card companies have to give consumers at least 21 days to pay from the time the bill is mailed. Credit card companies can not "trap" consumers by setting payment deadlines on the weekend or in the middle of the day, or changing their payment deadlines each month. Creditors may not charge late fees if debtor shows proof of payment by close of business on the due date. If the established due date falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal banking holiday, the due date is pushed back to the next business day.
* '''No retroactive rate increases.''' Credit card companies must give consumers at least 45 days notice if their rates are about to go up, and can not change any terms of the contract within a year.  Low introductory rates must last at least six months.
* '''Easier to pay down debt.''' Credit card companies must apply payments to a consumer's highest interest rate balances first. Statements must show consumers how long it would take to pay off their existing balance if the consumer made only the minimum payment, and must show the payment amount and total interest cost to pay off the entire balance in 36 months.
* '''Eliminates "fee harvester cards."''' The act restricts fees on low-balance cards sold to cardholders with bad credit. For many of these cards, the up-front fees charged exceeded the remaining credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/march-2009/money/scams/a-credit-card-for-anyone/scams-a-credit-card-for-anyone.htm|title=Consumer Reports Magazine|website=www.consumerreports.org|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also restricts the fees that can be charged for gift cards and other prepaid cards. 
* '''Eliminates excessive marketing to young people.''' Consumers under the age of 21 must prove that they have an independent income or get a co-signer before applying for a credit card.  The Act also prevents credit card companies from mailing offers to consumers under 21 unless they "opt in," and prohibits companies from wooing students with T-shirts, free pizza and other free gifts at university-sponsored events.&lt;ref&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/fact-sheet-reforms-protect-american-credit-card-holders&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amendment on guns in national parks===
[[Gun politics in the United States|Gun rights]] advocates in the Senate, led by [[Tom Coburn]] (R-Okla) added an [[Rider (legislation)|unrelated rider]] to the bill to prevent the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] from enforcing any regulation that would prohibit an individual from possessing a firearm in any unit of the [[National Park System]] or the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-627&amp;version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:582|title=Text of H.R. 627 (111th): Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Passed Congress version) - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SP01067:|title=Amendment SA 1067 proposed by Senator Coburn to Amendment SA 1058 of HR 627|publisher=|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate passed the amendment 67-29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://washingtonindependent.com/42641/senate-approves-coburn-gun-amendment |title=Senate Approves Coburn Gun Amendment…in Credit Card Bill |last=Lillis |first=Mike |date=May 12, 2009 |work=The Washington Independent |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621182431/http://washingtonindependent.com/42641/senate-approves-coburn-gun-amendment |archivedate=June 21, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTguns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/us/politics/21cards.html|title=Bill Changing Credit Card Rules Is Sent to Obama With Gun Measure Included|first=Carl|last=Hulse|date=May 20, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=April 8, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This amendment overturns a Reagan-era policy prohibiting firearms from being carried in national parks. The [[George W. Bush]] administration had attempted to implement a similar policy through the rulemaking process just before leaving office, but the change was struck down by a federal judge. The provision has been heavily criticized by some environmentalists and [[gun control]] advocates, but it was heavily applauded by [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] groups.&lt;ref name="NYTguns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/sciencemedicine/story/C3C0BD3CE784C5E3862576D000099E0D?OpenDocument | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224061605/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/sciencemedicine/story/C3C0BD3CE784C5E3862576D000099E0D?OpenDocument | title=Law change allows guns at U.S. parks, wildlife areas | archivedate=February 24, 2010 |last=McGuire|first=Kim|date=February 20, 2010|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Warren keynote speech Feb 22 2011 on CARD Act.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Elizabeth Warren]] delivers the keynote speech entitled "The CARD Act: One Year Later" at an evaluation symposium held February 22, 2011]]
The act was not expected to affect existing credit card contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/krwg/news/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1504604&amp;sectionID=1|title=Bingaman backs Credit Card Reform|date=May 11, 2009|publisher=KRWG|accessdate=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act that was passed applies to contracts made in the past by setting an effective date of February 22, 2010, which gave banks time to prepare and notify their customers. The [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] in its October 2013 report on the CARD Act found that between  the first quarter of 2009 and December 2013,  credit card interest rates increased on average from 16.2%  to 18.5%,  while the “total cost of credit,” that is, the total of all fees and interest paid by all consumers as a percentage of the average cycle-ending balance, decreased by two hundred basis points (2.00%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201309_cfpb_card-act-report.pdf|title=CARD Act Report|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CFPB made no judgment on the extent to which the CARD Act contributed to these increases and decreases. However, interest rates on other types of consumer credit increased. The CFPB in its study also found that consumers paid less in late payment and over-the-limit fees since passage of the CARD Act. In contrast, studies by [[CardHub.com]]&lt;ref name="Card Act Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.cardhub.com/interest-rate-study-q1-2011/|title=Study: The CARD Act's Impact on Rising Interest Rates|publisher=CardHub.com|accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Center for Responsible Lending]]&lt;ref name="Responsible Lending"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsiblelending.org/credit-cards/research-analysis/FinalCRL-CARD-Clarity-Report2-16-11.pdf|title=Credit Card Clarity: CARD Act Reform Works|publisher=Center for Responsible Lending|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that interest rate trends were the result of economic pressures typical of a recession and not the law.  According to these studies, historical economic data shows that the interest rate increase and decline in available credit seen during the Great Recession should have been worse considering the widespread unemployment, credit card delinquency and credit card charge-offs.&lt;ref name="Card Act Study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Responsible Lending" /&gt;

Section 502(a) of the CARD Act requires a review of the consumer credit card market to be undertaken every two years. In February 2013 letter to the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] as part of the review, the [[American Bankers Association]] wrote that "the CARD Act has provided clear and significant benefits to consumers" but "there have also been significant tradeoffs, specifically, higher costs and less availability for credit card credit."&lt;ref name="BankersLetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aba.com/Advocacy/commentletters/Documents/clCardAct2013Feb.pdf|title=ABA Letter to CFPB re: Notice and request for information regarding the credit card market|date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bankers Association, in its letter responding to the CFPB's request for information on the impact of the act, argued that following the implementation of the CARD Act and associated regulations, "average credit card interest rates have increased and credit card credit is less available, especially to subprime borrowers" and "credit card debt has decreased at a higher rate than other consumer debt and has decreased as a percent of disposable income as non‐revolving debt as a percent of disposable income has increased."&lt;ref name="BankersLetter"/&gt;

A study published in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' in 2014 (by Neale Mahoney of the [[University of Chicago]], Sumit Agarwal of the [[National University of Singapore]], Souphala Chomsisengphet of the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] and Johannes Stroebel of the [[New York University Stern School of Business]]) found that the law was saving American consumers $11.9 billion a year, and particularly decreased costs for borrowers with poor credit.  The researchers further found "no evidence of an increase in interest charges or a reduction to access to credit."&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Norris, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/business/economy/a-credit-card-rule-that-worked-for-consumers.html Card Act Cleared Up Credit Cards' Hidden Costs], ''New York Times'' (November 7, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Agarwal, Souphala Chomsisengphet, Neale Mahoney &amp; Johannes Stroebel, [http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/11/24/qje.qju037 Regulating Consumer Financial Products: Evidence from Credit Cards], ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' (first published online November 25, 2014), [[doi: 10.1093/qje/qju037]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on the one-year anniversary of the CARD Act, then-CFPB Special Adviser [[Elizabeth Warren]] said that "much of the [credit card] industry has gone further than the law requires in curbing re-pricing and overlimit fees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1074.aspx |work=Remarks by Elizabeth Warren on The CARD Act |title=The CARD Act: One Year Later |publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury |last=Warren |first=Elizabeth |date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she said there was still much work to be done, that the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]'s "next challenges will be about further clarifying price and risks and making it easier for consumers to make direct product comparisons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/warren-praises-credit-card-industry-for-transparency-efforts-for-borrowers/ |title=Warren Praises Credit Card Industry for Transparency Efforts for Borrowers |last=Saenz |first=Arlette |date=February 22, 2011 |work=ABC News |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/22/financial-regulation-cards-idUSN2229340420110222 |title=Credit cards still in US watchdog Warren's sights |work=Reuters |date=February 22, 2011 |last1=Clarke |first1=Dave |last2=Aspan |first2=Maria |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/18/elizabeth-warren-shortcom_n_467295.html |title=Elizabeth Warren: Shortcomings Of Credit Card Reform Show Need For CFPA |last=Delaney |first=Arthur |work=Huffington Post |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, many stay-at-home spouses complained that because they have no individual income, the act prevented them from acquiring credit cards without their husbands' permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/16/pf/credit-cards-stay-at-home-moms/ |title=Stay-at-home mom fights new credit card rule |last=Ellis|first=Blake |work=CNN Money |date=May 16, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, 2013, the CFPB amended regulations to allow credit card issuers to consider third-party income for applicants who are 21 or older, if the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/the-cfpb-amends-card-act-rule-to-make-it-easier-for-stay-at-home-spouses-and-partners-to-get-credit-cards/|title=The CFPB Amends Card Act Rule to Make it Easier for Stay-at-Home Spouses and Partners to Get Credit Cards|date=April 29, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cutoff period''' is a term in [[finance]]. In [[capital budgeting]], it is the period (usually in years) below which a project's [[payback period]] must fall in order to accept the project.
Generally it is the time period in which a project gives its investment back if a project fails to do so the project will be rejected.

For example a project has the following inflows
years              Inflows respectively
1                   100,000
2                   150,000   
3                   200,000

If the project's payback is 2 years having an outflow of 250,000 the cut off period must be 2 years otherwise the project will be rejected.

'''Downtown Columbus, Georgia''', also called "'''Uptown'''" (see [[Downtown Columbus, Georgia#"Downtown"/"Uptown"|here]]), is the [[central business district]] of the city of [[Columbus, Georgia]]. The commercial and governmental heart of the city has traditionally been toward the eastern end of Downtown Columbus, between 10th Street and 1st Avenue. Recent developments, particularly between Broadway and 2nd Avenue, have expanded the boundaries of the "central" part of the neighborhood. The term "Downtown Columbus" can also mean this smaller, more commercial area, particularly when used in the context of the city's nightlife and restaurants

South of Broadway is a much more residential area, characterized by historic homes, new infill construction, and some public housing. This part of Downtown Columbus has the highest concentration of hotels, particularly along Front Avenue, and the Broadway commercial corridor is the center of business.

[[File:Downtown columbus, georgia 1880.jpg|thumb|250px|Downtown in 1880, showing the [[Church of the Holy Family (Columbus, Georgia)|Church of the Holy Family]] (image by [[Theodore R. Davis]])]]
Downtown consists of many places to worship, such as historic [[Church of the Holy Family (Columbus, Georgia)|Church of the Holy Family]], Columbus' first [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] parish.

==Transportation==
There are many modes of transportation in Downtown Columbus that can be used by both tourists and residents. [[METRA Transit System]] operates bus service in downtown, which connects riders to other places in the city. The primary way of getting around downtown for many people is by car. Downtown Columbus is accessible from [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|Interstate 185]] by J. R. Allen Parkway, which allows direct travel into the area via 2nd Avenue. Downtown is also served by two [[arterial road]]s, [[U.S. Route 27 in Georgia|Veterans Parkway]] (north–south) and [[U.S. Route 280|Victory Drive]] (east–west).

=="Downtown"/"Uptown"==
There is confusion brought about by the use of the terms "Downtown" and "Uptown" for Columbus' central business district.  Uptown Columbus is the title given to both a non-profit organization operating to encourage area growth and development (sometimes called "urban renewal") and also to the actual physical area of that development itself, which is an expanding subsection of the Downtown district located in the areas from Broadway to the Chattahoochee River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uptowncolumbusga.com/plaintext/about/about.aspx Uptown Columbus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tornado==
On April 20, 2009, at approximately 12:40 AM [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Daylight Time]], a category [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF2]] [[tornado]] hit downtown with winds up to 135 miles per hour (217&amp;nbsp;km/h). This tornado caused damage to the Columbus State University Campus, the Springer Opera House, and the RiverCenter for the Performing Arts. This is the first time a tornado touched ground in downtown Columbus since weather records keeping began in the 1890s. While there were dozens of injuries, there were no fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120907045302/http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/breaking_news/story/694501.html Tornado tears through Downtown]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eliyahu Moshe Goldratt''' (March 31, 1947 – June 11, 2011) was an Israeli business management guru.&lt;ref&gt;McClenahen, John S: [http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=11477 "Manufacturing's Influential Thinkers &amp; Doers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608170929/http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=11477 |date=2008-06-08 }} Retrieved on: October 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Tales out of business school." ''The Economist.'' (January 21, 1995).  334 (7898), 63&lt;/ref&gt; He was the originator of the Optimized Production Technique, the [[Theory of Constraints]] (TOC), the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]], Drum-Buffer-Rope, [[Critical Chain Project Management]] (CCPM) and other TOC derived tools.

He was the author of several [[business fable|business novels]] and non-fiction works, mainly on the application of the theory of constraints to various manufacturing, engineering, and other business processes.

The processes are typically modeled as resource flows, the constraints typically represent limits on flows. In his book &lt;cite&gt;''[[The Goal]]''&lt;/cite&gt;, the protagonist is a manager in charge of a troubled manufacturing operation. At any point in time, one particular constraint (such as inadequate capacity at a machine tool) limits total system throughput, and when the constraint is resolved, another constraint becomes the critical one.  The plot of Goldratt's stories revolve around identifying the current limiting constraint and raising it, which is followed by finding out which is the next limiting constraint. Another common theme is that the system being analyzed has excess capacity at a number of non-critical points, which, contrary to conventional wisdom, is absolutely essential to ensure constant operation of the constrained resource.

==Life==
[[File:Eliyahu M. Goldratt grave 2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Eliyahu M. Goldratt's grave]]
Goldratt was born into a rabbinic family, the son of [[Avraham-Yehuda Goldrat]], in British Mandatory Palestine one year prior to Israel's modern statehood. He obtained BSc degree from [[Tel Aviv University; Israel]], and MSc and PhD degrees from [[Bar-Ilan University; Israel]]. Goldratt died June 11, 2011 at noon, in his home in Israel. &lt;ref&gt;"Eliyahu M.

Retrieved June 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Creative Output years===

After some experience helping Israeli manufacturers, Goldratt left the academic world to join a company called Creative Output. The company developed and sold a software package, the Optimized Production Technology (OPT). OPT was billed as the first software to provide finite capacity scheduling for production environments. This software and the principles behind it were analyzed by a number of major publications&lt;ref&gt;G. Bylinsky. &lt;cite&gt;''An Efficiency guru with a brown box''&lt;/cite&gt;. Fortune; 120 (September 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldratt was actively involved in many controversies such as Cost Accounting v Throughput Accounting&lt;ref&gt;Goldratt, E. M.; &lt;cite&gt;''Cost accounting is enemy number one of productivity''&lt;/cite&gt;. International Conference Proceedings, American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) (October 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated in the publication of &lt;cite&gt;''A Town Without Walls''&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Goldratt, Eliyahu M. &amp; Plossl, George; &lt;cite&gt;A'' Town Without Walls''&lt;cite&gt;. Whitepaper, distributed during APICS 1984 International Conference in Las Vegas/USA&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the company, Goldratt noticed elements that made him uncomfortable&lt;ref name="My Saga"&gt;Goldratt, Eliyahu M.; &lt;cite&gt;''My Saga to Improve Production''&lt;/cite&gt;. For instance, in the second edition of &lt;cite&gt;''The Goal''&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; several software implementations did not come close to their estimated potential. After some work, Goldratt discovered that the habits and assumptions (paradigms) of employees and managers prior to using the software were still prominent and negatively influenced results after implementation.&lt;ref name="My Saga"/&gt;

His answer was the book &lt;cite&gt;[[The Goal]]&lt;/cite&gt; that took 13 months to write. After completion, the book was not well received by the company staff and by large publishers.&lt;ref name="My Saga"/&gt; Finally, with help from Larry Gadd the owner of North River Press, the book was published and became a great success.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Gadd. Preface to &lt;cite&gt;[[The Choice (philosophy book)|The Choice]]&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After a while, Goldratt noticed that many implementations were conducted using the Book but not the software. This caused further stress in the company and Goldratt tried to capture the essence of how to implement the solution directly in what is now known as Drum-Buffer-Rope method. He published &lt;cite&gt;The Race&lt;/cite&gt; to explain some of the concepts he was working on and developed a course to teach people how to manage their production using a computer simulation game.

Goldratt tried to move the company down the path of "consulting," trying to help people rethink the way they did things, but Creative Output's declining revenues and Goldratt involvement with anything but the sales of OPT software convinced the shareholders to fire Goldratt (and afterward his closer collaborators).

===Avraham Y. Goldratt Institute years===

After leaving Creative Output circa 1985, Goldratt created the Avraham Y Goldratt Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = AGI Goldratt Institute | url = http://www.goldratt.com
 | accessdate = June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or AGI (named after his father) to promote the Theory of Constraints and help it be implemented worldwide.

During the time of the AGI, Goldratt got deeply involved with the further development of TOC, mainly the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]] (and launched it publicly in 1991), [[Critical Chain Project Management]] and other applications.  His concepts influenced applications outside manufacturing and supply management, including the field of [[sales process engineering]].&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite book|title= Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|pages =33–35, 264–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Goldratt followed his plan to retire from the Institute prior to his 50th birthday.

===Goldratt Group years===

From the beginning of the 2000s, Goldratt created the self-funded Goldratt Group and launched the Viable Vision initiative.

He continued the development of TOC both in the Goldratt Group and in active support for other developments like TOC for Education, TOC in Healthcare, TOC for the Individual (in the continuity of the Odyssey Program, and the publishing of &lt;cite&gt;''The Choice''&lt;/cite&gt;).

==Writings==
{{Original research|date=February 2010}}{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}

Goldratt produced many works. Some of the more noteworthy are:

:*''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]'' (fiction, 1984) introduces TOC process for improving organizations and briefly TOC's accounting aspects. While set in a manufacturing company, the book provides the context for a more generic approach to continuous improvement.&lt;ref name=Rahman1998&gt;Shams-ur Rahman, (1998) "Theory of constraints: A review of the philosophy and its applications", International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, Vol. 18 Iss: 4, pp.336 - 355&lt;/ref&gt;

:*''The Race'' (non-fiction, 1986) further develops the logistical system called drum-buffer-rope (DBR), based on metaphors developed in The Goal.&lt;ref name=Rahman1998 /&gt;

:*''The Haystack Syndrome'' (non-fiction, 1990) looks deeper at the idea of performance measurements, examines differences between data and information, and explains the logic of the need for information.&lt;ref name=Rahman1998 /&gt;

:*''What is This Thing Called Theory of Constraints and How Should it be Implemented?'' (non-fiction, 1990) addresses the five focusing steps of on-going improvement and fundamentals of the [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking processes]].&lt;ref name=Rahman1998 /&gt;

:*''[[It's Not Luck (novel)|It's Not Luck]]'' (fiction, 1994) applies TOC to [[marketing]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[Business Strategy]]; Goldratt illustrates use of the Thinking processes to address policy constraints.&lt;ref name=Rahman1998 /&gt;

:*''[[Critical Chain (novel)|Critical Chain]]'' (fiction, 1997) applies TOC to [[project management]] and illustrates the [[Critical Chain]] method for managing projects while commenting on the MBA Academic environment and its issues

:*''[[Necessary But Not Sufficient (novel)|Necessary But Not Sufficient]]'' (fiction, 2000) applies TOC to [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) and operations software

More recent works:

:*''[[The Choice (philosophy book)|The Choice]]'' (2008) Talks about Goldratt's thought-provoking approach, this time through a conversation with his daughter Efrat, as he explains to her his fundamental system of beliefs.
:*[[The Choice (philosophy book)|The Choice, Revised Edition]] (2010) The revised edition includes Efrat's own notes she made during the conversation with her father, helping the reader determine the true essence of the book.

:*''[[Isn't it Obvious (novel)|Isn't it Obvious]]'' (fiction, 2009) Goldratt's most recent book looks into retail. Ilan Eshkoli and Joe Leer Brown are co-authors. The story is about a husband (manager) and wife (purchaser) working in her family's retail chain. An unexpected crisis helps them to find new ways of doing things - ending in success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2846">The '''European Beer Consumers Union''' ('''EBCU''') is a [[consumer organisation]] founded in 1990 in [[Bruges]] by three national [[beer]] organisations, [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]] ([[United Kingdom]]), Objectieve Bierproevers ([[Belgium]]) and PINT ([[Netherlands]]).

==Aims==
The union campaigns on European level to:

*Preserve traditions in European beer culture particularly regional and local producers using traditional methods.
*Promote [[craft beers]] and breweries including local/national [[beer style]]s and breweries and help support small breweries to prevent assimilation into multinational companies.
*Represent beer drinkers to ensure consumers receive quality beers and value for money and choice in the marketplace.

==Current members==

===History===

In 2003, Objectieve Bierproevers was replaced by Zythos.

In 2008, the member organisations signed up to a constitution which defined the formal aims and structure and the role of traditional beer as a prime component of European culture, history and daily life.

In 2012, Terry Lock, chairman since 1999, retired and Henri Reuchlin from the Netherlands was elected to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebcu.org/index.php/news/94-dutchman-to-lead-european-beer-consumers EBCU Press Release: Dutchman to lead European Beer Consumers]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Factory-kitchen''' or '''kitchen factory''' ({{lang-ru|Фабрика-кухня}}) was a large mechanized enterprise of [[food service]] in the [[Soviet Union]], originated in 1920-1930s. Its main purpose was centralized preparation of food (both prefabrication and full processing) supplied for communal dining rooms or for personal purchase. Factory-kitchens were characteristic of their unique architecture. Sometimes the term is inadequately translated as '''communal kitchen''', the latter being a kitchen in a Soviet [[communal apartment]].

The idea of centralized food preparation was part of the emancipation of the women from the household work in early Soviet Union, and to better tap into women's workforce. Along with the [[house-commune]]s (дом-коммуна), factory-kitchens were to get rid of "the yoke of the household economy". Slogans of the day were "Away with Pots and Pans!" and "The Saucepan is an Enemy of the [[party cell|Party Cell]].&lt;ref name= stites&gt;[[Richard Stites]],  ''The Women's Liberation Movement in Russia: Feminism, Nihilism, and Bolshevism, 1860-1930'', 1978, {{ISBN|0691100586}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qy679HV7AmkC&amp;q=kitchen#v=snippet&amp;q=kitchen&amp;f=false p. 409]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various propagandists explained how "a single person can prepare from fifty to hundred dinners a day".&lt;ref name= stites/&gt; A children's book ''A Cook for a Whole City''&lt;ref&gt;Т.Габбе, З.Задунайская. ''Повар на весь город.'' (''A Cook for a Whole City'')  [[OGIZ]], 1932, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; described in detail how efficiently a kitchen-factory works

[[Image:Databar 14 00075678164125.png|thumbnail|GS1 DataBar barcode symbol encoding a GTIN-12 number]]
[[Image:Databar-stacked-omni.png|frame|GS1 DataBar Stacked Omni-Directional barcode symbol encoding &lt;tt&gt;'''00123456789012'''&lt;/tt&gt;]]

'''GS1 DataBar''' is a family of symbols most commonly seen in the [[GS1 DataBar Coupon]]. Formerly known as Reduced Space Symbology (RSS-14), this family of [[barcodes]] include:

* Symbols intended for retail [[point of sale]] scanning:
** GS1 DataBar Omnidirectional
** GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional
** GS1 DataBar Expanded
** GS1 DataBar Expanded Stacked
* Symbols that are not intended for retail Point-of-Sale scanning:
** GS1 DataBar Truncated
** GS1 DataBar Limited
** GS1 DataBar Stacked

All GS1 DataBar barcodes encode a GTIN-12 or GTIN-13 in a 14-digit data structure. In order to make the GTIN-12 or GTIN-13 a 14-digit data structure, a leading zero or zeros is filled to the left of the GTIN. GS1 DataBar Omnidirectional, GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional, GS1 DataBar Expanded, and GS1 DataBar Expanded Stacked have omnidirectional scanning capability. GS1 DataBar Truncated, GS1 DataBar Stacked and GS1 DataBar Limited can only be scanned by a linear hand held or imaging scanning device: they cannot be scanned by omnidirectional scanners and are intended to be read by handheld scanners.

GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional is designed to condense the GTIN information into a more compact and square barcode suitable for use on smaller packages (such as the label stickers on fresh produce).

GS1 DataBar Limited, GS1 DataBar Stacked and GS1 DataBar Truncated are designed for very small item identification and are mainly used in the [[healthcare industry]]. Each encodes a GTIN-12 or GTIN-13 in 14-digit data structure. Only GS1 DataBar Limited uses an indicator digit 1.

In addition to encoding Application Identifier (01) GTIN, GS1 DataBar Expanded and GS1 DataBar Expanded Stacked can encode additional GS1 Application Identifiers such as [[shelf life|sell-by date]], weight, and lot number. Each symbol has a capacity of up to 74 characters. These attributes can help in controlling [[shrinkage (accounting)|shrinkage]], optimizing product replenishment, and improving the traceability of a product at the point of sale. They are seeing increased use in manufacturers' coupons. Starting June 2011 GS1 Databar use is mandated for coupons and the use of UPC-A must be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honeywellaidc.com/promos/0710_Ask_the_Expert_landing/images/61510GS1DataBarPres_20100709T175210Z.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbology is formally defined as ISO/IEC 24724:2006.

The name was changed from RSS to GS1 DataBar due to the potential for confusion with [[Really Simple Syndication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gs1.org/docs/media_centre/gs1_pr_270207_RSS_now_called_GS1_DataBar.pdf |title=Reduced Space Symbology (RSS) is now called GS1 DataBar |author=Eric Decroix |publisher=GS1 Global Office (press release)|date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the above is true.

'''Georg Hagerup-Larssen''' (16 January 1903 – 21 September 1982) was a Norwegian engineer and businessperson.

[[Fiskaa Verk]] was expanded, and the ownership in [[Sulitjelma Mines|Sulitjelma Gruber]] and [[Porsgrunn Elektrometallurgiske]] increased. From 1945 to 1971 the number of employees in the Elkem corporation rose from about 200 to about 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Med hele verden som tumleplass – fra Majorstuen|date=27 January 1968|page=9|author=Gilbo, Ole S.|language=Norwegian|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=70y&gt;{{cite news|title=Betydelig industrileder|date=15 January 1973|page=10|author=Bratz, Jens-Halvard|authorlink=Jens-Halvard Bratz|language=Norwegian|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Psychological counseling." (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, Thomas A., and John R. Deckop. "Evolution of concept and practice in personnel administration/human resource management (PA/HRM)." Journal of Management 12.2 (1986): 223-241.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lyndall Urwick]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Warsaw, Illinois]] to Thomas B. and Mary A. (Chambers) Metcalf obtained his AB degree at the [[Illinois State University|Illinois State Normal University]] in 1894, and his PhD from the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] in 1897.&lt;ref name="HSR 1914"&gt;''[http://scans.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/2/31/n04reportclass1894harvuoft/n04reportclass1894harvuoft.pdf Harvard College Class of 1894, Secretary's Report No, VI].'' 1914. p. 181-182&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn 1899 Metcalf was appointed College Professor at [[Tufts College]] in Massachusetts, where early 1900s he first worked with [[Mary Parker Follett]].&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Graham ''Mary Parker Follett Prophet of Management''. Beard Books, 2003. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1910s he was also lecturer at Garland School of Homemaking in Boston, and at the New York Edison School. In 1914 he explained, that he had spent several "summers in travel in Europe and the United States, studying methods of industry and employers' welfare institutions."&lt;ref name="HSR 1914"/&gt; In the 1910s he was also chairman of Tufts College, and until 1919 Cornelia M. Jackson Professorship of in Political Science&lt;ref&gt;Russell Miller (1986) ''[http://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tei/tufts:UA069.005.DO.00003/chapter/c14s2 Light on the hill: A history of Tufts College, 1852-1952]'' Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt; at Tufts' Department of Economics. In 1917 he took leave of absence from his duties at Tufts College and visited industrial plants and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Notes" in ''[https://archive.org/details/jstor-1808569 The American Economic Review].'' Vol. 6 (September 1, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 Metcalf moved New York, where he was appointed Professor of Economics at the [[New School for Social Research]], and Director of the Bureau of Personnel Administration.

== Work ==
=== ''Personnel administration'' (1920) ===
In the Preface of ''Personnel administration: its principles and practice'' (1920) Tead and Metcalf explained, that the purpose of that book as "to set forth the principles and the best prevailing practice in the field of the administration of human relations in industry. It is addressed to employers, personnel executives and employment managers, and to students of personnel administration whether they are in schools of business administration or already in industry in some executive capacity." They hope that it "will have value, also, for all - managers, workers, consumers - who are interested to advance right human relations in industry, and to secure a productivity which is due to willing human cooperation, interest and creative power."&lt;ref name="TM 1920"&gt;[[Tead, Ordway]], and Henry Clayton Metcalf. ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924087548347 Personnel administration: its principles and practice]''. No. 18. McGraw-Hill Book Company, inc., 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of administrative activity covered by this book includes all those efforts usually included in personnel management; employment, health and safety, training, personnel research, service features and joint relations. And Tead and Metcalf seek, also, to show the relation of the personnel problems of each corporation to those of its industry as whole, by considering in conclusion the activities of employers' associations and the dealings which they may have with organizations of workers on a district or national scale.&lt;ref name="TM 1920"/&gt;

'''Josiah Clifton Firth''' (27 October 1826 &amp;ndash; 11 December 1897) was a New Zealand farmer, businessman and politician who had a brief brush with fame as the messenger between [[Te Kooti]] and the New Zealand Government during [[Te Kooti's War]].

Born in [[Clifton, West Yorkshire]], England, Firth came from a family background interested in farming and industrial development. He had a well rounded education. He moved to New Zealand in the early 1850s and settled in [[Auckland]] where he began making bricks and also took a one third interest in a steam powered flour mill in 1856. 

In 1859 he made his first visit to [[Matamata]] where he met and became friends with [[Wiremu Tamihana]], the King Maker&lt;ref name="DNZB Firth"&gt;{{DNZB|last=Waterson|first=D. B.|id=1F7|title=Firth, Josiah Clifton - Biography|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and met [[Pōtatau Te Wherowhero|King Pōtatau]] during a tour of the Waikato he published in 1860. His account ended with a prophecy of the [[Invasion of the Waikato]], saying, "''It is unfortunate that the remedy we propose should have an aspect of selfishness. For we say to them, and justly, 'Sell three-fourths of your lands, and cease to be nomads, if you wish to save your race from extinction.' They not unnaturally decline the prescription when the fee is apparently so large. So the matter rests for the present. Time and the natural progress of events will, nevertheless, shortly either enforce the prescription and exact the fee, or consign the refractory patients to a swift and sure destruction''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/new-zealander/1860/01/28/7|title=New Zealander {{!}} 28 January 1860|last=|first=|date=|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Auckland he was one of a small group of highly influential business men such as [[John Logan Campbell]], [[Frederick Whitaker]] and Thomas Morrin. They had significant influence on The [[Bank of New Zealand]] and the [[New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company]]. Firth was always able to borrow  finance to capitalize his many innovative schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Firth Tower and Stanley landing. Historical Reserves Management Plan Matamata District Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

Firth briefly entered Parliament for the [[Auckland West]] electorate. He was elected in [[New Zealand general election, 1860–61|1861]]&lt;!-- election held on 11 January 1861 --&gt;, and resigned on 30 April 1862.&lt;ref name="DNZB Firth" /&gt; He promoted the purchase of land directly from Maori as had happened in the Wairarapa. This contravened the Treaty of Waitangi but had been a mechanism used from time to time in localized issues when Maori agreed.

In 1865 with the establishment of peace in the Waikato, Firth was able to lease land from Wiremu Tamihana  of Ngati Haua, a kingitanga tribe. Tamihana, who was a Christian, had been at the core of the Kingite movement but was at heart a man of peace. A large area of land  around [[Matamata]] was leased for a rental of up to five hundred pounds a year. Two years later he bought outright some of the land covered by the lease and this became the basis of his estate at Matamata. By 1865 Firth had leased 55,000 acres."The fern and bracken covered plains was burnt and soon sown in grassland and feed crops such as turnips".

He built his first homestead near Peria where Tamihana had earlier established a missionary station. When Tamihana died in 1866 Firth had a monument built at the place he died with an inscription that said it was Tamihana's will that Firth stay on the Matamata land as long as he (Firth) chose.&lt;ref&gt;Firth Tower and Stanley Landing.. Matamata District Council.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, his businesses in Auckland were prospering and he was able to lease a very fine house on the eastern side of [[Mount Eden]] from John Ogilvie (1839?-1871) Secretary to the Auckland Board of Commissioners (in 1871 he would purchase the house).

Early in 1870 Josiah, or Hohaia as he was known to the [[Māori people|Māori]], was contacted by Te Kooti during his flight from Te Porere through the King Country and back to the Ureweras. From his base at Tapapa, near Tirau. Te Kooti sent a message to Firth to meet him at Wiremu Tamihana's monument. Firth  claimed to have inherited Wiremu Tamihana's "mantle of patience". Before the meeting Firth contacted Daniel Pollen the general agent for the government in Auckland. On 17 January Firth met Te Kooti. Firth told Te Kooti he had come to listen -he had no power to offer any terms. They talked for some time with Te Kooti emphasising he would not surrender but wanted to be left in peace to live at Tapapa. Firth noted that although Te Kooti was unarmed he was backed by a semi circle of heavily armed men with modern weapons in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;Redemption Songs. J. Binney. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; He told Firth: "If they let me alone I will live quietly; if not I will fight."

The government sent word to Firth that they had nothing to say to Te Kooti apart from if he surrendered he would be given safe conduct to Auckland. This telegram crossed with one from Firth outlining Te Kooti's wishes. But Te Kooti had aroused too much fear and hatred for his offer to be accepted, and it was rejected out of hand. There was also considerable official annoyance with Josiah Firth. The Premier Willian Fox and the government agent for Hawkes Bay J.D. Ormond were irate"with that meddlesome sweep Firth."The military were instructed to attack Te Kooti whether Firth was with him or not. For Te Kooti the whole meeting may have been another ruse, as shortly afterwards Chief Te Hiri from Coromandel arrived and gave Te Kooti a huge quantity of gunpowder(7kegs) and a bag of  bullets 2 feet high. In fact Te Kooti had "predicted" he would be given the ammunition down to the exact day and time.&lt;ref&gt;Redemption Songs. J. Binney. p. 198–201. Auckland University Press. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the resupply mission had been prearranged.

In 1873 Firth began a seven-year project to clear the Waihou River of snags and obstacles to navigation thus opening the upper reaches of the Thames Estuary to shipping.&lt;ref name="NZETC Firth"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand : Auckland Provincial District |year=1902 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc02Cycl-t1-body1-d1-d10-d17.html |author=Cyclopedia Company Limited |accessdate=8 June 2010 |location=Christchurch |chapter=Mr. Josiah Clifton Firth}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of "Our Kin across the Sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Australasia|Firth, Josiah Clifton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Firth purchased his Auckland residence 'Clifton' which he had previously leased, and extended the building. To the rear of the wooden Gothic house he erected a large wing in the Castellated style which included a 15 metre tall tower, completed in 1873. This structure was built in unreinforced [[concrete]], an experimental material for the period. As well a providing a vantage point with splendid views of the [[Waitematā Harbour]] the tower contained a water tank so the up-to-date indoor plumbing had good water pressure. The tower also contained a study for Firth in which he arranged a small museum of geological items and other curiosities. In 1882 at Matamata he constructed a second castellated tower, a slightly smaller version of the Mt Eden tower and likewise an extension to an earlier wooden residence. Both structures are still standing - the Matamata Tower being a tourist attraction in its own right.

Firth championed the use of concrete as a building material and significantly Firth's sons would go on to found the [[Firth Concrete|Firth Concrete Company]]. Firth's two concrete structures are now some of the earliest examples of concrete construction in the country ([[John Logan Campbell]]'s 1871 house 'Loganbank' in Official Bay having been demolished). As a member of the Beresford Street Congregationalist Church in [[Karangahape Road]], Firth influenced the choice of concrete for that building as well (1875).

In 1882 Firth arranged a grand reception in the grounds of Clifton House for the Maori King, [[Tawhiao]]. Firth had played a part in the establishment of Tawhiao's father The Waikato chief [[Potatau Te Wherowhero]] as Maori King in 1858.

New Zealand agriculture went through a serious depression during the 1880s, one which hit Firth hard, and in 1889 he was declared bankrupt.  Later he began to develop a trade in [[pumice]] based on its properties of insulation and fire resistance, travelling to the [[United States]] and England. He died suddenly on 11 December 1897 just as the venture was becoming successful,&lt;ref name="DNZB Firth" /&gt; and was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in the Auckland suburb of Parnell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS18971213.2.31 | date=13 December 1897| title=Mr J.

'''George Lennox ("Len") Fyfe, Baron Fyfe of Fairfield''' (10 April 1941 – 1 February 2011) was a British politician and [[life peer]] who sat as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] member of the House of Lords. 

Fyfe was born at [[Sauchie]], [[Clackmannanshire]], the son of George Lennox Fyfe and Elizabeth Struthers Fyfe. He was educated at [[Alloa Academy]] and [[Co-operative College]], Loughborough. 
 
Fyfe made his career in the [[British co-operative movement|Co-operative movement]], initially in Scotland; he was general manager of the [[Kirriemuir Co-operative Society]] from 1966 to 1968, and regional manager of the [[Scottish Co-operative Society]] from  1968 to 1972. He was group general manager of the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-operative Wholesale Society]] from 1972 to 1975. He served as Chief Executive of the Leicestershire Co-operative Society from 1975 to 1995, and, following a merger, held the same position at the [[Midlands Co-operative Society]] until 2000.  He was a member of the East Midlands Economic Planning Council from 1976 to 1979.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3286">This is a '''list of [[production function]]s''' that have been used in the [[economics]] literature. Production functions are a key part of modelling [[national output]] and [[national income]].

The production functions listed below, and their properties are shown for the case of two factors of production, [[capital (economics)|capital]] (K), and [[labor economics|labor]] (L), mostly for heuristic purposes. These functions and their properties are easily generalizable to include additional factors of production (like land, natural resources, entrepreneurship, etc.)

==Technology==

There are three common ways to incorporate technology (or the efficiency with which factors of production are used) into a production function (here ''A'' is a scale factor, ''F'' is a production function, and ''Y'' is the amount of physical output produced):
* [[Hicks-neutral technical change|Hicks-neutral technology]], or "factor augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = AF(K,L)&lt;/math&gt; 
* Harrod-neutral technology, or "labor augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = F(K,AL)&lt;/math&gt; 
* Solow-neutral technology, or "capital augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = F(AK,L)&lt;/math&gt;

==Elasticity of substitution==

The elasticity of substitution between [[factors of production]] is a measure of how easily one factor can be substituted for another. With two factors of production, say, ''K'' and ''L'', it is a measure of the curvature of a production [[isoquant]]. The mathematical definition is:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \epsilon=\left[\frac {\partial(slope)} {\partial(L/K)} \frac {L/K} {slope}\right]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where "slope" denotes the slope of the isoquant, given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ slope=-\frac {\partial F(K,L)/ \partial K} {\partial F(K,L)/ \partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Returns to scale==

[[Returns to scale]] can be
* Increasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages more than doubles output. 
* Decreasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages less than doubles output.
* Constant returns to scale: doubling all input usages exactly doubles output.

==Some widely used forms==
* [[Constant elasticity of substitution]] (CES) function: 
::&lt;math&gt; Y = A[\alpha K^\gamma + (1-\alpha) L^\gamma]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\gamma \isin [-\infty,1]&lt;/math&gt; 

::which includes the special cases of:

::*Linear production (or perfect substitutes) 
::::&lt;math&gt;\ Y=A[\alpha K+ (1-\alpha) L]&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\ \gamma=1&lt;/math&gt;
::*[[Cobb&amp;ndash;Douglas production function ]] (or imperfect complements) 
::::&lt;math&gt;\ Y=AK^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\gamma \to 0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1367">'''Market price support''' (MPS) is an indicator, developed by the [[OECD]], used in the calculation of [[Producer and Consumer Subsidy Equivalents]] (PSE/CSE). The PSE and CSE acronyms were changed en 1999 to [[Producer and Consumer Support Estimate]].  MPS is the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers arising from policy measures creating a gap between domestic market prices and border prices of a specific agricultural commodity measured at the [[Farm gate value|farm gate]] level.  Conditional on the production of a specific commodity, MPS includes the transfer to producers associated with both production for domestic use and exports and is measured by the price gap applied to current production.  The MPS is net of producer levies on sales of the specific commodity or penalties for not respecting regulations such as production quotas (price levies).  In the case of livestock production MPS is net of the market price support on domestically produced coarse grains and oilseeds used as animal feed (excess feed cost).

[[File:Merchants from Holland and the Middle East trading..jpg|thumb|right|Merchants from Holland and the Middle East trading.]]
A '''merchant''' is a person who [[trade]]s in [[Commodity|commodities]] produced by other people. Historically, a merchant is anyone who is involved in business or trade. Merchants have been known for as long as industry, commerce, and trade have existed. During the 16th-century, in Europe, two different terms for merchants emerged: One term, ''meerseniers,''  described local traders such as bakers, grocers, etc.; while a new term, ''koopman,'' described merchants who operated on a global stage, importing and exporting goods over vast distances, and offering added value services such as credit and finance. 

The status of the merchant has varied during different periods of history and among different societies. In ancient Rome and Greece, merchants may have been wealthy, but were not accorded high social status. In contrast, in the Middle East, where markets were an integral part of the city, merchants enjoyed high status. In modern times, the term occasionally has been used to refer to a [[businessperson]] or someone undertaking activities (commercial or industrial) for the purpose of generating profit, cash flow, sales, and revenue utilizing a combination of human, financial, intellectual and physical [[Capital (economics)|capital]] with a view to fuelling economic development and growth.

Merchants have been known for as long as humans have engaged in trade and commerce. Merchants and merchant networks were known to operate in ancient Babylonia and Assyria, China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Phoenicia and Rome. During the European medieval period, a rapid expansion in trade and commerce, led to the rise of a wealthy and powerful merchant class. The European age of discovery opened up new trading routes and gave European consumers access to a much broader range of goods. From the 1600s, goods began to travel much further distances as they found their way into geographically dispersed market places.  Following the opening Asia and the discovery of the New World, goods were imported from very long distances: calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. By the eighteenth century, a new type of manufacturer-merchant was emerging and modern business practices were becoming evident.

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:16th century costumes of merchants from Brabant and Antwerp.jpg|thumb|Costumes of merchants from Brabant and Antwerp, engraving by [[Abraham de Bruyn]], 1577]]
The English term, "merchant" comes from the Middle English, ''marchant'', which itself originated from the Vulgar Latin ''mercatant'' or ''mercatans'', formed from present participle of mercatare meaning to trade, to traffic or to deal in.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/merchant&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to refer to any type of reseller, but can also be used with a specific qualifier to suggest a person who deals in a given characteristic such as "speed merchant" to refer to someone who enjoys fast driving; a "noise merchant", used to refer to a group of musical performers.&lt;ref&gt;''Online Dictionary of Etymology,'' http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=merchant&lt;/ref&gt; Other known uses of the term include:  "dream merchant" used to describe someone who peddles idealistic visionary scenarios and "merchant of war" to describe proponents of war.

Elizabeth Honig has argued that concepts relating to the role of a merchant began to change in the mid-16th century. The Dutch term, ''koopman'' (meaning merchant), became rather more fluid during the 16th century when Antwerp was the most global market town in Europe. Two different terms, for a merchant, began to be used, ''meerseniers'' referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, while the alternate term, ''koopman,'' was used to describe those who traded in goods or credit on a large scale. This distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who took up their places on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;Honig, E.A., ''Painting &amp; the Market in Early Modern Antwerp,'' Yale University Press, 1998, pp 4-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of merchant==

Broadly, merchants can be classified into two categories:

* A [[wholesale]] merchant operates in the chain between the producer and retail merchant, typically dealing in large quantities of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, 2013. [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/merchant mer‧chant]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a wholesaler does not sell directly to end-users. Some wholesale merchants only organize the movement of goods rather than move the goods themselves.
* A [[retail]] merchant or [[retailer]] sells merchandise to end-users or consumers (including businesses), usually in small quantities. A shop-keeper is a retail merchant.

However, the term 'merchant' is often used in a variety of specialised contexts such as in ''merchant banker'', ''merchant navy'' or ''[[merchant services]]''.

===Merchants in antiquity===
[[File:PhoenicianTrade EN.svg|thumb|Phoenician trade route map]]
Merchants have existed as long as business, trade and commerce have been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Demirdjian, Z. S.,  "Rise and Fall of Marketing in Mesopotamia: A Conundrum in the Cradle of Civilization," In ''The Future of Marketing's Past: Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference on Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing,'' Leighton Neilson (ed.), CA, Longman, Association for Analysis and Research in Marketing, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A merchant [[class (social)|class]] characterized many [[pre-modern societies]]. Open air, public markets, where merchants and traders congregated, were known in ancient Babylonia and Assyria, China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Phoenicia and Rome. These markets typically occupied a place in the town's centre. Surrounding the market, skilled artisans, such as metal-workers and leather workers, occupied premises in alley ways that led to the open market-place. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity," In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums,'' Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, pp 209–250&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greece]] markets operated within the [[agora]] (open space), and in [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]] the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]. Rome had two forums; the [[Roman forum|Forum Romanum]] and [[Trajan's Forum]]. The latter was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop-front.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P., ''Shopping Environments,'' Elsevier, Oxford, 2006, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In antiquity, exchange involved [[direct selling]] through permanent or semi-permanent retail premises such as stall-holders at market places or shop-keepers selling from their own premises or through door-to-door direct sales via merchants or [[peddler]]s. The nature of direct selling centred around transactional exchange, where the goods were on open display, allowing buyers to evaluate quality directly through visual inspection. Relationships between merchant and consumer were minimal&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Phoenician Merchants and Traders.jpg|thumb|left|Phoenician merchants traded across the entire Mediterranean region]]
The Phoenicians were well known amongst contemporaries as "traders in purple" – a reference to their monopoly over the purple dye extracted from the [[murex]] shell.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, G., ''History of Phoenicia,'' Library of Alexandria, 1889&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenicians plied their ships across the Mediterranean, becoming a major trading power by the 9th century BCE. Phoenician merchant traders imported and exported wood, textiles, glass and produce such as wine, oil, dried fruit and nuts. Their trading skills necessitated a network of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, stretching from modern day Crete through to Tangiers and onto Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient.eu/article/881 Cartwright, M., "Trade in the Phoenician World", ''Ancient History Encyclopedia'', 1 April 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenicians not only traded in tangible goods, but were also instrumental in transporting the trappings of culture. The Phoenician's extensive trade networks necessitated considerable book-keeping and correspondence. In around 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, the Phoenicians developed a phonetic alphabet which was much easier to learn that the pictographic scripts used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Phoenician traders and merchants were largely responsible for spreading their alphabet around the region.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1996) p. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenician inscriptions have been found in [[archaeological]] sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and [[colonies]] around the Mediterranean, such as [[Byblos]] (in present-day [[Lebanon]]) and [[Carthage]] in [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;John Noble Wilford (November 13, 1999) "Discovery of Egyptian Inscriptions Indicates an Earlier Date for Origin of the Alphabet", New York Times, &lt;Online: https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/111499sci-alphabet-origin.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The social status of the merchant class varied across cultures; ranging from high status (the members even eventually achieving titles such as that of [[titles of nobility|Merchant Prince]] or [[Nawab|Nabob]]) to low status, as in [[Four occupations#The shang|China]], Greece and Roman cultures, owing to the presumed distastefulness of profiting from "mere" [[trade]] rather than from labor or the labor of others as in [[agriculture]] and [[Artisan|craftsmanship]].&lt;ref&gt;Oka, R. and Kusimba, C.M., "The Archaeology of Trading Systems, Part 1: Towards a New Trade Synthesis," The Archaeology of Trading Systems, Part 1: Towards a New Trade Synthesis," ''Journal of Archaeological Research,'' Vol. 16, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans defined merchants or traders in a very narrow sense. Merchants were those who bought and sold goods while landowners who sold their own produce were not considered to be merchants. Being a landowner was a 'respectable' occupation. On the other hand, the trade of merchant was not considered 'respectable'.&lt;ref&gt;Tchernia, A., ''The Romans and Trade,'' Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2016, Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the ancient cities of the Middle East, where the bazaar was the city's focal point and heartbeat, merchants who worked in bazaar were considered to be among the high-ranking members of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Ashraf, A., "Bazaar-Mosque Alliance: The Social Basis of Revolts and Revolutions," ''International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society,'' Vol. 1, No. 4, 1988, pp. 538-567, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20006873, p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval attitudes toward merchants in the West were strongly influenced by criticism of their activities by the Christian church, which closely associated their activities with the sin of [[usury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/society/structure/merchant_cult.php |title=Decameron Web – Society |author= |date= |work=Brown.edu |access-date=8 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GDf1o5rh?url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/society/structure/merchant_cult.php |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greco-Roman]] society, merchants typically did not have high [[social status]], though they may have enjoyed great wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Barnish, S.J.B. (1989) "The Transformation of Classical Cities and the Pirenne Debate", ''[[Journal of Roman Archaeology]]'', Vol. 2, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Umbricius Scauras, for example, was a manufacturer and trader of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii, circa 35 C.E. His villa, situated in one of the wealthier districts of Pompeii, was very large and ornately decorated in a show of substantial personal wealth. Mosaic patterns in the floor of his atrium were decorated with images of [[amphora]] bearing his personal brand and bearing quality claims. One of the inscriptions on the mosaic amphora reads "G(ari) F(los) SCO[m]/ SCAURI/ EX OFFI[ci]/NA SCAU/RI" which translates as "The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus, from the shop of Scaurus." The reputation of Scauras' fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the Mediterranean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern southern France.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, R.I., "A Personalized Floor Mosaic from Pompeii," ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 88, No. 4 (October 1984), DOI: 10.2307/504744, pp. 557-566, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/504744&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable Roman merchants include: [[Marcus Julius Alexander]], [[Sergius Orata]] and [[Annius Plocamus]].

In the Roman world, local merchants served the needs of the wealthier landowners. While the local peasantry, who were generally poor, relied on open air market places to buy and sell produce and wares, major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity," In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums,'' Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  Markets were also important centres of social life and merchants helped to spread news and gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, F., "The World of the Golden Ass", ''Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 71, 1981, pp. 63–67&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies. Both Greek and Roman merchants engaged in long-distance trade. A Chinese text records that a Roman merchant named Lun reached southern China in 226 CE. Roman objects, dating from the period 27 BCE to 37 CE, have been excavated in sites as far afield as the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] and [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus]] ports. The Romans sold purple and yellow dyes, brass and iron and acquired incense, balsalm, expensive liquid myrrh and spices from the Near East and India, fine silk from China&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, R., ''The Roman Empire and the Silk Routes: The Ancient World Economy and the Empires of Parthia, Central Asia and Han China,''South Yorkshire, Pen and Sword Books, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and fine white marble destined for the Roman wholesale market from Arabia.  For Roman consumers, the purchase of goods from the East was a symbol of social prestige.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, R., ''The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean: The Ancient World Economy and the Kingdoms of Africa, Arabia and India,'' South Yorkshire, Pen and Sword Books, 2014 p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchants in the medieval period===
[[File:Caravane Marco Polo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marco Polo]] was among the earliest European merchants to travel to the Orient, helping to open it up to trade in the 13th century]]

Medieval England and Europe witnessed a rapid expansion in trade and the rise of a wealthy and powerful merchant class. Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns. Peddlers or itinerant merchants filled any gaps in the distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; From the 11th century, the [[Crusades]] helped to open up new trade routes in the Near East, while the adventurer and merchant, [[Marco Polo]] stimulated interest in the far East in the 12th and 13th centuries. Medieval merchants began to trade in exotic goods imported from distant shores including spices, wine, food, furs, fine cloth (notably silk), glass, jewellery and many other luxury goods. Market towns began to spread across the landscape during the medieval period.

Merchant [[guild]]s began to form during the Medieval period. A fraternity formed by the merchants of Tiel in Gelderland (in present-day Netherlands) in 1020 is believed to be the first example of a guild. The term, "guild" was first used for ''gilda mercatoria'' to describe a body of merchants operating out of St. Omer, France in the 11th century and London's ''[[Hanseatic League|Hanse]]'' was formed in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online: https://www.britannica.com/topic/merchant-guild&lt;/ref&gt; These guilds controlled the way that trade was to be conducted and codified rules governing the conditions of trade. Rules established by merchant guilds were often incorporated into the charters granted to [[market town]]s. In the early 12th century, a confederation of merchant guilds, formed out the German cities of Lubeck and Hamburg, known as "The [[Hanseatic League]]" came to dominate trade around the Baltic Sea. By the 13th and 14th centuries, merchant guilds had sufficient resources to have erected [[guildhall|guild halls]] in many major market towns.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S.A, ''Wage Labor and Guilds in Medieval Europe,'' University of North Carolina Press, 1991, pp 50-100&lt;/ref&gt;

During the thirteenth century, European businesses became more permanent and were able to maintain sedentary merchants and a system of agents. Merchants specialised in financing, organisation and transport while agents were domiciled overseas and acted on behalf of a principal. These arrangements first appeared on the route from Italy to the Levant, but by the end of the thirteenth century merchant colonies could be found from Paris, London, Bruges, Seville, Barcelona and Montpellier. Over time these partnerships became more commonplace and led to the development of large trading companies. These developments also triggered innovations such as double-entry book-keeping, commercial accountancy, international banking including access to lines of credit, marine insurance and commercial courier services. These developments are sometimes known as the ''commercial revolution.''&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M. and Lee, J., "The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective," ''Business History Review,'' Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, pp 22–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Luca Clerici has made a detailed study of Vicenza’s food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of merchants operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called ‘resellers’ (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild.  Cheesemongers’ shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and direct sellers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, L., "Le prix du bien commun. Taxation des prix et approvisionnement urbain (Vicence, XVIe-XVIIe siècle)" [The price of the common good. Official prices and urban provisioning in sixteenth and seventeenth century Vicenza] in I prezzi delle cose nell’età preindustriale /''The Prices of Things in Pre-Industrial Times,'' [forthcoming], Firenze University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A merchant making up the account.jpg|thumbnail|left|''A merchant making up the account'' by [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]].]]
From 1300 through to the 1800s a large number of European chartered and merchant companies were established to exploit international trading opportunities. The [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London]], chartered in 1407, controlled most of the fine cloth imports&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9052088 "Merchant Adventurers"] in [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Online Library Edition, 2013. Retrieved 22 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Hanseatic League]] controlled most of the trade in the Baltic Sea. A detailed study of European trade between the thirteenth and fifteenth century demonstrates that the European age of discovery acted as a major driver of change. In 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances: grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20–40 miles. However, in the years following the opening up of Asia and the discovery of the New World, goods were imported from very long distances: calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century'', Berkeley CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mesoamerica, a tiered system of traders developed independently. The local markets, where people purchased their daily needs were known as ''[[tianguis]]'' while ''[[pochteca]]'' was the term used to describe long-distance, professional merchants traders who obtained rare goods and luxury items desired by the nobility. This trading system supported various levels of pochteca – from very high status merchants through to minor traders who acted as a type of peddler to fill in gaps in the distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;Salomón, F., "Pochteca and mindalá: a comparison of long-distance traders in Ecuador and Mesoamerica," ''Journal of the Steward Anthropological Society, '' Vol. 1-2, 1978, pp 231-246&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish conquerors commented on the impressive nature of the local and regional markets in the 15th century. The [[Mexica]] ([[Aztec]]) market of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] was the largest in all the [[Americas]] and said to be superior to those in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rebecca M.

===Merchants in the modern era===

The ''modern era'' is generally understood to refer to period that coincides with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Southerton, D. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. xxx&lt;/ref&gt; As standards of living improved in the 17th century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or [[bourgeosie]] stimulated demand for luxury goods and the act of shopping came to be seen as a pleasurable pass-time or form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C. and Spang, R., "Sans Culottes, Sans Café, Sans Tabac: Shifting Realms of Luxury and Necessity in Eighteenth-Century France," Chapter 2 in ''Consumers and Luxury: Consumer Culture in Europe, 1650-1850'' Berg, M. and Clifford, H., Manchester University Pres, 1999;  Berg, M., "New Commodities, Luxuries and Their Consumers in Nineteenth-Century England," Chapter 3 in ''Consumers and Luxury: Consumer Culture in Europe, 1650-1850'' Berg, M. and Clifford, H., Manchester University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Der vollkommene Kaufmann.jpg|thumb|Merchants engaged in international trade began to develop a more outward-looking mindset]]

As Britain embarked on colonial expansion, large commercial organisations were much in need of sophisticated information about trading conditions in foreign lands. [[Daniel Defoe]], a London merchant, published information on trade and economic resources of England, Scotland and India.&lt;ref&gt;Minto, W., ''Daniel Defoe,'' Tredition Classics, [Project Gutenberg ed.], Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richetti, J., ''The Life of Daniel Defoe: A Critical Biography,'' Malden, MA., Blackwell, 2005, 2015, pp 147-49 and 158-59&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe was a prolific pamphleteer and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including; ''Trade of Britain Stated,'' 1707; ''Trade of Scotland with France,'' 1713; ''The Trade to India Critically and Calmly Considered,'' 1720 and ''A Plan of the English Commerce'' 1731; all pamphlets that were highly popular with contemporary merchants and business houses.&lt;ref&gt;Backscheider, P.R., 'Daniel Defoe: His Life,'' Baltimore, Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth century merchants, who traded in foreign markets, developed a network of relationships which crossed national boundaries, religious affiliations, family ties, and gender. The historian, Vannneste, has argued that a new ''cosmopolitan merchant mentality'' based on trust, reciprosity and a culture of communal support developed and helped to unify the early modern world. Given that these cosmopolitan merchants were embedded within their societies and participated in the highest level of exchange, they transferred a more outward-looking mindset and system of values to their commercial exchange transactions, and also helped to disseminate a more global awareness to broader society and therefore acted as agents of change for local society. Successful, open-minded cosmopolitan merchants began to acquire a more esteemed social position with the political elites. They were often sought as advisors for high-level political agents&lt;ref&gt;Vanneste, R., ''Global Trade and Commercial Networks: Eighteenth-Century Diamond Merchants,'' London, Pickering and Chatto, 2011, {{ISBN|9781848930872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the eighteenth century, a new type of manufacturer-merchant was emerging and modern business practices were becoming evident. Many merchants held showcases of goods in their private homes for the benefit of wealthier clients.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp 155-59&lt;/ref&gt; McKendrick, Brewer and Plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century English entrepreneurs and merchants using 'modern' marketing techniques, including product differentiation, sales promotion and loss leader pricing.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; English industrialists, [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods.&lt;ref&gt;Tadajewski, M. and Jones, D.G.B., "Historical research in marketing theory and practice: a review essay," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 30, No. 11-12, 2014 [Special Issue: Pushing the Boundaries, Sketching the Future], pp 1239-1291&lt;/ref&gt; Wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail, travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders, J., "They Broke It," ''New York Times,'' 9 January 2009, &lt;Online:https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/opinion/10flanders.html?_r=2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs. He also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving [[Economies of scale|scale economies]] in production. By cutting costs and lowering prices, Wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, D., "Dinnerware &amp; Cost Accounting? The Story of Josiah Wedgwood: Potter and Cost Accountant," ''HQ Financial Views,'' Volume I, 1 May–July, 2005, pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, one of Wedgewood's contemporaries, [[Matthew Boulton]], pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his Soho Manufactory in the 1760s. He also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of "celebrity marketing" – that is supplying the nobility, often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage, for the sake of the publicity and kudos generated.&lt;ref&gt;Applbaum, K., ''The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning,'' Routledge, 2004, p. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt; Both Wedgewood and Boulton staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century American merchants, who had been operating as importers and exporters, began to specialise in either wholesale or retail roles. They tended not to specialise in particular types of merchandise, often trading as general merchants, selling a diverse range of product types. These merchants were concentrated in the larger cities. They often provided high levels of credit financing for retail transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Savitt, R., "Looking Back to See Ahead: Writing the History of American Retailing", in ''Retailing: The Evolution and Development of Retailing'', A. M. Findlay, Leigh Sparks (eds), pp 138–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==

Elizabeth Honig has argued that artists, especially the Dutch painters of Antwerp, developed a fascination with merchants from the mid-16th century. At this time, the economy was undergoing profound changes – capitalism emerged as the dominant social organisation replacing earlier modes of production. Merchants were importing produce from afar – grain from the Baltic, textiles from England, wine from Germany and metals from various countries. Antwerp was the centre of this new commercial world. The public began to distinguish between two types of merchant, the ''meerseniers'' which referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the ''koopman,'' which described a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;Honig, E.A., ''Painting &amp; the Market in Early Modern Antwerp,'' Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6-10&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthier merchants also had the means to commission artworks with the result that individual merchants and their families became important subject matter for artists. For instance, Hans Holbein, the younger painted a series of portraits of Hanseatic merchants working out of London's Steelyard in the 1530s. &lt;ref&gt;Fudge, J.F., ''Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation,'' Brill, 2007, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; These included  including Georg Giese of Danzig; Hillebrant Wedigh of Cologne; Dirk Tybis of Duisburg; Hans of Antwerp, Hermann Wedigh, Johann Schwarzwald, Cyriacus Kale, Derich Born and Derick Berck. &lt;ref&gt;Holman, T.S., "Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation," Metropolitan Museum Journal, vol. 14, 1980, pp  139-158&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings of groups of merchants, notably officers of the merchant guilds, also became subject matter for artists and documented the rise of important mercantile organisations.

In recent art: Dutch photographer Loes Heerink spend [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/nov/04/view-from-bridge-vietnams-street-vendors-in-pictures hours on bridges] in Hanoi to take pictures of Vietnamese street Merchants.

==In architecture==
Although merchant halls were known in antiquity, they fell into disuse and were not reinvented until Europe's Medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Gelderblom, O. and Grafe, E., "The Persistence and Decline of Merchant Guilds: Re-thinking the Comparative Study of Commercial Institutions in Pre-modern Europe," [Working Paper], Yale University, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the 12th century, powerful guilds which controlled the way that trade was conducted were established and were often incorporated into the charters granted to [[market town]]s. By the 13th and 14th centuries, merchant guilds had acquired sufficient resources to erect guild halls in many major market towns.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein S.A, ''Wage Labor and Guilds in Medieval Europe,'' University of North Carolina Press, 1991, pp 50-100&lt;/ref&gt; Many buildings have retained the names derived from their former use as the home or place of business of merchants:

'''Metrix UK Ltd''' is a [[joint venture]] company, originally a 50/50 equity partnership between [[QinetiQ]] and [[Land Securities|LandSecurities Trillium]], specifically set up to bid for the two main contracts under the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government's 2001 [[Defence Training Review]] (DTR) rationalisation programme. Contract 1 involves provision of training for [[engineering]] and [[Telecommunication|communication]]s for the whole of the [[British Armed Forces]], while contract 2 was to provide training for [[logistics]], [[security]], [[police|policing]] and [[Administration (business)|administration]].

On 17 January 2007, it was announced that the Metrix [[consortium]] had been awarded Preferred Bidder status for Package 1 of the DTR programme, and Provisional Preferred Bidder status for Package 2. Metrix was expected eventually to reduce the current defence training estate from about 30 current sites to about 10 in the future, with a main campus to be located at an [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] site at [[MOD St Athan|St Athan]] in southern [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=257220&amp;NewsAreaID=2 Government News Network - Wednesday 17 January 2007 13:22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191641/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=257220&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2008, the Government announced that it had become apparent that the Metrix Consortium is not able to offer an affordable and acceptable Package 2 solution and, as a consequence, alternative approaches were being considered. This did not have any impact on the commitment to the Package 1 Metrix solution, which was still to be vigorously pursued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qinetiq.com/home_metrix_review/31_01_08_statement.html A statement issued by the [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]] on 31 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2008, Land Securities confirmed, in light of the significantly increased bid costs, that Trillium was withdrawing from its role as a partner in the Metrix consortium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsecurities.com/websitefiles/Metrix%20withdrawal_111208.pdf LandSecurities Metrix Withdrawal]&lt;/ref&gt; Their place was taken by [[Sodexo]] (originally a consortium member, rather than partner).

On 19 October 2010 the DTR project was cancelled and Metrix UK lost its status as preferred bidder.

==Consortium members==

The full Metrix consortium is made up of:

*[[AgustaWestland]]
*[[City and Guilds of London Institute|City &amp; Guilds]]
*[[Currie &amp; Brown]]
*Dalkia (part of [[Veolia Environnement]])

'''Micro enterprise tax in Latvia''' — it is special tax regime. The law, regulating the tax, entered into force on 1-st, September, 2010 and name of the law is The law on micro enterprises tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=215302 The law on micro enterprises tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aim of the tax ==

Initially the tax was introduced with the aim to:
* facilitate the creation of new small businesses, 
* reduce bureaucracy and costs associated with starting a business, and
* facilitate the transition of business from the shadow (gray) market to the legal (white) market.

During that time (2009-2011) Latvia was struggling with the crisis, the unemployment rate was relatively high. The introduction of the tax on micro enterprises and other changes in legislation gave opportunity for enterprising people (including the unemployed) relatively simply and at low cost to start a business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.lv/news/comment/comment/agnese-bicevska-mikrouznemuma-nodoklis-vai-mazs-cinitis-gazis-lielo-vezumu.d?id=38812939 Article of Agnese Bičevska about micro enterprise tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

But fairly quickly, many companies have begun to use this regime to reduce their taxes. So [[Saeima|Latvian parliament]] adopted legislation amendments. According to the amendments the application of this tax is very limited. 
Starting from 2016 application of the tax gradually decreases and from 1 January 2019 enterprises operating in most sectors (industries), will not be able to use the tax regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.company-taxes.info/related-information/changes-of-law-on-micro-enterprises-tax Changes of the Law on micro-enterprises tax.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to become a payer of the micro enterprises tax? ==
The following persons has rights to start a payer of the tax:
* a sole trader,
* an individual enterprise,
* agricultural or fishery enterprise,
* natural (private) person, that has registered economic activities with the State revenue service,&lt;ref&gt;[https://vid.gov.lv/?hl=2 State revenue service]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a limited liability company.

To become a payer of micro enterprises tax also must meet all the following criteria:
* all shareholders (if any) must be natural persons (owner of the shares of OOO automatically becomes an employee of the Company),
* turnover (income from economic activities) must not exceed EUR 100 000 per year,
* the number of employees must not exceed five employees,
* members of the board directors are employees of the company,
* natural or legal person is not a partner in a personal society,
* amount of salary of each employee does not exceed 720 euro per month,
* a person conducts business in certain (allowed) industries (enters into force on 1 January 2017).

List of sectors (industries) to which has no right to apply the regime of the micro-enterprise &lt;ref&gt;[http://m.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=277258 Regulation of the Cabinet of ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person owns shares in several companies, then only one company has the right to become a payer of micro enterprise tax.

If a person meets the above requirements, then to become a tax payer, must submit special application to the State Revenue Service. The application can be submitted using the Electronic declaration system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eds.vid.gov.lv/login/ Electronic declaration system in Latvia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Micro enterprise tax rate ==
For turnover not exceeding 7000 euros (per tax year), the tax rate is 9% of the turnover.

If the turnover is in the range of 7000.01 to 100 000 euros for the first, second and third year of operation, then the rate is also 9%.

However, starting from the fourth tax year, the rate increases to 12%.

Starting from 2017, the tax rate changes.

For turnover not exceeding 7000 euros (per tax year), the tax rate is 15% of the turnover.

If the turnover is in the range of 7000.01 to 100 000 euros for the first, second and third year of operation, then the rate is also 15%.

However, starting from the fourth tax year, the rate increases to 18%.

Additionally, the company must pay an additional tax - State Social Insurance Mandatory Contributions.

In [[corporate law]] in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, an '''oppression remedy''' is a statutory right available to [[oppressed shareholder]]s. It empowers the shareholders to bring an action against the corporation in which they own shares when the conduct of the company has an effect that is oppressive, unfairly prejudicial, or unfairly disregards the interests of a shareholder. It was introduced in response to ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'', which had held that where a company's actions were ratified by a majority of the shareholders, the courts will not generally interfere.

It has been widely copied in companies legislation throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], including:

==Introduction in the United Kingdom==
{{see also|Unfair prejudice in United Kingdom company law}}
An oppression remedy, intended to operate as an alternative to [[winding up]] a company, was adopted as s. 210 of the ''[[Companies Act 1948]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Now {{cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/30|title = Part 30}} of the ''[[Companies Act 2006]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which declared:

{{quotation|
'''210'''. (1) Any member of a company who complains that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner oppressive to some part of the members (including himself) or, in a case falling within [s. 169(3)], the [[Board of Trade]], may make an application to the court by petition for an order under this section.

:(2) If on any such petition the court is of opinion{{emdash}}
::(a) that the company's affairs are being conducted as aforesaid; and
::(b) that to wind up the company would unfairly prejudice that part of the members, but otherwise the facts would justify the making of a winding-up order on the ground that it was just and equitable that the company should be wound up;
:the court may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters complained of, make such order as it thinks fit, whether for regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in future, or for the purchase of the shares of any members of the company by other members of the company or by the company and, in the case of a purchase by the company, for the reduction accordingly of the company's capital, or otherwise.
}}

In the ''[[Companies Act 2006]]'', the relevant provision is expressed in s. 994 (and the Secretary of State has similar authority under s. 995):

{{quotation|
'''994'''. (1) A member of a company may apply to the court by petition for an order under this Part on the ground{{emdash}}

:(a) that the company's affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner that is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of members generally or of some part of its members (including at least himself), or
:(b) that an actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.
}}

Conduct that is considered to constitute "unfair prejudice" has been given a broad interpretation, which can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Anthony Lee|title = Guide to Unfair Prejudice Against Shareholders|url = http://www.ashfords.co.uk/news/shareholders_disputes_guide|publisher = Ashfords|accessdate = {{date|2013-7-3}}|date = {{date|2012-11-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* exclusion from management in circumstances where there is a legitimate expectation of participation;
:* the diversion of business to another company in which the majority shareholder holds an interest;
:* the awarding by the majority shareholder to himself of excessive financial benefits; and
:* abuses of power and breaches of the Articles of Association.

The conduct is not confined to a specific group. In ''Re HR Harmer Ltd'', [[Jenkins LJ]] noted that the definition is "wide enough to cover oppression by anyone who is taking part in the conduct of the affairs of the company whether ''[[de facto]]'' or ''[[de jure]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[1959] 1 WLR 62 at 75&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it can cover the actions of:

:* directors,
:* a controlling shareholder,
:* persons with ''de facto'' control of the company,
:* a class of shareholders, or
:* conduct of a related company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Roman Tomasic|author2= Stephen Bottomley|author3 = Rob McQueen|edition = 2nd|title= Corporations Law in Australia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zFSgs52KSmoC&amp;lpg=PA410&amp;ots=x0ymO3P5oX&amp;pg=PA414#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate= |year= 2002|publisher= [[Federation Press]]|location= Annandale, NSW|isbn= 1-86287-314-3|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in Canada==
{{see also|Oppression remedy in Canadian corporate law}}
Provisions similar to s. 210 of the 1948 UK Act were first introduced into Canadian law through the 1975 passage of the ''[[Canada Business Corporations Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Canada Business Corporations Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1974-76|chapter = 33|section=234|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl197476v01cana#page/886/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporated recommendations made in 1962 by the UK [[Jenkins Committee on Company Law]] for removing the linkage of the remedy with that of [[winding-up]] and for broadening its scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Dickerson|first1= Robert W.V.|last2= Howard|first2= John L.|last3= Getz|first3= Leon|date= 1971|title= Proposals for a New Business Corporations Law for Canada|url= http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ic/RG35-1-1971-I-eng.pdf|location= Ottawa|publisher= Information Canada|volume= I|at= par. 485-486, at pp. 162-164}}; 1971 draft s. 19.04 shown at {{cite book |last1= Dickerson|first1= Robert W.V.|last2= Howard|first2= John L.|last3= Getz|first3= Leon|date= 1971|title= Proposals for a New Business Corporations Law for Canada|url= http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ic/RG35-1-1971-II-eng.pdf|location= Ottawa|publisher= Information Canada|volume= II|pages=175-177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian legislation (both federally and in all provinces other than [[Prince Edward Island]]) provides for a broad approach to the oppression remedy ({{lang-fr|recours en oppression}}). In ''[[Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] noted:

{{quotation|
48. ...The oppression remedy of s. 241(2)(c) of the ''CBCA'' and the similar provisions of provincial legislation regarding corporations grant the broadest rights to creditors of any common law jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = D.

}}

A "complainant" is deemed to be a current or former registered security holder, a current or former director or officer, the Director appointed under the ''CBCA'', or "any other person who, in the discretion of a court, is a proper person to make an application under this Part."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =Canada Business Corporations Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-44|section =238|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-44/section-238.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, it can include a creditor of the corporation (but not every creditor will qualify),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Frank Roberts|title = Creditor's use of the oppression remedy|url = http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=30298&amp;custom_att_2=direct|publisher = [[McGill University]]|year = 2000|accessdate = {{date|2013-7-2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a trustee appointed under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' or a monitor appointed under the ''[[Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ernst &amp; Young Inc v Essar Global Fund Ltd et al|link=|year=2017|court=onsc|num=1366|format=|pinpoint=par. 36-37|parallelcite=|date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the United Kingdom, oppressive conduct is not restricted to that committed by corporations. In the case of corporate directors, the Supreme Court of Canada in 2017 held that they can be held personally liable for such conduct, but only where:

#the oppression remedy request is a fair way of dealing with the situation;
#any order made under s. 241(3) should go no further than necessary to rectify the oppression; and
#any such order may serve only to vindicate the reasonable expectations of security holders, creditors, directors or officers in their capacity as corporate stakeholders; but
#director liability cannot be a surrogate for other forms of statutory or common law relief, particularly where such other relief may be more fitting in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.osler.com/en/resources/regulations/2017/supreme-court-clarifies-test-for-personal-liabilit|title= Supreme Court clarifies test for personal liability of directors for oppressive conduct|last1= O'Brien|first1= Kevin|last2= Carson|first2= Robert|last3= Malik|first3= Waleed|date= July 13, 2017|website= |publisher= [[Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Wilson v Alharayeri|link=Wilson v Alharayeri|year=2017|court=scc|num=39|pinpoint=par. 47-55|parallelcite=|date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications to the Court have been successful where:{{sfn|Ben-Ishai|Puri|2004|p=89}}

#there was lack of a valid corporate purpose for the transaction;
#the corporate and its controlling shareholders failed to take reasonable steps to simulate an [[arm's length]] transaction;
#there was lack of good faith on the part of the corporation's directors;
#there was discrimination among shareholders which benefited the majority to the exclusion of the minority;
#there was a lack of adequate and appropriate disclosure of material information to minority shareholders; and
#there was a plan to eliminate a minority shareholder.

The court's discretion is not unlimited, as the [[Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (Court of Appeal)|Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador]] observed in 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Pelley v. Pelley|link=|year=2003|court=nlca|num=6|format=|pinpoint=par. 37|parallelcite=221 Nfld &amp; PEIR 1  |date=2003-01-22|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The result of the exercise of the discretion contained in subsection 371(3)&lt;ref&gt;of ''NLCA'', equivalent to ''CBCA'', s. 241(3)&lt;/ref&gt; must be the rectification of the oppressive conduct.  If it has some other result the remedy would be one which is not authorized by law.
:* Any rectification of a matter complained of can only be made with respect to the person’s interest as a shareholder, creditor, director or officer.
:* Persons who are shareholders, officers and directors of companies may have other personal interests which are intimately connected to a transaction.  However, it is only their interests as shareholder, officer or director as such which are protected by section 371 of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;''NLCA''&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions of that section cannot be used to protect or to advance directly or indirectly their other personal interests.
:* The law is clear that when determining whether there has been oppression of a minority shareholder, the court must determine what the reasonable expectations of that person were according to the arrangements which existed between the principals.
:* They must be expectations which could be said to have been, or ought to have been, considered as part of the compact of the shareholders.
:* The determination of reasonable expectations will also[...] have an important bearing upon the decision as to what is a just remedy in a particular case.
:* The remedy must not be unjust to the others involved.

Oppression claims are separate from [[derivative action]]s, but the two are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = T. Mark Pontin|author2 = Tracey M. Cohen|author3 = Graeme Cooper|title = Distinguishing Oppression Claims and Derivative Actions|url = http://www.fasken.com/files/Publication/9f6e9808-d5d0-4c18-bf65-0c3b0f128332/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/8cf188a6-678d-4107-993d-1ffa93f80f24/53611_2_CohenPontin.pdf|publisher = [[Fasken Martineau]]|date = June 2011|accessdate = {{date|2013-7-2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a derivative action claim can only be instituted by [[appeal|leave of the court]], as it is brought by a complainant to sue on behalf of the corporation for a wrong done to the corporation, and any successful claim is binding on all shareholders. This is in contrast to the oppression remedy claim, where a complainant sues on behalf of himself for a wrong he suffers personally as a result of corporate conduct.&lt;ref name="Koshal"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianappeals.com/2015/06/10/pick-your-poison-the-court-of-appeal-clarifies-the-distinction-between-the-oppression-remedy-and-the-derivative-action/|title= Pick Your Poison: the Court of Appeal Clarifies the Distinction between the Oppression Remedy and the Derivative Action|last1= Koshal|first1= Anu|date= June 10, 2015 |publisher= [[McCarthy Tétrault]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Rea v Wildeboer|link=|year=2015|court=onca|num=373|parallelcite=126 OR (3d) 178|date=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in Australia==

S. 234 of the ''[[Corporations Act 2001]]'' provides that the following can apply for an order seeking relief for oppressive conduct:

:* a member of the company, on behalf of himself or another member,
:* a person who has been removed from the register of members, or has ceased to be a member under circumstances which are the substance of the application,
:* a person to whom a share in the company has been transmitted by will or by operation of law, or
:* any other person, with the consent of the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]], in connection to a current or prior investigation into the company conducted by ASIC.

S. 232 states that the conduct of the company's affairs, an actual or proposed act or omission by or on behalf of a company, or a resolution or proposed resolution by all, or by a class, of the shareholders, must be:

:* contrary to the interests of the shareholders as a whole; or
:* oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a shareholder or shareholders whether in that capacity or in any other capacity,

in order for an application to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statutory Oppression Remedy under the ''Corporations Act 2001'' (Cth)|url = http://www.ahernslawyers.com.au/newsletter.asp?ID=8774|publisher = Aherns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oppression remedy, together with the option available for winding up a company and ASIC's use of the public interest ground in that regard, has received greater exposure and legal development since the onset of the [[global financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Oppression and winding up remedies after the GFC|url = |author1 = Michael Legg|author2 = Louisa Travers|journal = [[Company and Securities Law Journal]]|volume = 29|issue = 2|pages = 101{{en dash}}114|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reed &amp; Reed Inc.''' is a private general contractor based in [[Woolwich, Maine]].

==Company history==
Founded in 1928 by Captain [[Josiah W. Reed]] and son [[Carlton Day Reed]], the initial capital was roughly $2,000. By 1930, Reed &amp; Reed was already beginning its first bridge construction projects. These would come to define the company's image for nearly five decades.

Although founded in 1928, Reed &amp; Reed, Inc. was first incorporated in 1982. Since then, operations have continued to grow and expand. In 1992, RR Caribbean Inc. was established in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] to handle the company's Caribbean ambitions. Only two years later, in 1994, the company purchased Callahan Brothers, Inc., a leading competitor in contracting and design.

Perhaps the company's most high-profile project began in 2003 as a joint venture with rival Cianboro Inc. The [[Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory]], which has become a [[Maine]] landmark, began construction following a competitive bid among many contractors. Other high-profile undertakings included one of New England's largest wind farms, located in [[Mars Hill, Maine]], and the new Ocean Gateway pier for cruise ships in [[Portland, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2011/09/15/pier-without-peer-in-maine_2011-09-15/|title=Pier without peer in Maine|date=2011-09-15|work=Press Herald|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
While many of Reed &amp; Reed's projects are located in Maine, job sites are scattered all over [[New England]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Although the bridge contracts continue to provide millions in revenue for the company every year, it has recently begun pursuing wind energy as a major initiative. As part of this, the corporate logo, as seen on their website, has added wind mills.

The three main goals of Reed &amp; Reed are clearly outlined: safety, quality, and performance. Often used by the State of Maine's [[Department of Transportation]] for large- and small-scale projects, Reed &amp; Reed has built a reputation for quality throughout New England.

In 2017 Reed &amp; Reed purchased PLC Construction, an electrical transmission contractor, based out of New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2017/04/17/maine-construction-firm-reed-reed-buys-new-hampshire-subcontractor/|title=Maine construction firm Reed &amp; Reed buys New Hampshire subcontractor|date=2017-04-17|work=Press Herald|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLC Construction was often a subcontractor of Reed &amp; Reed and employed approximately 40 workers at the time of purchase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Shin Jeong Yil'''&lt;ref name="sh"/&gt; ('''Shin Jeongyil''', {{korean|hangul=신정일|hanja=申正一}}, 1938–1999) was a South Korean religious leader (the founder of [[Hanol-gyo]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://premium.britannica.co.kr/bol/topic.asp?article_id=b24h2980a |title=한얼교(Hanol-gyo)|publisher=한국 브리태니커 온라인}} ''Encyclopædia Britannica online Korea''&lt;/ref&gt; a politician&lt;ref name="n"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&amp;query=%EC%8B%A0%EC%A0%95%EC%9D%BC&amp;sm=tab_etc&amp;ie=utf8&amp;key=PeopleService&amp;os=1874727|work=Naver People|title=신정일|trans-title=Shin Jeong Yil}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.joins.com/search/profile.aspx?pn=6934|work=Joins People|title=신정일|trans-title=Shin Jeong Yil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanol-gyo, the religion which Shin founded, can be regarded as the religious re-establishment of the Korean national founding philosophy&lt;ref name="hh"/&gt; which foresaw the possibility of an evolution in human consciousness 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hanol.org/world/hanol.asp Hanol-gyo Official website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=560571&amp;cid=46651&amp;categoryId=46651 |title=신정일 |trans-title=Shin Jeong Yil|work=한국민족문화대백과 [Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hanol-gyo==
Hanol-gyo is an unconventional religion: it is the teachings on enlightenment and awakening; it pursues self-liberation of consciousness rather than the traditional ways of religious worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerkoream.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1102216 Commemoration in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Hanol-gyo’s re-establishment.] (Power Korea. February 2015 issue, P. 71~77)&lt;/ref&gt; Hanol-gyo permits its participants to practice other religions as well: it honors and respects all other enlightened beings ([[Dangun]], [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Lao-tzu]], [[Confucius]], etc.), along with their teachings and their religions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=549556&amp;cid=46651&amp;categoryId=46651|title=종교합일사상|trans-title=The Religious Unification|work=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to overcome religious separation and unite under the name of Truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbscnbc.sbs.co.kr/read.jsp?pmArticleId=10000728854|title=홍익인간의 정신 계승한 한얼교, 창교 50년 기념하는 한얼절 행사 가져|trans-title=Preservation of Hanol Spirit, Hanol-gyo’s 50th Anniversary Commemoration Ceremony|date=2015-04-06|work=SBS CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1236">'''Texturising''' or '''texturizing''' is the process by which [[synthetic fibres]] are modified to change their texture - the physical appearance of the [[fibre]]. Texturising techniques can include [[bulking]] (where [[thermoplastic]] fibres are twisted, heat set and untwisted), [[Crimping (manmade fibre)|crimping]] and [[coiling]], amongst others. Texturising takes advantage of the thermoplastic nature of synthetic fibres, and uses it to set texturised features in place.

Fibres may be texturised to improve the fibre's insulation properties (as processes like bulking allow it to trap air better), to minimise a shiny, synthetic-looking appearance, to reduce the silky nature of the fibre, or to create special effects ([[fancy yarns]]). 

These modifications will also affect the eventual [[fabric]], and fibres may be folded, looped, coiled or crinkled in order to improve the drape, appearance, lustre, warmth, elasticity or handle of the finished fabric. Texturising can reduce the "synthetic" appearance of a finished fabric, bringing its appearance closer to that of a natural fibre fabric.

'''The Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki''' was founded in 1939 and is an organisation of more than 6300 [[business]] owners in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It is one of the 21 regional organisations of the [[Federation of Finnish Enterprises]], which has the largest membership of all business-related federations in Finland.

The mission of the organisation is to create a favourable [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] climate and provide its members with information, [[Mentorship|mentoring]], [[Business networking|networking]], events and [[education]]al opportunities.

==The Regions and Young Entrepreneurs Network==
The Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki is divided into 7 regions:

*Helsingin Vanhankaupungin Yrittäjät
*Itä-Helsingin Yrittäjät
*Kanta-Helsingin Yrittäjät
*Koillis-Helsingin Yrittäjät
*Helsingin Yrittäjät Töölö ry
*Lauttasaaren Yrittäjät and
*Länsi-Helsingin Yrittäjät

In addition, the organisation has its own informal network HYNY for [[entrepreneur]]s less than 35 years of age. Founded in 2006, HYNY helps young entrepreneurs to learn and grow, leading to greater business success. For its members HYNY provides [[training]], events and networking opportunities.

==History== 
The founding meeting of the Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki was held 10 January 1939. At that time the members consisted mainly of industry associations but soon more and more independent entrepreneurs became members.

Due to the change in regulations in 1962, the name of the organisation was changed to Suur-Helsingin Yrittäjät ry and the organisational activities and number of members increased. Caused by the strong development of the region, several structural solutions were implemented and organisation’s activities took their current form. In addition, [[Espoo]] and [[Vantaa]] founded their own regional organisations in 1979, thus the responsibilities of these strongly developing and growing regions were divided and organisational activities redefined.

The original mission statement: bring entrepreneurs together, influence and safeguard the common interests, has never changed its core. The most significant change is its key function: the nature of the organisation as an information, mentoring, networking, events and educational opportunities provider for its members.

In 2009 the Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki celebrated its 70th anniversary. In the same year the organisation hosted the National Entrepreneur’s Day at the [[Helsinki Fair Centre]].

"The [[Cottle Church]]", as it is now called, was completed in 1824 and opened on May 5 that year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5266">'''Thomas Foulis''' (fl. 1580-1628) Scottish goldsmith and financier.

Thomas Foulis was an Edinburgh goldsmith and financier, he was also involved in the mint and coinage, gold and lead mining, and from May 1591 the receipt of money given to [[James VI of England]] by [[Elizabeth I of England]], known as the English annuity or subsidy. He was a son of Henry Foulis of Colinton and Margaret Haldane.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Goodare, (2004, September 23). 'Foulis, Thomas (c. 1560–1628), goldsmith, financier, and mining entrepreneur', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved 29 Sep. 2018, [https://doi-org.nls.idm.oclc.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/73674], subscription or library log-in required.&lt;/ref&gt; As a financier to the mint and crown his business partner was Robert Joussie, or Jowsie (d. 1610), an Edinburgh cloth merchant who later became [[Groom of the Chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'' vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 228: Neil Cuddy, 'The Revival of the Entourage' in David Starkey, ''The English Court'' (London, 1987), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foulis was made a master of the Edinburgh Incorporation of Goldsmiths and burgess on 18 June 1581 after submitting an essay of silverwork. His master had been Michael Gilbert. A son David followed him into the craft.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Munro &amp; Henry Steuart Fotheringham, ''Edinburgh Goldsmith's Minutes'' (Edinburgh, 2006), p. 32, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1581/2 he made new dies for minting coins, following the designs of [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton's]] painter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Cochran-Patrick, ''Records of the Coinage of Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1876), pp. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

James VI sent Foulis and Joussie to London in July 1589 to buy clothes and ornaments for his marriage to [[Anne of Denmark]]. James gave him a pleadge of two cut rubies and three cabochon rubies set in gold "chattons" or buttons from the crown jewels for these purchases and new work.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), no. 154: David Masson, ''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, 1585-1592'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Foulis supplied jewels to James VI and Anne, while Joussie supplied clothes and fabrics (Foulis also had a stock of fabric at his death).&lt;ref&gt;Julian Goodare, ''ODNB'' (2004): See [https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk], (1629 Foullis, Thomas (Wills and testaments Reference CC14/5/3, Lanark Commissary Court)).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1590 he made a silver-gilt and engraved basin and ewer for [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth's]] christening gift to Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], and advanced the English ambassador [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] £20 sterling to reward the servants and musicians.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10, pp. 857-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1594 he received a grant to prospect and mine for gold, silver, lead, tin and other metals, in Lanarkshire.&lt;ref&gt;''The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707'', K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2018), 1594/4/82. Date accessed: 28 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He became known as Thomas Foulis of Leadhills.

Foulis became involved in the administration of the Scottish exchequer by the group knowns as the [[Octavians]]. They gave him a role on 29 December 1597 overseeing royal expenditure. However, Foulis was bankrupted by the scheme on 17 January 1598.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Goodare, 'The Octavians', in Miles Kerr-Peterson and Steven J. Reid ed., ''James VI and Noble Power'' (Abingdon, 2017), p. 182, 184-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Aston]] wrote that Foulis was treasurer in all but name and after twenty days "fell by his wits" and lay "in great extremity". [[David Calderwood]] called his distress a frenzy, "phrenesie".&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'' vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; He recovered and on 2 August 1598 Foulis and Joussie obtained a contract (a tack) to operate the mint for six years in recompense of their losses.&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Cochran-Patrick, ''Records of the Coinage of Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1876), pp. 269-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Hudson wrote in May 1598 that Foulis was involved in pawning a gold lion set with a ruby worth £400 in London, which he suggested belonged to James VI.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'' vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1613 Foulis had the contract for a silvermine at Hilderston near Linlithgow. He died in Edinburgh in 1628.

==Family==
Foulis married firstly Jean Francis, who died in 1623, then Rachel Porteous. Jean had sons, Thomas and David Foulis of Glendorch, and three daughters, Margaret, Jean, and another who married James McMath. After his death a cousin, Anne Foulis, who was married to [[James Hope of Hopetoun]], eventually inherited the mining wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Goodare, ''ODNB'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
