'''Anti-Romanian sentiment''' or '''Romanophobia'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXUVAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22romanian-phobia%22&amp;dq=%22romanian-phobia%22&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PGevUd-6BKaE4gSVk4GwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Human Rights at the Turn of New Millenium in the Republic of Moldova|work=google.ro|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ro|antiromânism}},&lt;ref&gt;The word ''antiromânism'' is sometimes written without diacritics, and can be a cause of some confusion, because ''antiromanism'' can also mean ''antiţiganism'' (discrimination and prejudice against the [[Romani people]]).&lt;/ref&gt; ''românofobie'') is hostility toward or prejudice against [[Romanians]] as an ethnic, linguistic, religious, or perceived racial group, and can range from individual hatred to institutionalized, violent persecution.

Anti-Romanian discrimination and sentiment has been present in various degrees among the peoples and/or governments of countries bordering on [[Romania]], either toward Romania itself or towards Romanian ethnic minorities residing in these countries. Similar patterns have existed toward other groups both in the region and elsewhere in the world, especially where political borders do not coincide with the patterns of ethnic population.

==Kingdom of Hungary==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Transylvania]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was organized according to the system of [[Estates of the realm|Estates]], which were privileged groups (''universitates'') with power and influence in socio-economic and political life, being nonetheless organized according to certain ethnic criteria as well. The first Estate was the lay and ecclesiastic aristocracy, ethnically heterogeneous, but undergoing a process of homogenization  around its [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nucleus. The other Estates were [[Saxons]], [[Székelys|Szeklers]] and [[Romanians]] (or [[Vlachs]] - ''[[Universitas Valachorum]]''), all with an ethnic and  ethno-linguistic basis (''Universis nobilibus, Saxonibus, Syculis et Olachis''). The general assembly (''congregatio generalis'') of the four Estates had mainly supra-legislative powers in Transylvania, but it sometimes took measures regarding order in the country, relationships between the privileged, military issues, etc.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The turning point in the history of the Romanian population in Transylvania was in 1366, when through the [[Decree of Turda]] the king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I Anjou of Hungary]] redefined nobility in terms of membership in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and, thus specifically excluding the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Romanians. The only possibility for Romanians to retain or access nobility was through [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to Roman Catholicism. Some Orthodox Romanian nobles converted, being integrated in the Hungarian nobility, but the most of them declined, thus losing their status and privileges. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

As a result, gradually, after 1366 Romanians lost their status as an Estate and were excluded from Transylvania's assemblies. This meant that the Romanian population of Transylvania was never directly represented in the Transylvanian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]], which consisted of Hungarian nobles, German and Székely nobles (the [[Unio Trium Nationum]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Moreover, in [[Medieval]] times, the Romanians were not allowed to reside within the walls of such Transylvanian cities as [[Sibiu]] (''Nagyszeben''/''Hermannstadt''), [[Braşov]] (''Brassó''/''Kronstadt'') or [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] (''Kolozsvár''/''Klausenburg''). This led to extensive persecution against the under-represented Romanians. For example, in the 16th century, Transylvanian laws of justice separated the rights of Hungarians, Saxons and Szeklers from the rights of the Romanians.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

As a consequence, Romanian peasants would sometimes revolt and demand better treatment. These revolts, such as the [[Revolt of Horea, Cloşca and Crişan|1784 Romanian peasant uprising]], were ruthlessly suppressed as [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] after learning the escalated situation ordered the army to intervene. Horea and Cloșca were caught by Romanians in their subterfuge and handled them to [[Paul Kray]] general. Horea and Cloșca were executed by [[breaking on the wheel]].&lt;ref name=HegyesMarczali&gt;Hegyes András - Marczali Henrik: Erdély története (Budapest, 2002) 141-147 o. {{ISBN|9639452297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of execution consisted of the victim being laid on the ground whilst the executioner would break the prisoner’s bones with a spiked wheel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Other peasants would be forced to watch the executions in order to frighten them from attempting future uprisings. Crișan committed suicide in the prison.&lt;ref name="HegyesMarczali"/&gt;

In 1918, after the First World War, the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]] was declared at [[Alba Iulia]] by an assembly of the delegates of ethnic Romanians in Transylvania. Following the Treaty of Trianon, eventually Transylvania became part of Romania.

==Bulgaria==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Bulgaria and Romania are neighbors, however, both two countries have been in conflicts in the past, especially over the [[Dobruja]] region. In the 1st millennium AD, [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] owned the territory of modern-day Romania. For many Bulgarians{{which|date=August 2017}}, at that time, Romanians were considered as being just Bulgarians, who spoke Bulgarian and belonged to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], a fact denied by the Romanians{{which|date=August 2017}}. It remained controversial even until the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s arrival to the Balkans.

After 1878, when Romania became independent, the two countries tried to resolve the conflict until the [[Second Balkan War]], when Romania attacked [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and took [[Tutrakan]] from the country, causing anti-Romanian sentiment to raise to higher levels. During [[World War I]], Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] and occupied [[Bucharest]] and Dobruja including the now retaken Tutrakan, which is still a part of Bulgaria today. After the end of the war, however, relations cooled down. In 1940, by the [[Treaty of Craiova]] Dobruja was divided between them with Bulgaria getting the Southern part and Romania getting the Northern part. After, in [[World War 2]], the two countries were allies. After the establishment of the Eastern Bloc, both countries became [[socialist]] republics, which furthered the friendship. The two countries currently have strong ties and have a very special relationship (both joined the [[EU]] in 2007), considering their opposed linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

Although the 1940 issue was reaffirmed later in 1947 by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]], today, most Romanians and Bulgarians get along with each other, but Romania is still being held at a negatively by certain groups{{which|date=August 2017}}, which still believe the whole of Romania belongs to them or at least all the Dobruja region.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Russian Empire==

[[Bessarabia]] became a part of the [[Russian Empire]] according to the 1812 [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. &lt;!---DO NOT USE ANNEXATION HERE! One cannot "annex" through the treaty. Read [[annexation]]---&gt; A period of autonomy followed, after which all Romanian government institutions, schools and presses were closed and replaced by a [[Russia]]n-style provincial administration in 1828. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Bessarabia saw an intense process of [[Russification]]. Military service also became a new instrument of Russification. The process of Russification and colonization of this territory started to be carried out by representatives of other ethnic groups of the Russian Empire, including [[Jew]]s, [[Bessarabia Germans|Germans]], [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]], [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]], and [[Ukrainians]].

== Soviet Union (including the 1917 Revolution) ==

When the Russian Empire collapsed after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], a local body called “[[Sfatul Ţării]]” ("Council of the Country") was created in Bessarabia. Moldova became an independent republic on December 2, 1917. Given that Soviet raids already menaced the newly formed authority, the local body ("Sfatul Ţării") called in support troops from the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. The troops entered [[Bessarabia]] on December 13. On March 27, 1918, the local body ([[Sfatul Ţării]]) voted to unite with [[Romania]]. Subsequently, the Soviet Union refused to recognize the union, and supported an intense propaganda stating that the Kingdom of Romania was an imperialistic multi-ethnic state.

Bessarabia was a part of Romania until 1940 when the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] re-annexed the territory as well as Northern [[Bukovina]].

The convention of October 28, 1920, whereby the [[British Empire]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] recognized Romanian sovereignty in Bessarabia, was rejected as invalid by the USSR. Moscow even denied the validity of that part of the convention that stipulated that, upon Russian request, the Council of the League of Nations could be empowered to arbitrate the Russo-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia. In short, the Kremlin insisted that Romania was illegally occupying Bessarabia. Moscow also encouraged revolutionary activities by Bolshevik elements in Bessarabia.

The exact position of the USSR on these issues is unknown except for Moscow's unwillingness to make any concessions to [[Bucharest]] on Bessarabian issues. Recent tracts by Romanian historians have emphasized the support given by Romanian Communists to the "democratic forces" opposed to alteration of the status quo in [[Transylvania]] in 1938 and subsequent years. True as this may be, there has been no evidence presented in support of any fundamental change in Moscow's positions with respect to Bessarabia in 1938 and subsequent years.

According to official NKVD documents, over 15,000 Romanians from Northern Bukovina were deported to [[Siberia]] in 1940 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gabriel Gherasim, [http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=3 Românii din Ucraina (2), p. 3] ("Romanians in Ukraine (2)", p. 3), ''Noi, NU! Revistă de atitudine şi de cultură'', August 7, 2005. Accessed online December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet action culminated with the [[Fântâna Albă massacre]] when 2,500 to 3,000 Romanian refugees who were attempting to leave Northern Bukovina for Romania were blocked by the [[USSR Border Troops]] and about 200 of them were shot, at a place called "Fântâna Albă" (''White Fountain'' in Romanian). This policy resulted in a substantial shrinkage of the Romanian population in the province. By 1941, out of 250,000 Romanians in Northern Bukovina, only 192,000 were left.

The territory of the [[Moldavian SSR]] was composed of Bessarabia (except for Southern Bessarabia, assigned to [[Ukraine]]) and a part of the territory of the former [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] ([[Transnistria]]), founded in 1924 within the territory of Ukraine. In the document confirming the establishment of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) of 12 October 1924 the West frontier of the republic was traced out not along the Dniester River but the [[Prut River]]. In the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|MASSR]] the ideology of a separate Moldovan identity was pursued, including the introduction of [[Moldovan language]], distinct from Romanian. The Cyrillic alphabet and abundant [[Russianism|Russisms]] were introduced.

Another historical event which contributed to the future implementation of the anti-Romanian feelings was [[Romania during World War II|Romania’s behaviour in World War II]], when the Romanian regime allied itself with [[Nazi Germany]].

In Bessarabia, the Soviet government pursued a policy of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the native Romanian population. First, the province was divided into a "Moldovan" Socialist Republic and a southern region known as [[Budjak]], which was renamed [[Izmail Oblast]] and attached to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Elite elements of the Romanian population were then deported to Siberia much like their Bukovinian counterparts. Russian and Ukrainian settlers were used to fill the vacant areas caused by the deportation of Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Nina Negru, [http://www.jurnal.md/articol.php?id=3652&amp;editie=409 Nu-i lua cu fericirile - disciplinează-i cu decalogul] ("Don't reach out to them with promises of happiness, discipline them with the Ten Commandments"), ''Jurnal de Chişinău'', Edition 409, 30 August 2005. Accessed online 20 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946-1947, as a result of the famine organised{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} in the [[Moldavian SSR|MSSR]] (according to some data of certain scientists; official data has not yet been published), around 300,000 died and many cases of cannibalism occurred{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. In addition, the population of the former MASSR, as a part of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], also suffered from the artificial famine in the 1930s when several million people died in Ukraine (''see also [[Holodomor]]'').

The territory of Transnistria was more industrialised in comparison with the other part of [[Moldova]] and the industrialisation process of Transnistria was accompanied by a population flow from other areas of the USSR, especially from Russia. Although in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] the level of population density was the highest one in the USSR, [[Moscow]] continued to stimulate the arrival of labour force from outside, including that with a poor qualification. Even [[Igor Smirnov]] himself, current leader of the separatist regime of Transnistria, was sent in 1987 from [[Russia]] to [[Tighina|Bender]] to be the director of an enterprise. This process was also amplified by the excessive militarization of the area.

The 1989 adoption of the Law on state language (official language) and Law on functioning of languages on the territory of the MSSR generated an extremely negative reaction in the industrial centres of Transnistria, where the largely [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking population was not being consulted, and felt threatened by the prospects of [[Romanianization]]. These laws proclaimed the Moldovan (Romanian) language, written in the Latin alphabet, as the only state language. The fact that [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] are identical was recognised. Although a majority of the Transnistrian population never read these laws which served as a reason for the conflict's outburst, they feared that by the application of the new linguistic legislation, [[Russian language]] speakers would become second-class citizens. At the industrial enterprises, including those of the military-industrial complex of the USSR, strikes occurred protesting against granting official language status to the Moldavian (Romanian) language.

==Post-Soviet Moldova==

After the breakup of the USSR, various legislative reforms consolidated the position of ethnic Romanians/Moldovans, especially by establishing the [[Moldovan language]] as the official language. The 2001 parliamentary elections, won by the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], initially brought a series of attempts to raise Russian to the status of a state language. However, the project was dropped by popular opposition.

Relations between the Moldovan and Romanian governments have initially included some tension as the Moldovan government led by President [[Vladimir Voronin]] accused Romania of ''[[imperialism]]''. Nevertheless, in the recent past relations have improved and President Voronin as well as Romanian President [[Traian Băsescu]] have called for cooperation between the two sovereign states.

In 2006, the [[Gheorghe Asachi]] Romanian-French School was forced by the government to change its name to the Gheorghe Asachi Moldovan-French School. Critics argued that the government acted unilaterally and discriminated against Romanians, as other schools such as the Necui-Leviţki Russian-Ukrainian School were allowed to continue using that name. In protest, four high school students from Asachi replaced the new high school sign with another with the old name. They were charged with "group-committed aggravated hooliganism".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.gandul.info/articol_10181/4_elevi_moldoveni_risca_inchisoarea__pentru_ca_sustin_ca_sunt_romani.html 4 elevi moldoveni risca inchisoarea, pentru ca sustin ca sunt romani] ("Four Moldovan students risk imprisonment for sustaining that they are Romanians"), ''Gândul'', 8 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Transnistria, the situation is considered to be far worse than the rest of Moldova. After the [[War of Transnistria|1992 war]], the Romanian population was substantially persecuted, causing at least 5,000 to 10,000 Romanians to flee the region. Although the number of Romanians in Transnistria is significant, Romanian is almost never used in public.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Romanian schools comprise about 11% of the total schools in Transnistria. Most of the schools are forced to teach in the [[Cyrillic]] script and use outdated, 40-year-old, communist-era books, and 6 schools are permitted to teach in Romanian using the [[Latin script]]; however, pressure is often put on the institutions to close. The [[Moldovan schools in Transnistria|2004 school crisis]] is a prime example of this, when the pro-Russian government in [[Tiraspol]] forcefully attempted to close down 2 of the schools. In the orphanage of [[Tighina]], Romanian children returning from vacations found the orphanage locked by police. After spending a night outdoors, they forced their way into the building and had to stay there without water and electricity for a few months, until pressure from the Moldovan and Romanian governments and from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) made the conflict get resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/publications/sg/2005/07/15621_425_en.pdf OSCE report about Romanian language in Transnistria]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Romanian parents were arrested or fired from their jobs for their political views and their determination to keep their children in Romanian-language schools.

Citizens who express pro-Romanian or pro-Moldovan attitudes are likewise persecuted in Transnistria. The [[Ilie Ilaşcu]] group is the most commonly known and well-documented of organisation.

==Ukraine==
[[Northern Bukovina]], as well as the [[Tiachiv]] and [[Rakhiv]] [[raion]]s (districts) of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] (Transcarpathia), are the regions in Ukraine with considerable Romanian minorities, according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]].

The Ukrainian Census of 2001 was criticized by Dr. Ion Popescu, leader of the National Council of the Interregional Union of the Romanian Community in Ukraine and also one of the authors of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], who claims that the very existence of the classification of Moldovans as a separate ethnic group in census results is a "continuation of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and Soviet policies of artificially dividing Romanians into [[Romanians]] and [[Moldovans]]"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141344/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=19.]&lt;!---is this a quote? than quotation marks are in order if not, pls replace with the exact quote---&gt;. However, the response to the census question about the ethnicity had to be written in into the census form rather than picked from a pre-determined set of choices and the census respondents were free to claim their ethnicity as they wished &lt;ref name=Censform&gt;[http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/organization/ The Census form] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830230721/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/organization/ |date=August 30, 2006 }} at the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine web-site.&lt;/ref&gt;  not to respond to this or any other particular census question or not answer any questions at all; besides, no allegation of counting fraud were ever brought up. It is therefore unclear if Dr. Popescu criticizes the way in which the census was conducted or the way in which data was processed.

The number of Romanian students at [[Chernivtsi University]] declined sharply in Soviet times. In 1991-92, the last year of Soviet rule, the number of Romanian students was only 4.44% (434 out of 9,769) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141344/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=19.]. Among teaching faculty, under-representation of Romanians is also evident. The breakdown by nationalities (in the same year) reveals: Ukrainian teachers 465 (77.1%), Russians 102 (16.9%), Moldovans 9 (1.4%), Romanians 7 (1.1%), Belorussians 6 (0.9%), etc. Even after Ukrainian independence, the number of Romanian students at the University continued to decline, to only 3.9% in 1992-93, which is much less than the overall percentage of Romanians in the region's general population. Since 1997, arrangements have been made for some students to study at universities in Romania [http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.phparticleID=149&amp;document=19]. In 2001 the [[Christian-Democratic Alliance of the Romanians]] from Ukraine reported that Romanians in [[Chernivtsi]] lack an opportunity to study at the university level in their native language.[http://www.minelres.lv/minelres/archive/04052001-10:44:51-22702.html]

However, it should be noted that according to the Ukrainian Constitution adopted after its 1991 independence, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the only [[state language]] in the country, and the state higher education system was switched to Ukrainian, according to the common practice in many countries worldwide and this practice was not directed specifically at the Romanian population. For example, the majority of Ukrainian universities do not provide education in [[Russian language|Russian]] either, despite the fact that Russian is the native language of a much more considerable part of the population in Ukraine.

At the same time, there are schools teaching Romanian as a primary language, as well as newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting in Romanian [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3384&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090514084325/http://www.saske.sk/cas/1-2000/gulpa-petrisce.html], [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3377&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0]. Future teachers for Romanian schools are trained in at the Chernivtsi University in the fields of Romanian philology, mathematics and physics [http://www.chnu.cv.ua/index.php?page=ua/gradinf/rules/02bac_d]. Romanian organizations still complain that despite this, 19 villages inhabited by Romanians have been deprived of schooling in their native language, therefore creating a worse situation than that which existed under the repressive Soviet regime [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141332/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=146&amp;document=3].

==Yugoslavia and modern Serbia==
The [[Romanians of Serbia|Romanians]] living in the Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]] are very well represented at the provincial level despite their small presence (about 30,000 people, 1.5% of the province's population of around 2 million), and Romanian is one of the six official languages of the province. However, their counterparts in Eastern [[Central Serbia]] (mostly in the [[Timočka Krajina|Timok Valley]] and [[Braničevo (region)|Branicevo]]), known as [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and outnumbering the Vojvodinian Romanians, have not had any privileges. As example from [[Negotin]] in [[Vrsac]], the Romanian local television station door was vandalized with the inscription "Out Romanians, Serbia!!!" (Serbian: ''Napolje Rumuni, Srbija!!!'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Hronika/342455/Grafiti-mrznje-u-Vrscu-Napolje-Rumuni|title=Blic Online - Grafiti mržnje u Vršcu: "Napolje Rumuni!"|work=Blic Online|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Timok Vlachs speak the same dialect ([[Daco-Romanian]]) as is spoken to the north, in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Thede Kahl, Ethnizität und räumliche Verteilung der Aromunen in Südosteuropa. Münster, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Serbian authorities have pursued a policy of de-nationalization as they have slowly changed the term ''Romanian'' into ''Vlach'' through the years.&lt;ref&gt;M. V. Fifor. Assimilation or Acculturalisation: Creating Identities in the New Europe. The case of Vlachs in Serbia. Published in Cultural Identity and Ethnicity in Central Europe, [[Jagellonian University]], Cracow. M.Fifor Assimilation or Acculturalisation: Creating Identities in the New Europe.

These people declare themselves on census forms as ethnic [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and their number is about 40,000. Nevertheless, older Serbian censuses counted up to 200,000 Romanians (Vlachs) in present-day Central Serbia (the 1895-census counted 159,510 Romanians, the 1921-census counted 150,098 Romanians, the 1953-census counted 198,793 [[Vlach language in Serbia|Vlach (Romanian)]] - speakers).

Since 2004 they are regular clashes between the Serbian authorities and the Romanian community in Timok when [[Bojan Aleksandrovic]], a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest decided to build a small church where he would hold services in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. The priest has been subjected to threats while children attending mass with their parents have been humiliated in the village school by their Serbian teacher. Romanians in Serbia proper do not have the right to schooling and public worship in their native language.&lt;ref name="Protests on the Council of Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10533.htm|title=Assemblée parlementaire du Conseil de l'Europe|work=coe.int|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,850103,00.html] April 25, 2003 on [[Deutsche Welle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 accusations of discrimination in [[Covasna]] surfaced against Hungarian students and teachers. During a ceremony for the national day of Hungary, some Romanian students wearing the Romanian flag were physically assaulted by older students, and threatened by teachers with punishment for wearing the national symbol. As a result, the Romanian human rights organisation ActiveWatch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.activewatch.ro/en/about-us/about-activewatch/|title=About ActiveWatch|work=ActiveWatch|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued a statement condemning the actions of the school's administration, which it considers a blunt infringement of human rights and freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="activewatch.ro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.activewatch.ro/ro/freeex/reactie-rapida/dreptul-la-libera-exprimare-reprimat-abuziv-de-conducerea-unui-liceu-din-covasna/|title=Dreptul la liberă exprimare reprimat abuziv de conducerea unui liceu din Covasna|work=ActiveWatch|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="activewatch.ro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/news/eveniment/protest-sabina-fetita-bentita-tricolor-zeci-persoane-costume-nationale-steaguri-romanesti-s-au-adunat-liceul-covasna-1_514c16d200f5182b853d5d1d/index.html|title=UPDATE Sute de persoane protestează în mai multe oraşe din ţară pentru susţinerea Sabinei, fata cu bentiţa tricoloră|work=adevarul.ro|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitatea.net/bentita-tricolora-protest-in-costume-nationale-la-liceul-din-covasna-elevii-nu-au-intrat-la-ore_1140838.html|title=BENTIŢA TRICOLORĂ.

In 2009, a right-wing political party ([[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP)) had run an anti-immigration campaign, against Romanians and Bulgarians, distributing and displaying banners depicting citizens of these countries as "crows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithaca.edu/rhp/programs/cmd/blogs/posters_and_election_propaganda/another_anti-immigrant_poster_in_switzerland/|title=Posters and Election Propaganda|work=ithaca.edu|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Romanian sentiment in the European Union refers to the discrimination of Romanian citizens within the European Union.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} As a member of the E.U., Romanian citizens have faced ethnic profiling in various [[Europe|European]] countries and open discrimination in countries like Italy or Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===United Kingdom===
In June 2009, having had their windows broken and deaths threats made against them, twenty Romanian families were forced from their homes in [[Lisburn Road]], [[Belfast]], in [[Northern Ireland]]. Up to 115 people, including women and children, were forced to seek refuge in a local [[church hall]] after being attacked. They were later moved by the authorities to a safer location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0618/1224249058810.html|title=Racist attacks on Roma are latest low in North's intolerant history|date=18 June 2009|publisher=irishtimes.com|accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] rally in the city on 15 June was attacked by youths chanting [[neo-Nazi]] slogans.

Following the arrest of three local youths in relation to the attacks, the church where the Romanians had been given shelter was badly vandalised.

Based on growing dissatisfaction with the European Union, several British politicians have posed a stance against the free movement of Romanians (and Bulgarians) within the E.U. and subsequently in the United Kingdom. As a result, multiple British newspapers have started publishing discriminatory articles about Romanian citizens, thus inciting an anti-Romanian sentiment; mainly against the Roma minority.

In 2013, Romanian ambassador [[Ion Jinga]] stated that a part of the British media launched a series of negative articles concerning Romanians, with reference to their “invasion”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2686/uk-cannot-afford-eu-open-borders-any-longer&lt;/ref&gt; to the United Kingdom, criminality, social benefits abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Public service Europe: http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2686/uk-cannot-afford-eu-open-borders-any-longer&lt;/ref&gt; and accusing Romania of involvement in the [[2013 horse meat scandal|meat adulteration scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2277223/Horsemeat-central-Inside-abattoir-Romania-revealed-main-source-contaminated-products.html|title=Horsemeat central: Inside the abattoir in Romania revealed as main source of contaminated products - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador Jinga responded to these allegations through a series of interviews and articles in British newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;ITV: Alarmist predictions' over immigrants can cause racism:  www.itv.com/news/update/2013-02-22/alarmist-predictions...

In 2013, the [[Daily Express]] newspaper launched a 'Crusade' against new [[European Union]] migrants from [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. The frontpage on Thursday 31 October declared 'Britain is full and fed up. Today join your Daily Express Crusade to stop new flood of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants'. [[UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] declared that he had signed the petition, and urged other to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/440538/I-ve-signed-the-Express-petition-you-should-too-Remember-it-ll-be-Albanians-next|title=I’ve signed the Express petition – you should too!

===Germany===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In 2013 a prominent German newspaper, Der Spiegel, has published a short video displaying Roma-Romanians living in the city of Duisburg. The video shows a small number of Roma-Romanians and uncensored under-aged children living in a ghetto-like part of the city, without access to proper public services and living in poor housing conditions. Although there is no proof that the Romanian citizens were unemployed, the video claims they are a burden on the local welfare system. The discriminatory aspect of this video is visible through the fact that a number of German citizens are shown living in the same conditions; yet blaming the foreign citizens. This further increases the anti-Romanian sentiment, in a country where the majority of Romanian (and Bulgarian) citizens are well integrated.

===France===
Historically, France had cultivated a [[France–Romania relations|close relationship]] with the [[Romanian Principalities]] being a strong supporter of their independence and unification in 1859 and ultimately  of Greater Romania in 1918. Many of the prominent Romanian scientists and artists like [[Henry Coanda]] and [[Constantin Brancusi]] had studied and worked in Paris and Bucharest was nicknamed Le Petit Paris for its cosmopolitan atmosphere. Furthermore, the [[Romanian flag]] bears homage to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] and has been interpreted as Liberty (blue) Justice (yellow) Fraternity (Red). 
Following the deportation of [[Roma-Romanian]] citizens from France, and numerous discriminatory articles in the French media, a small protest occurred in front of the French embassy in Bucharest, against the discrimination against Romanians in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/romanians-protest-discrimination-french-media-111226486.html|title=Romanians protest discrimination in French media|date=13 October 2011|work=[[Yahoo News]]|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===

A Dutch right wing political party ([[Wilders’ Freedom party]] (PVV)), launched a website aimed at gathering denunciations against Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/justice/dutch-website-causes-stir-centra-news-510729|title=Dutch website causes stir in Central Europe|work=EurActiv - EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denunciations consist of competition on the job market, and others, with the slogan: “Are they causing you problems? Or did you lose your job to a Pole, Bulgarian, Romanian or other Central or East European? We would love to hear from you,”; thus inciting social tension between European Citizens exercising their treaty right of freedom of movement and the local population. The Netherlands is one of the main countries blocking Romania and Bulgaria from joining the [[Schengen Agreement]]; as well as one of the countries with growing populism.

In 1980, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet scientists]] G.R. Ivanitsky, V.I. Krinsky, A.N. Zaikin, [[Anatoly Zhabotinsky|A.M. Zhabotinsky]],&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zaikin-1970"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zhabotinsky-1973"/&gt;&lt;ref group = "B:" name="b-Zhabotinsky-1974"/&gt; [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|B.P. Belousov]] became winners of the highest state award of the [[USSR]], [[:ru:Лауреаты Ленинской премии|Lenin Prize]] "''for the discovery of a new class of autowave processes and the study of them in disturbance of stability of the distributed excitable systems''."

=== A brief history of autowave researches ===

The first who studied actively the [[Self-exciting oscillation|self-oscillations]] was Academician [[Aleksandr Andronov|AA Andronov]], and the term "''auto-oscillations''" in Russian terminology was introduced by AA Andronov in 1928. His followers&lt;ref group = "note" name="P003"/&gt; from [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|Lobachevsky University]] further contributed greatly to the development of ''autowave theory''.

The simplest autowave equations describing combustion processes have been studied by [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A.N. Kolmogorov]],&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kolmogorov-1937"/&gt; I.E. Petrovsky, [[:ru:Пискунов, Николай Семёнович|N.S. Piskunov]] in 1937., as well as by [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Ya.B. Zel'dovich]] и [[David A. Frank-Kamenetskii|D.A. Frank-Kamenetsky]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zeldovich-1938"/&gt; in 1938.

The classical axiomatic model with autowaves in myocardium was published in 1946 by [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]].&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;

During 1970-80, major efforts to study autowaves were concentrated in the [[Institute of Biological Physics in Pushchino|Institute of Biological Physics]] of [[Russian Academy of Sciences|the USSR Academy of Sciences]], located in the suburban town [[Pushchino]], near Moscow. It was here, under the guidance of V.I.Krinsky,  such world-famous now experts in the field of the autowave researches as A.V.Panfilov, I.R.Efimov, R.R.Aliev, K.I. Agladze, O.A.Mornev, M.A.Tsyganov were educated and trained. V.V.Biktashev, Yu.E. Elkin, A.V. Moskalenko gained their experience with the autowave theory also in Pushchino, in the neighboring [[Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology]], under the guidance of E.E.Shnoll.

{{centered pull quote|The term "autowave processes" for all these (and other) phenomena was coined by the USSR physicist R.V. Khokhlov. There are definite and important relations between these autowaves and ideas from synergetics and self-organisation. |author= V. A. Vasiliev etc. (1987)|source=&lt;ref group="B:" name=" b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;}}

The term "''autowaves''" was proposed, probably, on the analogy of previously "''auto-oscillations''".

Almost immediately after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], many of these Russian scientists left their native country for working in foreign institutions, where they still continue their studies of autowaves. In particular,  E.R.Efimov is developing the ''theory of virtual electrode'',&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-2004"/&gt; which describes some effects occurring during [[defibrillation]].

Among other notable scientists, who are engaged in these investigation, there are A.N. Zaikin and E.E.Shnoll (autowaves and [[bifurcation memory]] in the blood coagulation system);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2002ufn"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2007ufn"/&gt; A.Yu. Loskutov (general autowave theory as well as dynamic chaos in autowaves);&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Loskutov-1995"/&gt; V.G. Yakhno (general autowave theory as well as connections between autowaves and process of thinking);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Yakhno-1979"/&gt; K.I. Agladze (autowaves in chemical media);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Agladze-1982"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Agladze-1984"/&gt; V.N.Biktashev (general autowave theory as well as different sorts of autowave drift);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1994"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1995"/&gt; O.A.Mornev (general autowave theory);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Mornev-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Mornev-2004"/&gt; M.A.Tsyganov (the role of autowave in population dynamics);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Tsyganov-1993"/&gt; Yu.E. Elkin, A.V. Moskalenko, ([[bifurcation memory]] in a model of cardiac tissue).&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;

A huge role in the study of autowave models of cardiac tissue belongs to [[Denis Noble]] and members of his team from the [[University of Oxford]].

=== The basic definitions ===

One of the first definitions of autowaves was as follows: {{centered pull quote|It is accepted now to consider an autowave as some self-sustaining wave process in a non-equilibrium environment that remain unchanged for sufficiently small changes in both the initial and boundary conditions. (...) Mathematical apparatus for describing autowaves often are [[Reaction-diffusion|the equations of the diffusion type with an active nonlinearity]].

Под автоволнами принято сейчас понимать самоподдерживающийся волновой процесс в неравновесной среде, остающийся неизменным при достаточно малых изменениях как начальных, так и граничных условий.

Unlike linear waves — such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves and other, which are inherent in [[conservative system]]s and mathematically described by linear second order [[Hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic equations]] ([[wave equation]]s), — dynamics of an ''autowave'' in terms of [[differential equations]] can be described by [[Parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic equation]] ''with nonlinear free member of a special form''.

The concrete form of the free member &lt;math&gt;\vec{f}(\vec{u})&lt;/math&gt; is extremely important, because: {{centered pull quote|

''Autowaves'' is an example of a self-sustaining wave process in extensive nonlinear systems containing distributed energy sources. It is correct for simple autowaves, that period, wavelength, propagation speed, amplitude, and some other characteristics of an autowave are determined solely by local properties of the medium. However, in the 21st century, researchers began to discover a growing number of examples of self-wave solutions when the "classical" principle is violated.

(See also general information in literature, for example, in&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Krinsky-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-SE_v01-1988"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Loskutov-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2002ufn"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2007ufn"/&gt;).

=== The simplest examples ===

[[File:Travelling wave for Fisher equation.svg|thumb|right|A switching wave front solution for Fisher's equation (See [[Reaction-diffusion]] for details).]]
The simplest model of autowave is a rank of dominoes that are falling one after another, if you drop an outermost one (so called "[[domino effect]]"). This is an example of a ''switching wave''.

As another example of autowaves, imagine that you stand on a field and set fire to the grass. While the temperature is below the threshold, the grass will not take fire. Upon reaching the ''threshold'' temperature ([[autoignition temperature]]) the [[combustion]] process begins, with the release of heat sufficient to ignite the nearest areas. The result is that the combustion front has been shaped, which spreads through the field. It can be said in such cases that autowave arose, which is one of the results of [[self-organization]] in non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. After some time new grass replaces the burnt grass, and the field acquires again the ability for igniting. This is an example of an ''excitation wave''.

There are a great deal of other natural objects that are also considered among autowave processes: oscillatory [[chemical reaction]]s in active media (e.g., [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]), the spread of excitation pulses along nerve fibres, wave chemical signalling in the colonies of certain microorganisms, autowaves in [[ferroelectric]] and [[semiconductor]] films, population waves, spread of [[epidemics]] and of [[genes]], and many other [[phenomena]].

Nerve impulses, which serve as a typical example of autowaves in an active medium with recovery, were studied as far back as 1850 by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. The properties of nerve impulses that are typical for the simplest self-wave solutions (universal shape and amplitude, independent of the initial conditions, and annihilation under collisions) were ascertained in the 1920s and 1930s.

[[File:Action potential.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic of an [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] recording of an action potential showing the various phases that occur as the wave passes a point on a cell [[biological membrane|membrane]].]]
Let's consider a 2D active medium consisting of elements, each of which can be found in three different states: rest, excitation and [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractoriness]]. In the absence of external influence, elements are at rest. As a result of an influence upon it, when the concentration of the activator reaches the threshold, the element will switch to an excited state, acquiring the ability to excite the neighbouring elements. Some time after the excitation the element switches to a refractory state, in which it cannot be excited. Then the element return to its initial state of rest, gaining again the ability to transform into an excited state.

Any "classical" excitation wave moves in an excitable medium without attenuation, maintaining its shape and amplitude constant. As it passes, the energy loss ([[dissipation]]) is completely offset by the energy input from the elements of the active medium. The leading front of an autowave (the transition from rest to a state of excitation) is usually very small: for example, the ratio of the leading front duration to the entire duration of the pulse for a myocardium sample is about 1:330.

Unique opportunities to study the autowave processes in two- and three-dimensional active media with very different kinetics are provided with methods of mathematical modelling using computers. For computer simulation of autowaves, one uses a generalized Wiener–Rosenblueth model, as well as a large number of other models, among which a special place is occupied by The [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]]  (the simplest model of an active medium, and its various versions) and The [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] (nerve impulse). There are also many autowave myocardial models: The [[Beeler–Reuter model]], several Noble models (developed by [[Denis Noble]]), The [[Aliev–Panfilov model]], The [[Fenton-Karma model]], etc.

=== Basic properties of autowaves ===

It was also proven&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that the simplest autowave regimes should be common to every system of differential equations of any complexity that describe a particular active media, because such a system can be simplified to two differential equations.

== Main known autowave objects ==

First of all, we should notice, that the elements of the active media can be, at least, of three very different types; these are ''[[Self-exciting oscillation|self-exciting]]'', ''[[Excitable medium|excitable]]'' and ''[[wikt:trigger|trigger]]'' (or ''bistable'') regimes. Accordingly, there are three types of homogeneous active media composed of these elements.

A bistable element has two stable stationary states, transitions between which occur when external influence exceeds a certain threshold. In media of such elements, ''switching waves'' arise, which switch the medium from one of its states to the other. For instance, a classic case of such a switching autowave — perhaps, the simplest autowave phenomena — is falling dominoes (the example already given). Another simple example of a bistable medium is burning paper: the switching wave propagates in the form of a flame, switching paper from the normal state to its ashes.

An excitable element has only one stable stationary state. External influence over a threshold level can bring such an element out of its stationary state and perform an evolution before the element will return again to its stationary state. During such evolution, the active element can affect the adjacent elements and, in turn, lead them out of the stationary state too. As a result,  the ''excitation wave'' propagates in this medium. This is the most common form of autowaves in biological media, such as nervous tissue, or the myocardium.

[[File:Typical phase portraits of autowaves.gif|thumb|300px|right|Phase portraits (left column) and the corresponding behaviour (right column) of an element of an active medium:  '''A''' (upper row) — excitable, '''B''' — bistable, '''C''' (lower row) — self-oscillating element types.]]
A self-oscillating element has no stationary states and continually performs stable oscillations of some fixed form, amplitude and frequency. External influence can disturb these oscillations. After some relaxation time, all their characteristics except for the phase back to its stable value, but the phase can be changed. As a result, the ''phase waves'' spread in the medium of such elements. Such phase waves can be observed in electro-garlands or in certain chemical media. An example of a self-oscillating medium is the SA node in the heart, in which excitation pulses arise spontaneously.

It can be clearly seen on the phase portrait of the basic system of equations describing the active medium (see Fig.) that a significant difference between these three types of behaviour of an active medium is caused by the quantity and the position of its singular points. The shape of autowaves observed in reality can be very similar to each other, and therefore it can be difficult to assess the type of element only by the form of the excitation pulse.

Besides, autowave phenomena, which can be observed and investigated, depend greatly on geometrical and topological peculiarities of an active medium.

=== One-dimensional autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

One-dimensional cases include autowave spread in cable and its spread in the ring, with the latter mode considering as a limiting case of a rotating wave in two-dimensional active medium, while the first case is considered as spread of the autowave in the ring with zero curvature (i.e., with an infinite radius).

=== Two-dimensional autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

[[File:reaction diffusion spiral.gif|thumb|265px|left|Autowave reverberator found in the above two-component [[Reaction-diffusion|reaction-diffusion system]] of [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|Fitzhugh-Nagumo]] type.]]
A number of autowave sources is known in the two-dimensional active media. In such a way, it is distinguished at least five type of re-entry,&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt; which are ''running around the ring'', ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'' (i.e., ''two-dimensional autowave vortex'') and ''fibrillation''. The literature identifies two types of sources of ''concentric autowaves'' in 2D active media; these are ''pacemakers'' and ''leading centres''. Both the ''leading centres'' and ''reverberators'' are interesting, because they are not tied to the structure of the medium and can appear and disappear in its different parts. Areas of increased automation may also be an example of a sources of autowaves. Three different types of increased automation are known now:&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;
# ''induced automatism''
# ''trigger automatism with the mechanism of early postdepolarisation''
# ''trigger automatism with the mechanism of late postdepolarisation''.

=== The population autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

{{centered pull quote|Collective amoebae [[Dictyostelium discoideum]] with a sufficient supply live as [[unicellular organism]]s. However, during starvation they crawl together with forming a [[multicellular organism]], which later gives [[spores]] that can survive under adverse conditions. It was found that the movement of amoebae is controlled by distribution of some substance, [[morphogen]] [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]],  in the environment. Such amoeba cells synthesize and accumulate the molecules of cAMP and then they are able to "release" this reserve into the environment, if the concentration of cAMP in it increased. The released quantity of cAMP diffuses through the environment and makes the following cell amoebas "snap into action" by throwing their portion of the morphogen out. As a result, an autowave of high concentration of cAMP spreads through the environment. After the passage of the wave, the "discharged" cells begin to accumulate a new portion of cAMP again, due to the synthesis, and after a while they are able to "snap into action" again.Thus, the population of the ''collective amoebae'' is a typical example of the [[active medium]].

Коллективные амёбы [[Dictyostelium discoideum]] при наличие достаточного питания живут в виде [[:ru:Одноклеточный организм|одноклеточных организмов]]. Однако при голодании они сползаются и образуют [[:ru:Многоклеточный организм]], который впоследствии даёт [[:ru:споры]], способные пережить неблагоприятные условия. Установлено, что движение амёб управляется распределением по среде некоторого вещества — ''морфогена'' [[:ru:Циклический аденозинмонофосфат|цАМФ]]. Клетки амёб синтезируют и накапливают в себе молекулы цАМФ и способны «высвободить» его запас в окружающую среду, если концентрация цАМФ в ней повысилась. Освободившееся количество цАМФ распространяется за счёт диффузии по среде и заставляет следующие клетки амёб «сработать», выбросив свою порцию морфогена. В результате по среде распространяется автоволна — повышенная концентрация цАМФ. После прохождения волны «разрядившиеся» клетки начинают вновь накапливать за счёт синтеза определённую порцию цАМФ и по прошествии некоторого времени способны «срабатывать» вновь. Таким образом, популяция ''коллективных амёб'' служит типичным примером активной среды. {{hidden end}}

&lt;ref name="P001"&gt;Now the sad role of re-entry as the causes of various cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized. The basic scheme re-entry was proposed as long ago as 1914, with being obtained in studies of isolated cardiac tissue rings (GR Mines — Trans.R.Soc.Can., 1914, 8, 43).  T.Lewis etc. demonstrated in 1921 that atrial flutter may be conditioned by the circulation of the excitation wave down the right and up the left atrium (Heart, 1921, 8, 361). This fact was again confirmed experimentally in the middle of 20th century by C.E.Cabrera and D.Soli-Pollares (Arch. Inst. Cardiol. Mex., 1947, 17,850). The essential role of re-entry as a pathogenetic mechanism of supraventricular tachycardia was suggested in 1928 by F.O.Schmidt and J.Erlanger (Am. J. Physiol. 1928-1929, 87, 326). It is also responsible for many types of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Aristotle]], whose ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' contained an early discussion of this fallacy]]
'''Begging the question''' is a [[logical fallacy]] that occurs when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. It is a type of [[circular reasoning]] and an [[informal fallacy]]: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.

The phrase ''begging the question'' originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}},'' which actually translates to "assuming the initial point".&lt;ref name="Liberman"/&gt; In modern [[vernacular]] usage, "begging the question" is frequently&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/begging-the-question-again/|title=Begging the Question, Again|last=Corbett|first=Philip B.|date=1222390395|website=After Deadline Blog|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to mean "raising the question" or "[[Question dodging|dodging the question]]".&lt;ref name="Liberman"/&gt; In contexts that demand strict adherence to a technical definition of the term, many consider these usages incorrect.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/begging-the-question-again/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 |title=Begging the Question, Again |first=Philip B. |last=Corbett |date=25 September 2008 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
: Africa is the largest continent because it has the largest area of any continent.
: Left-handed people are better painters because right-handed people can't paint as well.

Both these arguments are logically valid in that, assuming the initial premise is correct, the conclusion logically follows. But they are nonetheless unpersuasive because assuming the initial premise to be correct also means assuming the conclusion is correct.

== History ==
The original phrase used by [[Aristotle]] from which ''begging the question'' descends is: τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς (or sometimes ἐν ἀρχῇ) αἰτεῖν, "asking for the initial thing." Aristotle's intended meaning is closely tied to the type of [[dialectic]]al argument he discusses in his ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'', book VIII: a formalized debate in which the defending party asserts a thesis that the attacking party must attempt to refute by asking yes-or-no questions and deducing some inconsistency between the responses and the original thesis.

In this stylized form of debate, the proposition that the answerer undertakes to defend is called "the initial thing" (τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς, τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ) and one of the rules of the debate is that the questioner cannot simply ask for it (that would be trivial and uninteresting). Aristotle discusses this in ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' and in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' book II, (64b, 34–65a 9, for circular reasoning see 57b, 18–59b, 1).

The stylized dialectical exchanges Aristotle discusses in the ''Topics'' included rules for scoring the debate, and one important issue was precisely the matter of ''asking for the initial thing''—which included not just making the actual thesis adopted by the answerer into a question, but also making a question out of a sentence that was too close to that thesis (for example, ''[[Prior Analytics|PA]]'' II 16).

The term was translated into English from [[Latin]] in the 16th century. The Latin version, ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'', "asking for the starting point", can be interpreted in different ways. ''{{lang|la|Petitio}}'' (from ''{{lang|la|peto}}''), in the [[Postclassical Era|post-classical]] context in which the phrase arose, means ''assuming'' or ''postulating'', but in the older classical sense means ''petition'', ''request'' or ''beseeching''.&lt;ref name="Liberman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Liberman|first=Mark|title='Begging the question': we have answers|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2290|work=Language Log|accessdate=12 January 2012|authorlink=Mark Liberman|date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kretzmann1988"&gt;{{cite book |first=N. |last=Kretzmann |first2=E. |last2=Stump |year=1988 |title=Logic and the Philosophy of Language |series=The Cambridge Translations of Medieval Philosophical Texts |volume=Volume 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521280631 |lccn=87030542 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh-vE6T_WIcC&amp;pg=PA374 |page=374 |quote=One sort of ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is common, and another is dialectical; but common ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is not relevant here. A dialectical ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is an expression that insists that in the disputation some act must be performed with regard to the statable thing [at issue]. For example, "I require (''{{lang|la|peto}}'') you to respond affirmatively to 'God exists,'" and the like. And ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' obligates [the respondent] to perform an action with regard to the ''{{lang|la|obligatum}}'', while ''{{lang|la|positio}}'' obligates [him] only to maintain [the ''{{lang|la|obligatum}}'']; and in this way ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' and ''{{lang|la|positio}}'' differ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|la|Principii}}'', [[genitive case|genitive]] of ''{{lang|la|principium}}'', means ''beginning'', ''basis'' or ''premise'' (of an argument). Literally ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' means "assuming the premise" or "assuming the original point".

The Latin phrase comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ αἰτεῖσθαι}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|to en archei aiteisthai}}'', "asking the original point")&lt;ref name="Schreiber2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=S.G. |last=Schreiber |year=2003 |title=Aristotle on False Reasoning: Language and the World in the Sophistical Refutations |series=SUNY Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=9780791456590 |lccn=2002030968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AICfsOKXhJIC&amp;pg=PA106 |pages=99, 106, 214 |quote=It hardly needs pointing out that such circular arguments are logically unassailable. The importance of the ''Prior Analytics'' introduction to the fallacy is that it places the error in a thoroughly epistemic context. For Aristotle, some reasoning of the form "p because p" is acceptable, namely, in cases where p is self-justifying. In other cases the same (logical) reasoning commits the error of Begging the Question. Distinguishing self-evident from non-self-evident claims is a notorious crux in the history of philosophy. Aristotle's antidote to the subjectivism that threatens always to debilitate such decisions is his belief in a natural order of epistemic justification and the recognition that it takes special (dialectical) training to make that natural order also known to us.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' II xvi 64b28–65a26:

{{quote|Begging or assuming the point at issue consists (to take the expression in its widest sense) [of] failing to demonstrate the required proposition. But there are several other ways in which this may happen; for example, if the argument has not taken syllogistic form at all, he may argue from premises which are less known or equally unknown, or he may establish the antecedent by means of its consequents; for demonstration proceeds from what is more certain and is prior. Now begging the question is none of these. [...] If, however, the relation of B to C is such that they are identical, or that they are clearly convertible, or that one applies to the other, then he is begging the point at issue.... [B]egging the question is proving what is not self-evident by means of itself...either because predicates which are identical belong to the same subject, or because the same predicate belongs to subjects which are identical.|Aristotle|Hugh Tredennick (trans.) ''Prior Analytics''}}

Aristotle's distinction between [[apodictic]] science and other forms of non-demonstrative knowledge rests on an [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]] wherein appropriate [[first principles]] become apparent to the trained dialectician:
{{quote|Aristotle's advice in ''[[Sophistical Refutations|S.E.]]'' 27 for resolving fallacies of Begging the Question is brief. If one realizes that one is being asked to concede the original point, one should refuse to do so, even if the point being asked is a reputable belief. On the other hand, if one fails to realize that one has conceded the point at issue and the questioner uses the concession to produce the apparent refutation, then one should turn the tables on the sophistical opponent by oneself pointing out the fallacy committed. In dialectical exchange it is a worse mistake to be caught asking for the original point than to have inadvertently granted such a request. The answerer in such a position has failed to detect when different utterances mean the same thing. The questioner, if he did not realize he was asking the original point, has committed the same error. But if he has knowingly asked for the original point, then he reveals himself to be ontologically confused: he has mistaken what is non-self-explanatory (known through other things) to be something self-explanatory (known through itself). In pointing this out to the false reasoner, one is not just pointing out a tactical psychological misjudgment by the questioner. It is not simply that the questioner falsely thought that the original point, if placed under the guise of a semantic equivalent, or a logical equivalent, or a covering universal, or divided up into exhaustive parts, would be more persuasive to the answerer. Rather, the questioner falsely thought that a non-self-explanatory fact about the world was an explanatory first principle. For Aristotle, that certain facts are self-explanatory while others are not is not a reflection solely of the cognitive abilities of humans. It is primarily a reflection of the structure of noncognitive reality. In short, a successful resolution of such a fallacy requires a firm grasp of the correct explanatory powers of things. Without a knowledge of which things are self-explanatory and which are not, the reasoner is liable to find a question-begging argument persuasive.&lt;ref name="Schreiber2003"/&gt;|Scott Gregory Schreiber|''Aristotle on False Reasoning: Language and the World in the Sophistical Refutations''}}

[[Thomas Fowler (Oxford)|Thomas Fowler]] believed that ''{{lang|la|Petitio Principii}}'' would be more properly called ''{{lang|la|Petitio Quæsiti}}'', which is literally "begging the question".&lt;ref name="Fowler145"&gt;Fowler, Thomas (1887). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WdtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145 ''The Elements of Deductive Logic, Ninth Edition'']  (p. 145). Oxford, England: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
To "beg the question" is to put forward an argument whose validity requires that its own conclusion is true.

Also called ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'', the [[fallacy]] is an attempt to support a claim with a premise that itself presupposes the claim.&lt;ref name="Welton279"&gt;Welton (1905), 279., "Petitio principii is, therefore, committed when a proposition which requires proof is assumed without proof."&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attempt to prove a proposition while simultaneously taking the proposition for granted.

Given the single variable C (claim), "begging the question" is an attempt to assert that {{nowrap|C → C}}. In two variables, {{nowrap|C (claim)}} and {{nowrap|P (premise)}}, it attempts to pass {{nowrap|(C → P) → C}} as the valid claim {{nowrap|P → C}}.{{cn|date=January 2018}} This is a form of circular reasoning, and may involve any number of variables.

When the fallacy involves only a single variable, it is sometimes called a ''[[hysteron proteron]]''&lt;ref name="Davies572"&gt;Davies (1915), 572.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welton280"&gt;Welton (1905), 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Molière]]'s ''[[The Imaginary Invalid|Le Malade imaginaire]]'', a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its [[Hypnotic|soporific]] power." In the original: '' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de ''Le Malade imaginaire'' in French Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt;, as in the statement:

*"Opium induces sleep because it has a [[wiktionary:soporific|''soporific'']] quality."&lt;ref name="Welton281"&gt;Welton (1905), 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of the fallacy may not be immediately obvious. Linguistic variations in syntax, sentence structure and literary device may conceal it, as may other factors involved in an argument's delivery. It may take the form of an unstated premise which is essential but not identical to the conclusion, or is "controversial or questionable for the same reasons that typically might lead someone to question the conclusion":&lt;ref&gt;Kahane and Cavender (2005), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...[S]eldom is anyone going to simply place the conclusion word-for-word into the premises ... Rather, an arguer might use phraseology that conceals the fact that the conclusion is masquerading as a premise. The conclusion is rephrased to look different and is then placed in the premises.|Paul Herrick&lt;ref name="Herrick248"&gt;Herrick (2000) 248.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, one can obscure the fallacy by first making a statement in concrete terms, then attempting to pass off an identical statement, delivered in abstract terms, as evidence for the original.&lt;ref name="Welton281" /&gt; One could also "bring forth a proposition expressed in words of [[Saxon]] origin, and give as a reason for it the very same proposition stated in words of [[Norman language|Norman]] origin",&lt;ref&gt;Gibson (1908), 291.&lt;/ref&gt; as here:

*"To allow every man an unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole, advantageous to the State, for it is highly conducive to the interests of the community that each individual should enjoy a liberty perfectly unlimited of expressing his sentiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Whately]], ''Elements of Logic'' (1826) quoted in Gibson (1908), 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fallacy of begging the question is committed in more than one step, some authors dub it ''{{lang|la|circulus in probando}}'' (''reasoning in a circle'')&lt;ref name="Davies572" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowden"&gt;Bradley Dowden, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#BeggingtheQuestion "Fallacies"] in ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; or, more commonly, ''circular reasoning''.

Begging the question is not considered a [[formal fallacy]] (an [[argument]] that is defective because it uses an incorrect [[deductive reasoning|deductive step]]). Rather, it is a type of [[informal fallacy]] that is [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]] but unpersuasive, in that it fails to prove anything other than what is already assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Fallacy |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/200836/fallacy#ref1102387 |quote=Strictly speaking, ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' is not a fallacy of reasoning but an ineptitude in argumentation: thus the argument from p as a premise to p as conclusion is not deductively invalid but lacks any power of conviction, since no one who questioned the conclusion could concede the premise.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plausible argument in everyday conversation |publisher=SUNY Press |author=Walton, Douglas |year=1992 |pages=206–207 |isbn=9780791411575 |quote=Wellington is in New Zealand. Therefore, Wellington is in New Zealand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petitio Principii"&gt;The reason ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' is considered a fallacy is not that the [[inference]] is invalid (because any statement is indeed equivalent to itself), but that the argument can be deceptive.  A statement cannot prove itself.  A premiss{{sic}} must have a different source of reason, ground or evidence for its truth  from that of the conclusion: Lander University, [http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/circular.html "Petitio Principii"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related fallacies ==
{{main|Circular reasoning|Complex question|Ignoratio elenchi}}
Closely connected with begging the question is the fallacy of [[circular reasoning]] (''{{lang|la|circulus in probando}}''), a fallacy in which the reasoner begins with the conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dowden |first=Bradley |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#CircularReasoning |title=Fallacies |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=27 March 2003 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual components of a circular argument can be logically [[Validity (logic)|valid]] because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true, and does not lack relevance. However, circular reasoning is not persuasive because a listener who doubts the conclusion also doubts the premise that leads to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Logic |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=1998 |page=205 |isbn=9780070466494 |last1=Nolt |first1=John Eric |last2=Rohatyn |first2=Dennis |last3=Varzi |first3=Achille}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begging the question is similar to the ''[[complex question]]'' (also known as ''trick question'' or ''fallacy of many questions''): a question that, to be valid, requires the truth of another question that has not been established. For example, "Which color dress is Mary wearing?" may be fallacious because it presupposes that Mary is wearing a dress. Unless it has previously been established that her outfit is a dress, the question is fallacious because she could be wearing a pantsuit.&lt;ref name="Meyer1988"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Meyer |year=1988 |title=Questions and Questioning |series=Foundations of Communication |publisher=W. de Gruyter |isbn=9783110106800 |lccn=lc88025603 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwo5qXTCJewC&amp;pg=PA198 |pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton1989"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.N. |last=Walton |year=1989 |title=Informal Logic: A Handbook for Critical Argument |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521379250 |lccn=88030762 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kswimguc5uYC&amp;pg=PA36 |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related fallacy is ''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'' or ''irrelevant conclusion'': an argument that fails to address the issue in question, but appears to do so. An example might be a situation where A and B are debating whether the law permits A to do something. If A attempts to support his position with an argument that the law ''ought'' to allow him to do the thing in question, then he is guilty of ''{{lang|la|ignoratio elenchi}}''.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Fowler, ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''. Entry for ''{{lang|la|ignoratio elenchi}}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
&lt;!-- Please read the discussion on the talk page before editing this section --&gt;
Many modern English speakers use ''beg the question'' to mean "bear the question", "suggest the question," "raise the question", "invite the question", "evade the question", or even "ignore the question", and follow that phrase with the question, for example: "I weigh 120&amp;nbsp;kg and have severely clogged arteries, which begs the question: why have I not started exercising?" For [[Linguistic prescription|grammatical]] reasons and because the term has a specific, different meaning in philosophy, logic, and law, some commenters note that such usage is mistaken, or at best, unclear&lt;ref name="Garner1995"&gt;{{cite book |first=B.A. |last=Garner |year=1995 |title=Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage |series=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195142365 |lccn=95003863 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA101 |page=101 |quote=''begging the question'' does not mean "evading the issue" or "inviting the obvious questions," as some mistakenly believe. The proper meaning of begging the question is "basing a conclusion on an assumption that is as much in need of proof or demonstration as the conclusion itself." The formal name for this logical fallacy is ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}.'' Following are two classic examples: "Reasonable men are those who think and reason intelligently." ''Patterson v. Nutter,'' 7 A. 273, 275 (Me. 1886). (This statement begs the question, "What does it mean to think and reason intelligently?")/ "Life begins at conception!

A '''biofuel''' is a [[fuel]] that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and [[anaerobic digestion]], rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of [[fossil fuel]]s, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter.

Biofuels can be derived directly from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of [[biomass]]  (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to [[plants]] or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]] form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.

Biofuels are in theory [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because the carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants is equal to the carbon dioxide that is released when the fuel is burned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/print.php?page=biomass_environment Biomass and the Environment – Basics]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, whether or not a biofuel is carbon-neutral also depends greatly on whether the land which is used to grow the biofuel (with 1st and 2nd generation biofuel) [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|needed to be cleared of carbon-holding vegetation]] or not.

[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010, worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009,&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport. Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for about 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; {{as of|2011}}, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905003859/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-05 |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 |access-date=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency]] has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/biofuels_roadmap.pdf |year= 2011 |title=Technology Roadmap, Biofuels for Transport }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of biofuels also led into a flourishing automotive industry, where by 2010, 79% of all cars produced in Brazil were made with a hybrid fuel system of bioethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = Jeremy | last2 = Matos | first2 = Stelvia | last3 = Silvestre | first3 = Bruno | last4 = Martin | first4 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = Managing Technological and Social Uncertainties of Innovation: The Evolution of Brazilian Energy and Agriculture | url = | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 78 | issue = 7| pages = 1147–1157 | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2011.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various social, economic, environmental and technical [[issues relating to biofuels]] production and use, which have been debated in the popular media and scientific journals.

==Generations==
===First-generation biofuels===
"First-generation" or conventional biofuels are biofuels made from food crops grown on arable land. With this biofuel production generation, food crops are thus [[Food vs fuel|explicitly grown for fuel production]], and not anything else. The sugar, starch, or vegetable oil obtained from the crops is converted into biodiesel or ethanol, using [[transesterification]], or yeast fermentation.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100521143237/http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/05/18/3g-4g-a-taxonomy-for-far-out-%E2%80%94-but-not-far-away-%E2%80%94-biofuels/ First, second, third and fourth generation biofuels explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Second-generation biofuels}}
Second generation biofuels are fuels manufactured from various types of [[biomass]].  Biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the [[carbon cycle]]. Biomass is derived from plant materials, but can also include animal materials.

Whereas first generation biofuels are made from the [[sugar]]s and [[vegetable oil]]s found in arable crops, second generation biofuels are made from [[lignocellulosic biomass]] or woody crops, agricultural residues or waste plant material (from food crops that have already fulfilled their food purpose).&lt;ref&gt;An example here is [[rapeseed]], of which the oil is used as waste fuel, and of which the actual produce (for which the crop is grown) is [[fodder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coconut oil]] is another example, if it is extracted in such a way that the meat and milk can still be used for human and/or animal consumption.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/12/24/barley-grain-can-be-used-to-produce-ethanol-says-scientists-with-usda/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.315.5818.1488 |pmid=17363642 |title=CELLULOSIC ETHANOL: Biofuel Researchers Prepare to Reap a New Harvest |journal=Science |volume=315 |issue=5818 |pages=1488–1491 |year=2007 |last1=Service |first1=R.

Non-human food second generation feedstock sources include grasses, jatropha and other seed crops, waste vegetable oil, municipal solid waste and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biofuel.org.uk/second-generation-biofuels.html|title=Biofuels - Second Generation Biofuels|website=biofuel.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that, unlike with regular food crops, no arable land is used solely for the production of fuel. The disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops, it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel. For instance, a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/en8076765 |title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels |journal=Energies |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=6765–6794 |year=2015 |last1=Ramirez |first1=Jerome |last2=Brown |first2=Richard |last3=Rainey |first3=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The potential and challenges of drop-in fuels (members only) {{!}} IEA Bioenergy Task 39 – Commercializing Liquid Biofuels|url = http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/?p=932|website = task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Algaculture|Algae fuel}}
From 1978 to 1996, the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|US NREL]] experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "[[Aquatic Species Program]]".&lt;ref name = "NREL biofuels algae"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheehan|first=John|title=A Look Back at the U. S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program: Biofuels from Algae|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=July 1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the [[University of New Hampshire|UNH]] Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all [[motor vehicle|vehicular]] fuel with biofuels by using algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants.&lt;ref name="Briggs2004"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html| title = Widescale Biodiesel Production from Algae| first = Michael |last=Briggs|date=August 2004| accessdate = 2007-01-02

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture&amp;nbsp;– unlike [[agriculture|crop-based]] biofuels&amp;nbsp;– does not entail a decrease in [[food production]], since it requires neither [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] nor [[fresh water]]. Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |title=Valcent Products Inc.

E. Teixeira | doi = 10.1039/C2GC16225C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth-generation biofuels===
Similarly to third-generation biofuels, fourth-generation biofuels are made using non-arable land. However, unlike third-generation biofuels, they do not require the destruction of biomass. This class of biofuels includes [[electrofuel]]s&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and [[Solar fuel|photobiological solar fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4678123 | pmid=26667057 | doi=10.1007/s13280-015-0730-0 | volume=45 Suppl 1 | title=From first generation biofuels to advanced solar biofuels | journal=Ambio | pages=S24–31 | last1 = Aro | first1 = EM| year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fuels are [[Carbon-neutral fuel#Production|carbon-neutral]].

==Types==
The following fuels can be produced using first, second, third or fourth-generation biofuel production procedures. Most of these can even be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Ethanol for instance can be produced using 1G, 2G and 3G procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogas===

[[File:Biogas pipes.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Pipes carrying biogas]]
{{Main|Biogas}}
Biogas is [[methane]] produced by the process of [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[organic material]] by [[anaerobe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Redman, G., The Andersons Centre. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081004232058/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/metadot/index.pl?id=7198%3Bisa%3DDBRow%3Bop%3Dshow%3Bdbview_id%3D2457 "Assessment of on-farm AD in the UK"], ''[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]'', 2008-06-09. Retrieved on 2009-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be produced either from [[biodegradable waste]] materials or by the use of [[energy crop]]s fed into [[anaerobic digester]]s to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, [[digestate]], can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer.

Biogas can be recovered from [[mechanical biological treatment]] waste processing systems. [[Landfill gas]], a less clean form of biogas, is produced in [[landfill]]s through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential [[greenhouse gas]].

Farmers can produce biogas from [[manure]] from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters.&lt;ref&gt;"BIOGAS: No bull, manure can power your farm." Farmers Guardian (25 September 2009): 12. General OneFile. Gale.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syngas===

{{Main|Gasification}}
[[Syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and other hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of [[oxygen]] that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes [[pyrolysis|pyrolysed]]. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.

Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.

Syngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&amp;nbsp;°C.

Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].

===Ethanol===

{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left&amp;nbsp;(A), [[gasoline]] on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in [[Brazil]]]]
Biologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.

[[File:Bushlulacana09032007.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] looks at sugar cane, a source of biofuel, with Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during a tour on biofuel technology at [[Petrobras]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, 9 March 2007.]]
[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | Lär dig mer om energi - E.ON&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.

Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.

Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are "flueless", bioethanol fires&lt;ref&gt;Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.
The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;see "Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol"&lt;/ref&gt; the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkman, N. et al., "Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ.

Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol (in a long-term test of more than 2.1 million km, the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be 1–26% more energy efficient than petrol cars, but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30%, so more fuel stops are required).

With current subsidies, ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Other bioalcohols===

[[Methanol]] is currently produced from [[natural gas]], a [[non-renewable]] fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as [[biomethanol]]. This is technically feasible, but the production is currently being postponed for concerns of [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] that the economic viability is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;Börjesson.P. et al. 2013, REPORT f3 2013:13, p 170&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[methanol economy]] is an alternative to the [[hydrogen economy]], compared to today's [[hydrogen]] production from natural gas.

[[Butanol fuel|Butanol]] ({{chem|C|4|H|9|OH}}) is formed by [[Clostridium acetobutylicum|ABE fermentation]] (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high [[net energy gain]]s with butanol as the only liquid product. Butanol will produce more energy and allegedly can be burned "straight" in existing gasoline engines (without modification to the engine or car),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butanol.com/ |title=ButylFuel, LLC Main Page |publisher=Butanol.com |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is less corrosive and less water-soluble than ethanol, and could be distributed via existing infrastructures. [[DuPont]] and [[BP]] are working together to help develop butanol. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their [[protein metabolism|amino acid metabolism]].&lt;ref name="butanol"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biofpr.com/details/feature/102347/Biofuels_aim_higher.html|title=Biofuels aim higher|last=Evans|first=Jon|date=14 January 2008 |work=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining (BioFPR)|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback to butanol production in E. coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media, however, recent work has demonstrated E. coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2018.08.004 |pmid=30107263 |title=Directed strain evolution restructures metabolism for 1-butanol production in minimal media |journal=Metabolic Engineering |volume=49 |pages=153–163 |year=2018 |last1=Pontrelli |first1=Sammy |last2=Fricke |first2=Riley C.B. |last3=Sakurai |first3=Sana Subhan Memon |last4=Putri |first4=Sastia Prama |last5=Fitz-Gibbon |first5=Sorel |last6=Chung |first6=Matthew |last7=Wu |first7=Hsin-Yi |last8=Chen |first8=Yu-Ju |last9=Pellegrini |first9=Matteo |last10=Fukusaki |first10=Eiichiro |last11=Liao |first11=James C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodiesel ===

{{Main|Biodiesel}}
{{Further|Biodiesel around the world}}
[[Biodiesel]] is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]]. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as "neat" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ Perstop Press release: Verdis Polaris Aura – second generation B100 – The advanced green one]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]Biodiesel can be used in any [[diesel engine]] when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100&lt;!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) --&gt;. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.

Electronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.
Since biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the [[combustion]] of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/technology/2012/T46.pdf Nylund.N-O &amp; Koponen.K. 2013. Fuel and Technology Alternatives for Buses. Overall Energy Efficiency and Emission Performance. IEA Bioenergy Task 46]. Possibly the new emission standards Euro VI/EPA 10 will lead to reduced NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-levels also when using B100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and [[biodegradable]], and has a high [[flash point]] of about 300&amp;nbsp;°F (148&amp;nbsp;°C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125&amp;nbsp;°F (52&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |title=Biofuels Facts |publisher=Hempcar.org |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520231032/http://hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005.

===Straight vegetable oil===

[[File:Used vegetable cooking oil.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Filtered waste vegetable oil]]

{{Main|Vegetable oil fuel}}
Straight unmodified [[Eating|edible]] vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.

As with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&amp;W Diesel]], [[Wärtsilä]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.

Vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-"Pumpe Duse" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.

Oils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, G.

===Bioethers===

Bioethers (also referred to as fuel [[ethers]] or [[oxygenated fuel]]s) are cost-effective [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that act as [[octane rating]] enhancers."Bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso-olefins, such as iso-butylene, with bioethanol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rock|first=Kerry|title=Bioethers Impact on the Gasoline Pool|url=http://www.digitalrefining.com/article/1000210,Bioethers_impact_on_the_gasoline_pool.html|publisher=Digital Refining|accessdate=15 February 2014|author2=Maurice Korpelshoek|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioethers are created by wheat or sugar beet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biofuel.org.uk/bioethers.html Biofuels - Types of Biofuels - Bioethers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  They also enhance [[engine]] performance, while significantly reducing engine wear and [[toxic]] [[exhaust gas|exhaust emissions]]. Although bioethers are likely to replace petroethers in the UK, it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biofuel.org.uk/bioethers.html|title=Biofuels - Types of Biofuels - Bioethers|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greatly reducing the amount of ground-level [[ozone emissions]], they contribute to air quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0536:EN:HTML |title=Council Directive 85/536/EEC of 5 December 1985 on crude-oil savings through the use of substitute fuel components in petrol |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/registre/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/sec/2007/0055/COM_SEC(2007)0055_EN.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - IA 55 EN.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives: [[dimethyl ether]] (DME), [[diethyl ether]] (DEE), methyl teritiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl ''ter''-butyl ether (ETBE), t''er''-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and ''ter''-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sukla |first=Mirtunjay Kumar |title=Bio-Ethers as Transportation Fuel: A Review |url=http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/DMEoverview.pdf |publisher=Indian Institute of Petroleum Dehradun |accessdate=15 February 2014 |author2=Thallada Bhaskar |author3=A.K. Jain |author4=S.K. Singal |author5=M.O. Garg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Fuel Oxygenates Association (EFOA) credits methyl Ttertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl ter-butyl ether (ETBE) as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were introduced in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Bio-Ethers? |url=http://www.petrochemistry.eu/ftp/pressroom/EFOA_2008_def.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306082952/http://www.petrochemistry.eu/ftp/pressroom/EFOA_2008_def.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-06 |publisher=.

===Solid biomass fuels ===

Examples include [[wood]], [[sawdust]], [[grass]] trimmings, [[domestic waste|domestic refuse]], [[charcoal]], [[agricultural waste]], nonfood [[energy crop]]s, and [[Dry animal dung fuel|dried manure]].

When solid biomass is already in a suitable form (such as [[firewood]]), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from {{convert|1|to|3|cm|1|abbr=on}}, which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce [[wood pellet]]s, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with a broad range of input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.

Sawdust, bark and chips are already used for decades for fuel in industrial processes; examples include the pulp and paper industry and the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000&amp;nbsp;lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, spreader stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel. Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low-cost fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. McGowan, Michael L. Brown, William S. Bulpitt, James L. Walsh, Jr. (Editors) 2009. Biomass and Alternate Fuel Systems: An Engineering and Economic Guide. {{ISBN|978-0-470-41028-8}} Wiley, 280 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of solid biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal husbandry and forestry.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=20 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

A problem with the combustion of solid biomass fuels is that it emits considerable amounts of [[pollutant]]s, such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]. Even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers. Pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets, producing much larger emissions of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[chlorophenol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briens | first1 = Cedric | last2 = Piskorz | first2 = Jan | last3 = Berruti | first3 = Franco | year = 2008 | title = Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review | url = | journal = International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering | volume = 6 | issue = | page = R2 | doi=10.2202/1542-6580.1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A derived fuel is [[biochar]], which is produced by biomass [[pyrolysis]]. Biochar made from agricultural waste can substitute for wood charcoal. As wood stock becomes scarce, this alternative is gaining ground. In eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], for example, [[biomass briquettes]] are being marketed as an alternative to charcoal to protect [[Virunga National Park]] from [[deforestation]] associated with [[charcoal]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |title=Threat to Great Apes Highlighted at Virunga Meeting |publisher=America.gov |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828133830/http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |archivedate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air pollution==
{{main|Biomass#Environmental damage|Ethanol_fuel#Air_pollution}}

Biofuels are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces [[carbon dioxide]], airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ WHO | Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas [[chromatograph]] studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240399720_Atmospheric_alcohols_and_aldehydes_concentrations_measured_in_Osaka_Japan_and_in_Sao_Paulo_Brazil Atmospheric alcohols and aldehydes concentrations measured in Osaka, Japan and in São Paulo, Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged in April 2007 that the increased use of bio-ethanol will lead to worse air quality. The total emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides will rise due the growing use of bio-ethanol. There is an increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels to produce the biofuels as well as nitrous oxide from the soil, which has most likely been treated with nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrous oxide is known to have a greater impact on the atmosphere in relation to global warming, as it is also an ozone destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haerens|first1=Margaret|title=Biofuels|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7377-5553-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates regarding the production and use of biofuel==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}
There are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[food prices]], [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[energy ratio]], [[energy requirements]],  [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], loss of [[biodiversity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher Jr.|first=Robert J.|author2=Bruce A Robertson |author3=Jason Evans |author4=Patrick J Doran |author5=Janaki RR Alavalapati |author6=Douglas W Schemske |title=Biodiversity conservation in the era of biofuels: risks and opportunities|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|year=2011|volume=9|issue=3|pages=161–168|url=http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/24366|accessdate=10 December 2013 |doi=10.1890/090091|hdl=10919/24366}}&lt;/ref&gt; impact on [[water resources]], the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel, as well as [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cotton |first=Charles A.

It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.

Another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) set by congress for 2010 was pushed back to at best 2012 to produce 100 million gallons of pure ethanol (not blended with a fossil fuel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bracmort|first=Kelsi|title=Meeting the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Mandate for Cellulosic Biofuels:Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41106.pdf|publisher=Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning of first-generation biofuels===

Particularly fuels made from such oils such as palm oil and soy oil are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/04/palm-oil-biofuels-meps-eu-transport-deforestation-zsl-greenpeace-golden-agri-resources-oxfam MEPs vote to ban the use of palm oil in biofuels ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/eu-heading-for-zero-palm-oil-in-transport-by-2021/ EU heading for ‘zero palm oil’ in transport by 2021]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-climatechange-palmoil/eu-to-phase-out-palm-oil-from-transport-fuel-by-2030-idUSKBN1JA21F EU to phase out palm oil from transport fuel by 2030]&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, biofuels in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials are entering the market, driven by the perception that they reduce climate gas emissions, and also by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]].

According to the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Rocky Mountain Institute (2005).

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
Some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1238 |title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change |last = Searchinger |first = Timothy |author2=Ralph Heimlich |author3=R.A.

However, no-till practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal |title =Biofuels, Land Use Change, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Some Unexplored Variables|last = Kim |first = Hyungtae|author2=Seungdo Kim|author3=Bruce E.

A study conducted in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 53-105 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 48-90 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be sequestered from forest depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alves Finco | first1 = Marcus V. | last2 = Doppler | first2 = Werner | year = 2010 | title = Bioenergy and Sustainable Development: The Dilemma of Food Security and Climate Change in the Brazilian Savannah | url = | journal = Energy for Sustainable Development | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 194–199 | doi = 10.1016/j.esd.2010.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Runge | first1 = Ford | last2 = Senauer | first2 = Benjamin | year = 2007 | title = How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 41–53 | jstor=20032348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt.&lt;ref name="Science2"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1235.short |title =Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt|last = fargione| first = Joseph|author2=Jason Hill |author3=David Tilman |author4=Stephen Polasky |author5=Peter Hawthorne |doi = 10.1126/science.1152747 |pmid =18258862|year=2008|accessdate = 12 November 2011 |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1235–1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Use===
In addition to crop growth requiring water, biofuel facilities require significant process water.&lt;ref name="WaterI"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&amp;page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 18 June 2015 |journal=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests and Carbon Sequestration===
Scientific research (20th century) shows that carbon dioxide emissions from all forms of surface transport are converted in a few weeks by forests, farms and oceans into biomass. This implies that a greater emphasis on sustainable forestry is very relevant for climate protection and sustainable, energy-efficient transport.

==Current research==
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would require twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean production, or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production, to meet current US heating and transportation needs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Specially bred mustard varieties can produce reasonably high oil yields and are very useful in [[crop rotation]] with cereals, and have the added benefit that the meal left over after the oil has been pressed out can act as an effective and biodegradable pesticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/mustard_hybrids.pdf |title=Mustard Hybrids for Low-Cost Biofuels and Organic Pesticides |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726174434/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/mustard_hybrids.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Spanish developers working for a company called [[Ecofasa]] announced a new biofuel made from trash. The fuel is created from general urban waste which is treated by bacteria to produce fatty acids, which can be used to make biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lele.newsvine.com/_news/2008/10/18/2014473-ecofasa-turns-waste-to-biofuels-using-bacteria- |title=Newsvine - Ecofasa turns waste to biofuels using bacteria |publisher=Lele.newsvine.com |date=2008-10-18 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before its shutdown, [[Joule Unlimited]] was attempting to make cheap ethanol and biodiesel from a genetically modified photosynthetic bacterium.

===Ethanol biofuels (bioethanol){{anchor|Ethanol biofuels}}{{anchor|Bioethanol}}===

As the primary source of biofuels in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of [[ethanol]] production. The National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) is a research division of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] dedicated solely to ethanol-based biofuel research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ethanol Research |url=http://www.ethanolresearch.com/ethanolresearch/about.shtml |title=National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) |publisher=Ethanol Research |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320192458/http://www.ethanolresearch.com/ethanolresearch/about.shtml |archivedate=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the federal level, the [[USDA]] conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States. Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Coalition for Ethanol |url=http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |title=Responses to Questions from Senator Bingaman |publisher=American Coalition for Ethanol |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004113944/http://ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A division of the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL), has also conducted various ethanol research projects, mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |url=http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |title=Research Advantages: Cellulosic Ethanol |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125101249/http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies, such as [[Iogen Corp.|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], are building refineries that can process [[biomass]] and turn it into [[bioethanol]]. Companies, such as [[Diversa]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Dyadic International|Dyadic]], are producing enzymes that could enable a [[cellulosic ethanol]] future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the first commercial-scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating. Multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used. In the next few years, the cost data of these technologies operating at commercial scale, and their relative performance, will become available. Lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE_Reports/HLPE-Report-5_Biofuels_and_food_security.pdf |title=Biofuels and food security |author=HLPE |year=2013 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Asia and Africa where drylands prevail, [[sweet sorghum]] is being investigated as a potential source of food, feed and fuel combined. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions, as it only extracts one seventh of the water used by sugarcane. In [[India]], and other places, sweet sorghum stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |title=Sweet Sorghum : A New "Smart Biofuel Crop" |date=30 June 2008 |publisher=Agriculture Business Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004827/http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |archivedate=27 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers at the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014010/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf ''Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel''] New Agriculturalist, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jatropha===
{{Main|Jatropha biofuel}}
Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on ''[[Jatropha curcas]]'', a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biology and genetic improvement of Jatropha curcas L.: A review| journal = [[Applied Energy]] | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | year = 2010| pages = 732–742 |author1=B.N.

Plant Research International, a department of the [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] in the Netherlands, maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project that examines the feasibility of large-scale jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plant Research International |url=http://www.pri.wur.nl/UK/research/plant-based_raw_materials/jatropha/JATROPT |title=JATROPT (Jatropha curcas): Applied and technical research into plant properties |publisher=Plant Research International |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming (CfSEF) is a Los Angeles-based nonprofit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science, agronomy, and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300% in the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Biofuels Magazine |url=http://www.biofuelsmagazine.com/articles/7743/energy-farming-methods-mature-improve|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727140520/http://www.biofuelsmagazine.com/articles/7743/energy-farming-methods-mature-improve|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-07-27|title=Energy Farming Methods Mature, Improve |publisher=Biofuels Magazine |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
A group at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]], in a 2008 paper, stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species, ''[[Cunninghamella]]'' ''[[Cunninghamella japonica|japonica]]'', and others, is likely to appear in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Sergeeva | first1 = Y.

The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus ''[[Gliocladium roseum]]'' (later renamed Ascocoryne sarcoides) points toward the production of so-called [[myco-diesel]] from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern [[Patagonia]], and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium-length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Strobel | first1 = G.| last2 = Knighton | first2 = B.| last3 = Kluck | first3 = K.| last4 = Ren | first4 = Y.| last5 = Livinghouse | first5 = T.| last6 = Griffin | first6 = M.| last7 = Spakowicz | first7 = D.| last8 = Sears | first8 = J.| title = The production of myco-diesel hydrocarbons and their derivatives by the endophytic fungus Gliocladium roseum (NRRL 50072)| journal = Microbiology| volume = 154| issue = Pt 11| pages = 3319–3328| year = 2008| pmid = 18957585| doi = 10.1099/mic.0.2008/022186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms, suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bio-production of fuels in the future (reviewed in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 99| issue = 12| pages = 4943–4951| last1 = Spakowicz| first1 = Daniel J.| last2 = Strobel| first2 = Scott A.| title = Biosynthesis of hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds by fungi: bioengineering potential| journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology| date = 2015| doi=10.1007/s00253-015-6641-y| pmid = 25957494| pmc = 4677055}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Animal gut bacteria===
Microbial [[Gut flora|gastrointestinal flora]] in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels.

The '''Burning of Edinburgh''' in 1544 by an English sea-borne army was the first major action of the war of [[the Rough Wooing]]. A Scottish army observed the landing on 3 May 1544 but did not engage with the English force. The [[Provost of Edinburgh]] was compelled to allow the English to sack [[Leith]] and [[Edinburgh]]. However, the Scottish artillery within [[Edinburgh Castle]] harassed the English forces, who had neither the time nor the resources to besiege the Castle. The English fleet sailed away loaded with captured goods, and with [[Salamander of Leith|two ships]] that had belonged to [[James V of Scotland]].

==The Plan==
[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Henry VIII]]
[[Henry VIII of England]] wished to unite the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], or at least bring the kingdom under his hegemony. He had contracted with the [[Regent Arran]] that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] would marry his son, [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]]. But Arran allowed the [[Parliament of Scotland]] to revoke this agreement prompting Henry to declare war in December 1543, and now the Regent was making ground against his rebels who still supported the English marriage, such as the [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox|Earl of Lennox]], [[William Cunningham, 4th Earl of Glencairn|Earl of Glencairn]], the [[Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis|Earl of Cassillis]] and the [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus|Earl of Angus]]. These nobles were in touch with Henry VIII via Lennox's secretary Thomas Bishop and Angus's chaplain, Master John Penven. Their letters to Henry VIII requested intervention, and in March he replied that a 'main army' was in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''Calendar, Marquis of Salisbury, Hatfield House'', vol. 1 (1883), nos.101, 133, 134, 135: Haynes (1740), pp.19, 20: ''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1903), preface, identifies Penven as Angus's chaplain.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's Privy Council issued his instructions for the invasion force on 10 April 1544, and they were to;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon (them) for their falsehood and disloyalty."&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, Marcus, ''The Rough Wooings'', Tuckwell (2000), 144 from ''Hamilton Papers'', vol.2, p.326 ''Letters &amp; Papers'', vol.19 part 1, no.314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], at this time called [[Earl of Hertford|Lord Hertford]] was the King's Lieutenant of this Army Royal. He had considered establishing an English garrison at [[Leith]] but the Privy Council vetoed this plan. Henry VIII had also asked him to destroy [[St Andrews]], but Lord Hertford pointed out the extra distance would be troublesome.
[[File:Edward Seymour.jpg|thumb|140px|Hertford]]
Hertford discussed with Privy Council the possibility of Scottish allies capturing [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] during his invasion. Henry VIII believed that Beaton, a favourer of the [[Auld Alliance]] with France, was particularly responsible for the rejection of the marriage plan. Beaton's would-be kidnappers included [[James Kirkcaldy of Grange]], [[Norman Leslie (soldier)|Norman Leslie Master of Rothes]], and John Charteris who offered to attempt to capture the Cardinal as he travelled in [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]]. Their second scheme was to attack [[Arbroath]] while attention was focussed on Edinburgh. This offer was made by [[Alexander Crichton of Brunstane]] who sent a messenger called Wishart to Lord Hertford.&lt;ref&gt;''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5, part IV cont., (1836), 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Time was too short to offer military support for these plans, but if those concerned would join in the destruction of Church property they would be offered asylum in England and £1000 to fund their action.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''Salisbury, Hatfield'', vol.1 (1883), p.36 no.36: Haynes, Samuel, ed., ''A Collection of State Papers'', vol. 1 (1740), p.32: the Scottish agent conducting this negotiation in London was called 'Wishart.'&lt;/ref&gt; Any schemes more elaborate than a punitive raid on Edinburgh were shelved as Henry VIII committed resources to the [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544–1546)|siege of Boulogne]] in France already planned for the summer.

==Supplies==
The army assembled at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Gateshead]]. In April 1544, [[Christopher Morris (Master of the Ordnance)|Sir Christopher Morris]] reported to Lord Hertford that he had organised munitions for the invasion at [[Berwick upon Tweed]]. These included;
* 2 batard [[culverin]]s
* 3 [[Saker (cannon)|sakers]]
* 8 falcons
* a [[Falconet (cannon)|falconette]]
* 4 carriages with two [[Breech-loading swivel gun|'bases']] on each
* 3000 bows, 1000 ready strung in 60 chests
* 4000 sheaves of arrows in 80 chests
* 4 barrels of bow strings; described further as 40 [[Gross (unit)|gross]] of 12 dozen, i.e., 5,760 strings
* 480 [[Pike (weapon)|Moorish pikes]]
* 3000 [[Bill (weapon)|Bills]]
Anthony Neville of South Leverton was appointed Surveyor General of Victuals for the army.&lt;ref&gt;Bindoff, Stanley T., et al ed., ''The House of Commons: 1509 - 1558, part 1, Appendices, constituencies, members A - C'', vol. 4 (1982), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
Edward Shelley (who was one of the first English soldiers to be killed at the [[battle of Pinkie]]) reported that he had 40 thousand-weight of biscuit on 20 April. At Berwick, Shelley had problems getting enough coal or wood for baking and brewing. He had to ask permission to impress more supplies and hold sales to rotate his stock.&lt;ref&gt;HMC: ''Report on the Manuscripts of the Most Honourable the Marquess of Bath, at Longleat, Seymour Papers'', vol.4 (1967), pp.60-63.&lt;/ref&gt; 4000 border horsemen waited at Berwick for Hertford's signal. At first it was planned that they would make a diversionary attack on [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]]. Their commander [[William Eure, 1st Baron Eure|Ralph Eure]] wrote from [[Alnwick Castle|Alnwick]] on 28 April that these 'countrymen' were so poor he had to lend them money.&lt;ref&gt;''HMC, Seymour Papers'', vol.4 (1967),p.64-5&lt;/ref&gt; He also asked for 1000 Yorkshire archers as reinforcement so that they could come to Edinburgh to support the landing. In the event, it was agreed that Hertford would summon Eure when he had disembarked his troops. When Eure's men arrived in Edinburgh they would get their pay.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters and Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1903), nos. 464, 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orders for the fleet===
Orders for the fleet at [[Tynemouth]] were given on 28 April. All the ships were to be ready to weigh anchor at a favourable wind. The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night. The ships of the [[Vanguard (military formation)|'vaward', the vanguard]], would follow and anchor as near as possible. Hertford and the treasure-ship ([[Ralph Sadler]] was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the [[Mast (sailing)|main-top mast]] of the ''Rose Lion'' with two night lights on the [[Shroud (sailing)|shrouds]]. The [[Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]], captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his mizzen mast, with a [[cresset]] light in the [[poop deck]] at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the fore-deck for the landing.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton Papers'', vol.2 (1892), pp.354-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence==
On 23 April 1544, all Scottish east coast towns were warned to entrench their bounds to resist the English navy. Men from neighbouring counties were summoned to muster in Edinburgh on 5 May. Extra gunners were hired for Edinburgh Castle, and Regent Arran's goods and the [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|royal tapestries]] were carried up the [[Royal Mile]] from Holyroodhouse to the Castle and watched by his wardrobe servant Malcolm Gourlay. In the previous month an Edinburgh merchant James Johnston of Coates was paid £22 for going to "find out the Englishmen's purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/accountslordhig00unkngoog ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8, HM General Register House (1908)] lv-lix, pp.276, 289-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The Burgh records are mostly missing for the year, so there is no detailed information on any defence measures provided by the town. The English account mentions that the Scots had cast great trenches and ditches to defend Leith.&lt;ref&gt;''An English Garner: Tudor Tracts'', (1903), p.41 re-printing, ''The Late Expedition in Scotland, 1544'', London (1544)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The landing==
An account of the episode was published later in 1544 in London as; ''The Late Expedition in Scotland made by the King's highness' army under the conduct of the Right Honourable the Earl of Hertford in 1544.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Late Expedition in Scotland made by the King's highness' army under the conduct of the Right Honourable the Earl of Hertford in 1544.'' Reynold Wolf, London (1544); reprinted in ''Tudor Tracts'' (1903), pp.38-51.&lt;/ref&gt; A later account by Mary's secretary [[Claude Nau]] records the fleet burning [[St Monans|St Mynettes]] on the north side of the [[River Forth|Forth]] and taking fishing boats for landing-craft.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Joseph ed., ''The History of Mary Stewart by Claude Nau, Edinburgh'', (1883), 318, 338-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Knox]] gave an account of the landing from another Scottish viewpoint. The English fleet was sighted before noon on Saturday. Knox said that [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] dismissed the threat and sat calmly at dinner. At 6pm there were 200 ships and an English pilot sounded the depths between Granton and Leith. Though experts could see this meant the English minded to land still there was no Scottish response. At daybreak on Sunday some of the smaller boats nosed onto land at [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton Crags]] and the troops landed using these as piers for the larger boats. According to Knox, when around 10,000 men were landed unchallenged the Cardinal and [[Regent Arran]] left Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, John, ''History of the Reformation'', Book 1, see external links for an edition: Claude Nau has "Wendy" meaning "Wardie" east of Granton.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. Ninian's Manse, North Leith.JPG|thumb|180px|'''St Ninian's Chapel at the Bridgend''' was burnt in May 1544. The attached manse still stands.]]
The English account is similar, but mentions the presence of five or six thousand horsemen and some foot soldiers, positioned to prevent the short march from Granton to Leith at a ford on the Water of Leith. The Cardinal was with this army but after a few shots and only a couple of casualties on either side, the Scots abandoned their position at the ford of a stream, leaving their eight cannon. (Lisle said two slings and three serpentines were placed to fire across the river, agreeing with Lee's plan).&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1908), no.481, Lisle to Paget.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earls of [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|Huntly]] and [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray (1501 creation)|Moray]] also left the field. Hertford's own dispatch describes this as a half hour fight, "right sharply handled on both parts," with [[Jane Meutas|Peter Mewtas]]'s [[Arquebus|hagbuters]] giving good service.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers,'' vol.19 part 1 (1908), no.472.&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiral reported that Beaton stayed until he was in range of the handguns. He was wearing a frock of yellow velvet, cut and pulled out with white tinselled sarcenet.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of State Papers, Spain'', vol.7, (1899), no.86, Admiral to Paget, 8 May 1544: the description of the Cardinal's costume was translated into French; "Le cardinal y estoit en ung beau chamar de velour iausne tout couppé et deschiquetté bien soigneusement comme à ung tel prelat appartient.", no.88 &amp; note.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another stand before Leith itself gave some resistance, but folded after three expert Scottish gunners were killed by arrows. Hertford summoned Eure and the border horsemen with a brief note mentioning the lack of resistance, signed from the field on the west of Leith.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1903), no.464.&lt;/ref&gt; The English then entered Leith unopposed, where they found two ships that had belonged to James V, the ''[[Salamander of Leith]]'' and the ''Unicorn.'' Some buildings in Leith were burnt, including St Ninian's chapel at the Bridge-end.&lt;ref&gt;'Calendar of Charters &amp; other writs', ''PSAS'' (1907), p.327 no.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Their overnight security was increased by recently constructed defensive entrenchments. Next day, Monday 5 May, the larger English ships were able to unload the heavier artillery on the quayside of the Shore of Leith. these guns were to be used against Edinburgh's gates and the castle.&lt;ref&gt;''Tudor Tracts'', (1903),40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Beaton left the area on Monday, the date recorded in his accounts for hiring a guide between [[Corstorphine]] and [[Stirling]], (a journey then more usually made by boat).&lt;ref&gt;''Rentale Sancti Andree'', SHS (1913), p.180&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eustace Chapuys]], on the same day the Cardinal's enemy [[Alexander Crichton of Brunstane]] tried to meet Hertford at Leith, but an English guard shot him with an arrow in the leg. However, Hertford wrote that Brunstane was in the field with Arran and retreated with him to [[Linlithgow]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Spain'', vol.7 (1899), no.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus|Earl of Angus]], [[George Douglas of Pittendreich]] and [[Robert Maxwell, 5th Lord Maxwell|Lord Maxwell]] were in prison at [[Blackness Castle]] and Edinburgh Castle because they supported the English alliance. Arran, Guise and the Cardinal now ordered their release so their supporters would help their cause. Maxwell later wrote that they were offered cash inducements, with incomes from church lands and pensions from the [[Francis I of France|King of France]].&lt;ref&gt;''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 (1836), pp.428-229, the Confession of Lord Maxwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edinburgh==
[[File:Holyrood Palace 1544.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of '''Richard Lee's''' sketch showing the Palace of Holyroodhouse, English troops entering the [[Canongate]] and an English position on [[Calton Hill]]]]

[[William Stourton, 7th Baron Stourton|William Stourton]] (later commander of the Newhaven fort at [[Ambleteuse]]) was left in charge of Leith on 6 May with 1,500 men while the main force approached Edinburgh itself. They were met by the Provost [[Adam Otterburn]] and two heralds. Otterburn offered to give up the keys of the town on conditions. Hertford refused to accept as he had no authority to bargain. Another English herald went to the Castle, and returned with the news that the Earl of Huntly and [[George Home, 4th Lord Home|Lord Home]] had brought 2000 horsemen to defend the town.

[[Christopher Morris (Master of the Ordnance)|Sir Christopher Morris]] was then ordered to bring his artillery up [[the Canongate]] to assault Edinburgh's Netherbow Gate. During this operation some of the English gunners were killed. The infantry attacked the gate and, according to the English narrative, pulled one of the Scottish artillery pieces through its gunloop. The Scots could not retaliate due to heavy small arms fire and archery, during which Morris placed a cannon close to the gate. After three or four rounds, the gate was breached and the English army stormed through killing 300 or 400 defenders. The Scottish exchequer accounts record that their heavy guns were withdrawn from the High Street into the Castle.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8, HM General Register House (1908), p.291.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, according to a report sent to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the English troops who were unused to urban warfare fought amongst each other, and [[William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham|William Howard]], brother of the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], was hurt in the cheek by an English arrow.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of State Papers, Spain'', vol.7, (1899), no. 89, French copy of Imperial newsletter.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Royal Mile, the central main street of Edinburgh, the English were exposed to the artillery of the Castle. They attempted to place their cannon above the Butter-Tron, between Lawnmarket and Castlehill. A shot from the Castle dismounted one English cannon, and Hertford ordered it to be deliberately burst. At the end of that day, the English retired from the town to their camp at Leith after starting a number of fires.

On 7 May, the fire-raising and looting continued, in the town and at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]], and the English force was joined by Ralph Eure's 4000 border horsemen. [[Nicholas Poyntz]] was sent to burn [[Kinghorn]] and villages on the north of the [[river Forth]]. The fortress on the island of [[Inchgarvie]] was captured and destroyed by [[Richard Brooke (Norton)|Richard Brooke]] in the ''[[List of early warships of the English navy|Galley Subtile]]'' on 6 May. (Hertford mentioned in his dispatch that it would have been useful to garrison Inchgarvie, but his orders from Henry VIII would not allow it.)

Christopher Morris shipped the larger artillery, the ships sailed, and on 14 May the harbour and piers of Leith were demolished. Hertford, as the King's Lieutenant, knighted fifty-eight of his captains and his servant Thomas Fisher distributed three pounds and fifteen shillings amongst the men.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''Marquis of Bath, Longleat, Seymour Papers'', vol.4 (1967), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;  The army left Leith by land on 15 May, stopping to burn [[Seton Palace]] and Haddington.&lt;ref&gt;''Tudor Tracts'', (1903), pp.41-45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edinburgh Castle==
[[File:Edinburgh Castle 1544.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of '''Richard Lee's''' sketch showing [[Edinburgh Castle]] with an English siege gun before David's Tower]]
Although Hertford's army entered the town with little resistance, the defenders of the castle led by the Captain, James Hamilton of Stenhouse kept up an artillery barrage, firing down the line of the Royal Mile. The Clerk of the King's Works, [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Richard Lee]], who was Captain of the Pioneers on this expedition and the Surveyor of Calais, William Burgate, declared the castle impregnable.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the King's Works'', vol. 3, HMSO (1975), 357: ''Letters &amp; Papers'', vol.19, 327, 468, 483-4: ''Hamilton Papers'', vol.2 (1892), p.356&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Castle gunners was [[Andrew Mansioun]], a French carver who had made fittings for the ''Unicorn'', the yacht of James V and furniture for the royal palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pearce, 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', ''Regional Furniture'' vol. XXXII (2018), pp. 127-136.&lt;/ref&gt; His hand was injured when a cannon backfired, and in June 1544 he was given 44 shillings to pay for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 8 (1908), 127, 143, 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Repairs were made in July 1544, when two of the gunners, Tibault Roqueneau and Piers Schouffene (French or Flemish, originally employed at [[Dunbar Castle]]) were working to improve the gun emplacements with [[gabion]]s. The fore-wall of the castle was strengthened and repaired from July. This work was completed between July and August 1546 by three masons and four workmen (called barrowmen in the accounts).&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8 (1908), pp.304, 305, 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looting==
Hertford estimated the value of goods in Leith at £10,000.  This included a large stock of three grades of linen cloth from Brittany. The ships were loaded with property seized in Edinburgh and Leith. He also took the ''Salamander'' and ''Unicorn'', loading them with 80,000 cannon balls for ballast from the [[John Chisholm (soldier)|King's Wark]] arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;''Tudor Tracts'', (1903), 44: ''Hamilton Papers'', vol.2 (1892), p.378 no.238, "canvas, [[Douarnenez|polldavies (Pouldavid linen)]], olromes, other linen cloths," perhaps sail-cloth.&lt;/ref&gt; One surviving captured item is the [[Dunkeld Lectern]], removed from [[Holyrood Abbey]] before the English soldiers fired the church. The lectern may have come into the possession of [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Sir Richard Lee]] who made plans of Edinburgh and Leith and assessed the strength of Edinburgh Castle. Lee certainly took a brass font from Holyrood which he gave to [[St Albans Abbey]]. He had it engraved with an inscription claiming that it was used for the baptism of the Kings of Scotland. As a relic of the monarchy it was destroyed during the [[English civil war]]. [[Longleat House]] has a manuscript copy of a translation of [[Hector Boece]]'s ''Chronicle of Scotland'', taken by [[John Thynne]], Hertford's steward, from [[Holyroodhouse]] on Wednesday 7 May 1544.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers &amp; Seton, 'Bellenden's translation of Boece' in ''SHR'', vol. 9, no.75 (April 1922), p.198: [http://www.christies.com/special_sites/longleat/article.asp?sale=1&amp;article=4 Longleat's Libraries Christie's]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Hertford's muster lists survive at Longleat. These include the name of Sir William Norris of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''Manuscripts of the Marquess of Bath at Longleat, Seymour Papers'', vol.4, HMSO (1967), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; It has traditionally been asserted that carved panelling at his house of [[Speke Hall]] came from the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] though this has been challenged on stylistic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/arch_scot_vol_004/04_001_014.pdf Whatton, William Robert, 'An Inquiry into the probability of a Tradition connected with the Library and Furniture of James IV of Scotland, and of their having been carried off after the Battle of Flodden, and set up at Speke Hall, in the county of Lancaster', ''Archaeologia Scotia'', vol.4, (1857), pp.1-14] (no knowledge of the Longleat muster)&lt;/ref&gt; At Speke there were legal books including [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato|''Bartolus sup. primi degestis veteris'']], Venice (1499) and [[Panormitanus|''Panormitanus on the Decretals'']], Lyon (1501), with [[Robert Estienne]]'s Bible (1532). William Norris wrote in each volume that they were won at Edinburgh on 8 May 1544.  The books passed to the library of the [[Liverpool Athenaeum]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Clark Pidgeon|Pidgeon, H. C.]], ''Proceedings and Papers of the Historical Society of Liverpool and Cheshire'', vol.1&amp;2, (1855), p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Duff, E., 'Some Scottish book-bindings', ''Scottish Historical Review'', vol.4 no.16 (July 1907), p.432.&lt;/ref&gt; They were returned to Edinburgh in 2008 when the [[National Library of Scotland]] bought the collection. Inscriptions show they belonged to the [[Abbot of Cambuskenneth]], who had a lodging on the south side of the Lawnmarket.&lt;ref&gt;See external links&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burnt places==
The returning English army burnt a number of settlements. The destruction was described by [[Walter Lynne]] in his appendix to [[Johann Carion]]'s ''Cronicles'', (1550); "burnyng and destroyeng the countrey about, sparyng nether castel, towne, pyle nor vyllage, untyll they had overthrowen and destroyed many of them, as the borough and towne of Edenborough with the Abbey called Holy Rodehouse, and the kynges Palice adjoyned to the same. The towne of Lyth also with the haven and peyre. The castell and vyllage of Cragmyller, the Abbay of Newbottell, and parte of Muskelborowe towne, the Chappel of our lady of Lawret. Preston towne, and the castell Hatintowne wyth the Freres and Nunery, and castell of [[Oliver Sinclair|Oliuer Sancklers]], the towne of Dunbar, Laurestone wyth the Graunge, with many other townes, castels, vyllages and pyles."&lt;ref&gt;Carion, John, ''Thre Bokes of Cronicles'', (1550), p.cliii&lt;/ref&gt;

The following places burnt or demolished were listed by William Patten, with other places and dates from a manuscript in the [[Harley Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tudor Tracts'', (1903), 47-8, modern place names suggested here, Broughton and Stanhope are west of the army route home, but Patten's list may include places burnt by the Border horse.): Stevenson, Joseph, ed., ''Selections from Unpublished Manuscripts'', Maitland Club (1837), p.5 transcript Harley Ms.6047&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
News spread quickly throughout Europe, though [[Nicholas Wotton]] at [[Speyer]] had to show the importance of Edinburgh as the capital of Scotland using the chronicles of [[Hector Boece]] and [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1903), no.556&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from the physical destruction, a recent historian of the conflict [[Marcus Merriman]] concluded that the army, "really did little of any long-term effect."&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, Marcus, ''The Rough Wooings'', Tuckwell (2000), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Edinburgh was not again threatened by the war, rebuilding was a slow process. New buildings were built on the exact site of their predecessors. Tenure of the Edinburgh lands was complex with numbers of owners claiming incomes from sub-divided buildings, with some portions 'mortified' to the chaplains of altars. At the end of the war, in September 1551 and February 1552 Parliament laid down guidelines for sharing the burden of costs for re-building the burnt lands and tenements "brint be the auld inimies of Ingland."&lt;ref&gt;''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland,'' vol. 3 (1814), pp.489-491.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hertford's knights and captains==
Hertford, as the King's lieutenant knighted the men listed below. The names of his captains are recorded in pay-books and muster lists preserved at [[Longleat House]]. A book of 'conduct money' notes where the captains came from, e.g., Hugh Chomley from [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire]] with 100 men, paid for travelling 130 miles to Edinburgh and back, William Norris from [[Speke Hall|Liverpool]], John Markham from Cottham near [[Retford]], Nottinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;''HMC, Seymour Papers'', vol.4 (1967), pp.66-7, 69-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knighted on Sunday, 11 May, at Leith;

'''Carsten Höller''' (born December 1961) is a [[Germany|German]] [[artist]]. He lives and works in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Today, he also shares a house in [[Ghana]] with colleague [[Marcel Odenbach]].&lt;ref name="wmagazine.com"&gt;Alice Rawsthorn (January 2012), [http://www.wmagazine.com/artdesign/2012/01/carsten-holler-marcel-odenbach-ghana-home "Cliff Hanger - The Ghanaian home of artists Carsten Höller and Marcel Odenbach goes above—and beyond"], ''[[W Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born to German parents working for the [[European Economic Community]], Höller grew up in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Hester Lacey (13 May 2011), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3a805670-7b71-11e0-ae56-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1PdSDc93f "The Inventory: Carsten Höller"], ''Financial Times Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a doctorate in agricultural science, specializing in the area of insects' olfactory&lt;ref&gt;[http://enelcontemporanea.enel.com/en/2011-2/award/carsten-holler/ Carsten Höller] Enel Contemporanea.&lt;/ref&gt; communication strategies, from [[University of Kiel]];&lt;ref name="kunsthaus-bregenz.at"&gt;[http://www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at/ehtml/ewelcome00.htm Carsten Höller "Carrousel" - Kunsthaus Bregenz]&lt;/ref&gt; the title of his dissertation is "Efficiency Analysis of the Parasitoids of Cereal Aphids".&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Höller, Christian Borgemeister, Helmut Haardt and Wilf Powell,[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/5478?uid=3738984&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=56110251503 "The Relationship between Primary Parasitoids and Hyperparasitoids of Cereal Aphids: An Analysis of Field Data"], ''Journal of Animal Ecology'', Vol. 62, No. 1 (January 1993), pp. 12–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Only during the late 1980s did he first begin making art. However, he worked as a research entomologist until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Jones (13 October 2006), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/13/art ''The Guardian'' profile: Carsten Höller], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Höller came to prominence in the 1990s alongside a group of artists including [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Douglas Gordon]],&lt;ref name="wmagazine.com"/&gt; [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]], and [[Andrea Zittel]] who worked across disciplines to reimagine the experience and the space of art.&lt;ref name="newmuseum.org"&gt;[http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/449 Carsten Höller: Experience, 26 October 2011 – 15 January 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022114208/http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/449 |date=22 October 2011 }} [[New Museum]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Höller creates situations which question familiar forms of perception and allow exhibition visitors to experiment on themselves, often inviting the public's active participation in so-called "influential environments".&lt;ref&gt;Nazanin Lankarani (22 March 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/arts/23iht-rartcongo23.html "Juxtaposing Works From Congo and Japan"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In their form, Höller's works are occasionally reminiscent of scientific laboratory arrangements, allowing the viewer to become the subject of an experiment.&lt;ref name="kunsthaus-bregenz.at"/&gt; His work since the early 1990s has encompassed buildings, vehicles, slides, toys, games, narcotics, animals, performances, lectures, 3D films, flashing lights, mirrors, eyewear and sensory deprivation tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Farquharson, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/before_and_after_science/ Before and After Science] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524051227/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/before_and_after_science/ |date=24 May 2011 }} ''Frieze Magazine'', Issue 85, September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Höller's works is a series of corkscrewing tubular metal slides made from 1998 that is an ongoing project.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy (25 October 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/arts/design/carsten-holler-exhibition-at-the-new-museum.html?ref=design Is It Art, Science or a Test of People?] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are slides a practical means of transportation, but the act of sliding down one produces a loss of control, inducing a particular state of mind related to freedom from constraint. His most famous slides include that made for the office of [[Miuccia Prada]] in Milan (2000) and the first slides made for the [[Berlin Biennale]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/pressoffice/pressreleases/2006/tm_carston_holler_16-01-06.htm "Carsten Höller to undertake next commission in The Unilever Series"], Tate Modern, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Höller's artistic practice reflects the interaction between work and public in various ways, sometimes chemically analyzing the nature of human emotions. His avid interest in the double harks back to the start of his career, when Höller designed a series of works with his then girlfriend,&lt;ref name="wmagazine.com"/&gt; the artist [[Rosemarie Trockel]], actually doubling himself up in another creator. Other examples include an exhibition in which Höller and [[Maurizio Cattelan]] presented a series of identical works at two different Paris galleries, removing all differences of style or ownership;&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimiliano Gioni]] (22 August 2011), [http://www.domusweb.it/en/art/my-africa/ My Africa] ''[[Domus (magazine)|Domus]]'' 949, July/August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and his exhibition "One Day One Day" (2003) at Färgfabriken in Stockholm, where two works were shown opposite each other and changed every day without the public’s knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Sansom (8 March 2011), [http://www.frieze.com/shows/review/japancongo/ JAPANCONGO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514193822/http://www.frieze.com/shows/review/japancongo/ |date=14 May 2011 }} ''Frieze Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; His explorations often involve playful elements such as in ''Sliding Doors'' (2003), a series of electronic sliding doors with a mirrored surface through which the audience passes in a seemingly endless passage.&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt; In 2008, Höller installed ''The Revolving Hotel Room'', a hotel room for two, as part of an exhibition at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Martin (27 August 2008), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/27/museums "A room for two at the Guggenhei"m], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; At his 2010 show at the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]], visitors could pay 1,000 euros ($1,370) for a night on an exposed circular platform perched above 12 castrated reindeer, 24 canaries, eight mice and two flies.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hickley (25 November 2010), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-25/magic-mushroom-reindeer-bored-by-couples-at-1-370-museum-slumber-parties.html Magic-Mushroom Reindeer Bored by $1,370 Museum Slumber Parties] ''Bloomberg''.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Psycho Tank'', which can be used alone or with others, visitors float weightlessly on the surface of a sensory deprivation pool, providing a strange out-of-body experience&lt;ref name="newmuseum.org"/&gt; Equally encouraging visitors' participation, ''Pill Clock'' (2011) is an aperture which emits a white pill into a growing pile of the same every 15 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle Chayka (26 October 2011), [http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38961/take-a-virtual-tour-of-carsten-hollers-art-amusement-park-at-the-new-museum/ Take a Virtual Tour of Carsten Holler's Art Amusement Park at the New Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028172108/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38961/take-a-virtual-tour-of-carsten-hollers-art-amusement-park-at-the-new-museum/ |date=28 October 2011 }} ''ARTINFO''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mushrooms became a regular feature of Höller's work from 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Cripps (10 February 2010), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/j-g-ballard-high-impact-on-artists-1894377.html?action=Gallery&amp;ino=6 J G Ballard: High impact on artists] ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He has since realized several works with the [[Amanita muscaria|fly-agaric mushroom]], including the ''Mushroom Suitcase'' series (2001/2008) and the ''Upside Down Mushroom Room'' (2000), which was shown in 2000 at Fondazione Prada in Milan and in 2005 at [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|MOCA]] in Los Angeles. His fly-agaric replicas are large-scale and often spin or hang upside down from the ceiling. The artist has also created photographic works based on the fly-agaric, entitled ''Mushroom Print'' (2003) and ''Soma Series'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garageccc.ru/eng/exhibitions/13619.phtml Giant Triple Mushrooms - Carsten Höller, 29 May – 10 October 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011233431/http://www.garageccc.ru/eng/exhibitions/13619.phtml |date=11 October 2011 }} Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of giant sculptures of funghi – ''Giant Triple Mushrooms'' (2010) –, two quarters of each sculpture replicate the looks of two random fungi; half, a very specific species: the large red-and-white fly agaric fungus, [[Amanita muscaria]], occurring wild in Eurasia. A fungus with psychoactive, hallucinogenic properties, it was used, it is thought, by Siberian shamans as an intoxicant.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Higgins (25 October 2011), [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2011/oct/25/art-museums?newsfeed=true "Carsten Höller in New York: all the fun of the fair"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals have figured largely in Höller’s work, most prominently at his exhibition ''Soma'' at the Hamburger Bahnhof, where two herds of reindeer were housed in the large main exhibition hall, along with canaries, mice and flies. The project was modeled after a scientific experiment. Other works that include animals include ''House for Pigs and People'', a construction Höller made with [[Rosemarie Trockel]] that was exhibited in [[documenta|documenta X]], which Höller described as a "monument of incomprehensibility. The amazement that comes back every time we observe an animal… the pigs are so similar to us, they set off strong biophile sentiments, mainly among children…." In a conversation with [[Daniel Birnbaum]], Höller continues, "…It is difficult for us to believe that our consciousness—my consciousness—can correspond to an other’s. Only if others behave like me, am I prepared to accept it—and still consider my own being unique, as do all other humans. Perhaps it is only this uniqueness that a bird doesn’t believe in. Is it missing the process of a feedback with its ‹own›". Other animal works include ''Loverfinches'' (1992-1994), ''Aquarium'' (1996), ''The Belgian Problem'' (2007), ''Singing Canaries Mobile'' (2009), and, with Rosemarie Trockel, ''Mosquito Bus'' (1996), ''Addina'' (1997), ''Bee House'' (1999), ''Silverfish House'' (1999) and ''Eyeball: a House for Pigeons, People, and Rats'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Holler, Carsten, and Daniel Birnbaum.

==Notable works, projects, and exhibitions==
'''Slides'''&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Carsten holler tate.jpg|thumb|350px|right|''Test Site'' at the Tate Modern]]
For the seventh commission in The Unilever Series, in [[Tate Modern|Tate Modern's]] Turbine Hall, Höller created ''Test Site'', an installment in his ongoing series of slide works which started in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-carsten-holler-test-site|title=The Unilever Series: Carsten Höller: Test site|website=www.tate.org.uk|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Höller’s interest in slides ranges from their use as a practical and alternative means of transportation and the effect of sliding itself, which involves a loss of control, vertigo and an emotional response from the sliders, often delight. He is also interested in the shape of slides as a counterpoint to rectangular architecture, as in the Turbine Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Höller: Test Site. London: Tate, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier slide works include ''Valerio I'' and ''Valerio II'', which were installed at Kunst-Werke in Berlin in 1998 and 1999. Höller described their title, "The Valerio Phenomenon…supposedly originated at a rock concert in Italy. It’s an interesting example of mass hysteria.  A sound technician at a concert disappeared, and someone in the audience, pretending to know his name, shouted 'Valerio!', and  more and more people joined in.  It was apparently infectious, and it spread from Brindisi to Rimini and other cities.  There is something about the sound of this name that makes you want to shout it loud.  You feel a little better after you’ve done it, just like after having traveled down a slide."&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Höller in Daniel Birnbaum and Carsten Höller, Tuotanto/Production, exh. cat., Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki 2000, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay about ''Test Site'', Dorothea von Hantelmann compares Höller’s slides to Nietzsche’s ideas regarding art and science as two different powers that inform culture in distinct ways. "When Nietzsche speaks of art’s potential to create intensities and vital energies, for him these creations are extraordinary—but they need not be true.  While the scientist deals with truth and its cognition, the artist, after Nietzche, creates and transforms reality."&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Höller: Test Site. London: Tate, 2006, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his exhibition ''Experience'' at the New Museum in New York in 2011/2012, a slide was installed inside, spiraling straight through the third and fourth floors of the museum, ejecting the sliders on the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy. "Is It Art, Science or a Test of People?" ''The New York Times'', 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''House for Pigs and People'''&lt;br /&gt;
The project ''House for Pigs and People'', for documenta X in Kassel in 1997, was one of several collaborations realized by Höller in cooperation with the artist [[Rosemarie Trockel]]. It consisted of a box-like house structure with a concrete surface.  Inside, the space was divided by a sheet of glass, separating two sections of the house—one side for pigs, the other side for people.  The partition was one-way mirror glass, enabling the people to see the pigs, but not the other way around. The piece is a metaphor of ecological and social division, as well as an epistemological critique.&lt;ref&gt;Höller, Carsten, and Trockel, Rosemarie. ''A House for Pigs and People = Ein Haus für Schweine und Menschen''. Köln: Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther König, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book produced for the project, Höller and Trockel contribute a text that consists of a series of questions involving the relationship between humans and animals.  Some of the questions ask: "Does not human consciousness originate primarily as a project of the sociological conditions of its coming into being?  Doesn’t animal consciousness have to be something quite different, something we cannot imagine?  Or is there a basic measure of consciousness, which is part of man’s biological makeup and also occurs in animals?"&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, Daniel. "Mice And Man - Carsten Höller and Rosemarie Trockel", ''[[Artforum International]]'', February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Double Club'''&lt;br /&gt;
''The Double Club'' was a project in the form of a bar, restaurant and nightclub produced in collaboration with [[Fondazione Prada]].  It was installed in a warehouse in Islington, London, and was open from 20 November 2008 – 12 July 2009.  The club was divided into equal amounts of floor space representing the "Congo" and the "West".  Each division contained exclusively elements from each culture, including the furnishings, wall decors and food.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Jennifer, ''Frieze'', 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(London location), Collard, James, ''The Times of London'', 18 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wallpaper.com/travel/the-double-club-london&lt;/ref&gt;

Höller’s interaction with the culture of the Congo began when he started making regular visits to Kinshasa since 2001, interested in the role of music on public opinion and in turn in effecting politics. In an interview with [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]] in 2009, Höller also explains that the impetus for the ''Double Club'' was also drawn from a fascination with the phi phenomenon, "…phi was of course interesting in a double sense…the jumping to and fro between two points, the eternal back and forth.  And in that way this third form arises, which is an illusion and which moves, while the two other forms, by contrast, are fixed."&lt;ref&gt;''The Double Club''. Milan: Fondazione Prada, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phi phenomenon]] was explored earlier in Höller’s ''Flicker Films'', (2004 and 2005) which took footage from Congolese musicians and dancers presented on overlapping projections, which created a sculptural, quasi-holographic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Höller, Carsten and Barbara-Brigitte Mak. ''Höller 2001-2010: 184 Objects, Experiments, Events''. Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition of Double Club took place at Miami Art Basel this year where the artist exposes his on going concept on duality and oppositions in the shape of two installations where one side is monochromatic and other, full of neon colours. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/06/prada-double-club-miami-wynwood-carsten-holler-art-basel/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carsten Holler Soma Hamburger Bahnhof Reindeer closeup.jpg|thumb|left|''Soma'' at Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin 2010. Photo credit: Tomislav Medak]]
'''SOMA'''&lt;br /&gt;
The exhibition ''Soma'' was installed at the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] in Berlin in 2010.  Its main element were 12 reindeer in two pens running the length of the former railway station. Half of the reindeer were fed the [[Amanita muscaria|fly agaric mushrooms]] in their food, which are part of their customary diet in the wild, and turn their urine into a hallucinogen. The reindeer urine was collected by handlers and then stored in on-site refrigerators for use. The experiment was extended to canaries, which were housed in two hanging cage pieces, to mice, and to flies. A mushroom-shaped ''Elevator Bed'' was installed in the middle of the space, and visitors could spend the night on the premise for a fee.

The title ''Soma'' comes from the name of the sacred libation drunk by the Indo-European followers of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], Hinduism's 5,000-year-old parent. Its ancient text, the [[Rigveda]], contains 114 hymns to "creative juice", supposed to offer immortality. The recipe was lost, but in the 1960s researcher Robert Wasson hypothesised that soma was based on the fly agaric mushroom.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Williams (20 December 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/21/carsten-holler-soma "Carsten Höller: deer of perception"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Killing Children'''&lt;br /&gt;
Höller’s ''Killing Children'' works are discreet objects made between 1990 and 1994.  Some consist of such things as a comforter containing a piece of dried fly agaric titled ''Sucette aux Fausses Oranges'', a trap made from an upside-down playpen baited with a [[Kinder Chocolate|Kinder Schokolade]] egg attached to fishing wire titled ''Komm Kleines, kriegst was Feines'', a bicycle for children rigged with a fuse, match, and petrol titled ''Bicycle Bomb'', a piece titled ''220 Volt'' consisting of plugs, connecting cable and candy. ''Three Venomous Frogs from [[Costa Rica]] in a Bottle'' is a piece that is just that: dangerous frogs submerged in water in a baby’s bottle. The works in this series have been usually installed on bright bubble-gum pink carpet.&lt;ref name="Höller, Carsten 2000"&gt;Höller, Carsten, and Germano Celant. Carsten Höller - Register: [in Occasion of Carsten Höller's Exhibition "Synchro System" at the Fondazione Prada, 22.XI.2000 - 7.I.2001]. Milano, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carousels'''&lt;br /&gt;
Höller’s carousels (sometimes spelled carrousel, with two R’s, intentionally like the original word in French) and amusement park works, are some of his most well-known projects.  Dating back to 1998, the key feature with Höller’s carousels are that they are modified in some way than what we expect from an amusement park ride, either most often through speed, or sometimes rotational direction, or surface material, as is the case with his ''Mirror Carousel'' (2005). In his exhibition ''Amusement Park'' at [[MASS MoCA]] in North Adams, 2006, the degree of slowness and direction changed every day.  A local fairground operator, Art Gillette, engineered the changes.

In a catalogue essay for Höller’s 2008 exhibition at [[Kunsthaus Bregenz]], Carl Roitmeister writes of the carrousel works, "This is the age-old artistic ploy of defamiliarizing the commonplace in combination with the age-old artistic ploy represented by the Duchamp-style readymade.  But two age-old ploys do not add up to a new one…The title of the carrousel, ''R B Ride'', doesn’t get us anywhere, because R B merely stands for Robles Bouso, the name of the now-defunct Spanish company that made the fairground device.  The year of manufacture is 1969, the year of the failed revolution."  Roitmeister goes on to make comparisons of the failure of the revolution with the action of the carrousel, the revolution of a clock, or time passing, in relation to the fact that the carousels move at a reduced speed, another failure—the failure to produce amusement.  He goes further to say that "the carrousel resembles a huge clock—that is, a time-measuring device rather than a time-diverting machine…"&lt;ref&gt;Roitmeister, Carl, Eckhard Schneider, and Carsten Höller. Carsten Höller, Carrousel [anlässlich Der Ausstellung Carsten Höller - Carrousel, 12. April Bis 1. Juni 2008, Kunsthaus Bregenz]. Köln: König, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Höller’s exhibition in 2011 at [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome|MACRO]], he showed ''Double Carousel with Zöllner Stripes'' (2011). The pair of carousels anthropomorphically suggests a couple, "I thought it would be nice to have two [merry-go-rounds] interacting as if they were in love or something. To bring people together and then further away ... It is romantic and tragic at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Spence (16 December 2011), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/c9b0b29e-2261-11e1-923d-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1rX87CXAu Just Höller] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilarie M. Sheets (29 January 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/arts/lowspeed-chase-on-carousel-of-the-mind.html "Directions - Low-Speed Chase On Carousel Of the Mind"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light Wall and Lichtraum'''&lt;br /&gt;
''Light Wall I'' (2000), ''Light Wall II'' (2001), ''Light Wall III'' (2002), ''Light Wall IV'' (2007), constitute a series of variable ''Light Walls'' consisting of at least nine panels.  Each panel holds a grid of light bulbs flickering at a frequency of between seven and twelve hertz, combined with a clicking stereo signal that continues back and forth between two audio speakers. This induces optic and acoustic [[hallucinations]]: viewers experience modulating fields of color with their eyes open or shut, or perceive themselves or what is said by others around them in altered ways. The incessant turning on and off of the lights—in contrast to strobe lights—primarily induces, due to the slow illumination rate of the filaments, an erratic state of mind caught "between" poles of light/dark, awake/asleep, I/other, etc. ''Lichtraum'' (2008), as installed at [[Kunsthaus Bregenz]], consisted of four walls of the exhibition space, each covered by thousands of [[LED lights]].  Since given the imposing scale of the surfaces, the lights are always seen out of the corner of the eye, one’s proprioception is affected so that one forms an "intuited" revolving.&lt;ref name="Höller, Carsten 2010"&gt;Höller, Carsten, Barbara-Brigitte Mak, and Erik Smith.

{{Mass surveillance by location}}

The '''Central Monitoring System''', abbreviated to '''CMS''', is a centralized telephone interception provisioning system installed by the [[C-DOT|Centre for Development of Telematics]] (C-DOT), an [[Government of India|Indian Government]] owned [[telecommunications]] technology development centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/AR%20Englsih%2011-12_0.pdf |title=Annual Report 2011-12 |publisher=Department of Telecommunications (DoT) |date= |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated by [[Telecom Enforcement Resource and Monitoring]] (TERM) [[Clandestine cell system|Cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Telecom%20Annual%20Report-2012-13%20%28English%29%20_For%20web%20%281%29.pdf |title=Annual Report 2012-13 |publisher=Department of Telecommunications (DoT) |date= |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMC system is going to be set up in each major state collocated with the TERM Cells.Telecom operators in India are required by law to give access to their networks to law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kotoky |first=Anurag |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/06/20/india-surveillance-idINDEE95J04V20130620 |title=India sets up elaborate system to tap phone calls, e-mail |publisher=Reuters |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government has set up the Centralized Monitoring System (CMS) to automate the process of Lawful Interception &amp; Monitoring of telecommunications. CMS has got the approval from government. Cabinet Committee on Security has approved the project of CMS with government funding of Rs 400 Crores. Pilot trials have been completed and the system is anticipated to be progressively operationalised from the end of the financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==History==
The 2007-08 annual report of the [[Department of Telecommunications]] (DoT) stated that the requirements for the CMS project had been finalized by the [[Telecommunication Engineering Center]] (TEC), after deliberations with security agencies, and that the first phase of the project, covering the "national capital", was scheduled to be implemented by 31 March 2008. It also stated that C-DOT had finalized the "scope, architecture and dimensioning of the network".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/English%20annual%20report%202007-08_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008-09 annual report stated that proof of concept had been demonstrated and that R&amp;D activities for the project were "ongoing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/AR_English_2008-09_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of India budgeted $150 million for the system as part of its [[12th Five Year Plan (Government of India)|12th Five Year Plan]], with [[Cabinet of India|Cabinet]] ultimately approving a higher amount.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The CMS was fast-tracked following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]. However, it faced repeated delays and missed the original deployment deadline of the end of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-27/news/40233413_1_surveillance-system-government-surveillance-business-climate |title=Beyond Snowden: US surveillance system a useful model for democratic, terror-hit India|publisher=The Economic Times |date=2013-06-27 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the next deadline of March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=PTI|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/telecom-central-monitoring-system-in-10-circles-by-december-914389.html |title=Telecom Central Monitoring System in 10 circles by December |publisher=''Firstpost'' |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMS was first announced publicly in a press release by the [[Press Information Bureau]] (PIB), dated 26 November 2009.&lt;ref name="firstpost1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Raza |first=Danish |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/indias-central-monitoring-system-security-cant-come-at-cost-of-privacy-944475.html |title=India's Central Monitoring System: Security can't come at cost of privacy |publisher=''Firstpost'' |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release lacked details on the system but stated that CMS was a "centralized system to monitor communications on mobile phones, landlines and the internet in the country" and claimed that the project would "strengthen the security environment in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=54679 |title=Press Information Bureau English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMS was mentioned by [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Minister of Communications and Information Technology]] [[Kapil Sibal]] on 1 January 2011, while addressing the media to announce his 100-day agenda for the Indian telecom sector. Sibal mentioned it in passing, telling the media that "Steps will be taken to establish the Central Monitoring System which will facilitate and prevent misuse of lawful interception facility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandeep Joshi |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1023117.ece |title=100-day plan: Sibal promises transparency in telecom sector |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=PTI |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-01/india/28373595_1_spectrum-telecom-minister-new-telecom-policy |title=Govt to come out with new telecom policy: Sibal |publisher=The Times of India |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was described as "muted" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [[Time (magazine)|magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trivedi |first=Anjani |url=http://world.time.com/2013/06/30/in-india-prism-like-surveillance-slips-under-the-radar/ |title=In India, Prism-like Surveillance Slips Under the Radar |publisher=World.time.com |date=2013-06-30 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2011, Minister of State for Communications &amp; Information Technology, [[Sachin Pilot]] stated that the CMS was to be set up for the "[[Lawful Interception]] and [[Surveillance|Monitoring]] of communications to address the national security concerns. It will automize the present manual system of interception and monitoring, which will enhance the secrecy of intercepted numbers and will cut down the delay in provisioning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=70747 |title=Press Information Bureau English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2012, ''[[The New Indian Express]]'' reported that the [[National Investigation Agency]] (NIA) had requested for authorization to access CMS once it became functional. The paper also stated that a pilot trial was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yadav |first=Yatish |url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/article1300012.ece |title=NIA seeks Central Monitoring System to tap phones |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mint'' cited an internal note from the DoT dated 10 June 2013, which reportedly said that CMS had "undergone successful pilots" and was "likely to be commissioned" by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="livemint1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie D’Monte &amp; Joji Thomas Philip |url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/pR5zc8hCD1sn3NWQwa7cQJ/The-new-surveillance-state.html |title=How the world's largest democracy is preparing to snoop on its citizens |publisher=Livemint |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government began rolling out the CMS, state by state, in April 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

== Interception Authorization ==
In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 7 of the [[Indian Telegraph Act]], 1885 (13 of 1885), the Government of [[India]] made [http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/resources/rule-419-a-indian-telegraph-rules-1951 Rule 419A] of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directions for interception of any message or class of messages under sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 shall not be issued except by an order made by the Secretary to the Government of India in the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] in the case of Government of India and by the Secretary to the State Government in-charge of the Home Department in the case of a State Government. In unavoidable circumstances, such order may be made by an officer, not below the rank of a Joint Secretary to the Government of India, who has been duly authorized by the Union Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary, as the case may be:

Provided that in emergent cases:

(i) in remote areas, where obtaining of prior directions for interception of messages or class of messages is not feasible; or

(ii) for operational reasons, where obtaining of prior directions for interception of message or class of messages is not feasible;

the required interception of any message or class of messages shall be carried out with the prior approval of the Head or the second senior most officer of the authorized security ''i.e.'' Law Enforcement Agency at the Central Level and the officers authorised in this behalf, not below the rank of Inspector General of Police at the state level but the concerned competent authority shall be informed of such interceptions by the approving authority within three working days and that such interceptions shall be got confirmed by the concerned competent authority within a period of seven working days. If the confirmation from the competent authority is not received within the stipulated seven days, such interception shall cease and the same message or class of messages shall not be intercepted thereafter without the prior approval of the Union Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary, as the case may be.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of interceptions and monitoring under Section 5(2) of the Act through its order dated 18.12.1996 in Writ Petition (C) No.256/1991 by People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) Vs. Union of India. It has also observed that the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one's home or office without interference can certainly be claimed as “Right to Privacy”, and accordingly, held that telephone tapping would infringe the Right to Life and Right to Freedom of Speech &amp; Expression enshrined in Articles 21 and 19(1)(a) respectively of the Constitution of India, unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law. The Hon’ble Court further observed that Section 5(2) of the Act clearly provides that ‘occurrence of any public emergency’ or ‘interest of public safety’ is a sine qua non for the application of these provisions. Neither of these are secretive conditions or situations. Either of the situations would be apparent to a reasonable person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==System details==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Earlier the provisioning of Interception of the Telephone was being done by the Telecom operators on the basis of duly authorized order by the competent authority in accordance with 419A telephone rule. Traditionally, the Law Enforcement Agency was approaching the various telecom companies based on the numbering scheme of the target telephone number. In CMS setup there is no change in the Interception authorization order envisaged in 419A telephone rule except that now the [[Law Enforcement]] Agency will go to only TERM Cell for any interception order provisioning irrespective of telephone numbering scheme. There is no change in the existing LIS / LIM system in the telecom network. The TERM Cell who are the field unit of DOT and carries the enforcement and regulation of licensing conditions in the field will be sole authority to provision the interception orders but interception orders will be obtained by Law Enforcement Agencies in according to the 419A telephone rule.

==Government objective==
Government has set up the Centralized Monitoring System (CMS) to automate the process of Lawful Interception &amp; Monitoring of telecommunications technology. Government of India on 2015-12-02 in a reply to parliament question no. 595 on scope, objectives and framework of the CMS has struck a balance between national security, online privacy and free speech informed that to take care of the privacy of citizens, lawful interception and monitoring is governed by the Section 5(2) of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 read with Rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007 wherein oversight mechanism exists in form of review committee under chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary at Central Government level and Chief Secretary of the State at the State Government level. The same mechanism is applicable for the interception under the CMS Project also. Additionally, there is an inbuilt mechanism of check and balance as Security Agencies/Law Enforcement Agencies cannot provision the target and the provisioning agency cannot see the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

''[[Business Standard]]'' criticised the fact that a warrant need not be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/india-s-digital-battleground-113062101013_1.html|title=India's digital battleground|last=Shukla|first=Ajai|date=21 June 2013|work=[[Business Standard]]|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Firstpost]]'' criticised the lack of information from the government about the project and the lack of a legal recourse for a citizen whose personal details were misused or leaked.&lt;ref name="firstpost1"/&gt; ''[[The Hindu]]'' also criticised the lack of information available about the system.&lt;ref name="thehindu2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Deepa Kurup |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/in-the-dark-about-indias-prism/article4817903.ece |title=In the dark about 'India's Prism' |publisher=The Hindu |date=2013-06-16 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Indian Express]]'' criticised the introduction of the system in the absence of accountability and "any reasonably effective safeguards" to protect privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/way-to-watch/1133737/0 |title=Way to watch |publisher=Indian Express |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times of India]]'' criticised the introduction of CMS without public debate or Parliamentary accountability. The paper also felt that Indian privacy laws were "lax",&lt;ref name="indiatimes3"/&gt; and "far worse than American law on these matters".&lt;ref name="indiatimes3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-13/news/39952596_1_nsa-india-us-homeland-security-dialogue-national-security-letters |title=Indian surveillance laws &amp; practices far worse than US|publisher=The Economic Times |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued that India did not need centralised interception facilities to have centralised tracking of interception requests. The paper also expressed supported for a strong privacy law, and advised Indian citizens to "take greater care of their own privacy and safeguard the security of their communications".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prakash |first=Pranesh |url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/can-india-trust-its-government-on-privacy/ |title=Can India Trust Its Government on Privacy? |location=Hyderabad |publisher=India.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights and civil-liberties groups reactions==
Human rights and civil-liberties groups have expressed concerns that the CMS is prone to abuse, and is an infringement of privacy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|author=R.

Meenakshi Ganguly, the [[South Asia]] director of [[Human Rights Watch]], felt that the move toward extensive "surveillance capabilities enabled by digital communications" suggests that governments are now "casting the net wide, enabling intrusions into private lives". Ganguly also felt that increasing surveillance around the world was an attempt by governments to "grapple with the power of social media that can enable spontaneous street protests".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[Praveen Swami]], strategic affairs editor of [[Network 18|Network18]], felt that "There is also the argument that the threat of a cyber attack is deliberately overplayed&amp;nbsp;... it is far-fetched.

Anja Kovacs of the Internet Democracy Project, and a fellow at the New Delhi-based Centre for Internet and Society, felt that there was "a growing discrepancy and power imbalance between citizens and the state" and that in the Indian scenario, there were "no checks and balances in place".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trivedi |first=Anjani |url=http://world.time.com/2013/06/30/in-india-prism-like-surveillance-slips-under-the-radar/#ixzz2YpWhRsrB |title=In India, Prism-like Surveillance Slips Under the Radar |publisher=''Time'' |date=2013-06-30 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunil Abraham, executive director of Bangalore-based non-profit Centre for Internet and Society, advised Indians to "stop using proprietary software, shift to free/open source software" and "encrypt all sensitive Internet traffic and email using software like TOR and GNU Privacy Guard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-22/internet/40133453_1_source-software-cyanogenmod-encryption |title=Cyber experts suggest using open source software to protect privacy |publisher=The Times of India |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compassion''' motivates people to go out of their way to help the physical, mental, or emotional pains of another and themselves. Compassion is often regarded as having sensitivity, an emotional aspect to suffering, though when based on cerebral notions such as fairness, justice, and interdependence, it may be considered rational in nature and its application understood as an activity also based on sound judgment. There is also an aspect of equal dimension, such that individual's compassion is often given a property of "depth", "vigour", or "[[passion (emotion)|passion]]". The etymology of "compassion" is Latin, meaning "co-suffering." Compassion involves "feeling for another" and is a precursor to [[empathy]], the "feeling as another" capacity for better person centered acts of active compassion; in common parlance active compassion is the [[desire (emotion)|desire]] to alleviate another's suffering.&lt;ref name="sjsl"&gt;Sherlyn Jimenez, see article on ''Compassion'', The Encyclopedia of Positive Psychology, Volume I, Editor: Shane Lopez, Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion involves allowing ourselves to be moved by suffering, and experiencing the motivation to help alleviate and prevent it. An act of compassion is defined by its [[helpfulness]]. Qualities of compassion are patience and wisdom; kindness and perseverance; warmth and resolve. It is often, though not inevitably, the key component in what manifests in the social context as [[altruism]]. Expression of compassion is prone to be hierarchical, paternalistic and controlling in responses.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010"/&gt; Difference between sympathy and compassion is that the former responds to suffering with sorrow and concern while the latter responds with warmth and care.&lt;ref name="CompInteg"/&gt;

The English [[noun]] ''compassion'', meaning ''to love together with'', comes from [[Latin]]. Its [[prefix]] ''com-'' comes directly from ''com'', an archaic version of the Latin [[preposition]] and affix [[wikt:cum|cum]] (= with); the ''-passion'' segment is derived from ''passus'', [[past participle]] of the [[deponent verb]] [[wikt:patior|patior, patī, passus sum]]. Compassion is thus related in origin, form and meaning to the English noun [[patient]] (= one who suffers), from ''patiens'', [[present participle]] of the same [[wikt:patior|patior]], and is akin to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb πάσχειν (= ''paskhein'', to suffer) and to its [[cognate]] noun [[wikt:πάθος|πάθος]] (= [[pathos]]).&lt;ref name="newSOED"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;{{cite book |author=Partridge, Eric |title=Origins: a short etymological dictionary of modern English |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1966 |pages= |isbn=0-02-594840-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranked a great virtue in numerous [[philosophy|philosophies]], compassion is considered in almost all the major [[religion|religious traditions]] as among the greatest of [[virtue]]s.

== Theories ==
Theoretical perspectives of compassion have been developed through the years, the following three proposed perspectives show contrasts in their evolution and approaches to compassion.
:* Compassion is simply a variation of love or sadness, not a distinct emotion.&lt;ref name="Shaver et. al: Emotion Knowledge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaver|first=P|author2=J Schwartz |author3=D Kirson |author4=C O'Connor |title=Emotion knowledge: further exploration of a prototype approach|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=June 1987|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1061–1086|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.6.1061 |pmid=3598857}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, compassion can be viewed as a distinct emotional state, which can be differentiated from distress, [[sadness]], and [[love]].&lt;ref name="Bowlby: Attach and loss vol. 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=John|title=Attachment: Attachment and Loss Volume One|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Moral Emotions: Haidt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|title=The Moral Emotions|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=852–870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social Functionalism and the Evolution of Emotions: Keltner et al"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keltner|first=Dacher|title=Social Functionalism and the Evolution of Emotions|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|pages=115–142|author2=Jonathan Haidt |author3=Michelle Shiota}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Compassion as a synonym of empathic distress, which is characterized by the feeling of distress in connection with another person's suffering.&lt;ref name="Compassion: An Evolutionary Analysis and Empirical Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goetz|first=Jennifer|author2=Dacher Kelter |author3=Emiliana Simon-Thomas |title=Compassion: An Evolutionary Analysis and Empirical Review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2010|volume=136|issue=3|pages=351–374|doi=10.1037/a0018807|pmid=20438142|pmc=2864937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman|first=Paul|title=Emotions Revealed: Recognizing Faces and Feelings to improve communication and emotional life|year=2003|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Martin|title=Is altruism part of human nature?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1981|volume=40|issue=1|pages=121–137|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective of compassion is based on the finding that people sometimes emulate and feel the emotions of people around them.&lt;ref name="Hatfield, 1993: Emotional Contagion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatfield|first=Elaine|author2=John Cacioppo|title=Emotional Contagion|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=1993|volume=2|issue=3|pages=96–99|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953|last3=Rapson|first3=Richard L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more one person knows about the human condition and the associated experiences, the more vivid the route to identification with suffering becomes.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Eric|title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-518724-3|pages=393–403|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying with another person is an essential process for human beings, it is commonly seen throughout the world as people adapt and change with new styles of clothing, language, behavior, etc., which is even illustrated by infants who begin to mirror the facial expressions and body movements of their mother as early as the first days of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzoff|first=Andrew|title=The Roots of Social and Cognitive Development: Models of Man's Original Nature|journal=Social Perception in Infants|year=1985|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personality psychology]] agrees that people are inherently different and distinct from one another, which leads to the conclusion that human suffering is always individual and unique.

The compassion process is highly related to identifying with the other person because sympathizing with others is possible among people from other countries, cultures, locations, etc. A possible source of this process of identifying with others comes from a universal category called "Spirit." Toward the late 1970s, very different cultures and nations around the world took a turn to [[religious fundamentalism]], which has occasionally been attributed to "Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegal|first=Georg|title=Phenomenology of Spirit|year=1952|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824597-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of compassion as a factor contributing to individual or societal behavior has been the topic of continuous debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Lee |title=Compassion and Societal Well-Being|journal=Pacific Philosophical Quarterly|date=1 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the process of identifying with other people, a complete absence of compassion may require ignoring or disapproving identification with other people or groups.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Earlier studies established the links between interpersonal violence and cruelty which leads to indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Frank R.

=== Psychology ===
Compassion has become associated with and researched in the fields of [[positive psychology]] and social psychology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jazaieri|first=Hooria|last2=Jinpa|first2=Geshe Thupten|last3=McGonigal|first3=Kelly|last4=Rosenberg|first4=Erika L.|last5=Finkelstein|first5=Joel|last6=Simon-Thomas|first6=Emiliana|last7=Cullen|first7=Margaret|last8=Doty|first8=James R.|last9=Gross|first9=James J.|date=2012-07-25|title=Enhancing Compassion: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Compassion Cultivation Training Program|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9373-z|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=1113–1126|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9373-z|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This identification with others through compassion can lead to increased motivation to do something in an effort to relieve the suffering of others.

Compassion is an evolved function from the harmony of a three grid internal system: contentment-and-peace system, goals-and-drives system and threat-and-safety system. Paul Gilbert defines these collectively as necessary regulated systems for compassion.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gilbert|title=The Compassionate Mind: A New Approach to Life's Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krNPL6xCVL0C|year=2010|publisher=New Harbinger  Publications|isbn=978-1-57224-840-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In examination of the motivated regulation of compassion in the context of large-scale crises, such as natural disasters and genocides, much research has established that people tend to feel more compassion for single identifiable victims than large masses of victims (the [[Identifiable victim effect]]). It is found that people only show less compassion for many victims than for single victims of disasters when they expect to incur a financial cost upon helping. This [[collapse of compassion]] depends on having the motivation and ability to regulate emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron &amp; Payne, 2011, JPSP&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory research, psychologists are exploring how concerns about becoming emotionally exhausted may motivate people to curb their compassion for—and dehumanize—members of stigmatized social groups, such as homeless individuals and drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Harris, &amp; Payne, in prep&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion consists of three major requirements: People must feel that troubles that evoke their feelings are serious, the understanding that sufferers' troubles are not self-inflicted, and ability to picture oneself with the same problems in a non-blaming and non-shaming manner.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt;

=== Neuropsychology ===
In a 2009 small [[fMRI]] experiment, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang and colleagues at the [[Brain and Creativity Institute]] studied strong feelings of compassion for social and physical pain in others. Both feelings involved an expected change in activity in the anterior [[insular cortex|insula]], [[anterior cingulate]], [[hypothalamus]], and [[midbrain]], but they also found a previously undescribed pattern of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] activity on the posterior [[medial (anatomy)|medial]] surface of each brain hemisphere, a region involved in the [[Default network|default mode of brain function]], and implicated in self-related processes. Compassion for social pain in others was associated with strong activation in the interoceptive, inferior/posterior portion of this region, while compassion for physical pain in others involved heightened activity in the exteroceptive, superior/anterior portion. Compassion for social pain activated this superior/anterior section, to a lesser extent. Activity in the anterior insula related to compassion for social pain peaked later and endured longer than that associated with compassion for physical pain.&lt;ref name=MHIY2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=Immordino-Yang MH, McColl A, Damasio H, Damasio A |title=Neural correlates of admiration and compassion |journal=Proc.

In one study conducted by Jill Rilling and Gregory Berns, neuroscientists at Emory University, subjects’ brain activity was recorded while they helped someone in need. It was found that while the subjects were performing compassionate acts the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate regions of the brain were activated, the same areas of the brain associated with pleasure and reward. This research sheds light on how acting on compassion induces a positive feeling in people and how humans are innately wired to want to help the suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Keltner, Dacher.

=== Medicine ===
Compassion is one of the most important attributes for physicians practicing medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Medical Ethics|year=1981|publisher=American Medical Association|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that felt compassion brings about the desire to do something to help the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; That desire to be helpful is not compassion, but it does suggest that compassion is similar to other emotions by motivating behaviors to reduce the tension brought on by the emotion.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Physicians generally identify their central duties as the responsibility to put the patient's interests first, including the duty not to harm, deliver proper care, and maintain confidentiality.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Compassion is seen in each of those duties because of its direct relation to the recognition and treatment of suffering.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Physicians who use compassion understand the effects of sickness and suffering on human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Eric|title=The Nature of Suffering|year=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion may be closely related to love and the emotions evoked in both. This is illustrated by the relationship between patients and physicians in medical institutions.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; The relationship between suffering patients and their care-givers provides evidence that compassion is a social emotion, which is highly related to closeness between individuals.

=== Self-compassion ===
{{Further|Self-compassion}}
Self-compassion is a process of self kindness and accepting suffering as a quality of being human. It has positive effects on subjective [[happiness]], [[optimism]], [[wisdom]], [[curiosity]], [[agreeableness]], and [[extroversion]].&lt;ref name="Emotional effects of compassion - NeV"&gt;{{cite journal|last=NeV|first=Kristen|author2=Stephanie Rude |author3=Kristin Kirpatrick |title=An examination of self-compassion in relation  to positive psychological functioning and personality traits|journal=Journal of Research in Psychology|year=2007|volume=41|issue=4|pages=908–916|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2006.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kristin Neff]] and Christopher Germer have identified that there are three levels of activities that thwart self-compassion and they are self-criticism, self-isolation and self-absorption, they equate this to fight, flight and freeze responses.&lt;ref&gt;http://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/germer.neff.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://chrisgermer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Transforming-Trauma.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified that people who lack of life skill equanimity that is akin with distress tolerance are prone to such spontaneous responses. Certain activities may increase feelings of and readiness to practice self-compassion; some of these activities include creating a loving-kindness rituals, practicing empathy, practice random acts of warmth and goodwill like [[tonglen]], etc.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Historical and spiritual-religious views ==
The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers typically distrusted (feeling) compassion. In the view of many, reason alone was the proper guide to conduct. To some, compassion was an effect, neither admirable nor contemptible. Compassion historically is considered as a passion; [[Justitia]] is blindfolded because her virtue is dispassion and not compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Szasz]]|title=Cruel Compassion: Psychiatric Control of Society's Unwanted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pduB22E43oC&amp;pg=PA4|year=1998|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-0510-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman society, in fact, compassion was often seen as a vice when it was inclined toward pity, as opposed to mercy. In other words, showing empathy toward someone who was seen as deserving was considered virtuous, whereas showing empathy to someone deemed unworthy was considered immoral (weak).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome | author=Dunkle, Roger | publisher=Routledge | year=2008 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdvbAAAAQBAJ | page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtue of compassion to all living beings, claim [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Gandhi, Hindu Dharma, {{ISBN|978-8122201086}}, Orient Paperbacks&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tripathi, A., &amp; Mullet, E.

''Daya'' is defined by [[Padma Purana]] as the virtuous desire to mitigate the sorrow and difficulties of others by putting forth whatever effort necessary.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Parmeshwaranand, Encyclopaedic Dictionary of The Dharmasastra, {{ISBN|978-8176253659}}, pp 369-370&lt;/ref&gt; Matsya Purana describes ''daya'' as the value that treats all living beings (including human beings) as one's own self, wanting the welfare and good of the other living being.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana, 52.8 and 143.31 through 332&lt;/ref&gt; Such compassion, claims [[Matsya Purana]], is one of necessary paths to being happy. Ekadashi Tattvam&lt;ref&gt;Ekadashi Tattvam, [[Raghunandana Bhattacharya]], Smriti, Calcutta/London (1816)&lt;/ref&gt; explains ''daya'' is treating a stranger, a relative, a friend and a foe as one's own self; it argues that compassion is that state when one sees all living beings as part of one's own self, and when everyone's suffering is seen as one's own suffering. Compassion to all living beings, including to those who are strangers and those who are foes, is seen as a noble virtue.&lt;ref name=abde&gt;Anandita Balslev and Dirk Evers (Editors), Compassion in the World's Religions: Envisioning Human Solidarity (Religionswissenschaft: Forschung und Wissenschaft), {{ISBN|978-3643104762}}, LIT Verlag (2009), see Chapter 4, Compassion: Etymology, Rituals, Anecdotes from the Hindu Tradition&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karuna'', another word for compassion in Hindu philosophy, means placing one's mind in other's favor, thereby seeking to understand the other from their perspective.

Compassion in Hinduism is discussed as an absolute and relative concept. There are two forms of compassion: one for those who suffer even though they have done nothing wrong and one for those who suffer because they did something wrong. Absolute compassion applies to both, while relative compassion addresses the difference between the former and the latter. An example of the latter include those who plead guilty or are convicted of a crime such as murder; in these cases, the virtue of compassion must be balanced with the virtue of justice.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muniapan | first1 = B | year = 2008 | title = Kautilya's Arthashastra and Perspectives on Organizational Management | url = | journal = Asian Social Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 30–34 | doi=10.5539/ass.v4n1p30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' written between 200 BC and AD 400, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], is a cherished classic on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It dedicates Chapter 25 of Book 1 to compassion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=December 16, 2014 }} verses 241-250&lt;/ref&gt; further dedicating separate chapters each for the resulting values of compassion, chiefly, [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] (Chapter 26), [[non-violence|doing no harm]] (Chapter 32), [[non-killing]] (Chapter 33), possession of [[kindness]] (Chapter 8), dreading evil deeds (Chapter 21), [[benignity]] (Chapter 58), the right [[scepter]] (Chapter 55), and absence of [[terrorism]] (Chapter 57), to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H.

===Jainism===
{{further|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
Compassion for all life, human and non-human, is central to the [[Jainism|Jain]] tradition. Though all life is considered sacred, human life is deemed the highest form of earthly existence. To kill any person, no matter their crime, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is the only substantial religious tradition that requires both monks and laity to be vegetarian. It is suggested that certain strains of the [[Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences.&lt;ref&gt;South India Handbook: The Travel Guide By Robert Bradnock, 2000 Footprint Travel Guides, p. 543, Vegetarianism: A History By Colin Spencer, 2002 Thunder's Mouth Press, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain tradition's stance on [[ahimsa|nonviolence]], however, goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice [[veganism]].  Jains run animal shelters all over India. The [[Lal Mandir]], a prominent Jain temple in Delhi, is known for the Jain Birds Hospital in a second building behind the main temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Powell Ettinger |url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/world/bird-hospital.html#cr |title=Jainism and the legendary Delhi bird hospital |publisher=Wildlifeextra.com |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ja7iTij7Bc0C&amp;pg=PT81&amp;dq=birds+hospital+in+delhi#v=onepage&amp;q=birds%20hospital%20in%20delhi&amp;f=false |title=Top 10 Delhi - Dorling Kindersley - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-09-28|isbn=9780756695637 |date=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
In the [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]], [[God]] is the Compassionate and is invoked as the Father of Compassion:&lt;ref&gt;Lampert K., ''Traditions of Compassion: From Religious Duty to Social Activism'', Palgrave-Macmillan, 2006; {{ISBN|978-1-4039-8527-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence ''Raḥmana'' or Compassionate becomes the usual designation for His revealed word. (Compare, below, the frequent use of ''raḥman'' in the [[Quran]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=699&amp;letter=C&amp;search=compassion |title=The Jewish Encyclopedia |publisher=The Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorrow and pity for one in distress, creating a desire to relieve it, is a feeling ascribed alike to man and God: in [[Biblical Hebrew]], ("riḥam," from "reḥem," the mother, womb), "to pity" or "to show mercy" in view of the sufferer's helplessness, hence also "to forgive" (Hab. iii. 2), "to forbear" (Ex. ii. 6; I Sam. xv. 3; Jer. xv. 15, xxi. 7). The [[Rabbi]]s speak of the "thirteen attributes of compassion." The [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] conception of compassion is the feeling of the parent for the child. Hence the prophet's appeal in confirmation of his trust in God invokes the feeling of a mother for her offspring (Isa. xlix. 15).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule (see above) came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the "while standing on one leg" meaning in the most concise terms, Hillel stated: "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is the explanation; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Post [[9/11]], the words of Rabbi Hillel are frequently quoted in public lectures and interviews around the world by the prominent writer on comparative religion [[Karen Armstrong]].

Many Jewish sources speak of the importance of compassion for animals. Significant rabbis who have done so include Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishveg.com/schwartz/rabbinic.htm |title=Judaism and Vegetarianism: RABBINIC TEACHINGS ON VEGETARIANISM |publisher=Jewishveg.com |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Simhah Zissel Ziv,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/413321/Jewish_Virtue_Ethics_and_Compassion_for_Animals_A_Model_from_the_Musar_Movement|title=Jewish Virtue Ethics and Compassion for Animals: A Model from the Musar Movement|last=Claussen|first=Geoffrey|date=2011|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-09-28|journal=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi Moshe Cordovero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishveg.com/DScordovero.html |title=Rav Moshe Cordoero on Compassion for Animals |publisher=JewishVeg |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Karuṇā}}
[[File:Liao Dynasty Avalokitesvara Statue Clear.jpeg|thumb|[[Avalokiteśvara]] looking out over the sea of suffering. [[China]], [[Liao Dynasty]].]]
The first of what in English are called the [[Four Noble Truths]] is the truth of [[suffering]] or [[dukkha]] (unsatisfactoriness or stress). [[Dukkha]] is identified as one of the [[Three marks of existence|three distinguishing characteristics]] of all conditioned existence. It arises as a consequence of the failure to adapt to change  or [[anicca]] (the second characteristic) and the insubstantiality, lack of fixed identity, the horrendous lack of certainty of [[anatta]] (the third characteristic) to which all this constant change in turn gives rise. Compassion made possible by observation and accurate perception is the appropriate practical response. The ultimate and earnest wish, manifest in the Buddha, both as archetype and as historical entity, is to relieve the suffering of all living beings everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;HarperCollins  Dictionary of Religion, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]] has said, "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter - Dalai Lama|url=https://twitter.com/dalailama/status/576314276228390912|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Buddhist monk|monk]] [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states that compassion "supplies the complement to [[metta|loving-kindness]]: whereas loving-kindness has the characteristic of wishing for the [[happiness]] and welfare of others, compassion has the characteristic of wishing that others be free from suffering, a wish to be extended without limits to all living beings. Like [[metta]], compassion arises by entering into the [[subjectivity]] of others, by sharing their interiority in a deep and total way. It springs up by considering that all beings, like ourselves, wish to be free from suffering, yet despite their wishes continue to be harassed by [[Pain and nociception|pain]], [[fear]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], and other forms of dukkha."&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''The Noble Eightfold Path: Way to the End of Suffering''. Buddhist Publication Society, 1994, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:G. Conti La parabola del Buon Samaritano Messina Chiesa della Medaglia Miracolosa Casa di Ospitalità Collereale.jpg|thumb|Compassion in action: an 18th-century Italian depiction of the Parable of the [[Good Samaritan]]]]

The Christian [[Bible]]'s [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]] is but one place where God is spoken of as the "Father of compassion" and the "God of all comfort." It reads as follows: 2 Corinthians 1:3-7 "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves received from God. For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort." [[Jesus]] embodies for [[Christian]]s, the very essence of compassion and relational care. Christ challenges Christians to forsake their own desires and to act compassionately towards others, particularly those in need or distress.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert Khen (2006), Ch. 1 ''incomplete reference''&lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, he demonstrated compassion to those his society had condemned - tax collectors, prostitutes and criminals.

Conversely, a 2012 study of the [[historical Jesus]] has claimed that the founder of Christianity sought to elevate Judaic compassion as the supreme human virtue, capable of reducing suffering and fulfilling our God-ordained purpose of transforming the world into something more worthy of its creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|year=2012|publisher=Denis Jones and associates|location=Sydney|isbn=9780646530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
[[File:Nomad prayer.jpg|thumb|A 1930s photograph of a [[desert]] traveler seeking the assistance of [[Allah]] the Merciful, the Compassionate]]

In the Muslim tradition, foremost among [[Allah|God's]] [[99 Names of Allah#List of Names|attributes]] are mercy and compassion or, in the canonical language of Arabic, ''Rahman'' and ''Rahim''. Each of the 114 chapters of the [[Quran]], with one exception, begins with the verse, "In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/tawheed/conceptofgod.html |title=University of Southern California |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Certainly a Messenger has come to you from among yourselves; grievous to him is your falling into distress, excessively solicitous respecting you; to the believers (he is) compassionate.|[[Qur'an]]|{{quran-usc|9|128}}||}}

The Arabic word for compassion is ''rahmah''. As a cultural influence, its roots abound in the Quran. A good Muslim is to commence each day, each prayer and each significant action by invoking Allah the Merciful and Compassionate, i.e., by reciting ''Bism-i-llah a-Rahman-i-Rahim''. The [http://vimeo.com/11262742 womb and family ties] are characterized by compassion and named after the exalted attribute of Allah "Al-Rahim" (The Compassionate).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">==What is a conservation community?==
A conservation community is a group of individuals and families living in a community who are committed to saving large parcels of land from ecological degradation. This land can be [[forest]]ed land, [[agriculture|agricultural]] land, [[ranch]] land, or any other type of land that needs protecting from high-impact development.

Conservation communities are models of sustainable community development, a new approach to development which provides alternatives to conventional forms of development.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Fraser University, Centre for Sustainable Community Development, https://www.sfu.ca/cscd/&lt;/ref&gt; They are adaptable to the needs of different regions and they use small-scale residential development to fund [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], eliminating the need to depend on funding from private [[Donation|donor]]s or [[government]]s. This land development model is important to the environmental movements towards [[sustainable development]], Green homebuilding, local [[food security]], and responsible management of [[natural resource]]s.

Some of the tools used to create conservation communities are conservation covenants, [[ecoforestry]] covenants, and other forms of covenant registered to the title of the land. Covenants are a legal contract used to protect the integrity of land. Covenants help protect the ecological health of [[drainage basin|watersheds]] (which are damaged by increased development),&lt;ref&gt;Purdue University, College of Engineering, "Watershed Protection", https://engineering.purdue.edu/SafeWater/watershed/&lt;/ref&gt; maintain long-term access to natural resources and associated [[value added|value-added]] opportunities, protect [[native plant]] and animal species, and prevent [[climate change]] impacts of intense development practices. Conservation communities are developed under a standard of performance that not only minimizes their [[ecological footprint]] on the Earth but also ensures that the development improves (or at the very least does not diminish) the existing ecological system’s performance.

The planning basis for the residential community focuses around maintaining and enhancing the ecological integrity of the land. The community, therefore, sits on the least sensitive part of the land from an ecological point of view, and is often built using low-impact infrastructure such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-targeted housing.

==The economy==
Conservation communities can also offer the opportunity for other eco-compatible uses such as sustainable resource extraction, value-added manufacturing opportunities, [[organic horticulture]], [[mixed-use development|live/work enterprises]], [[ecotourism]], recreational and ecological educational opportunities.

Conservation communities can create sustainable employment opportunities for those living in the communities as well as the surrounding region. Ecotourism promotes environmental protection and support for the well-being of local community members by bringing visitors into the conservation community for educational and recreational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, A. (1987). Resource economics, Second Edition. New York, USA: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==
Conservation communities can be designed to strengthen the connections between neighbors and communities. Kim Davis, of the Vancouver Sun newspaper notes that "while hardship, economic or otherwise, is not something most people desire, let alone seek, adversity does have a way of inspiring collaboration, creativity and innovation."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Kim, "Hard Times Can Increase Innovation and Collaboration",(December 13, 2008), ''Vancouver Sun'', Westcoast Homes.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical-Creative Thinking and Behavioral Research Laboratory''' (ELYADAL) was founded in March 2002 as a branch in the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences in [[Baskent University]], [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]]. Academicians and students in different disciplines like [[psychology]], [[social science]], [[philosophy of science]], [[scientific method]], [[political science]], [[business management]] and [[economics]] have convened to conduct [[scientific research]] and produce applications of science pertaining to [[human behavior]] as it is manifested in varying contexts. ELYADAL's perspective regarding scientific inquiry can be summarized as "disseminating the scientific knowledge accumulated by following curiosity through asking questions and answering them by means of scientific research."

ELYADAL has two branches to organize interests in two broad topics. The first branch is related to make research on, develop programs to train on, and to provide information about [[critical thinking]] and [[creative thinking]] for students, faculty members, and organizations. The second branch is organized around [[behavior]], its antecedents and consequences, and research conducted in an interdisciplinary fashion is welcomed.

==Brief history==
The process of establishment have started in March 2002. A core group of academicians have called for colleagues and students to participate in the new-founding laboratory. Following a number of meetings with the initial respondents, ELYADAL Research Group has started its activities on April 13, 2002. In order to test and form the interaction dynamics of the group, three subgroups have been established to work independently on three topics of interest. These topics were chosen so that no group member had previous in-depth knowledge or formal education about them, enabling equidistant amateurship in the beginning. The topics were the number '''[[Pi]]''' in mathematics, the microscopic organism '''[[Volvox]]''' colony in biology, and the '''[[black hole]]''' in physics. The studies of the groups were disseminated by a then-established popular scientific magazine named PiVOLKA (an anagram name including syllables from the three topics). Mini-group studies on natural scientific issues then become a one-step hurdle for the selection of prospective adjoiners and PiVOLKA became a source of dissemination and open forum to students and academicians in other universities as well.

The ongoing studies by members of ELYADAL include critical thinking, political and economical psychology research and publications, convention papers, the PiVOLKA peer-reviewed quarterly scholarly publication, a booklet about research methods-academic writing, a booklet about statistics, seminars and panels on various topics.

ELYADAL has 28 papers that are published in various journals, 33 papers that are presented in various seminars and conferences, 16 talks that are broadcast in media about [[psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[critical thinking]], [[creative thinking]], [[science]] against [[pseudoscience]], etc.

In sports, a '''depth chart''' is used to show the placements of the starting players and the secondary players. Generally a starting player will be listed first or on top while a back-up will be listed below. Depth charts also tend to resemble the actual position locations of certain players.&lt;ref name="LongCzarnecki2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Howie Long|author2=John Czarnecki|title=Football For Dummies, USA Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an8ZIHOMda0C&amp;pg=PA244|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=12 May 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01265-9|pages=244–|quote=A depth chart lists the starting lineups for both teams by their positions on offense and defense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical [[Major League Baseball]] depth chart consists of  a list of players at each position, with the starter or first-string player listed first, followed by replacement and [[Platoon system|platoon players]].  For [[fantasy baseball]], typical preseason projection systems such as [[PECOTA]] construct depth charts that specify not just the order of the players at each position (starter, replacement or [[List of baseball jargon (B)#bench|bench player]]) but also the amount of playing time each person at that position will have. For example, at first base one player may be projected as playing 60 percent of the innings, and another 40 percent for the coming season, while at catcher one player may be projected as playing 80 percent of the innings, and another 20 percent.  For pitchers, the depth charts project the number of innings each roster player will pitch.

The [[line (ice hockey)|line system]] in [[ice hockey]] follows the same structure as a depth chart.

==Outside of sports==
The term depth chart is now also being used from the perspective of management theory, to address the process of key positioning leaders within the organization, considering a dynamic [[Product lifecycle (engineering)|life cycle]] perspective which includes developmental tasks such as those cited in books and articles related to the leadership pipeline subject.  A depth chart analysis for key positioning leaders should affect the development of leadership training programs and high performance development initiatives in modern corporations and enterprises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7223">[[File:DoNotDisturbSign.jpg|right|thumb|Common ''Do not disturb sign'' of a hotel]]
[[File:Do not disturb.svg|right|thumb|150px|''Do not disturb'' door sign]]
A '''door hanger''' (also spelled '''''doorhanger''''' or '''''door-hanger''''') is a [[plastic]] or [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] sign, generally rectangular in shape, cut to hang from the handle or knob of a [[door]].   They are sometimes used to distribute print [[advertising]] to residences.  Door hangers are often seen in [[hotel]]s and other places of lodging as a means for guests to communicate with maintenance and housekeeping staff.

== Other meanings ==

In computer [[user interface]] design, a "doorhanger" notification is a sort of pop-up panel that "hangs" from another user interface element, typically an icon in the tool bar.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://bsdpower.com/modern-design-abominations-firefox-doorhanger-notifications/ here] for an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

One common place where do not disturb signs are used is in [[hotel|places of lodging]], where guests can place these signs on the door in order to inform staff, including [[Maid service|housekeeping]], to respect their [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/29/TRVA11DNES.DTL |title=As hotels squeeze cleaning staff, guests get caught in the middle. How to make sure your housekeeping needs get met |first=Christopher |last=Elliott |date=June 29, 2008 |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hotels also provide "make up room" signs giving the opposite instructions.

They are also used in schools to let other staff members and students at the school know that testing is in progress in the particular classroom.

Do not disturb signs can also be used by those who keep valuables in their rooms in order to deter possible thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoVKSXBTzwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22do+not+disturb+sign%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html |title=Importers manual USA. |volume=4 |author1=Edward G.

In multiple cases, a ''do not disturb'' sign on the door of a hotel room has been blamed for concealing a [[homicide]], suspicious death, or other [[criminal activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-06-26-3285533780_x.htm |title=Warrant: Body of pregnant soldier found in tub |first=Kevin |last=Maurer |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/104279/Hotel-do-not-disturb-sign-hid-murder |title=Hotel 'Do not Disturb' sign hid murder |publisher=Express.co.uk |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/18730289.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910134044/http://www.startribune.com/local/18730289.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 September 2012 |title=Hotel 'do not disturb' sign hid murder |date=30 May 2009 |first=Chris |last=Riches |publisher=[[Star Tribune]] |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a ''do not disturb'' sign was blamed for concealing the disappearance of an elderly couple on a cruise ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/17/national/main4730518.shtml |title=Elderly Couple Disappears On Cruise Ship |date=January 17, 2009 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, mass murderer [[Stephen Paddock]] kept a "do not disturb" sign on his hotel room door, concealing ten suitcases with a stockpile of rifles and ammunition he used to commit the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]].

Some hotels are using high-tech means to replace paper do not disturb signs that hang on the door. One example is a privacy button that one can press from within the room to light up an indicator outside the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/09/1210131215154.html |title=From hotel rooms to hi-tech havens |date=May 9, 23008 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising ==
More recently, hotels have used the do not disturb signs as a way to brand themselves and provide inexpensive advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_travel_story_skin/476263?format=html |title=Catching ZZZZZZZZs a sign of the times |date=26 February 2005 |publisher=tvnz.co.nz |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projo.com/travel/content/projo_20050227_shush27x.1de18b8.html |title=Genius works behind 'do not disturb' sign |date=27 February 2005 |first=Amanda |last=Kingsbury |publisher=projo.com |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Embassy Suites]] ran a contest allowing the public to design do not disturb signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap_travel/20070917/ap_tr_ge/travel_brief_do_not_disturb |title= Make your own 'Do Not Disturb' sign|publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was announced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2008/2/18/102222/497/hotels/The_Disturbing_Results_of_Embassy_Suites_Do_Not_Disturb_Sign_Contest |title=The disturbin results of Embassy Suites 'Do Not Disturb' sign |publisher=hotelchatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Door Hangers are also used in competition with direct mail as an advertising vehicle. Most recently, companies providing this type of advertising have been using the term Direct to Door Advertising. This type of advertising offers a number of advantages over traditional direct mail in that the impression is "guaranteed". The home owner must handle the piece and typically on a door hanger there is just one advertising message giving the advertiser great exposure.&lt;ref&gt;http://marketing.allovermedia.com/door-hanger-infographic&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of advertising is used by national brands and local companies to help drive traffic into their stores, increase trial by offering a sample, and to increase their brand awareness. This method of delivery can often be more cost effective and with today's technology, the delivery of the pieces is completely trackable by integrating GPS and photos into the Proof of Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aapsinc.org/members-only-section/doorhangers-are-simply-better/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220458/http://aapsinc.org/members-only-section/doorhangers-are-simply-better/ |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NSB-doubleelim-draw-2004.png|200px|right|thumb|A double-elimination [[bracket (tournament)|bracket]] from the 2004 National [[Science Bowl]]]]
A '''double-elimination tournament''' is a type of [[elimination tournament]] [[competition]] in which a participant ceases to be eligible to win the [[tournament]]'s championship upon having lost ''two'' games or matches. It stands in contrast to a [[single-elimination tournament]], in which only ''one'' defeat results in elimination.

One method of arranging a double-elimination tournament is to break the competitors into two sets of [[bracket (tournament)|brackets]], the ''winners bracket'' and ''losers bracket'' (''W'' and ''L'' brackets for short; also sometimes ''upper bracket'' and ''lower bracket'', respectively) after the first round. The first-round winners proceed into the W bracket and the losers proceed into the L bracket. The W bracket is conducted in the same manner as a single-elimination tournament, except that the losers of each round "drop down" into the L bracket. Another method of double-elimination tournament management is the ''Draw and Process''.

As with single-elimination tournaments, most often the number of competitors is equal to a [[power of two]] (8, 16, 32, etc.) so that in each round there is an even number of competitors and never any [[Bye (sports)|byes]]. The maximum number of games in a double-elimination tournament is one less than twice the number of teams participating (e.g., 8 teams – 15 games). The minimum number is two less than twice the number of teams (e.g., 8 teams – 14 games).

==Conducting the tournament==
If the standard double-elimination bracket arrangement is being used, then each round of the L Bracket is conducted in two stages; a minor stage followed by a major stage. Both contain the same number of matches (assuming there are no byes) which is the same again as the number of matches in the corresponding round of the W Bracket. If the minor stage of an L Bracket round contains ''N'' matches, it will produce ''N'' winners. Meanwhile, the ''N'' matches in the corresponding round of the W Bracket will produce ''N'' losers. These 2''N'' competitors will then pair off in the ''N'' matches of the corresponding major stage of the L Bracket.

For example, in an eight-competitor double-elimination tournament, the four losers of the first round, W Bracket quarter finals, pair off in the first stage of the L Bracket, the L Bracket minor semifinals. The two losers are eliminated, while the two winners proceed to the L Bracket major semifinals. Here, those two players/teams will each compete against a loser of the W Bracket semifinal in the L Bracket major semifinals. The winners of the L Bracket major semifinals compete against each other in the L Bracket minor-final, with the winner playing the loser of the W Bracket final in the L Bracket major final.

The championship finals of a double elimination tournament is usually set up to be a possible two games. The rationale is that since the tournament is indeed double elimination, it is unfair to have the W Bracket champion eliminated with its first loss. Therefore, while the W Bracket champion needs to beat the L Bracket champion only once to win the tournament, the L Bracket champion must beat the Winners' Bracket champion twice.

A Draw and Process tournament requires less intervention by the manager. The competitors are allocated their first round positions on the competition grid and this is played as if it were a single elimination event. This grid is called the "Draw". A second competition grid called the "Process" is then produced and again played as a single elimination event. The fixed arrangement of the Process ensures that players who met in the first round of the Draw cannot meet until the final of the Process. Similarly, players who meet in the second round of the Draw cannot meet until the semi finals of the Process. If the same person wins both the Draw and Process then they are the overall winner and the losing finalists will play each other for second and third place. Otherwise the winners of the Draw and Process will play off to determine the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = United States Croquet Association. Draw and Process Format. | url=http://www.croquetamerica.com/croquet/tournaments/DrawAndProcess.php | accessdate = 18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pros and cons==
The double-elimination format has some advantages over the single-elimination format, most notably the fact that third and fourth places can be determined without the use of a consolation or "classification" match involving two contestants who have already been eliminated from winning the championship.

Some tournaments, such as in tennis, will use "[[Seed (sports)|seeding]]" to prevent the strongest contestants from meeting until the later round. However, in tournaments where contestants are placed randomly in the draw, or in situations where seeding is not available, it is possible for 2 of the strongest teams to meet in the early rounds rather than a final or semifinal as would be expected in a seeded draw. Double elimination overcomes this shortfall by allowing a strong team which loses early to work their way through the L Bracket and progress to the later rounds, despite meeting the strongest team in the early rounds of competition.

Another advantage of the double-elimination format is the fact that all competitors will play at least twice and three quarters will play three games or more. In a single-elimination tournament with no [[bye (sports)|byes]], half of the competitors will be eliminated after their first game. This can be disappointing to those who had to travel to the tournament and were only able to play once.

A disadvantage compared to the single-elimination format is that at least twice the number of matches have to be conducted. Since each player has to lose twice and since the tournament ends when only one player remains, in a tournament for ''n'' competitors there will be either 2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 or 2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 games depending on whether or not the winner was undefeated during the tournament. This may result in a scheduling hardship for venues where only one facility for play is available.

It is possible for the Championship finals to be determined by just a single match if the W Bracket winner defeats the L Bracket winner. It is therefore unknown, until this match has been concluded, whether the final scheduled match will in fact be required. This can be seen as a disadvantage of the system, particularly if broadcasting and ticket sales companies have an interest in the tournament.

==Examples of use==
One such athletic event that employs a double-elimination format is the NCAA baseball tournament, including the [[College World Series]], where a team is not eliminated until it loses twice in each of the four rounds (regional, super regional, College World Series, and CWS championship, with the super regional and CWS championship series featuring two teams in a best-of-3 format). The NCAA softball tournament (including the [[Women's College World Series]]) uses the same format. The [[Little League World Series]] switched from [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] to double-elimination formats for each of its pools starting in [[2010 Little League World Series|2010]] in an effort to eliminate meaningless games.

It is also used in [[Electronic sports|video game tournaments]] and [[table football]] tournaments. Double-elimination brackets are also popular in [[amateur wrestling]] of all levels, [[pool (cue sports)|pool]], [[surfing]], [[windsurfing]] and [[Kitesurfing|kiteboarding]] freestyle competitions, as well as [[Curling]] [[bonspiel]]s (where triple-elimination is also used), [[Hardcourt Bike Polo]]. The [[World Baseball Classic]] used a double-elimination format for its second rounds of the tournament in [[2009 World Baseball Classic|2009]] and [[2013 World Baseball Classic|2013]], as well as in its first round in 2009. In [[contract bridge]], the [[English Bridge Union]] Spring Foursomes, first contested in 1962, uses a double elimination format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebu.co.uk/node/477 |title=Schapiro Spring Foursomes - history  |website=[[English Bridge Union]] |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebu.co.uk/competitions/schapiro-spring-fours |title=Schapiro Spring Foursomes |website=[[English Bridge Union]] |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used, in modified form, in the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Senior Gaelic Football Championship]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]].

[[World Championship Wrestling]] was the only professional wrestling promotion to date to use the double-elimination format. They used the format for a tournament for the vacant [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] in 1999.

==Variations==
In [[judo]], players that end up in the L bracket can finish in third place at best. The winner of the W bracket will win the tournament, with the losing finalist finishing second. The other losers of the W bracket will end up in the L bracket, which will only be played to the minor stage of the final, resulting in two 3rd placed players. Thus, compared to double elimination, there is no major stage of the L Bracket final played, and there is no game between the winners of the W and L Brackets.

Another aspect of the system used in judo is that losers of the first round (of the W bracket) only advance to the L bracket if the player they lost to wins his or her second round match. If a player loses to a second round loser, they are eliminated from the tournament.

Another variant, called the ''(third-place) challenge'', is used, particularly in scholastic wrestling. The winner of the L bracket may challenge the loser of the finals in the W bracket, if and only if the two contestants had not faced each other previously; if the challenger (the winner of the L bracket) wins, he is awarded second place, and the loser of the W final is dropped to third place. This system is used particularly where the top '''two''' places advance to a higher level of competition (example: advancement from a regional tournament to a state tournament).

Another is the ''balanced'' variant which is a bracket arrangement that is ''not'' strictly divided into two brackets based on number of losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tournamentdesign.org TournamentDesign.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Players with different numbers of losses can play each other in any round. A goal of the variant is that no player sits idle for more than one round consecutively. The added complexity of the brackets is handled by using "if necessary" matches. The flexible approach allows practical bracket designs to be made for any number of competitors including odd numbers (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, etc.).

A possible alternative is a single-elimination format where each match is a best-of-5 or best-of-7 series. This format still allows a competitor to lose (perhaps multiple times) while still remaining eligible to win the tournament. Of course, having multiple games in each series ''also'' requires considerably more games to be conducted.

Another is the modified single elimination tournament which guarantees at least two games per competitor, but not necessarily two losses for elimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poolplayers.com/apa-rulebook-team-manual-scoresheets-and-other-materials/ APA Game Rules (Rulebook), Team Manual and other materials]&lt;/ref&gt; The brackets are similar to the double elimination format, except the two finalists from the L bracket (each with one loss) face the two finalists from the W bracket (neither with a loss) in a single elimination semi-final and final.

The [[College World Series]] (a [[baseball]] tournament) has frequently tried to modify the double-elimination format to set up, if possible, a single championship game. Until 1988, the College World Series did this by adding an extra round to the L Bracket. What would be the L Bracket major semifinals (i.e. the round where the W Bracket semifinal losers dropped down) became the L Bracket quarterfinals. The winners would then progress to the L Bracket semifinals against the two participants in the W Bracket final (i.e. the WINNERS of the W Bracket semifinals drop down). This thus left open the possibility that the W Bracket champion would pick up a loss, albeit in the L Bracket semifinal. If, however, the W Bracket champion prevailed in the L Bracket semifinal, the same two-game final setup existed in effect, albeit not in practice ... for under the CWS pre-1988 version, the unbeaten W Bracket champion would be playing a once-beaten L Bracket opponent in the L Bracket final, with the winner to advance to play the unbeaten W Bracket champion in the finals (if necessary). The CWS subsequently broke up its eight-team field into two four-team double elimination tournaments, with the winners meeting in either a sudden-death or, currently, a best-of-three final.

A way to reduce the number of rounds is to do cross-bracket elimination in the last rounds. For instance, in a double-elimination tournament of eight teams, you could have both the winner and the loser of the W Bracket final join the third round of the L Bracket, the winner facing the lowest-seeded L Bracket team or crossing inversely how W Bracket semifinal losers are placed in L Bracket. If the W Bracket team wins, there will be two teams left and they will go straight to the finals (with the W Bracket team having a one-game advantage as usual). However, if the W Bracket team loses then three teams will still be in the tournament, all with one loss. Usually in the subsequent fifth round either the last W Bracket team that just lost has a [[bye (sports)|bye]] round or the top seed remaining will have a bye, while the other two teams square off. This leaves two teams for a one-game final in the sixth and last round. Whether the W Bracket team wins or loses in round four, this cross-bracket procedure shortens an eight team double elimination tournament from 6–7 rounds to 5–6 rounds. This system also gives more odds to a single game final (75% of situations, instead the ordinary 50%)

The [[Little League World Series]] began using a modified double elimination bracket in 2011.  Eight U.S. teams and eight international teams compete in respective double elimination formats until their respective championship games, which are single elimination.  That is, irrespective of whether a team has one loss, or no losses, that team would be eliminated with a loss in either the U.S. or international championship game.  The two respective champions then play a single elimination game for the World Series championship.

==Other tournament systems==
Variations of the double-elimination tournament include:
* [[Elimination tournament]]
* [[Single-elimination tournament]]
Other common tournament types are
* [[Round-robin tournament]]
* [[Swiss system tournament]]
* [[Playoffs]] – a variation of the single-elimination tournament where instead of one win, a team needs to win a specific number of games in a series in order to advance.

The Hindus of the [[Kashmir Valley]], a large majority of whom were [[Kashmiri Pandits]], were forced to flee the Kashmir valley as a result of being targeted by [[JKLF]] and Islamic insurgents during late 1989 and early 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/25/world/kashmir-massacre-may-signal-the-coming-of-widespread-violence.html|title=Kashmir Massacre May Signal the Coming of Widespread Violence|last=Waldman|first=Amy|date=2003-03-25|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-10|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211082255/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/25/world/kashmir-massacre-may-signal-the-coming-of-widespread-violence.html|archive-date=11 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/24/world/24-hindus-are-shot-dead-in-kashmiri-village.html|title=24 Hindus Are Shot Dead in Kashmiri Village|last=Reuters|date=2003-03-24|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-10|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081401/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/24/world/24-hindus-are-shot-dead-in-kashmiri-village.html|archive-date=11 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the approximately 300,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Singh |first=Devinder |date=2014-11-21 |title=Reinventing Agency, Sacred Geography and Community Formation: The Case of Displaced Kashmiri Pandits in India |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9376-6_20 |language=en |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |pages=397–414 |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-9376-6_20 |isbn=9789401793759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1995 |title=PROTECTION ASPECTS OF UNHCR ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rsq/14.1-2.176 |journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly |volume=14 |issue=1-2 |pages=176–191 |doi=10.1093/rsq/14.1-2.176 |issn=1020-4067}}:The mass exodus began on 1st March 1990, when about 250,000 of the 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits fled the State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yong |first=Amos |date=2011 |title=Constructing China's Jerusalem: Christians, Power, and Place in Contemporary Wenzhou - By Nanlai Cao |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0922.2011.01544_1.x |journal=Religious Studies Review |language=en |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=236–236 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-0922.2011.01544_1.x |issn=0319-485X}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 600,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Casimir |first=Michael J. |last2=Lancaster |first2=William |last3=Rao |first3=Aparna |date=1997-06-01 |title=Editorial |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3167/082279497782384668 |journal=Nomadic Peoples |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=3–4 |doi=10.3167/082279497782384668 |issn=0822-7942}}:From 1947 on, Kashmir's roughly 700,000 Hindus felt increasingly uneasy and discriminated

== Background ==

Under the [[1975 Indira–Sheikh accord|1975 accord]], [[Sheikh Abdullah]] agreed to measures previously undertaken by the central government in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to integrate the state into India.{{sfn|Hussain, Kashmiri Visions of Freedom|2015|pp=102, 103}} Sociologist Farrukh Faheem states that it was met with of hostility among people of Kashmir and laid the groundwork for the future insurgency.{{sfn|Faheem, Interrogating the Ordinary|2018|pp=233, 234}} Those opposed to it included [[Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir]] and People's League in Indian Jammu and Kashmir, and [[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF) based in [[Azad Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chowdhary|first1=Rekha |title=Jammu and Kashmir: Politics of identity and separatism |year=2015 |publisher= Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-2oCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 |isbn=1317414055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1970s, communalist rhetoric was being exploited in the state for [[votebank]] politics. This fit together with the plan of Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) which was trying to Islamise Kashmir and replace its prevalent [[Sufism|Sufi culture]] with [[Wahhabism]] in order to create an atmosphere of religious unity with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mahadevan|first1=Prem |title= The Politics of Counterterrorism in India: Strategic Intelligence and National Security in South Asia |year = 2011 | publisher= I.T.

Critics of the then Chief Minister, Farooq Abdullah, charged that Abdullah was losing control. His visit to Pakistan administered Kashmir during then became an embarrassment, where according to [[Hashim Qureshi]], he shared a platform with JKLF . Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of [[Indira Gandhi]] and his father, so that sentiments there could "be known first hand", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed [[Khalistan movement|Khalistan]] terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On July 2, 1984, [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah|G. M. Shah]], who had support from Indira Gandhi, replaced his brother-in-law Farooq Abdullah and became the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, after Abdullah was dismissed, in what was termed as a political "coup".{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947–2004|2007|p=157}} 

G. M. Shah's administration, which did not have people's mandate, turned to Islamists and opponents of India, notably the [[Molvi Iftikhar Hussain Ansari]], [[Mohammad Shafi Qureshi]] and Mohinuddin Salati, to gain some legitimacy through religious sentiments. This gave political space to Islamists who previously lost overwhelmingly in the 1983 state elections.{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947–2004|2007|p=157}} In 1986, Shah decided to construct a mosque within the premises of an ancient Hindu temple inside the New Civil Secretariat area in Jammu to be made available to the Muslim employees for 'Namaz'. People of Jammu took to streets to protest against this decision, which led to a Hindu-Muslim clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verma|first1=P.

Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Pandits were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged.&lt;ref name="Tikoo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colonel Tej K Tikoo|title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&amp;pg=PT397|publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC|isbn=978-1-935501-58-9|pages=397–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation of Anantnag riots revealed that members of the 'secular parties' in the state, rather than the Islamists, had played a key role in organising the violence to gain political mileage through religious sentiments. Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on March 12, 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly. The political fight was hence being portrayed as a conflict between "Hindu" New Delhi (Central Government), and its efforts to impose its will in the state, and "Muslim" Kashmir, represented by political Islamists and clerics.{{sfn|Praveen Swami; India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad: The Covert War in Kashmir, 1947– 19472004|2007|p=158}}

The Islamists had organised under a banner named [[Muslim United Front]], with manifesto to work for Islamic unity and against political interference from the centre, and contested the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 1987|1987 state elections]], in which they lost again. However, the 1987 elections were widely believed to be rigged so as to bring the secular parties ([[Jammu and Kashmir National Conference|NC]] and [[Indian National Congress|INC]]) in Kashmir at the forefront, and this caused the [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|insurgency in Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkTetMfI6QkC&amp;pg=PA137 |title=Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War|last=Schofield|first=Victoria|date=2000|publisher=I.B.

The Islamist groups proclaimed the Islamicisation of socio-political and economic set-up, merger with Pakistan, unification of ''[[ummah]]'' and establishment of an ''Islamic [[Caliphate]]''. Liquidation of central government officials, Pandits, liberal and nationalist intellectuals, social and cultural activists was described as necessary to rid the valley of un-Islamic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Religion and Security in South and Central Asia|publisher=Routledge|author=K.

The JKLF had also utilized Islamic formulations in its mobilization strategies and public discourse, using Islam and independence interchangeably. It demanded equal rights for everyone however this had a distinct Islamic flavor as it sought to establish an [[Islamic democracy]], protection of minority rights per [[Quran]] and [[Sunnah]] and an economy of [[Islamic socialism]]. The pro-separatist political practices at times deviated from their stated secular position.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book| title=Imagining Kashmir: Emplotment and Colonialism|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|author=Patrick Colm Hogan|year=2016|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Behera&gt;{{cite book| title=Demystifying Kashmir|publisher=Brookings Institution|author=Navnita Chadha Behera|year=2006|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This instilled fear in the Kashmiri Pandit community especially as Taploo's killers were never caught which also emboldened the terrorists.

The killings of Kashmiri Hindus continued that included many of the prominent ones.&lt;ref name="Tikoo p.414"/&gt; On January 4, 1990, a local Urdu newspaper, ''Aftab'', published a press release issued by [[Hizbul Mujahideen|Hizb-ul-Mujahideen]], asking all Pandits to leave the Valley immediately.

In order to undermine his political rival [[Farooq Abdullah]] who at that time was the Chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, the [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister of Home Affairs]] [[Mufti Mohammad Sayeed]] convinced [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[V.P. Singh]] to appoint Jagmohan as the governor of the state. Abdullah resented Jagmohan who had been appointed as the governor earlier in April 1984 as well and had recommended Abdullah's dismissal to [[Rajiv Gandhi]] in July 1984. Mufti was convinced that such a move will irritate Abdullah and make him quit. Abdullah had earlier declared that he would resign if Jagmohan was made the Governor. However, the Central government went ahead and appointed him as Governor on 19 January 1990. In response, Abdullah resigned on the same day and Jagmohan suggested the dissolution of the State Assembly. On 21 January 1990, two days after Jagmohan took over as governor, the [[Gawkadal massacre]] took place in Srinagar, in which the Indian security forces had opened fire on protesters, leading to the death of at least 50 people, and likely over 100. These events led to chaos. Lawlessness took over the valley and the crowd with slogans and guns started roaming around the streets. News kept coming of violent incidents and those Hindus who survived the night saved their lives by traveling out of the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ananth|first=V.

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Pandit families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Pandits faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Pandits to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

The local organisation of Pandits in [[Kashmir]], Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti (KPSS) after carrying out a survey in 2008 and 2009, said that 399 [[Kashmiri Pandits]] were killed by insurgents from 1990 to 2011 with 75% of them being killed during the first year of the Kashmiri insurgency, and that during the last 20 years, about 650 Pandits have been killed in the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/201176134818984961.html |title=Kashmiri Pandits: Why we never fled Kashmir – Kashmir: The forgotten conflict |publisher=Al Jazeera English |author=Azad Essa |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/mobi/news/news/399-pandits-killed-since-1990-kpss/97140.html |title=399 Pandits killed since 1990 KPSS |date=20 June 2011 |publisher=Greater Kashmir |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, estimates 357 pandits were killed in Kashmir in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://globalpressjournal.com/asia/indian-administered_kashmir/25-years-after-islamists-drove-out-hindus-kashmiris-debate-repatriation-incentives/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
Whilst some Pandit organisations such as [[Panun Kashmir]] etc. have accused Kashmiri Muslims of genocide and mass-rape, during the times of exodus,&lt;ref name="Chatterji et al."&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wB2DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT305 |title=Conflicted Democracies and Gendered Violence: Internal Conflict and Social Upheaval in India |last=Chatterji |first=Angana P. |last2=Buluswar |first2=Shashi |last3=Kaur |first3=Mallika |date=2016-11-04 |publisher=Zubaan |isbn=9789385932113}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors have labeled the claims as "exaggerated".&lt;ref name="Chatterji et al."/&gt; Scholars Mridu Rai&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/2011724204546645823.html |title=Kashmir: The Pandit question |last=Essa |first=Azad |website=www.aljazeera.com |access-date=2018-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907044311/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/2011724204546645823.html |archive-date=7 September 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and A. Evans{{sfn|Evans, A departure from history|2002|pp=23–24}} have outright rejected the claims of genocide.

Some scholars have also accused the Indian state and Media of utilizing the experience of Pandits as a tool of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC&amp;pg=PA121 |title=Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |date=June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674028555}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1993, a notable Indian magazine launched an investigation upon a list of 23 shrines provided by [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and found that the claims of alleged desecration of scores of Hindu shrines in Kashmir, widely perpetuated by the Indian media and right-wing Hindu politicians, were "false".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC&amp;pg=PA123 |title=Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |date=June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674028555}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Evans, A departure from history|2002|pp=23–24}}

Further, whilst significantly higher figures of death, in thousands, have been reported by certain Pandit-organisations, scholars have rejected the claims, instead choosing to roughly rely upon the official figures.{{sfn|Evans, A departure from history|2002|pp=23–24}} According to the government of Jammu and Kashmir 219 Kashmiri Pandits were killed and 24,202 families migrated out of the valley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ldquo219-Kashmiri-Pandits-killed-by-militants-since-1989rdquo/article16006510.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
The Indian Government has tried to rehabilitate the Pandits and the separatists have also invited the Pandits back  to Kashmir. Tahir, the commander of a separatist Islamic group, ensured full protection to the Kashmiri Pandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1246_land/page9.shtml |title=BBC World Service {{!}} World Agenda - Give me land |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=2017-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109093913/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1246_land/page9.shtml |archive-date=9 November 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apathy on the part of the government and the sufferings of the Kashmiri Pandits have been highlighted in a play titled 'Kaash Kashmir'.&lt;ref&gt;https://nehagargblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/br-kaash-kashmir/&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts or claims have lacked political will as journalist Rahul Pandita writes in a memoir.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/01/22/rahul-panditas-book-on-a-kashmir-exodus/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider Article 370 as a roadblock in the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandits as the [[Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir]] does not allow those living in India outside Jammu and Kashmir to freely settle in the state and become its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwW3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113 |title=Jammu &amp; Kashmir: A State in Turbulence |last=Sahagala |first=Narendra |date=2011-01-01 |publisher=Suruchi Prakashan |year= |isbn=9788189622831 |location= |pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tikoo1"&gt;{{citation |last=Tikoo |first=Colonel Tej K |title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&amp;pg=PT281 |year=2012 |publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC |isbn=978-1-935501-58-9 |pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjp.org/images/pdf_2014/full_manifesto_english_07.04.2014.pdf Election Manifesto 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704041114/http://www.bjp.org/images/pdf_2014/full_manifesto_english_07.04.2014.pdf |date=4 July 2017 }}, Bharatiya Janata Party, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanjay Tickoo, president of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), says that the 'Article 370' affair is different from the issue of exodus of Kashmiri Hindus and both should be dealt with separately. He remarks that, linking both the affairs is an "utterly insensitive way to deal with a highly sensitive and emotive issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2659432/Dont-confuse-Kashmiri-Pandit-issue-Artcle-370-expert-warns.html |title='Don't confuse Kashmiri Pandit issue with Article 370' expert warns |date=16 June 2014 |work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, a total of 1,800 Kashmiri Pandit youths have returned to the Valley since the announcing of Rs. 1,168-crore package in 2008 by the UPA government. R.K. Bhat, president of Youth All India Kashmiri Samaj criticised the package to be a mere eyewash and claimed that most of the youths were living in cramped prefabricated sheds or in rented accommodation. He also said that 4,000 vacancies have been lying vacant since 2010 and alleged that the BJP government was repeating the same rhetoric and was not serious about helping them. In an interview with NDTV on January 19, Farooq Abdullah commented that the onus was on Kashmiri Pandits to come back themselves and nobody would beg them to do so. His comments were met with disagreement by Kashmiri Pandit authors Neeru Kaul, [[Siddhartha Gigoo]], Congress MP [[Shashi Tharoor]] and retired General [[Syed Ata Hasnain]]. He also said that during his tenure as Chief Minister in 1996, he had asked them to return but they refused to do so. He reiterated his comments on January 23 and said that the time had come for them to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/when-will-we-finally-return-home-ask-displaced-kashmiri-pandits-2590640.html |title=When will we finally return home, ask displaced Kashmiri Pandits |work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The issue of separate townships for Kashmiri Pandits has been a source of contention in Kashmir with separatists as well as mainstream political parties opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kps-seeks-centres-intervention-on-kashmiri-pandits-township-issue-2814059/ |title=KPS seeks Centre’s intervention on Kashmiri Pandits township issue |work=Press Trust of India |publisher=The Indian Express |date=22 May 2016 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hizbul Mujahideen]] militant, [[Burhan Muzaffar Wani]], had threatened of attacking the "Pandit composite townships" which were meant to be built for the rehabilitation of the non-Muslim community.

[[File:The Golden Age (fresco by Pietro da Cortona).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Golden Age'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]] ([[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]]).]]

The term '''Golden Age'''  comes from [[Greek mythology]], particularly the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], and is part of the description of temporal decline of the state of peoples through five [[Ages of Man|Ages]], [[Gold]] being the first and the one during which the Golden Race of humanity ({{Lang-el|χρύσεον γένος}} ''chrýseon génos'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Hesiod]]|title=[[Works and Days]]|chapter=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lived. Those living in the  first Age were ruled by [[Cronus|Kronos]], after the finish of the first age was the [[Silver age|Silver]], then the [[Bronze Age (mythology)|Bronze]], after this the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic]] age, with the fifth and current age being [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron]].&lt;ref&gt; Robin Hard - [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology: Based on H.J. Rose's "Handbook of Greek Mythology"], [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=The+Golden+age+in+Greek+mythology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3gP-h9tvTAhVLbBoKHWhQDkwQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Golden%20age%20in%20Greek%20mythology&amp;f=false p.69-70], [[Psychology Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0415186366}}, Accessed 2017-06-May&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension "Golden Age" denotes a period of primordial [[peace]], [[harmony]], [[ecological stability|stability]], and [[prosperity]]. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as "guardians". [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.

In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths|publisher=Penguin Books | author=Gravity, Grass|year=1960|location=London|pages=35–37|isbn=9780140171990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some version of the myth [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], holding the scales of Justice, or [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hesiod calls [Astraea] the daughter of Jove and Themis. Aratus says that she is thought to be the daughter of Astraeus and Aurora, who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice, and at that time no foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live their lives caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars." ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#25 Astronomica 2]).&lt;/ref&gt;

European [[pastoral]] literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who dwelt among them.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'' ({{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Golden Age in Europe: Greece==
The earliest attested reference to the European myth of the [[Ages of Man]] 500 BCE–350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the [[Greek language|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (109–126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry, known to schoolboys from Antiquity through the Middle Ages and beyond,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.

[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]

In Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.

The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.

===Arcadia===
A tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born.

==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==
Writing in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.

Virgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:
&lt;poem&gt;''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;
''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:
''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;
''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;'''Translation:'''
''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung
''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll
''Of circling centuries begins anew:
''Astraea returns,
''Returns old Saturn's reign,
''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&amp;layout=&amp;loc=4.1 5-8)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Somewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:
&lt;poem&gt;
''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen
''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.
''Even this was impious; for the common stock
''They gathered, and the earth of her own will
''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni
''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum
''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus
''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125–28])&lt;/poem&gt;

This view, which identifies a [[State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:
&lt;poem&gt;
''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,
''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:
''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''
''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
''Needless was written law, where none opprest:
''The law of Man was written in his breast.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, "Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The Graeco-Roman concept of the "natural man" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.&lt;ref&gt;See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on "The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Soft" and "hard" primitivism in Arcadia==
In his famous essay, "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition",&lt;ref&gt;"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition," in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297–98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, "that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a "Gegen-Konstruktion" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed "soft" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O, Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, "hard" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Arcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of “soft" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other Golden Ages==
There are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu===
The Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.

The [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Satya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana&lt;/ref&gt;
Knowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga "because it was the time when all people were happy".

===Brahma Kumaris===
The [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.&lt;ref name="4ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama.The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.

Golden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajayoga Mediation taught at the Brahma Kumaris are the way to revive the seven qualities within and awaken self true divinity, the souls of Satyuga AKA Golden Age has.

Meditation energizes your awareness, bringing both peace and wisdom to a busy mind. It expands one’s capacity to love, and heals broken hearts. It also dissolves many fears, replacing them with lightness and freedom from anxiety.

But perhaps the greatest gift that meditation brings is the glow of inner peace that is both gentle and strong.

Practice of Rajyoga meditation or intellectual communion with God brings into the soul many powers. Of these, eight are important.[http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/benefits-of-meditation/ The Eight Powers.]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Norse===
The [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally "Golden Age") was used in [[Völuspá]] to describe the period after [[Ragnarök]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Gimlé]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]]. In this period, [[Baldr]] reigns.

===Bible===
There is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s dream in [[Daniel 2]], in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.

{{quote|31 "Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue – an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 34 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+2%3A+31-35&amp;version=NIV|title=Daniel 2: 31-35|publisher=Zondervon|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel 2: 31-35}}

The interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36–45.

===Fantasy===
In modern [[fantasy world]]s, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elf]]-like creatures existed, before the coming of [[human]]s.

For example, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the [[Dagor Dagorath|end of the world]], the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the "Age of Legends" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] – trained channelers – were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole – The Bore – being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.

Another example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.

The Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J.

===Present-day usage===
{{See also|Golden age (metaphor)}}
The term "Golden Age" is at present frequently used in the context of various fields, such as the "[[Spanish Golden Age]]", "[[Dutch Golden Age]]", "[[Golden age of alpinism]]", "[[Golden Age of American animation]]", "[[Golden Age of Comics]]", "[[Golden Age of Science Fiction]]", "[[Golden Age of Television]]", "[[Golden Age of Hollywood]]", "[[Golden age of arcade video games]]", "[[Golden Age of Radio]]", "[[Golden age hip hop|Golden Age of Hip Hop]]" and even "[[Golden Age of Piracy]]" or "[[Golden Age of Porn]]". Usually, the term "Golden Age" is bestowed retroactively, when the period in question has ended and is compared with what followed in the specific field discussed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">'''Golus nationalism''' (Yiddish: גלות נאַציאָנאַליזם ''Golus natsionalizm'' after [[Jewish diaspora|golus]]), or Diaspora Nationalism, is a [[Nationalism|national]] movement of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] that argued for furthering Jewish national and cultural life in the large Jewish centers throughout the world, while at the same time seeking recognition for a Jewish national identity from world powers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Yiddish Culture: The Story of the Yiddish Language Movement|last=Goldsmith|first=Emanuel S.|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|year=1997|isbn=0823216950|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Golus Nationalism was conceived by [[Nathan Birnbaum]], the Austrian philosopher who had given [[Zionism]] its name. Although Birnbaum was an early theorist of Zionism and participated in the [[First Zionist Congress]] (1897), he broke with the movement shortly after. Birnbaum began to develop a theory of pan-Judaism (''Alljudentum''), which embraced Jewish life in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laboratory for World Destruction: Germans and Jews in Central Europe|last=Wistrich|first=Robert S.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2007|isbn=0803211341|location=|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum was opposed to the idea that [[Jewish assimilation]] was inevitable, inspired by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who had retained Yiddish as a language, had a robust folk culture, and banded together in recognizably distinct communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Seeking recognition for Jewish nationality ==
Birnbaum made several attempts to have a Jewish national identity recognized by state powers. In 1907, he unsuccessfully advocated for [[Yiddish]] to be included as a Jewish national language in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] census. The following year, he ran a popular but fruitless campaign for a seat in Parliament. In 1910, he again attempted to have Yiddish recognized. Birnbaum felt that if he could get state recognition for elements of Jewish nationhood, he could petition for Jews to have shared control of a province in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. He was encouraged by the fact that the Austro-Hungarian Empire was offering the possibility of autonomous regions to ethnic groups and nationalities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yiddish: A Nation of Words|last=Weinstein|first=Miriam|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=2002|isbn=0345447301|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum also propagandized on behalf of Yiddish as a language, coining the words "Yiddishism" and "Yiddishist." He organized Yiddish events in [[Vienna]], translate Yiddish authors into German, and in 1905 established a student organization for the furtherance of the language called ''Yidishe Kultur''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1908, he organized an international conference on the Yiddish language in [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]], in which different Jewish factions squared off as to whether Yiddish should be declared the official language of Jewish nationalism or instead one of several Jewish languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Influence ==
Golus nationalism prefigured a variety of attempts to reconcile Jewish identity with the experience of diaspora. Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan|Mordecai M. Kaplan]] would wrestle with similar themes, developing a theory that Judaism should be seen as a civilization, rather than a religion, and founding [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] on this theory. Yiddishist [[Abraham Golomb]] wrote frequently about maintaining a Jewish identity in the Diaspora, and the centrality of Yiddish and Hebrew in this pursuit.

[[File:Green Beard Effect.svg|thumb|upright|The Green-beard effect is a form of selection in which individuals with genes that produce unique observable traits select individuals with the specific trait and thereby the same gene. In this illustration individuals selectively mate with individuals of the same head color.]]

The '''green-beard effect''' is a [[thought experiment]] used in [[evolutionary biology]] to explain selective [[Altruism (biology)|altruism]] among individuals of a species. Altruistic behaviour is paradoxical when viewed in the light of old ideas of evolutionary theory that emphasised the role of competition. The evolution of altruism is better explained through the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], which emphasizes an interpretation of [[natural selection]] from the point of view of the [[gene]] which acts as an agent that has the metaphorical "selfish goal" of maximizing its own propagation. A gene for (behavioral) selective altruism can be favored by (natural) selection if the altruism is primarily directed at other individuals who share the gene. Since genes are invisible, such an effect requires perceptible markers for altruistic behaviour to occur.

A green-beard effect occurs when an [[allele]], or a set of [[Genetic linkage|linked]] alleles, produce three expressed (or [[phenotype|phenotypic]]) effects: 
*a perceptible [[Trait (biology)|trait]]&amp;mdash;the hypothetical "green beard"
*recognition of this trait by others; and
*preferential treatment of individuals with the trait

The carrier of the gene (or a specific allele) is essentially recognizing copies of the same gene (or a specific allele) in other individuals.  Whereas [[kin selection]] involves altruism to related individuals who share genes in a non-specific way, green-beard alleles promote altruism toward individuals who share a gene that is expressed by a specific phenotypic trait. Some authors also note that the green-beard effects can include "spite" for individuals lacking the "green-beard" gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Altruism, Spite, and Greenbeards|author1=West, Stuart A. | author2=Gardner, Andy| journal=Science| volume=327| year=2010| pages=1341–1344|url=http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/West&amp;Gardner_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have the effect of delineating a subset of organisms within a population that is characterized by members who show greater cooperation toward each other, this forming a "clique" that can be advantageous to its members who are not necessarily kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gardner, Andy|author2=West, Stuart A.|year=2010| volume=64| issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00842.x| pages=25–38| title=Greenbeards| journal=Evolution}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green-beard effect could increase altruism on green-beard phenotypes and therefore its presence in a population even if genes assist in the increase of genes that are not exact copies; all that is required is that they express the three required characteristics. Green-beard alleles are vulnerable to mutations that produce the perceptible trait without the helping behaviour.

The idea of a green-beard allele was proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton|William D.

==Examples==
Evolutionary biologists have debated the potential validity of green-beard genes, suggesting that it would be extraordinarily rare for a single or even a set of linked genes to produce three complex phenotypic effects. This criticism has led some to believe that they simply cannot exist or that they only can be present in less complex organisms, such as microorganisms. Several discoveries within the past ten years have illuminated the validity of this critique.

The concept remained a merely theoretical possibility under Dawkins' selfish gene model until 1998, when a green-beard allele was first found in nature, in the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'').&lt;ref name=Grafen/&gt;&lt;ref name=invicta/&gt; [[Polygyne]] colony queens are [[heterozygous]] (Bb) at the Gp-9 gene locus. Their worker offspring can have both heterozygous (Bb) and [[homozygous]] (BB) genotypes. The investigators discovered that homozygous dominant (BB) queens, which in the wild form produce [[monogyne]] rather than polygyne colonies, are specifically killed when introduced into polygyne colonies, most often by heterozygous (Bb) and not homozygous (BB) workers. They concluded that the allele Gp-9&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; is linked to a greenbeard allele which induces workers bearing this allele to kill all queens that do not have it. A final conclusion notes that the workers are able to distinguish BB queens from Bb queens based on an odor cue.&lt;ref name=invicta /&gt;

The gene csA in the [[slime mould]] ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'', discovered in 2003,&lt;ref name=discoideum/&gt; codes for a [[cell adhesion]] protein which binds to gp80 proteins on other cells, allowing multicellular fruiting body formation on soil.  Mixtures of csA [[gene knockout|knockout]] cells with wild-type cells yield [[spores]], "born" from the fruiting bodies, which are 82% wild-type (WT).  This is because the wild-type cells are better at adhering and more effectively combine into aggregates; knockout (KO) cells are left behind.  On more adhesive but less natural substances, KO cells can adhere; WT cells, still better at adhering, sort preferentially into the stalk.&lt;ref name=discoideum /&gt;

In 2006, green beard-like recognition was seen in the cooperative behavior among color morphs in side-blotched lizards, although the traits appear to be encoded by multiple loci across the genome.&lt;ref name="pmid16651531"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinervo B, Chaine A, Clobert J, Calsbeek R, Hazard L, Lancaster L, McAdam AG, Alonzo S, Corrigan G, Hochberg ME | title = Self-recognition, color signals, and cycles of greenbeard mutualism and altruism | journal =  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 103 | issue = 19 | pages = 7372–7377 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16651531 | url = | doi =10.1073/pnas.0510260103 | pmc = 1564281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example, found in 2008, is a gene that makes [[brewer's yeast]] clump together in response to a toxin such as alcohol.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; By investigating [[flocculation]], a type of self-adherence generally present in asexual aggregations, Smukalla ''et al.'' showed that ''S. cerevisiae'' is a model for cooperative behavior evolution. When this yeast expresses FLO1 in the laboratory, flocculation is restored.  Flocculation is apparently protective for the FLO1+ cells, which are shielded from certain stresses (ethanol, for example).  In addition FLO1+ cells preferentially adhere to each other.  The authors therefore conclude that flocculation is driven by this greenbeard allele.&lt;ref name=cerevisiae/&gt;

A mammalian example appears to be the reproductive strategy of the [[wood mouse]], which shows cooperation among spermatozoa. Single sperms hook in each other to form sperm-trains, which are able to move faster together than single sperm would do.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt;

It has been suggested that [[speciation]] could be possible through the manifestation of a green-beard effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2003)057[0154:SMS]2.0.CO;2 |title=Socially mediated speciation| author1=Hochberg,  Michael E. |author2=Sinervo, Barry |author3=Brown, Sam P. | journal=Evolution| volume= 57|issue=1|pages=154–158| year=2003|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/classes/game_theory/HochbergEvo2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been pointed out that both the biological and cultural aspects of language are bestowed with green beard recognition systems, thus providing insights into the evolution of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenfors|first=Patrik|date=2013-02-27|title=The green beards of language|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ece3.506|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=1104–1112|doi=10.1002/ece3.506|issn=2045-7758|pmc=3631417|pmid=23610647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13911">The '''Gutmann method''' is an [[algorithm]] for [[data remanence|securely erasing]] the contents of computer [[hard disk drive]]s, such as [[computer file|file]]s. Devised by [[Peter Gutmann (computer scientist)|Peter Gutmann]] and Colin Plumb and presented in the paper ''Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory'' in July 1996, it involved writing a series of 35 [[pattern]]s over the region to be erased.

The selection of patterns assumes that the user does not know the encoding mechanism used by the drive, so it includes patterns designed specifically for three types of drives. A user who knows which type of encoding the drive uses can choose only those patterns intended for their drive. A drive with a different encoding mechanism would need different patterns.

Most of the patterns in the Gutmann method were designed for older [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]/[[Run Length Limited|RLL]] encoded disks. Gutmann himself has noted that more modern drives no longer use these older encoding techniques, making parts of the method irrelevant. He said "In the time since this paper was published, some people have treated the 35-pass overwrite technique described in it more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding techniques".&lt;ref name="Gutmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name=security-and-usability&gt;{{cite book |title=Security and Usability: Designing Secure Systems that People Can Use |authors=Lorrie Faith Cranor, Simson Garfinkel |page=307 |url=https://books.google.ee/books?id=wDVhy9EyEAEC&amp;pg=PA307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2001, some [[Parallel ATA|ATA IDE]] and [[SATA]] hard drive manufacturer designs include support for the [[ATA Secure Erase]] standard, obviating the need to apply the Gutmann method when erasing an entire drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf|title=Clearing and Declassifying Electronic Data Storage Devices|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303210956/http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-03|publisher=Communications Security Establishment|date=July 2006|page=7|type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2011 research found that 4 out of 8 manufacturers did not implement ATA Secure Erase correctly.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical overview==
One standard way to recover data that has been overwritten on a hard drive is to capture and process the analog signal obtained from the drive's read/write head prior to this analog signal being digitized. This analog signal will be close to an ideal digital signal, but the differences will reveal important information. By calculating the ideal digital signal and then subtracting it from the actual analog signal, it is possible to amplify the obtained difference signal and use it to determine what had previously been written on the disk.

For example:
 Analog signal:        +11.1  -8.9  +9.1 -11.1 +10.9  -9.1
 Ideal digital signal: +10.0 -10.0 +10.0 -10.0 +10.0 -10.0
 Difference:            +1.1  +1.1  -0.9  -1.1  +0.9  +0.9
 Previous signal:      +11    +11   -9   -11    +9    +9

This can then be done again to see the previous data written:
 Recovered signal:     +11    +11   -9   -11    +9    +9
 Ideal digital signal: +10.0 +10.0 -10.0 -10.0 +10.0 +10.0
 Difference:            +1    +1    +1    -1    -1    -1
 Previous signal:      +10   +10   +10   -10   -10   -10

However, even when overwriting the disk repeatedly with random data it is theoretically possible to recover the previous signal. The  [[permittivity]] of a medium changes with the frequency of the magnetic field{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. This means that a lower frequency field will penetrate deeper into the magnetic material on the drive than a high frequency one{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. So a low frequency signal will, in theory, still be detectable even after it has been overwritten hundreds of times by a high frequency signal.

The patterns used are designed to apply alternating magnetic fields of various frequencies and various phases to the drive surface and thereby approximate [[degaussing]] the material below the surface of the drive{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

==Method==
An [[overwrite]] session consists of a lead-in of four [[random]] write patterns, followed by patterns 5 to 31 (see rows of table below), executed in a random order, and a lead-out of four more random patterns.

Each of patterns 5 to 31 was designed with a specific [[magnetic medium|magnetic media]] [[code|encoding]] scheme in mind, which each pattern targets. The drive is written to for all the passes even though the table below only shows the bit patterns for the passes that are specifically targeted at each encoding scheme. The end result should obscure any data on the drive so that only the most advanced physical scanning (e.g., using a [[magnetic force microscope]]) of the drive is likely to be able to recover any data. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Encoded bits shown in bold are what should be present in the ideal pattern, although due to the encoding the complementary bit is actually present at the start of the track.

==Criticism==

The delete function in most [[operating systems]] simply marks the space occupied by the file as reusable (removes the [[data pointer|pointer]] to the file) without immediately removing any of its contents. At this point the file can be fairly easily recovered by numerous recovery applications.  However, once the space is overwritten with other data, there is no known way to use software to recover it. It cannot be done with software alone since the storage device only returns its current contents via its normal interface.  Gutmann claims that [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] have sophisticated tools, including [[magnetic force microscope]]s, which together with [[image analysis]], can detect the previous values of [[bit]]s on the affected area of the media (for example [[hard disk]]).

Daniel Feenberg of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], an American private nonprofit research organization, criticized Gutmann's claim that intelligence agencies are likely to be able to read overwritten data, citing a lack of evidence for such claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/sys-admin/overwritten-data-gutmann.html|title=Can Intelligence Agencies Read Overwritten Data? A response to Gutmann|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|date=2013|orig-year=2003|author=Daniel Feenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some published government security procedures consider a disk overwritten once to still be sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf|title=Clearing and Declassifying Electronic Data Storage Devices|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303210956/http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/documents/publications/itsg-csti/itsg06-eng.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-03|publisher=Communications Security Establishment|date=July 2006|type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutmann himself has responded to some of these criticisms and also criticized how his algorithm has been abused in an epilogue to his original paper, in which he states:&lt;ref name="Gutmann"&gt;Gutmann, Peter. (July 22–25, 1996) ''[https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory.]'' University of Auckland Department of Computer Science. Epilogue section.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=security-and-usability /&gt;
{{quotation|In the time since this paper was published, some people have treated the 35-pass overwrite technique described in it more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding techniques. As a result, they advocate applying the voodoo to [[Partial response maximum likelihood|PRML]] and EPRML drives even though it will have no more effect than a simple scrubbing with random data. In fact performing the full 35-pass overwrite is pointless for any drive since it targets a blend of scenarios involving all types of (normally-used) encoding technology, which covers everything back to 30+-year-old [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] methods (if you don't understand that statement, re-read the paper). If you're using a drive which uses encoding technology X, you only need to perform the passes specific to X, and you never need to perform all 35 passes. For any modern PRML/EPRML drive, a few passes of random scrubbing is the best you can do. As the paper says, "A good scrubbing with random data will do about as well as can be expected". This was true in 1996, and is still true now.|Peter Gutmann|Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory|University of Auckland Department of Computer Science.}}

==History==
The term gynocentrism has been in use since at least 1897 when it appeared in The Open Court stating that Continental Europeans view Americans "as suffering rather from gynocentrism than anthropocentrism."&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Court'', Volume 11 (Open Court Publishing Company, 1897)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, author George A. Birmingham stated that "American social life seems to me gynocentric. It is arranged with a view to the convenience and delight of women. Men come in where and how they can."&lt;ref&gt;George A. Birmingham, ''From Dublin to Chicago: Some Notes on a Tour in America'' (George H. Doran Company, 1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[second-wave feminism]] in the 1970s, the term gynocentrism has been used to describe [[difference feminism]], which displayed a shift towards understanding and accepting gender differences, in contrast to [[equality feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Linda J. (1997), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EcgSDuc2bWQC&amp;pg=PT147 Gynocentrism: women's oppression, women's identity, and women's standpoint]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Nicholson | editor-first = Linda J. | title = The second wave: a reader in feminist theory (Volume 1) | pages = 147&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415917612 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Massachusetts philosopher Christa Hodapp, in modern men's movements gynocentrism is described as a continuation of the [[courtly love]] conventions of medieval times, wherein women were valued as a quasi-[[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic class]], and males were seen as a lower serving class. This [[antifeminism|antifeminist]] viewpoint describes [[feminism]] as the perpetuation of oppressive medieval conventions such as [[Domnei|devotional chivalry]] and [[Romance (love)#Popularization of love|romanticized relationships]], rather than as a movement towards liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Christa Hodapp, ''Men's Rights, Gender, and Social Media'', Lexington Books (September 5, 2017) {{ISBN|1498526160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious studies professors Paul Nathanson and [[Katherine K. Young]] claim that feminist calls for equality or equity are a subterfuge for gynocentrism.&lt;ref name="Katherine K p.116"&gt;Nathanson, Paul; [[Katherine K. Young|Young, Katherine K.]] (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&amp;pg=PT116 Women's rights v. human rights: the case of entitlements]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Nathanson | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Young | editor-first2 = Katherine K. | editor-link2 = Katherine K.

==Etymology==
The term ''gynocentrism'' is derived from [[ancient Greek]], γυνή and κέντρον. Γυνή can be translated as ''woman'' or ''female'',&lt;ref name="Kraus"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kraus | first = Ludwig A. | title = Kritisch-etymologisches medicinisches Lexikon'' (Dritte Auflage) | publisher = Deuerlich &amp; Dieterich | location = Göttingen, Germany | year = 1844 | oclc = 491993305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Liddell | first1 = Henry G. | last2 = Scott | first2 = Robert | author-link1 = Henry Liddell | author-link2 = Robert Scott (philologist) | title = A Greek-English lexicon / a new edition revised and augmented throughout / by Sir Henry Stuart Jones; with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie and with the co-operation of many scholars | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1940 | oclc = 630078019}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also as ''wife''.&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; In ancient Greek compounds with γυνή, the stem γυναικ- is normally used.&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; This stem can be spotted in the genitive case γυναικός,&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt; and in the older form of the nominative case γύναιξ.&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt; In ancient Greek, no compounds are known to exist with γυνή that start with γυνο- or γυνω-.&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt;

The ancient Greek word κέντρον can be translated as ''sharp point'',&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; ''sting (of bees and wasps)'',&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; ''point of a spear''&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt;  and ''stationary point of a pair of compasses'',&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; with the meaning ''centre of a circle'' related to the latter.&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt; The meaning ''centre/middle point (of a circle)'' is preserved in the Latin word ''centrum'',&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Short"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Charlton T. | last2 = Short | first2 = Charles | author-link1 = Charlton Thomas Lewis | title = A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1879 | oclc = 223667500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saalfeld1884"&gt;{{cite book | last = Saalfeld | first = Günther Alexander Ernst Adolf | title = Tensaurus Italograecus : ausführliches historisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der Griechischen Lehn- und Fremdwörter im Lateinischen | publisher = Druck und Verlag von Carl Gerold's Sohn, Buchhändler der Kaiserl.

==Criticism==
Nathanson and Young state that ideologically, the overriding focus of gynocentrism is to prioritize females hierarchically, and as a result may be interpreted as [[misandry]] (hatred of and prejudice towards men). Feminist calls for equality or even equity are often, according to them, a subterfuge for gynocentrism.&lt;ref name="Katherine K p.116"/&gt;

They define gynocentrism as a worldview based on the implicit or explicit belief that the world revolves around women, a cultural theme that they claim has become 'de rigueur' behind the scenes in law courts and government bureaucracies, resulting in systemic discrimination against men.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson, Paul; [[Katherine K. Young|Young, Katherine K.]] (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&amp;pg=PT309 Misandry v. equality]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Nathanson | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Young | editor-first2 = Katherine K. | editor-link2 = Katherine K. Young | title = Legalizing misandry: from public shame to systemic discrimination against men | page = 309 | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | location = Montreal Ithaca | isbn = 9780773559998 | ref = harv | postscript = .| year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They further state that gynocentrism is a form of [[essentialism]] – as distinct from scholarship or political activity on behalf of women- to the extent that it focuses on the innate ''virtues'' of women and the innate ''vices'' of men.&lt;ref name="Katherine K p.58"&gt;Nathanson, Paul; [[Katherine K. Young|Young, Katherine K.]] (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&amp;pg=PT58 Misandry v. equality]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Nathanson | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Young | editor-first2 = Katherine K. | editor-link2 = Katherine K. Young | title = Martyrs v. murderers: the Montreal massacre | page = 58 | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | location = Montreal Ithaca | isbn = 9780773559998 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors make discriminations between ''individual'' gynocentric acts and events, such as [[Mother's Day]], and the more general concept of a ''gynocentric culture'' which refers to a larger collection of culture traits that have major significance in the way people’s lives were lived.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Peter (2014), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GU9VBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8 Introduction to gynocentrism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Peter | title = Gynocentrism: From Feudalism to Modern Disney Princesses | page = 8 | publisher = [[Amazon (company)|Amazon Digital]] | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781520327327 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self published inline|certain=y|date=November 2017}}

Some [[post-modern]] feminists such as [[Nancy Fraser]] question the assumption of a stable concept of 'woman' which underlies all gynocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;La Caze, Marguerite (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CdfgMEV3f6oC&amp;pg=PT161 Splitting the difference: between Young and Fraser on identity politics]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Burns | editor-first = Lynda | title = Feminist alliances | pages = 160–161 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam New York | isbn = 9789042017283 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathanson and Young make a comparable claim that gynocentrism is a form of essentialism as distinct from scholarship or political activity on behalf of women, to the extent that it focuses on the innate virtues of women. Nathanson and Young add that "This worldview is explicitly misandric too, because it not only ignores the needs and problems of men, but also attacks men."&lt;ref name="Katherine K p.58"/&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has argued that gynocentrism is anti-intellectual and holds an antagonistic view of traditional scientific and creative disciplines, dismissing many important discoveries and artistic works as masculine. Sommers also writes that the presumption of objectivity ascribed to many gynocentrist theories has stifled feminist discourse and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christina Hoff Sommers|Hoff Sommers, Christina]] (1995), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIUtJziqIqAC&amp;pg=PA64 Transforming the academy]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Hoff Sommers | editor-first = Christina | editor-link = Christina Hoff Sommers | title = Who stole feminism?: How women have betrayed women | pages = 64–73 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | isbn = 9780684801568 | ref = harv | postscript = .| title-link = Who Stole Feminism? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist writer [[Lynda Burns]] emphasises that gynocentrism calls for a celebration of women's positive differences—of women's history, myths, arts and music—as opposed to an assimilationist model privileging similarity to men.&lt;ref&gt;La Caze, Marguerite (2006), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CdfgMEV3f6oC&amp;pg=PT153 Splitting the difference: between Young and Fraser on identity politics]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Burns | editor-first = Lynda | title = Feminist alliances | page = 153 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam New York | isbn = 9789042017283 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However observed in practice, the preeminence of women associated with gynocentric narratives is often seen as absolute: interpersonally, culturally, historically, politically, or in broader social contexts such as popular entertainment. As such, it can shade into what [[Rosalind Coward]] called "womanism...a sort of popularized version of feminism which acclaims everything women do and disparages men".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ros Coward|Coward, Rosalind]] (2000), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PTfaNLyXS0wC&amp;pg=PT19 Introduction]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Coward | editor-first = Rosalind | editor-link = Ros Coward | title = Sacred cows: is feminism relevant to the new millennium | page = 11 | publisher = HarperCollins | location = London | isbn = 9780006548201 | ref = harv | postscript = .| year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Men Going Their Own Way]] (MGTOW) community describes themselves as a backlash against the misandry of gynocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Habitus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|b|ɪ|t|ə|s}}) is ingrained habits, skills, and dispositions.  It is the way that individuals perceive the social world around them and react to it. These dispositions are usually shared by people with similar backgrounds (such as [[social class]], religion, nationality, ethnicity, education, profession etc.). The habitus is acquired through imitation (''[[Mimesis|mimesis]]'') and is the reality that individuals are socialized, which includes their individual experience and opportunities. Thus, the habitus represents the way group culture and personal history shape the body and the mind, and as a result, shape present social actions of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Lizardo, O. 2004, "The cognitive origins of Bourdieu's Habitus", Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, vol. 34, no. 4, pp. 375-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|newspaper=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] suggested that the habitus consists of both the ''[[hexis]]'' (the tendency to hold and use one's body in a certain way, such as posture and accent) and more abstract mental habits, schemes of perception, classification, appreciation, feeling, and action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Pascalian Meditations|newspaper=Stanford University Press.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schemes are not mere [[habit]]s: Bourdieu suggested they allow individuals to find new solutions to new situations without calculated deliberation, based on their gut feelings and intuitions, which Bourdieu believed were collective and socially shaped. These attitudes, mannerisms, tastes, moral intuitions and habits have influence on the individual's life chances, so the habitus not only is structured by an individual's objective past position in the [[social structure]] but also structures the individual's future life path. Pierre Bourdieu argued that the reproduction of the social structure results from the habitus of individuals (Bourdieu, 1987).

The notion of habitus is extremely influential (with 400,000 Google Scholar publications using it), yet it also evoked criticism for its alleged determinism, as Bourdieu compared social actors to ''automata'' (while relying on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] theory of [[Monadology|Monads]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Origins ==
The concept of habitus has been used as early as [[Aristotle]] but in contemporary usage was introduced by [[Marcel Mauss]] and later [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. However, it was [[Pierre Bourdieu]] who turned it into a cornerstone of his sociology, and used it to address the sociological problem of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] and structure: the habitus is shaped by structural position and generates action, thus when people act and demonstrate agency they simultaneously reflect and reproduce social structure. Bourdieu elaborated his theory of the habitus while borrowing ideas on cognitive and generative schemes from [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jean Piaget]] dependency on history and human memory. For instance, a certain behaviour or belief becomes part of a society's structure when the original purpose of that behaviour or belief can no longer be recalled and becomes socialized into individuals of that culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community and society|last=Tönnies|first=Ferdinand|publisher=Harper and Row.|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY:|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loïc Wacquant]] wrote that habitus is an old philosophical notion, originating in the thought of [[Aristotle]], whose notion of ''[[hexis]]'' ("state") was translated into ''habitus'' by the Medieval [[Scholastics]].  Bourdieu first adapted the term in his 1967 postface to [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Winter2007/Premodern.htm Review] of Holsinger, ''The Premodern Condition'', in ''Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature'' 6:1 (Winter 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was earlier used in sociology by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939) and in [[Marcel Mauss]]'s account of "body techniques" (techniques du corps).  The concept is also present in the work of [[Max Weber]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and [[Edmund Husserl]].

Mauss defined habitus as those aspects of culture that are anchored in the body or daily practices of individuals, groups, societies, and nations.  It includes the totality of learned [[Habit (psychology)|habits]], bodily skills, styles, tastes, and other non-discursive knowledges that might be said to "go without saying" for a specific group (Bourdieu 1990:66-67)—in that way it can be said to operate beneath the level of rational [[ideology]].

According to Bourdieu, habitus is composed of:

{{quote|[s]ystems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=The Logic of Practice|newspaper=Polity Press.|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Non-sociological uses==

=== Literary criticism ===
The term has also been adopted in literary criticism, adapting from Bourdieu's usage of the term. For example, Joe Moran's examination of authorial identities in ''Star Authors: Literary Celebrity in America'' uses the term in discussion of how authors develop a habitus formed around their own celebrity and status as authors, which manifests in their writing.

=== Use in literary theory ===
Bourdieu's principle of habitus is interwoven with the concept of structuralism in literary theory. Peter Barry explains, "in the structuralist approach to literature there is a constant movement away from interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger structures which contain them" (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;39). There is therefore a strong desire to understand the larger influencing factors which makes an individual literary work. As Bourdieu explains, habitus "are structured structures, generative principles of distinct and distinctive practices – what the worker eats, and especially the way he eats it, the sport he practices and the way he practices it, his political opinions and the way he expresses them are systematically different from the industrial proprietor's corresponding activities / habitus are also structuring structures, different classifying schemes classification principles, different principles of vision and division, different tastes. Habitus make different differences; they implement distinctions between what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong, between what is distinguished and what is vulgar, and so on, but they are not the same. Thus, for instance, the same behaviour or even the same good can appear distinguished to one person, pretentious to someone else, and cheap or showy to yet another" (Bourdieu, 1996). As a result, habitus may be employed in literary theory in order to understand those larger, external structures which influence individual theories and works of literature.

=== Body habitus ===
Body habitus (or "bodily habitus") is the medical term for physique, and is categorized as either endomorphic (relatively short and stout), ectomorphic (relatively long and thin) or mesomorphic (average dimensions). In this sense, habitus has in the past been interpreted as the physical and constitutional characteristics of an individual, especially as related to the tendency to develop a certain disease.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (4th Ed) Houghton Mifflin Company, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "[[marfan syndrome|Marfanoid]] bodily habitus".

== Scholars researching habitus ==
* [[Loïc Wacquant]] – a sociologist and ethnographer who studied the construction of the "pugilistic habitus" in a boxing gym of the black ghetto of Chicago in ''Body and Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer'' (2004) and in "Habitus as Topic and Tool" (2009).
* Bernard Lahire – a French sociologist who suggested that the habitus is not (or no longer) a system shared by a class, but rather an eclectic set of dispositions that are often contradictory, due to non-typical socialization paths in late modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Lahire, Bernard. 2011.

'''''Hakham Bashi''''' ({{lang-ota|حاخامباشی}}, {{lang-tr|Hahambaşı}}, {{IPA-tr|hɑˈhɑm bɑˈʃɯ|IPA}}) is the Turkish name for the [[Chief Rabbi]] of the nation's [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Jewish community]]. In the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] it was also used for the chief rabbi of a particular region of the empire, such as [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] or [[Ottoman Iraq|Iraq]], though the Hakham Bashi of [[Constantinople]] was considered overall head of the Jews of the Empire.
==Etymology==
''Hakham'' is Hebrew for "wise man" (or "scholar"), while ''başı'' is Turkish for "head".
==History==
[[Image:Alepporabbiwithsecretary.jpg|thumb|Chief Rabbi Jacob Saul Dwek, Hakham Bashi of [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], 1907.]]

The institution of the ''Hakham Bashi'' was established by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Mehmet II]], as part of his policy of governing his exceedingly diverse subjects according to their own laws and authorities wherever possible. Religion was considered as primordial aspect of a communities 'national' identity, so the term [[Ethnarch]] has been applied to such religious leaders, especially the ([[Greek Orthodox]]) [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] (i.e. in the Sultan's imperial capital, renamed [[Istanbul]] in 1930 but replaced by [[Ankara]] as republican capital in 1923). As [[Islam]] was the official religion of both court and state, the [[Chief Mufti]] in Istanbul had a much higher status, even of cabinet rank.

Because of the size and nature of the Ottoman state, containing a far greater part of the [[diaspora]] than any other, the position of Hakham Bashi has been compared to that of the Jewish [[Exilarch]].

In the Ottoman Empire, and as such, the ''Hakham Bashi'' was the closest thing to an overall [[Exilarch]]al authority among [[Jewry]] everywhere in the Middle East in early modern times. They held broad powers to legislate, judge and enforce the laws among the Jews in the Ottoman Empire and often sat on the [[Sultan]]'s [[divan]].

The office also maintained considerable influence outside the Ottoman Empire, especially after the [[Alhambra decree|forced migration]] of numerous Jewish communities and individuals out of [[Spain]] (after the fall of Granada in 1492) and [[Italy]].

The Chief Rabbi of the modern, secular Republic of [[Turkey]] is still known as ''Hahambaşı''.

The term ''Hakham Bashi'' was also used for the official Government-appointed Chief Rabbi of other important cities in the Ottoman Empire, such as [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]]. In particular, the position of Hakham Bashi of Palestine was the precursor of that of [[List of Sephardi chief rabbis of the Land of Israel|Sephardic]] [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]].

The '''heath hen''' (''Tympanuchus cupido cupido'') was a distinctive subspecies of the [[greater prairie chicken]], ''Tympanuchus cupido'', a large [[North America]]n [[bird]] in the [[grouse]] family, or possibly a distinct species, that became extinct in 1932.

Heath hens lived in the scrubby [[Pine barrens|heathland barrens]] of coastal [[North America]] from southernmost [[New Hampshire]] to northern [[Virginia]] in historical times, but possibly south to [[Florida]] prehistorically.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  The prairie chickens, ''[[Tympanuchus]]'' species, on the other hand, inhabited [[prairie]]s from [[Texas]] north to [[Indiana]] and the [[Dakotas]], and in earlier times in mid-southern [[Canada]].

Heath hens were extremely common in their habitat during Colonial times, but being a [[Galliformes|gallinaceous]] bird, they were hunted by settlers extensively for food. In fact, many have speculated that the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]]' [[first Thanksgiving]] dinner featured heath hens and not [[wild turkey]]. By the late 18th century, the heath hen had a reputation as poor man's food for being so cheap and plentiful; somewhat earlier [[Thomas L. Winthrop]] had reported that they lived on the [[Boston Common]] (presumably when it was still used to graze cows, etc.) and that servants would sometimes bargain with a new employer for ''not'' being given heath hen for food more often than two or three days a week.&lt;ref name=thompson1971&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Daniel Q.|author2=Ralph H. Smith|year=1971|title=The Forest Primeval in the Northeast&amp;nbsp;– A Great Myth?|journal=Proceedings Annual Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference|volume=10|pages=263–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Heath Hen, Boston.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stuffed female specimen at [[Boston Museum of Science]]]]
A first [[mtDNA]] [[D-loop]] [[haplotype]] comparison between heath hen specimens and prairie-chickens&lt;ref name=Palkovacs/&gt; brought the unexpected result that all heath hens tested formed a group very distinct from mainland birds, being most similar genetically to greater prairie chickens from [[Wisconsin]]. A more recent study&lt;ref name=Johnson2006/&gt; of the same parameter by Johnson and Dunn verified these results, but disagreed in the placement of the heath hen respective to its relatives, suggesting a closer relationship with the [[lesser prairie chicken]] instead.

However, Johnson and Dunn caution against reading too much into these results: while the lesser prairie chicken is considered a distinct species and the genetically apparently equally distinct heath hen would thus likewise deserve species status.&lt;ref&gt;In this case, the correct nomenclature for the Greater Prairie-Chicken would be ''Tympanuchus pinnatus pinnatus''; ''Tympanuchus pinnatus attwateri'' for [[Attwater's Prairie Chicken]].&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA haplotypes in small populations that have undergone [[population bottleneck|bottlenecks]] are likely to show higher divergence than they would judging from taxonomic status alone&lt;ref name=Johnson2003/&gt; (see also [[genetic drift]]). Thus, given the fact that all heath hen specimens from known localities studied by Johnson and Dunn are Martha's Vineyard birds&amp;nbsp;– where the population may never have exceeded several thousand due to the limited space and limited genetic exchange with the mainland&amp;nbsp;– it is possible that the low genetic diversity and apparent distinctness of the heath hen are an artifact of the small number of useful specimens, all from the same close-knit population.

Prairie chickens were indiscriminately introduced to the Eastern Seaboard after the heath hen was gone from the mainland, but failed to thrive. There exist a considerable number of supposed heath hen specimens in public collections today, but many&amp;nbsp;– all mainland specimens and those with insufficient locality information&amp;nbsp;– cannot be unequivocally assumed to be heath hens. For example, a mere 7 unequivocal heath hen eggs&amp;nbsp;– equivalent to a very small [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]]&lt;ref name=Luther/&gt; – are known to be held in public collections today. That the [[genus]] ''Tympanuchus'' apparently evolved rapidly and therefore has high morphological but low genetic distinctness between taxa further complicates research.
[[File:Heath Hen display.jpg|thumb|Photo of a displaying male from 1900]] 
It is also important to note that while introductions of the greater prairie chicken (''Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus'') were occurring, true heath hens (''Tympanuchus cupido cupido'') are distinct enough in morphological features to be separated from the greater prairie chicken. Taking a generous starting date of ~1810 when introductions could have started, and taking into account that [[Lewis and Clark]] did not even return from their expedition until 1806,  gives roughly a 60-year period of possible introductions. From an evolutionary biology aspect, in a 60, or even 100-year timeframe, a species like the greater prairie chicken would not have been able to evolve to the point where he would so closely resemble the native heath hen that he could not be distinguished.

A prime example of this would be in opposing the lesser prairie chicken (''[[Tympanuchus pallidicinctus]]'') which differs from the greater prairie chicken in being smaller, lighter, and having less distinct barring, to the heath hen, which was smaller, darker, and had more distinct barring. Meaning that the lesser prairie chicken can be readily distinguished from the greater prairie chicken both morphologically and genetically (much like the heath hen) even if he were found in an area that the greater prairie
chicken inhabited.

The apparent distinctness of the species and the failure of the early introductions raises the question of whether the heath hen was uniquely (by comparison with its relatives) adapted to the more [[oceanic climate]] of its former area of occurrence, and in consequence, whether a future attempt to establish a population of the western birds on Martha's Vineyard could be bound to fail, possibly even by competing for funding and other resources jeopardizing the extant but much declined populations of the prairie-chickens. Clearly, more research is necessary, for example by analyzing mainland specimens to determine whether they can be assigned to a taxon from molecular and morphological characters.

==Description==
[[File:Heath Hens.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Male and female]]
Very similar to the [[greater prairie chicken]] of the [[Great Plains]], but slightly smaller,&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt; the length of the bird was approximately 17&amp;nbsp;inches (43&amp;nbsp;cm) and weight was about two pounds (0.9&amp;nbsp;kg). A specimen weighing three pounds was claimed by [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] but that figure was not verified by later ornithologists.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbush/&gt; Several key plumage characteristics separated the heath hens from their Great Plains counterparts: heath hens generally displayed a strong reddish hue in their plumage, especially in their [[Crop (anatomy)#Birds|crop]] area, and much thicker barring throughout the breast and sides. Their pinnae (horns) were generally pointed, and tails were a greyish brown.

==Extinction==
[[Image:Tympanuchus cupido cupidoAEP11LA.png|thumb|Two displaying males with a female in the background]]
Owing to intense hunting pressure, the population declined rapidly. Perhaps as early as the 1840s, at any rate by 1870, all heath hens were [[Local extinction|extirpate]]d on the mainland. There were about 300 left on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], off [[Massachusetts]], but by 1890 this number had declined to 120–200 birds, mainly due to predation by [[feral]] cats and [[poaching]]. By the late 19th century, there were about 70 left. These were protected by a hunting ban and by the establishment in 1908 of the "Heath Hen Reserve" (today the [[Manuel F. Correllus State Forest]]), and the population rapidly grew to almost 2000: by the mid-1910s, observing the birds on their [[Lek (animal behaviour)|lekking grounds]] had become something of a tourist attraction. However, a destructive fire during the 1916 nesting season, severe winters, an unusual influx of predatory [[northern goshawk|goshawk]]s, [[inbreeding]], an excess number of male individuals and apparently an epidemic of [[Histomoniasis|blackhead disease]], which might have been transmitted by [[poultry]], brought the numbers down quickly; after a last recovery to 600 in 1920, the population began its final decline.

In 1927, only about a dozen were left&amp;nbsp;– a mere two being females&amp;nbsp;– despite being afforded the best protection according to contemporary science; that number had declined to a handful, all males, by the end of the year. After December 8, 1928, apparently only one male survived,&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt; lovingly nicknamed "Booming Ben". He was last seen on his traditional lekking ground between [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts|West Tisbury]] and today's [[Martha's Vineyard Airport]] on March 11, 1932 – early in the breeding season -, and thus presumably died, about 8 years old, days or only hours afterwards from unknown causes.

Heath hens were one of the first bird species that Americans tried to save from [[extinction]]. As early as 1791, a bill "for the preservation of heath-hen and other game" was introduced in the [[New York State legislature]]. Some representatives misinterpreted the bill when it was read as an act to protect "[[Iroquois|Indians]] and other {{linktext|heathen}}";&lt;ref&gt;"The bill was entitled, 'An Act for the preservation of Heath-Hen, and other game.' The honest Chairman of the Assembly&amp;nbsp;— no sportsman, I suppose&amp;nbsp;— read the title, 'An Act for the preservation of Heathen, and other game' !" ([Alexander Wilson], Thomas Mayo Brewer, ed. ''Wilson's American Ornithology: with notes by Jardine...'', 1840: 257).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the legislation was passed, it turned out to be unenforceable.

Although the effort to save the heath hen from extinction was ultimately unsuccessful, it paved the way for conservation of other species. The establishment of the reserve on the open shrubland of what was then called the Great Plain in the Vineyard may have accelerated the heath hen's extinction. Fires were a normal part of the environment, but with the attempt to suppress fires instead of enforcing [[ecological succession]] with [[controlled burn]]s, open habitat quality decreased and undergrowth accumulated until a normally limited fire would have disastrous consequences, as it did in 1916.&lt;ref name="thompson1971" /&gt;  Lack of awareness of the region's historical [[fire ecology]] also led the state legislature to require [[firebreak]]s when protecting the heath hen.&lt;ref name="thompson1971" /&gt;

Realizing the degradation that has affected the State Forest (and although it does hold remarkable [[biodiversity]], prevents it from being utilized to its full potential), reestablishment of the original shrubland/heath/woods mosaic and eventual introduction of the closely related Greater Prairie Chickens as an "[[umbrella species]]" that serves as an indicator of good habitat quality has been discussed since the late 1990s.

A '''hydrogen vehicle''' is a [[vehicle]] that uses [[hydrogen]] as its onboard fuel for [[motive power]]. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled [[space rocket]]s, as well as [[automobile]]s and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the [[chemical energy]] of hydrogen to [[mechanical energy]] either by burning hydrogen in an [[internal combustion engine]], or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a [[fuel cell]] to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed [[hydrogen economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iphe.net/docs/Resources/Power_trains_for_Europe.pdf|title=A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis|author=|date=|website=iphe.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, there are three hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the [[Toyota Mirai]], the [[Hyundai Nexo]], and the [[Honda Clarity]]. Several other companies are working to develop hydrogen cars. As of 2014, 95% of hydrogen is made from natural gas.

Companies such as [[Boeing]], [[Lange Aviation]], and the [[German Aerospace Center]] pursue hydrogen as fuel for manned and unmanned airplanes. In February 2008 Boeing tested a manned flight of a small aircraft powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. Unmanned hydrogen planes have also been tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091013123350.htm |title=Ion tiger hydrogen UAV |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large passenger airplanes, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that "Boeing said that hydrogen fuel cells were unlikely to power the engines of large passenger jet airplanes but could be used as backup or auxiliary power units onboard."&lt;ref name="Apr08Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article3675188.ece|title=Boeing tests first hydrogen powered plane|publisher=The Times|author=David Robertson|date=3 April 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the [[Reaction Engines A2]] has been proposed to use the thermodynamic properties of [[liquid hydrogen]] to achieve very high speed, long distance (antipodal) flight by burning it in a [[precooled jet engine]].

===Fork trucks===
A HICE forklift or HICE lift truck is a hydrogen fueled, [[internal combustion engine]]-powered industrial [[forklift truck]] used for lifting and [[transport]]ing materials.  The first production HICE forklift truck based on the Linde X39 Diesel was presented at an exposition in [[Hannover]] on May 27, 2008. It used a 2.0 litre, {{convert|43|kW|abbr=on}} diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel with the use of a compressor and [[fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-35668015_ITM |title=Hydrogen engines get a lift |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HyICE"&gt;[https://www.hfpeurope.org/uploads/700/836/2005_HFP_Brussels_HyICE.pdf HyICE]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[fuel cell forklift]] (also called a fuel cell lift truck) is a fuel cell powered industrial forklift truck.

Environmental Leader: Environmental &amp; Energy Management News, 20 July 2011, accessed 2 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Most companies in Europe and the US do not use petroleum powered forklifts, as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/forklift_anl_esd.pdf Full Fuel-Cycle Comparison of Forklift Propulsion Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217104928/http://www2.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/forklift_anl_esd.pdf |date=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel-cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery powered forklifts as they can be refueled in 3 minutes. They can be used in refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The fuel cell units are often designed as drop-in replacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.still.co.uk/fuel-cell-technology-uk.0.0.html|title=Fuel cell technology|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graftechaet.com/getattachment/065811d2-720e-40c6-b236-0440c4d90d76/OFCC-Forklift-Case-Study.aspx|title=Creating Innovative Graphite Solutions for Over 125 Years|work=GrafTech International|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206072419/http://www.graftechaet.com/getattachment/065811d2-720e-40c6-b236-0440c4d90d76/OFCC-Forklift-Case-Study.aspx|archive-date=6 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockets===
Many large [[rocket]]s use [[liquid hydrogen]] as fuel, with [[liquid oxygen]] as an oxidizer (LH2/LOX). An advantage of hydrogen rocket fuel is the high [[effective exhaust velocity]] compared to [[kerosene]]/[[LOX]] or [[UDMH]]/[[Nitrogen tetroxide|NTO]] engines. According to the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]], a rocket with higher exhaust velocity uses less propellant to accelerate. Also the [[energy density]] of hydrogen is greater than any other fuel.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;College of the Desert, “Module 1, Hydrogen Properties”, Revision 0, December 2001 [http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/03/f12/fcm01r0.pdf Hydrogen Properties]. Retrieved 2015-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; LH2/LOX also yields the greatest efficiency in relation to the amount of propellant consumed, of any known rocket propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/hydrogen/hydrogen_fuel_of_choice.html|title=NASA - Liquid Hydrogen--the Fuel of Choice for Space Exploration|author=|date=|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disadvantage of LH2/LOX engines is the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen, which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed. This increases the rocket's structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly.  Another disadvantage is the poor storability of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due to the constant hydrogen boil-off, the rocket must be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for [[ICBM]]s and other rocket applications with the need for short launch preparations.

Overall, the delta-v of a hydrogen stage is typically not much different from that of a dense fuelled stage, but the weight of a hydrogen stage is much less, which makes it particularly effective for upper stages, since they are carried by the lower stages. For first stages, dense fuelled rockets in studies may show a small advantage, due to the smaller vehicle size and lower air drag.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, George P. and Oscar Biblarz. [http://web.mit.edu/e_peters/Public/Rockets/Rocket_Propulsion_Elements.pdf ''Rocket Propulsion Elements''], Seventh edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons (2001), p. 257, {{ISBN|0-471-32642-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LH2/LOX were also used in the [[Space Shuttle]] to run the fuel cells that power the electrical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/hydrogen/fc_shuttle.html |title=Fuel cell use in the Space Shuttle |publisher=NASA |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproduct of the fuel cell is water, which is used for drinking and other applications that require water in space.

==Internal combustion vehicle==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ford Motor Company]] --&gt;
{{Main|Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle|List of hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles}}
Hydrogen internal combustion engine cars are different from hydrogen fuel cell cars. The [[Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle|hydrogen internal combustion car]] is a slightly modified version of the traditional gasoline [[internal combustion engine]] car. These hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do; the main difference is the exhaust product. Gasoline combustion results in [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapour|water vapor]], while the only exhaust product of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.

In 1807 [[Francois Isaac de Rivaz]] designed [[De Rivaz engine|the first hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h2cars.de/1_cardata/c214.htm|title=H2Mobility - Hydrogen Vehicles - netinform|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Roger Billings]], then a high school student, converted a [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]] to run on hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/index.php/1807-1986 "Hydrogen Fuel Cars 1807–1986"], Hydrogen Cars Now, accessed April 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Paul Dieges patented a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline-powered engine to run on hydrogen {{Cite patent|US|3844262}}.

===Production===
{{Details|Hydrogen production}}
The molecular hydrogen needed as an onboard fuel for hydrogen vehicles can be obtained through many thermochemical methods utilizing [[natural gas]], [[coal]] (by a process known as coal gasification), [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[biomass]] ([[biomass gasification]]), by a process called [[thermolysis]], or as a microbial waste product called [[biohydrogen]] or [[biological hydrogen production (Algae)|Biological hydrogen production]]. 95% of hydrogen is produced using natural gas,&lt;ref name=Stupendous&gt;Suplee, Curt. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/16/AR2009111602668.html "Don't bet on a hydrogen car anytime soon"]. ''Washington Post'', November 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and 85% of hydrogen produced is used to remove sulfur from gasoline. Hydrogen can also be produced from [[water]] by [[electrolysis]] at working efficiencies in the 50–60% range for the smaller electrolysers and around 65–70% for the larger plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hyweb.de/Knowledge/w-i-energiew-eng3.html#3.4 |title= Chapter 3: Production of Hydrogen.

===Storage===
{{Details|Hydrogen storage}}
[[Image:Blue diamond compressed hydrogen.jpg|thumb|upright|Compressed hydrogen storage mark]]
Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484_Fuel_cell_electric_vehicles_and_hydrogen_infrastructure_status_2012?ev=prf_pub|last1=Eberle|first1=Ulrich|first2=Bernd|last2=Mueller|first3=Rittmar|last3=von Helmolt|publisher=[[Energy &amp; Environmental Science]] |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen has a very low volumetric energy [[density]] at ambient conditions, equal to about one-third that of methane. Even when the fuel is stored as [[liquid hydrogen]] in a [[cryogenic]] tank or in a [[compressed hydrogen]] [[hydrogen tank|storage tank]], the volumetric energy density (megajoules per liter) is small relative to that of gasoline.&lt;ref name=lanz/&gt;&lt;ref name=zubrin121/&gt;&lt;ref name=olah155/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSC2/&gt; Hydrogen has three times higher [[specific energy]] by [[mass]] compared to gasoline (143 MJ/kg versus 46.9 MJ/kg).

===US initiatives===
In 2003, [[George W.

Under heavy criticism, the funding was partially restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/cars/obama-kills-hydrogen-car-funding.html|title=Obama Kills Hydrogen Car Funding|author=|date=|website=treehugger.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/05/08/obama-doe-slash-hydrogen-fuel-cell-funding-in-new-budget|title=Obama, DOE slash hydrogen fuel cell funding in new budget|author=|date=|website=autoblog.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Obama administration announced they want to speed up production and development of hydrogen powered vehicles.  The Department of Energy planned to spread a $7.2 million investment among the states of Georgia, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee to support projects that fuel vehicles and support power systems. The Center for Transportation and The Environment, Fed Ex Express, Air Products and Chemicals, and Sprint have invested in the development of fuel cells. Fuel cells could also be used in handling equipment such as forklifts as well as telecommunications infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/green-tech/fuel-cells/obama-administration-wants-to-speed-up-hydrogenpowered-vehicles|title=Obama Administration Wants to Speed Up Hydrogen-Powered Vehicles|author=Ken Silverstein|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byron L. Dorgan|Senator Byron L. Dorgan]] stated in 2013: “The Energy and Water Appropriations bill makes investments in our nation’s efforts to develop safe, homegrown energy sources that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil. And, because ongoing research and development is necessary to develop game-changing technologies, this bill also restores funding for Hydrogen energy research”. In June 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy gave 9 million dollars in grants to speed up technology development, 4.5 million for advanced fuel cell membranes, $3 million to 3M corporation to work on membranes with improved durability and performance, and 1.5 million to the Colorado School of Mines for work on simpler and more affordable fuel cell membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://green.autoblog.com/2013/08/07/doe-funds-more-hydrogen-fuel-cell-research-with-4-5m-investment/|title=DOE funds more hydrogen fuel cell research with $4.5m investment| author=Jon LeSage|work=Autoblog|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of hydrogen vehicles are presented in the 2006 documentary, ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]''.  According to former [[U.S. Department of Energy]] official [[Joseph Romm]], "A hydrogen car is one of the least efficient, most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases." Asked when hydrogen cars will be broadly available, Romm replied: "Not in our lifetime, and very possibly never."&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/robert_boyd/story/16179.html |title=Hydrogen cars may be a long time coming |last=Boyd |first=Robert S. |date=May 15, 2007 |work= |publisher=McClatchy Newspapers |accessdate=9 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501193814/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/robert_boyd/story/16179.html |archivedate=1 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote, in 2009, "Hydrogen fuel-cell technology won't work in cars. ...

''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, in 2008, quoted [[Robert Zubrin]], the author of ''[[Energy Victory]]'', as saying: "Hydrogen is 'just about the worst possible vehicle fuel'".&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;Wrigglesworth, Phil.

The revised mandate allows manufacturers to comply with the rules by building more battery-electric cars instead of fuel-cell vehicles."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; The magazine also noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam reformation, which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of today's gasoline cars. On the other hand, if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, "it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

A 2009 study at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], published in the ''Journal of Power Sources'', similarly found that, over their lifetimes, hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.&lt;ref name=UCDavis&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/cars-lifestyle/hydrogen-cars-lifecycle-emits-more-carbon-than-gas-cars-study-says/ "Hydrogen Cars' Lifecycle Emits More Carbon Than Gas Cars, Study Says",] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106211628/http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/cars-lifestyle/hydrogen-cars-lifecycle-emits-more-carbon-than-gas-cars-study-says/ |date=2010-01-06 }} ''[[Digital Trends]]'', January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with a 2014 analysis.&lt;ref name=Cox2014/&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' asked in 2009, "[W]hy would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries"?&lt;ref name=Stupendous/&gt;  ''[[The Motley Fool]]'' stated in 2013 that "there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles [for hydrogen cars] relating to transportation, storage, and, most importantly, production."&lt;ref&gt;Chatsko, Maxx.

Volkswagen's Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that "no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity." He elaborated: "Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy", but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen "with low efficiencies" where "you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy". You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. "And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss". Krebs continued: "in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent."&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, Sebastian.

If that energy does not come from renewable sources, then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem. ... Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure. Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before [[FCEV]]s [fuel cell electric vehicles] become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are "still very, very expensive".&lt;ref name=Davies1&gt;Davies, Alex.

Considering all the obstacles and requirements for new infrastructure (estimated to cost as much as $400 billion), fuel-cell vehicles seem likely to be a niche technology at best, with little impact on U.S. oil consumption.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The US Department of Energy agrees, for fuel produced by grid electricity via electrolysis, but not for most other pathways for generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/emissions_hydrogen.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Emissions| website=www.afdc.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne National Laboratory developed a model of these emission pathways, to communicate the impact of potential fuel cell vehicle advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=M|date=November 2, 2002|title=Fuel Choices for Fuel-Cell Vehicles: Well-to-Wheels Energy and Emission Impacts|url=https://greet.es.anl.gov/publication-vmuujx18|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=112|pages=307–321|doi=10.1016/s0378-7753(02)00447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Michael Barnard, writing in ''[[Forbes]]'', listed the continuing disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell cars and concluded that "by about 2008, it was very clear that hydrogen was and would be inferior to battery technology as a storage of energy for vehicles. [B]y 2025 the last hold-outs should likely be retiring their fuel cell dreams."&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Michael.

==Comparison with other types of alternative fuel vehicle==
{{main|alternative fuel vehicle}}

Hydrogen vehicles compete with various proposed alternatives to the modern [[fossil fuel]] powered vehicle infrastructure.&lt;ref name=RSC2/&gt;

===Plug-in hybrids===
{{update|section|date=November 2013|No content is presented about series production PHEVs launched starting with the [[BYD F3DM]] and the [[Chevrolet Volt]]. Figures presented do not reflect current technology available.}}
{{Main|plug-in hybrid}}
[[Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s, or PHEVs, are [[hybrid vehicle]]s that can be plugged into the electric grid and contain an electric motor and also an [[internal combustion engine]]. The PHEV concept augments standard [[hybrid electric vehicles]] with the ability to recharge their batteries from an external source, enabling increased use of the vehicle's electric motors while reducing their reliance on internal combustion engines. The infrastructure required to charge PHEVs is already in place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnl.gov/news/release.asp?id=204 |title=US government news release |publisher=Pnl.gov |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transmission of power from grid to car is about 93% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerwatch.org.uk/energy/graham.asp |title=Domestic Energy use in the UK |publisher=Powerwatch |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not the only energy loss in transferring power from grid to wheels. AC/DC conversion must take place from the grids AC supply to the PHEV's DC. This is roughly 98% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cr4.globalspec.com/blogentry/434/Transformer-Efficiency-Standards-Proposed |title=CR4 - Blog Entry: Transformer Efficiency Standards Proposed |publisher=Google.co.uk |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery then must be charged. As of 2007, the [[Lithium iron phosphate battery]] was between 80-90% efficient in charging/discharging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginhighway.ca/PHEV2007/proceedings/PluginHwy_PHEV2007_PaperReviewed_Valoen.pdf |title=Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle 2007 Conference - Home |publisher= |accessdate=30 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326150713/http://www.pluginhighway.ca/PHEV2007/proceedings/PluginHwy_PHEV2007_PaperReviewed_Valoen.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery needs to be cooled; the GM Volt's battery has four coolers and two radiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stewart |first=Ben |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4257460.html |title=Chevy Volt Plug-in Car Batteries Ready for 2010 - GM Technical Center |publisher=Popular Mechanics |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604044820/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4257460.html |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, "the total well-to-wheels efficiency with which a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might utilize renewable electricity is roughly 20% (although that number could rise to 25% or a little higher with the kind of multiple technology breakthroughs required to enable a hydrogen economy). The well-to-wheels efficiency of charging an onboard battery and then discharging it to run an electric motor in a PHEV or EV, however, is 80% (and could be higher in the future)—four times more efficient than current hydrogen fuel cell vehicle pathways."&lt;ref name=EnergyCollective/&gt;  A 2006 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' argued that PHEVs, rather than hydrogen vehicles, would become standard in the automobile industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph J. Romm|Romm, Joseph]] and Prof. [[Andrew A. Frank]]. [http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/329.html "Hybrid Vehicles Gain Traction", ''Scientific American'' (April 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginpartners.org |title=Plug-in Hybrid Advocacy Group |publisher=Pluginpartners.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A December 2009 study at UC Davis found that, over their lifetimes, PHEVs will emit less carbon than current vehicles, while hydrogen cars will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.&lt;ref name=UCDavis/&gt;

===Natural gas===
{{Main|natural gas vehicle}}
[[Internal combustion engine]]-based [[compressed natural gas]](CNG), [[HCNG]] or [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] vehicles ([[Natural gas vehicle]]s or NGVs) use methane ([[Natural gas]] or [[Biogas]]) directly as a fuel source. Natural gas has a higher [[energy density]] than hydrogen gas. NGVs using biogas are nearly [[carbon neutral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/ncer/p3/press/04_22_07.html|title=Car Fueled With Biogas From Cow Manure: WWU Students Convert Methane Into Natural Gas|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike hydrogen vehicles, CNG vehicles have been available for many years, and there is sufficient infrastructure to provide both commercial and home refueling stations. Worldwide, there were 14.8 million natural gas vehicles by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngvjournal.dreamhosters.com/en/statistics/item/911-worldwide-ngv-statistics |title=Worldwide NGV Statistics |publisher=NGV Journal |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220030004/http://www.ngvjournal.dreamhosters.com/en/statistics/item/911-worldwide-ngv-statistics |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other use for natural gas is in [[steam reforming]] which is the common way to produce hydrogen gas for use in electric cars with fuel cells.

===All-electric vehicles===
{{main|electric car}}
A 2008 ''Technology Review'' article stated, "Electric cars—and plug-in hybrid cars—have an enormous advantage over hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in utilizing low-carbon electricity.  That is because of the inherent inefficiency of the entire hydrogen fueling process, from generating the hydrogen with that electricity to transporting this diffuse gas long distances, getting the hydrogen in the car, and then running it through a fuel cell—all for the purpose of converting the hydrogen back into electricity to drive the same exact electric motor you'll find in an electric car."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/guest/22087/ "The Last Car You Would Ever Buy – Literally: Why we shouldn't get excited by the latest hydrogen cars"], ''Technology Review'', June 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Thermodynamically, each additional step in the conversion process decreases the overall efficiency of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency of Hydrogen PEFC, Diesel-SOFC-Hybrid and Battery Electric Vehicles |date=15 July 2003 |url=http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021051748/http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cta.ornl.gov/data/index.shtml |title=Information from |publisher=cta.ornl.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 comparison of hydrogen and [[battery electric vehicle]]s agreed with the 25% figure from Ulf Bossel in 2006 and stated that the cost of an [[electric vehicle battery]] "is rapidly coming down, and the gap will widen further", while there is little "existing infrastructure to transport, store and deliver hydrogen to vehicles and would cost billions of dollars to put into place, everyone's household power sockets are "electric vehicle refueling" station and the "cost of electricity (depending on the source) is at least 75% cheaper than hydrogen."&lt;ref&gt;Dansie, Mark. [http://revolution-green.com/hydrogen-vs-electric/ "Hydrogen vs Electric"], revolution-green.com, July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18264|title=Transitions to Alternative Vehicles and Fuels - The National Academies Press|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOE stated that even under optimistic conditions by 2030 the price for the battery is not expected to go below $17,000 ($200–$250/kWh) on 300 miles of range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/16/toyotas-hydrogen-vs-teslas-batteries-which-car-wil.aspx|title=Toyota’s Hydrogen vs. Tesla’s Batteries: Which Car Will Win?|author=Katie Spence|date=16 November 2013|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Matthew Mench, from the [[University of Tennessee]] stated: "If we are sitting around waiting for a battery breakthrough that will give us four times the range than we have now, we are going to be waiting for a long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-auto-show-fuel-cell-20131117,0,3678128.story?page=2#axzz2lGKcgiZs|title=L.A. Auto Show: Will fuel cells make battery electric cars obsolete?|author=Los Angeles Times|date=18 November 2013|work=latimes.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navigant Research, (formerly Pike research), on the other hand, forecasts that “lithium-ion costs, which are tipping the scales at about $500 per kilowatt hour now, could fall to $300 by 2015 and to $180 by 2020.”&lt;ref&gt;King, Danny. [http://green.autoblog.com/2013/11/08/li-ion-battery-prices-headed--down-180-kwh/ “Li-ion battery prices still headed way, way down, to $180/kWh by 2020”], ‘’AutoblogGreen’’, November 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Takeshi Uchiyamada, a designer of the [[Toyota Prius]] stated: "Because of its shortcomings – driving range, cost and recharging time – the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/04/us-autos-electric-hydrogen-idUSBRE91304Z20130204|title=Insight: Electric cars head toward another dead end|work=Reuters|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[electric car]] designs offer limited driving range causing [[range anxiety]]. For example, the 2013 [[Nissan Leaf]] has a range of {{Convert|75|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2013-nissan-leaf-gets-fuel-econom-range-improvement-says-epa.html "2013 Nissan Leaf Gets Fuel Economy, Range Improvement, Says EPA"], Edmunds.com, May 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the 2014 [[Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive]] has an estimated range of {{Convert|115|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Jablansky, Jeffrey.

European Environment Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''The New York Times'' stated that there are only 10 publicly accessible hydrogen-filling stations in the U.S., eight of which are in Southern California, and that BEVs' cost-per-mile expense in 2013 is one-third as much as hydrogen cars when comparing electricity from the grid and hydrogen at a filling station. The ''Times'' commented: "By the time Toyota sells its first fuel-cell sedan, there will be about half-million plug-in vehicles on the road in the United States – and tens of thousands of E.V. charging stations."&lt;ref name=Berman2013/&gt; In 2013 John Swanton of the [[California Air Resources Board]], who sees them as complementary technologies, stated that EVs have the jump on fuel-cell autos, which "are like electric vehicles were 10 years ago. EVs are for real consumers, no strings attached. With EVs you have a lot of infrastructure in place.&lt;ref&gt;Scauzillo, Steve. [http://www.trentonian.com/lifestyle/20131123/la-auto-show-drives-new-green-car-market "L.A. Auto Show drives new green-car market"], ''The Trentonian'', November 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Business Insider]]'', in 2013 commented that if the energy to produce hydrogen "does not come from renewable sources, then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem. ... Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before FCEVs become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are "still very, very expensive", even compared to battery-powered EVs.&lt;ref name=Davies1/&gt;

{{SikhBeliefs}}
{{Five Evils}}
'''Kaam'''  (from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[kama]]'') meaning deep extensive desire, uncontrolled longing, concupiscence, sensuality or lasciviousness is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities in [[Sikhism]].{{CN|date=September 2018}}  In common usage, the term stands for ''excessive passion for [[sexual pleasure]]'' and it is in this sense that it is considered to be an evil in Sikhism.{{CN|date=September 2018}}

In Sikhism it is believed that Kaam can be overcome by being satisfied with the current moment. All 5 thieves can be overcome with [[selfless service]] and remembrance of God ([[Simran]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Majupuria|first=Trilok|title=Religions in Nepal: With Reference to Religions of Tibet and India|year=2004|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sevartham, Volume 31|publisher=St. Albert's College|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sikh Guru teachings ==
The [[Gurus]] rejected lust. Yet they recognized the four ''purusarthas'', referred to in [[gurbani]] as char ''[[Padarath]]s'' or the four human pursuits as the Granth Sahib declares "''[[Dharma]], [[Artha]], Kam and [[Moksha]] follow God's devotee like shadow''" (SGGS 1320).  However, in Sikhism, Kam is not unrestricted gratification of carnal desires, but an impulse which needs to be kept under check like other impulses and passions.  Unrestrained propensity towards Kam, especially sexual relationship outside the marital bond, is condemned in the strongest terms in [[Sikh]] codes of conduct as well as in the Scripture.  It is a destructive evil and a deadly sin. Kam is heavily discouraged as it "''can build barriers against God in their lives''".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote [[Guru Arjan]], Nanak V: "O Kam, thou landest people in hell and makest them wander through many births, enticest all minds, swayest all the three worlds and undoest one's meditation, austerities and restraint. The pleasure is ephemeral and thou afflictest high and low alike" (GG, 1358).  [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] Nanak IX, says:  "In the sinning heart reigns kam and the fickle mind breaks out of control.  Kam casts its noose even upon yogis, jangams and sannyasis.  Only those imbued with God's Name (fall not a prey to it) and are able to go across the ocean of existence" (GG, 1186).  [[Bhai Gurdas]] describes an ideal [[Sikh]] as one who is loyal to his wife and "regards all other women as mothers, sisters and daughters" (Varan, XXIX. 11). [[Guru Gobind Singh]] also said: "Love your own wedded wife ever so more, but do not go to another woman's bed even in a dream."  [[Sikh]] codes of conduct strictly prohibit extramarital relations.

While prescribing self-control and restraint and not total annihilation of kam, the [[Gurus]] suggested two ways of channelizing and sublimating it. On the one hand, they pronounced grihastha or married life to be the ideal one, and, on the other laid down love of God and absorption in His Name as the essential principle of spiritual discipline. Says [[Guru Gobind Singh]] "Hear ye all, I proclaim here the truth: only they who love God find Him." The image of a devotee most common in [[Sikh Scripture]] is one of a wife deeply in love with her husband presently separated from him, and waiting, craving, praying for a reunion with him. Such fervent devotion cannot but bridle the wayward passion in man.  According to [[Guru Arjan]], a person who has cultivated the love of the Lord’s feet would desire neither kingship, worldly power, or even mukti or liberation (GG 534).

{{Saivism}}
'''Kaula''', also known as '''Kula''', '''{{IPA|Kulamārga}}''' ("the Kula practice") and '''{{IPA|Kaulācāra}}''' ("the Kaula conduct"), is a religious tradition in [[Shaktism]] and [[tantra|tantric]] [[Shaivism]] characterised by distinctive rituals and symbolism connected with the worship of [[Shakti]]. It flourished in India primarily in the first millennium AD.

Kaula preserves some of the distinctive features of the [[Kāpālika]] tradition, from which it is derived.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/sanderson_2014_the_saiva_literature_jist_kyoto_(1).pdf "The Śaiva Literature."] Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 &amp; 25 (2012–2013), 2014, pp.4-5, 11, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; It is subdivided into four subcategories  of texts based on the goddesses Kuleśvarī, Kubjikā, [[Kālī]] and [[Tripura Sundari|Tripurasundarī]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/sanderson_2014_the_saiva_literature_jist_kyoto_(1).pdf "The Śaiva Literature."] Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 &amp; 25 (2012–2013), 2014, pp. 57-65.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Trika]] texts are closely related to the Kuleśvarī texts and can be considered as part of the Kulamārga.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/sanderson_2014_the_saiva_literature_jist_kyoto_(1).pdf "The Śaiva Literature."] Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 &amp; 25 (2012–2013), 2014, pp. 59-60, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later [[Hatha Yoga]], the Kaula visualization of Kuṇḍalini rising through a system of [[chakra]]s is overlaid onto the earlier [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]-oriented system.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;[[James Mallinson (author)|Mallinson, James]] (2011). [https://www.academia.edu/1317005/Ha_ha_Yoga ''Hatha Yoga''] Brill Encyclopedia of Hinduism Vol. 3 (pp. 770-781). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|770, 774}}

==''Kaula'' and ''Kula''==

The translation of the term ''Kula'' in English is considered difficult and has raised some problems for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The basic meaning is "family", "group" or "self-contained unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by Flood as referring to the retinues of minor goddesses depicted in the schools' literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophically the term is said to represent a unifying connectedness, beneath the various objects, processes and living entities of this world, which may be identified with these goddesses as aspects of the supreme deity, in some regions the god Shiva, elsewhere a goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Another meaning sometimes given to the term ''kaula'' is that of a "group of people" engaged together in the practice of spiritual discipline.

Kaula practices are based on [[tantra]], closely related to the siddha tradition and shaktism. Kaula sects are noted for their extreme exponents who recommend the flouting of taboos and social mores as a means of liberation. Such practices were often later toned down to appeal to ordinary householders, as in [[Kaśmir Śaivism|Kaśmiri Śaivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental concepts==
The concepts of purity, sacrifice, freedom, the spiritual master (''guru'') and ''the heart'' are core concepts of the Kaula tradition.

===Purity and impurity===
{{quote|In this sacrifice, the wise man should use the very ingredient which is forbidden in the series of scriptures. It is immersed in the nectar-of-the-left. ([[Tantrāloka]])&lt;ref&gt;Tantrāloka, Chapter 29, śl. 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Actions or objects are not seen impure in themselves, rather the attitude is the determinant factor. Spiritual ignorance is the only impurity and knowledge is pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; As long as one is identified with the supreme consciousness, there is nothing impure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The adept is unaffected by any external impurity&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; and makes use of what is reprehensible to attain transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Here arises the antinomian and asocial character of Kaula and the left-handed forms of Tantra.

===Sacrifice===
{{main article|Sacrifice}}
''Kaula'' sacrifice (''[[yajna]]'') is defined primarily as an inward act. Any action performed with the purpose of evoking the supreme reality is said to be sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; However, if sacrifice were performed only interiorly, there would be a lack of externality and therefore limitation and dualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; That is why ''Kaula'' adepts also perform symbolic external sacrifices making use of a sacred place and various rituals.

There are six main types of sacrifice according to the "six supports"; external reality, the couple, the body, the central channel of the subtle breath ([[susumna]]), the mind and ''Shakti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom===
''Kaula'' stresses the language of self-sufficiency, liberation and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Socially the ''Kaula'' may be viewed as an alternative society, complete in itself, which supports the freedom of the devotee from interior mental and egotistic limitations and from exterior social and cultural preconceptions.

At a social level deconditioning is realized by detaching from traditional restrictions with regard to what is considered pure and impure and through the adoption of the spiritual family of the guru. At the mental level freedom is attained by the awakening of ''Kundalini'' through ''[[asana]]'', ''[[pranayama]]'', ''[[mudra]]'' or ''[[mantras]]'', the amplification and sublimation of the vital and mental energy and the elevation of consciousness. The culmination of this process is spiritual illumination.

Absolute freedom is to be found only in the revelation of the unity of the spirit with God, a state described as ''Atma-vyapti'' or re-absorption into the true Self (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') or ''Shiva-vyapti'': re-absorption into the supreme consciousness of ''Shiva''.&lt;ref&gt;Kundalini, the Energy of the Depths, Lilian Silburn&lt;/ref&gt; To be free is to be absolved from the necessity of [[reincarnation|rebirth]] conditioned by [[Karma|karmic]] restraints. Consciousness expands into the so-called [[The 36 tattvas#Śuddha tattvas|pure reality]], a level that is considered to exist beyond time and space, where the powers of knowledge and action are unfettered, there are no conditioning desires or needs to be fulfilled and bliss is directly present in consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lakshmanjoo|1988}}, p. 3, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kaula's'' basic method is the experience of the freedom of consciousness&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; in the heart, ultimately reflected in the center of the being as ''Kechari Mudra''. This mudra (attitude) means "the ability of consciousness to freely move (''charati'') about in the space (''kha'') of the heart".&lt;ref&gt;Khe carati iti kechar[ii], {{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The disciple learns to recognize Śiva as the ultimate reality. The practices pertaining to consciousness are explained in such texts as ''Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra'', ''Spanda Kārikās'' and ''Śiva Sūtras''.

Kashmiri Shaivism describes freedom as ''svātantrya'' - the freedom to create, maintain and destroy the universe pertaining to Śiva himself. It is considered that Śiva, above any restriction or conditioning, creates the universe of his free will as a playful expression of his spirit ([[lila (Hinduism)|lila]]). Here the kaulas are unlike [[Advaita]] and [[Veda]], where there is the conception that [[maya (illusion)|maya]] (cosmic illusion) is superimposed upon the [[brahman]] (absolute), inducing a sort of illusory creation. Here, creation is considered real, and the will to create is considered free and unfettered. ''Svatantrya'' is identical to [[Ananda]] (bliss) and ''vimarśa'' (reflexive consciousness/auto-consciousness).

===Guru===
{{main article|Guru}}
"Guru is the path" (''{{IAST|gurur upāyaḥ}}'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta|Śiva Sutras]] of Vasugupta, Cap II, Verse 5&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from the most revered sacred text of Kashmir Shaivism, the ''Śiva Sutras'', summarizes the school's conception of the guru-disciple relationship. ''Kaula'' functions as a form of [[guru yoga]], where the disciple's only essential practice is to surrender himself to his guru, accepting the spiritual impulse bestowed upon him by his master. Disciples eminently open towards their guru's spiritual influence are named ''spiritual sons'' and held to know the highest state of consciousness&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; by their direct link to their guru's illuminated heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The guru is considered to form a single Self (atman) with his disciples. As such, he leads the disciples to the discovery of their own ''Atman'' with his own consciousness, exalted into the supreme state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Like fire kindled from a candle to another candle, the revelation of the self is passed from master to disciple directly, not through words or exterior practices, but mediated by the direct transfer of ''śakti''.&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Heart===
[[Aham (Kashmir Shaivism)|Aham]], the heart or "subjective I", is a central concept in ''Kaula'' ideology, conceived of as the most sacred reality, home of consciousness (''Cit'') and bliss (''Ananda''), place of union of the cosmic couple Shiva and [[Shakti]]. The term ''Aham'' refers to the same reality as other terms like ''anuttara'' (unsurpassed), ''Akula'' (beyond the group), ''Shiva'' (The Lord), ''Cit'' (supreme consciousness) as well as "feminine" aspects as Ananda and ''Shakti''. Each term brings a specific viewpoint, but none of them can fully describe the Supreme Reality.

On the individual level, the heart is the binding force of all conscious experiences&amp;nbsp;– the individual being is considered a ''Kula'' composed of eight elements: five senses, ego (''ahamkar''), the mind and the intellect. These eight are not disconnected, unrelated processes but rather a unified, interrelated family ("kaula") based on consciousness as the common substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kaula'' prescribes practices that reintegrate the eight "rays" of the soul into the supreme consciousness.

On the cosmic level, the "Heart of the Lord" (''aham'') is the substrate of the family of [[The 36 tattvas|36 elements]] forming all manifestation. The concept of "Spiritual Heart" is so important that even the supreme realization in Kashmir Shaivism is described in relation to it. The so-called ''Kechari Mudra'' is an attitude described as "the ability of consciousness to freely move (''charati'') about in the space (''kha'') of the heart".&lt;ref&gt;Khe carati iti kechar[ii], {{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; ("kha"+"charati" forming "kechari")

==Practices==
Similarly to other [[tantra|tantric]] schools, ''Kaula'' chooses a positive (affirmative) approach: instead of prescribing self-limitations and condemning various actions, it embraces such actions in a spiritual light.&lt;ref&gt;Touched By Fire, The Ongoing Journey Of A Spiritual Seeker, Pandit Rajmani Tigunait, Pandit Rajmani Tigunait, Ph.D., Rajmani Tigunait, page 188&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sexuality, love, social life and artistic pursuits are considered vectors of spiritual evolution. The main focus in ''Kaula'' is on practical methods for attaining [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; rather than engaging in complex philosophical debate. Whatever is pleasant and positive can be integrated in its practice.

The principal means employed in the ''Kaula'' practice are the spiritual family, the practice of initiation rituals, the couple (sexual rituals such as [[maithuna]]), the body (spiritual alchemy inside one's own body), the energy (shakti) (controlled especially through the use of mantras and mystical phonemes) and the consciousness (seen as the epitome of one's whole being and of the universe itself).&lt;ref&gt;Kundalini, Energy of the depths, p177-178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p.s 58, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of development is linked to the attainment of a state of [[non-duality]] described as an "absorption into the spiritual heart", ''[[nirvikalpa samadhi]]'' or experiencing the "[[Prakasa|uncreated light]]" of consciousness (''prakāśa'')&lt;ref&gt;The Cultural Heritage of India, {{IAST|Haridāsa Bhaṭṭācāryya}}, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Page 521&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tantra: The Supreme Understanding: Discourses on the Tantric Way of Tilopa's, Osho, Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; (read [[Prakasa#Subjective experiences of prakāśa|a number of subjective accounts]] of this experience).

===Group practice===
Group practices, which are restricted to the members of a ''kaula'' (family),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; include rituals, festivities, initiations and the secretive tantric sexual union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The purposes of this practice are the initiation of novices, the expansion of consciousness&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and expression of the bliss already attained as participants become more and more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The key to the effectiveness of group practice is held to reside in the harmony of minds and hearts of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;Luce dei Tantra: Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, translation by Raniero Gnoli&lt;/ref&gt; When a compatible spiritual group is created, it can greatly accelerate the spiritual evolution of its members. [[Abhinavagupta]] declares that such a group can enter a state of oneness and universal consciousness without effort.&lt;ref&gt;Tantraloka by Abhinavagupta Cap28.v373–v380&lt;/ref&gt; He explains this by the notion of reflection (''pratibimba''), a process of unification, an effortless overflow of spiritual energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between a ''Kaula's'' parts is realized through mutual reflection. Reflection (''pratibimba'') is used here in the sense of "containing an image of the other objects inside", a concept similar to that of the hologram. The number of possible interactions and reflections between the members of a ''Kaula'' is much larger than the number of elements it contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lakshmanjoo|1988}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmir Shaivism declares that each part is in fact ''Akula'' (Shiva) in essence;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; thus there is a connection between the parts through their common ''Akula'' substrate. As each part contains ''Akula'', in its essence, it automatically contains everything,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; this is how the mutual reflection is said to be realized.

Almost half of the Tantraloka is dedicated to rituals, usually evoking the union of complementary sets such as man and woman, a faculty and its object or inhalation and exhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of ritual may involve the construction of a [[mandala]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; visualization of a goddess or group of goddesses (''Śakti''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; recitation ([[japa]]), performed in a state of "rest inside the creative awareness" (''camatkāra''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; oblation into fire and its internalized version&amp;nbsp;– the burning of the objects and means of knowledge into the "fire" of non-dual consciousness (''parāmarśa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of a ritual lies in its repetition. A pure disciple will attain the supreme state even by simply staying for a short time in presence of a guru without any instruction, but less prepared ones need reinforcement and gradual accumulation.

===Physical practices===
''Kaula'' puts a special emphasis on the physical body in spiritual practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; "as a vessel of the Supreme" and, as such, not an obstacle tortured in ascetic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated submergence into the state of non-duality is supposed to induce secondary effects on the physical body due to the activity of the spiritual energy (''śakti'') and may be called [[Alchemy in history#Indian alchemy|tantric body alchemy]] (see [[internal alchemy]]). Starting from the expanded consciousness of the self (''atman''), the body (and in the end, the exterior reality too) is infused with the experience of non-duality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-dual, experienced initially only in consciousness, is extended to the whole body. The ''kaula'' adept will discover ''kaulika''&amp;nbsp;– the power (''[[siddhi]]'') of identification with the Universal Consciousness experienced in the physical body,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; generated spontaneously, without any effort (formal meditation, postures&amp;nbsp;– ''asana'', concentration ''[[Dharana]]'' and other forms of exertion in yoga).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; This process is described as the descent of the energy of the non-dual consciousness into the physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Then consciousness manifests as a free force, entering the senses and producing extroverted ''[[samādhi]]''. At this point, consciousness, mind, senses and physical body are "dissolved" into oneness, expanded into the spiritual light of consciousness.

As a consequence, any perception of the exterior reality becomes nondual. It becomes possible to live submerged in a continuous state of union with Shiva even while performing regular day-to-day activities. This form of extroverted, all inclusive ''samādhi'' is the pinnacle of spiritual evolution, ''bhairavi mudra'', ''jagadananda'' or ''bhava samadhi''. The yogi experiences everything as pure light and ecstasy (''cit-ananda'') and does not feel any difference between interior and exterior any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yamala – the tantric couple====
Abhinavagupta: "The couple (''yamala'') is consciousness itself, the unifying emission and the stable abode. It is the absolute, the noble cosmic bliss consisting of both Shiva and Shakti. It is the supreme secret of ''Kula''; neither quiescent nor emergent, it is the flowing font of both quiescence and emergence." (Tantraloka)&lt;ref&gt;Tantraloka by Abhinavagupta Cap. 29 Verse. 116-117a&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexual practices of the ''Kaula'' schools, also known as "the secret ritual", are performed with a so-called "external Shakti" (sexual partner)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the purely meditative practices which involve only one's own spiritual energies (the "interior Shakti"). The role of the sexual ''Kaula'' ritual is to unite the couple, [[yogini]] (initiated woman) and siddha (initiated man), and induce one in the other a state of permanent awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Kundalini, energy of the depths, Lilian Silburn, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; This achievement is made possible by the intensity of their love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In their exalted state, the two become absorbed into the consciousness of the Self. Becoming united on all the levels, physical, astral, mental and even in their consciousness, they reconstitute the supreme couple of Shiva and Shakti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kaula'' sacrifice is reserved for the few, the elite who can maintain a state of ''Bhairava'' (spiritual illumination) in sexual union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Other couples, even if they reproduce the ritual to the letter (as perceived from outside), if they do not attain ''Bhairava'' consciousness, are merely engaging in a sexual act.

"Initiation by the mouth of the yogini (''yoginī-vaktra'')", is a method by which the adept unites with a purified ''yoginī'' and receives the unique experience of the illuminated consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; He is to see her as both his lover and guru.

The energy generated during the tantric sexual act is considered a form of "subtle emission", while the act of ejaculation is considered a form of physical emission.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sexual sublimation]], [[Ojas]] and [[Visarga]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Kashmir Shaivism, the energy of emission (''visarga śakti'') is considered to be a form of ''ānanda'' (bliss).

Depending on the orientation of one's consciousness, introverted or extroverted, emission can be of two kinds: rested and risen. In ''Śānta'', the rested form of emission, focus is absorbed just on one's own Self in an act of transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Udita'', the risen form, the focus is projected on the Self (''atman'') of one's lover&amp;nbsp;– a state associated with immanence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

''Santodita'' (beyond ''udita'' and ''śānta'') is the uniting form, cause of both ''śānta'' and ''udita'' emissions. ''Santodita'' is described as universal bliss (''cidānanda''), undivided consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 261,263&lt;/ref&gt; ''kaula'' (the group of two as one)&lt;ref&gt;Kundalini, energy of the depths, Lilian Silburn, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; and an "outflow of the pulsation of Shiva and Shakti".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of translation from the physical act to the mental and to consciousness itself is a characteristic of the tantric world view.

===Mantra practice===
Mantric meditation is the most common form of tantric practice. In the ''Kaula'' system, this practice is associated especially with the group of [[phoneme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The 50 phonemes (''varṇa'') of the [[Sanskrit]] alphabet are used as "seed" mantras denoting various aspects of consciousness (''cit'') and energy (''śakti''). The group (''kula'') of Sanskrit phonemes form a complete description of reality, from the lowest ("earth") to the highest (Śiva consciousness) level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual "setting out" of the phonemes imitates the emanation of the cosmos from the supreme I-consciousness of Śiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In another ritual, the phonemes are identified with specific zones of the body through the practice of ''nyāsa'', infusing the body with spiritual energy. This mystical state of culminates in the ''kaula'' of the body (perfection of the ensemble of organs, senses and mind) and such a being is known as a siddha (accomplished one).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The adept attains a form of bodily enlightenment where, through the power of mantras, he comes to recognize the divinities within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiation into mantric practice is based on a transfer of power and the link (lineage) of the heart. The word or phoneme is not useful in itself, as it does not have efficiency unless the disciple received his initiation from an authentic master.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dupuche|2003}}, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of the term==
While the manifest reality is described as ''Kula'' (a variant form of the term ''Kaula''), the unifying factor, the Deity, is termed ''Akula''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; "A" means "beyond", or "non", thus "Akula" is "beyond kula". As the substrate of all manifestation is ''Akula'', such is also the basis of any ''Kula''. So ''Kula'' families are united by a common substrate, the transcendent ''Akula''.

In every one of its instances, on various levels of the universe, ''Kula'' is a contraction (''saṃkoca'') of totality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; thus in each ''Kula'' there is a contracted form of the universe, a contracted form of Shiva (''Akula'') himself. Such an affirmation has been popularized under slogans like "Consciousness is Everything" in some recent Kashmir Shaivism related publications for the public.&lt;ref&gt;The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism, Consciousness is Everything, [[Swami Shankarananda (Shiva Yoga)|Swami Shankarananda]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often at the highest level of reality Shiva and Shakti form the supreme couple, or the ultimate ''Kula'' (family).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pandit|2003}}, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Shiva, under various names (''anuttara'' - absolute, ''prakāśa'' - uncreated light, ''cit'' - supreme consciousness, ''Akula'' - beyond the groups of manifestation) and ''Shakti'', under a similar plethora or names (''Vimarsa'' - reflection in consciousness, ''Visarga'' - creative energy that emits the Universe, ''Kundalini'' - fundamental energy of the body, ''spanda'' - atemporal vibration, ''Kauliki'' - that which is "sprung" in ''Kula''). The two are always in indissoluble union in a perfect state of bliss. Ultimately there is no difference between Shiva and Shakti, they are different aspects of the same reality. The supreme "family" by definition spans both manifestation and transcendence.

In Kashmir Shaivism, Supreme Consciousness (''Cit'', identical to ''Akula'') is considered to be the substrate of manifestation. Consciousness is the ultimate principle, the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]] of the universe, always present as substrate in every external object, be it gross (physical), subtle (mental) or subtlest (relating to the causal body or soul). Thus external world, body, mind and soul are considered kindred parts of the whole, concretisation of the supreme ''consciousness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 5, 31&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, ''Kula'' is the totality of manifestation, in gross, subtle and supreme form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Even if ''Cit'' is not directly involved in the process of manifestation (as it is said to be unmanifest),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; it is always present in every possible facet of manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, it is said to be the substantial cause of manifestation (manifestation is made of ''Cit'', "like pots are made of clay") and also the efficient cause ("like the potter is the efficient cause in the activity of creating pots").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muller-Ortega|1989}}, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related concept is ''Kaulika'', the binding force of the ''Kula''. The term literally means "sprung in ''Kula''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kaulika'' is another name for ''Shakti'', the spiritual energy. ''Shakti'', as described in Kashmir Shaivism, does a paradoxical thing&amp;nbsp;– she creates the universe, with all its diversity and at the same time remains identical to ''Shiva'', the absolute transcendent. Thus, ''Kaulika'' is an energy both of spirit and matter. Bridging the two, ''Kaulika'' creates the path of evolution for consciousness from ego to spirit.

The manifestation of ''Kaulika'' proceeds from the absolute (''anuttara'') in the process of cosmic creation (''mahasristi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2005}}, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''Kaulika'' should not be seen as mere energy, or just the link between matter and spirit, but also identical to the absolute. Even if she is the dynamic aspect of the absolute, she does not rank lower than Shiva, her divine consort.

==Texts==

'''Kashmiri School of Kaula'''

While Kaula is primarily an oral tradition and does not place a high value on the creation of texts, there are some texts associated with the tradition. Muller-Ortega, following Pandey, summarizes the literature of the Kashmiri school as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Muller-Ortega (1989), pp. 57-58&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''Kleene algebra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|eɪ|n|i}} {{respell|KLAY|nee}}; named after [[Stephen Cole Kleene]]) is an idempotent (and thus partially ordered) [[semiring]] endowed with a [[closure operator]].&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Pouly|author2=Jürg Kohlas|title=Generic Inference: A Unifying Theory for Automated Reasoning|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01086-0|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generalizes the operations known from [[regular expression]]s.

== Definition ==

Various inequivalent definitions of Kleene algebras and related structures have been given in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey, see: {{cite book | zbl=0732.03047 | last=Kozen | first=Dexter | chapter=On Kleene algebras and closed semirings | title=Mathematical foundations of computer science, Proc. 15th Symp., MFCS '90, Banská Bystrica/Czech. 1990 | series=Lecture Notes Computer Science | volume=452 | pages=26–47 | year=1990 | authorlink=Dexter Kozen | editor1-last=Rovan | editor1-first=Branislav | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/6971/1/90-1131.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we will give the definition that seems to be the most common nowadays.

A Kleene algebra is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' together with two [[binary operation]]s + : ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'' → ''A'' and · : ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'' → ''A'' and one function &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; : ''A'' → ''A'', written as ''a'' + ''b'', ''ab'' and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, so that the following axioms are satisfied.
* [[Associativity]] of + and ·: ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' and ''a''(''bc'') = (''ab'')''c'' for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''A''.
* [[Commutativity]] of +: ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A''
* [[Distributivity]]: ''a''(''b'' + ''c'') = (''ab'') + (''ac'') and (''b'' + ''c'')''a'' = (''ba'') + (''ca'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''A''
* [[Identity element]]s for + and ·: There exists an element 0 in ''A'' such that for all ''a'' in ''A'': ''a'' + 0 = 0 + ''a'' = ''a''. There exists an element 1 in ''A'' such that for all ''a'' in ''A'': ''a''1 = 1''a'' = ''a''.
* [[absorbing element|Annihilation]] by 0: ''a''0 = 0''a'' = 0 for all ''a'' in ''A''.
The above axioms define a [[semiring]]. We further require:
* + is [[idempotent]]: ''a'' + ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''.
It is now possible to define a [[partial order]] ≤ on ''A'' by setting ''a'' ≤ ''b'' [[if and only if]] ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' (or equivalently: ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists an ''x'' in ''A'' such that ''a'' + ''x'' = ''b''; with any definition, ''a'' ≤ ''b'' ≤ ''a'' implies ''a'' = ''b''). With this order we can formulate the last four axioms about the operation &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;:
* 1 + ''a''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) ≤ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;  for all ''a'' in ''A''.
* 1 + (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''a'' ≤ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;  for all ''a'' in ''A''.
* if ''a'' and ''x'' are in ''A'' such that ''ax'' ≤ ''x'', then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' ≤ ''x''
* if ''a'' and ''x'' are in ''A'' such that ''xa'' ≤ ''x'', then ''x''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) ≤ ''x'' &lt;ref&gt;Kozen (1990), sect.2.1, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitively, one should think of ''a'' + ''b'' as the "union" or the "least upper bound" of ''a'' and ''b'' and of ''ab'' as some multiplication which is [[Monotonic function#Monotonicity in order theory|monotonic]], in the sense that ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''ax'' ≤ ''bx''. The idea behind the star operator is ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + ''a'' + ''aa'' + ''aaa'' + ... From the standpoint of [[programming language theory]], one may also interpret + as "choice", · as "sequencing" and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; as "iteration".

|}
Let Σ be a finite set (an "alphabet") and let ''A'' be the set of all [[Regular expression#Formal language theory|regular expression]]s over Σ. We consider two such regular expressions equal if they describe the same [[formal language|language]]. Then ''A'' forms a Kleene algebra. In fact, this is a [[free object|free]] Kleene algebra in the sense that any equation among regular expressions follows from the Kleene algebra axioms and is therefore valid in every Kleene algebra.

Again let Σ be an alphabet. Let ''A'' be the set of all [[regular language]]s over Σ (or the set of all [[context-free language]]s over Σ; or the set of all [[recursive language]]s over Σ; or the set of ''all'' languages over Σ). Then the [[union (set theory)|union]] (written as +) and the [[concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] (written as ·) of two elements of ''A'' again belong to ''A'', and so does the [[Kleene star]] operation applied to any element of ''A''. We obtain a Kleene algebra ''A'' with 0 being the [[empty set]] and 1 being the set that only contains the [[empty string]].

Let ''M'' be a [[monoid]] with identity element ''e'' and let ''A'' be the set of all [[subset]]s of ''M''. For two such subsets ''S'' and ''T'', let ''S'' + ''T'' be the union of ''S'' and ''T'' and set ''ST'' = {''st'' : ''s'' in ''S'' and ''t'' in ''T''}. ''S''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as the submonoid of ''M'' generated by ''S'', which can be described as {''e''} ∪ ''S'' ∪ ''SS'' ∪ ''SSS'' ∪ ... Then ''A'' forms a Kleene algebra with 0 being the empty set and 1 being {''e''}. An analogous construction can be performed for any small [[category theory|category]].

The [[linear subspace]]s of a unital [[algebra over a field]] form a Kleene algebra.  Given linear subspaces ''V'' and ''W'', define ''V'' + ''W'' to be the sum of the two subspaces, and 0 to be the trivial subspace {0}.  Define ''V'' · ''W'' = span {v · w | v ∈ V, w ∈ W}, the [[linear span]] of the product of vectors from ''V'' and ''W'' respectively.  Define 1 = span {I}, the span of the unit of the algebra.  The closure of ''V'' is the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of all powers of ''V''.

:&lt;math&gt;V^{*} = \bigoplus_{i = 0}^{\infty} V^{i}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose ''M'' is a set and ''A'' is the set of all [[binary relation]]s on ''M''. Taking + to be the union, · to be the composition and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to be the [[reflexive transitive closure]], we obtain a Kleene algebra.

Every [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] with operations &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; turns into a Kleene algebra if we use &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; for +, &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; for · and set ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 for all ''a''.

A quite different Kleene algebra can be used to implement the [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], computing the [[shortest path problem|shortest path's length]] for every two vertices  of a [[graph theory|weighted directed graph]], by [[Kleene's algorithm]], computing a regular expression for every two states of a [[deterministic finite automaton]].
Using the [[extended real number line]], take ''a'' + ''b'' to be the minimum of ''a'' and ''b'' and ''ab'' to be the ordinary sum of ''a'' and ''b'' (with the sum of +∞ and −∞ being defined as +∞). ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is defined to be the real number zero for nonnegative ''a'' and −∞ for negative ''a''. This is a Kleene algebra with zero element +∞ and one element the real number zero. 
A weighted directed graph can then be considered as a deterministic finite automaton, with each transition labelled by its weight.
For any two graph nodes (automaton states), the regular expressions computed from Kleene's algorithm evaluates, in this particular Kleene algebra, to the shortest path length between the nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Handbook of Graph Theory|series=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications|first1=Jonathan L.|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKkIGIea_BkC&amp;pg=PA65|isbn=9780203490204}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

Zero is the smallest element: 0 ≤ ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''.

The sum ''a'' + ''b'' is the [[least upper bound]] of ''a'' and ''b'': we have ''a'' ≤ ''a'' + ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''a'' + ''b'' and if ''x'' is an element of ''A'' with ''a'' ≤ ''x'' and ''b'' ≤ ''x'', then ''a'' + ''b'' ≤ ''x''. Similarly, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the least upper bound of the elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Multiplication and addition are monotonic: if ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then 
* ''a'' + ''x'' ≤ ''b'' + ''x'', 
* ''ax'' ≤ ''bx'', and 
* ''xa'' ≤ ''xb'' 
for all ''x'' in ''A''.

Regarding the star operation, we have 
* 0&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 and 1&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, 
* ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (monotonicity),
* ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; for every natural number ''n'', where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as ''n''-fold multiplication of ''a'',
* (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,
* (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, 
* 1 + ''a''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''a'', 
* ''ax'' = ''xb'' implies (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''x'' = ''x''(''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;),
* ((''ab'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''a'' = ''a''((''ba'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;),
* (''a''+''b'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;))&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and
* ''pq'' = 1 = ''qp'' implies ''q''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''p'' = (''qap'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Kozen (1990), sect.2.1.2, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''A'' is a Kleene algebra and ''n'' is a natural number, then one can consider the set M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') consisting of all ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries in ''A''.
Using the ordinary notions of matrix addition and multiplication, one can define a unique &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-operation so that M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') becomes a Kleene algebra.

== History ==

Kleene introduced regular expressions and gave some of their algebraic laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport| author=S.C. Kleene| title=Representation of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automata|date=Dec 1951| number=RM-704| pages=98| institution=U.S. Air Force / RAND Corporation| url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM704.pdf}} Here: sect.7.2, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kleene, Stephen C.| title=Representation of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automata| journal=Automata Studies, Annals of Mathematical Studies| year=1956| volume=34| publisher=Princeton Univ. Press| url=http://www.dlsi.ua.es/~mlf/nnafmc/papers/kleene56representation.pdf}} Here: sect.7.2, p.26-27&lt;/ref&gt;
Although he didn't define Kleene algebras, he asked for a decision procedure for equivalence of regular expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene (1956), p.35&lt;/ref&gt;
Redko proved that no finite set of ''equational'' axioms can characterize the algebra of regular languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=V.N. Redko| url=http://umj.imath.kiev.ua/archiv/1964/01/umj_1964_01_10002_20139.pdf | title=On defining relations for the algebra of regular events| journal={{ill|Ukrainskii Matematicheskii Zhurnal|uk|Український математичний журнал}} | year=1964| volume=16| number=1 | pages=120–126}} (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;
Salomaa gave complete axiomatizations of this algebra, however depending on problematic inference rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=[[Arto Salomaa]]| title=Two complete axiom systems for the algebra of regular events| journal=J. Assoc. Comput. Mach|date=Jan 1966| volume=13| number=1| pages=158–169| url=http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/ansatte/henglein/papers/salomaa1966.pdf| doi=10.1145/321312.321326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The problem of providing a complete set of axioms, which would allow derivation of all equations among regular expressions, was intensively studied by [[John Horton Conway]] under the name of ''regular algebras'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J.H. | last=Conway | authorlink=John Horton Conway | title=Regular algebra and finite machines | publisher=Chapman and Hall | year=1971 | isbn=0-412-10620-5 | zbl=0231.94041 | location=London }}  Chap.IV.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the bulk of his treatment was infinitary.
In 1981, [[Dexter Kozen|Kozen]] gave a complete infinitary equational deductive system for the algebra of regular languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dexter Kozen| chapter=On induction vs. &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-continuity| title=Proc.

Sci.| url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/indvsstarcont.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1994, he gave the [[#Definition|above]] finite axiom system, which uses unconditional and conditional equalities,&lt;ref&gt;considering ''a''≤''b'' as an abbreviation for ''a''+''b''=''b''&lt;/ref&gt; and is equationally complete for the algebra of regular languages, that is, two regular expressions ''a'' and ''b'' denote the same language only if ''a''=''b'' follows from the [[#Definition|above]] axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dexter Kozen| title=A Completeness Theorem for Kleene Algebras and the Algebra of Regular Events| journal=Information and Computation|date=May 1994| volume=110| number=2| pages=366–390| url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/ka.pdf| doi=10.1006/inco.1994.1037}} &amp;mdash; An earlier version appeared as: {{cite techreport| author=Dexter Kozen| title=A Completeness Theorem for Kleene Algebras and the Algebra of Regular Events|date=May 1990| number=TR90-1123| pages=27| institution=Cornell| url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/6963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalization (or relation to other structures) ==
Kleene algebras are a particular case of [[closed semiring]]s, also called [[quasi-regular semiring]]s or [[Lehmann semiring]]s, which are semirings in which every element has at least one quasi-inverse satisfying the equation: a* = aa* + 1 = a*a + 1. This quasi-inverse is not necessarily unique.&lt;ref name="Golan2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan S. Golan|title=Semirings and Affine Equations over Them|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jw4Hmgz5ETQC&amp;pg=PA157|date=30 June 2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-1358-4|pages=157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012b"/&gt; In a Kleene algebra, a* is the least solution to the [[fixpoint]] equations: X = aX + 1 and X = Xa + 1.&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012b"/&gt;

Closed semirings and Kleene algebras appear in [[algebraic path problem]]s, a generalization of the [[shortest path]] problem.&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Pouly|author2=Jürg Kohlas|title=Generic Inference: A Unifying Theory for Automated Reasoning|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01086-0|pages=232 and 248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[law]] of [[South America]] is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the [[law of Brazil]] suggest a move towards the ''[[stare decisis]]'' doctrine. Moreover, all countries have recently signed up to the [[Union of South American Nations]] agreement, which aims to establish a system of supra-national law along the lines of the [[European Union]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">'''Moves management''' is a term used primarily with the [[non-profit sector]] in relationship to [[donor development]]. It refers to the process by which a prospective [[Donation|donor]] is moved from cultivation to solicitation. “Moves” are the actions an organization takes to bring in donors, establish relationships, and renew contributions. David Dunlop, the [[Cornell University]] senior development officer who developed the concept of moves management, described the idea as “changing people’s attitudes so they want to give.”&lt;ref name="Avectra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Orankashaw/the-new-model-of-moves-management-for-effective-fundraising|title=The New Model of Moves Management for Effective Fundraising}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
An organization implementing moves management should have a system of policies, procedures, and practices that direct the actions of the organization towards bringing in donors, forging relationships, and generating major gifts. These systems should be focused on donors, rather than donations. They should also emphasize documenting the relationship between the donor and the organization.&lt;ref name="ProsperFundraising"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosperfundraising.com/pdf/moves_management.pdf|title=Moves Management: The Science of Fundraising}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Major Gifts: Moves Management Made Easy
"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/NonprofitWebinars/major-gifts-moves-management-made-easy|title=Major Gifts: Moves Management Made Easy
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Tracked==
Moves management requires a baseline of [[personally identifiable information]] for each donor. Because moves management attempts to leverage personal relationships with donors, an organization should be tracking the following:

*Donor's biographical information
*Donor's actions
*Donor's interests
*Donor's relationships
*Donor's giving history

Using this data and any other additional information in your information tracking system is the foundation for enhancing donor communication and improving solicitation strategies under the moves management philosophy.

==Social Data==
Moves management’s heavy focus on donor relationships has led to social data transforming the way organizations are able to interact with donors. Organizations have primarily begun incorporating social data into their moves management strategies in two ways: prospecting and engagement.

===Prospecting Uses===
The donor prospecting phase has been enhanced through the ability of [[Customer_relationship_management#Non-profit_and_membership-based|constituent relationship management]] (CRM) technology to import social data. This data also helps inform solicitation strategies, pipeline management, and overall outreach execution for the entire organization.

===Engagement Uses===
Donor engagement has benefitted from the use of social data by providing [[Fundraising#Professional_fundraisers|development officers]] with additional methods of communication. The variety of ways that social media is disseminated has created. CRM software is commonly used to parse the large quantities of social data to turn it into something that is actionable for development officers who are reaching out and nurturing donor relationships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1585">In the [[history of ideas]] the '''New Learning''' in Europe is the [[Renaissance humanism]], developed in the later fifteenth century. Newly retrieved classical texts sparked [[philology|philological]] study of a refined and classical Latin style in prose and poetry. 

The term came to refer to other trends, one being the new formulation of the relationship between the [[Christian Church|Church]] and the individual arising from the [[Protestant Revolution]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}} Contemporaries noticed this: [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] lamented "It was merry in England afore the new learning came up", in relation to reading the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Sessions, ''Henry Howard, the Poet Earl of Surrey: A Life'' (1999), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier 'new learning' had a similar cause, two centuries earlier. In that case it was new texts of [[Aristotle]] that were discovered, with a major impact on [[scholasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy: From the Rediscovery of Aristotle to the Disintegration of Scholasticism, 1100-1600'' (1988), p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; A later phase of the New Learning of the Renaissance concerned the beginnings of modern scientific thought. Here [[Francis Bacon]] is pointed to as an important reference point and catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Appleby, ''Knowledge and Postmodernism in Historical Perspective'' (1996), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Jnana Yoga]] '''Nididhyasana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: निदिध्यासन) is profound and repeated meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=nididhyAsana&amp;link=m}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[mahavakyas]], great Upanishadic statements such as "That art Thou", to realize the identity of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. It is the fourth step in the training of a [[Guru-shishya tradition|sisya]] (disciple), consisting of preparatory practives, listening to the teachings as contained in the [[sruti]], [[Manana (reflection)|reflection]] on the teachings, and nididhyasana.

==Four stages of practice==
Nididhyasana is the final step in the correct understanding of the meaning of the [[Mahavakyas]]. Classical [[Advaita Vedanta]] emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain [[moksha]]. It consists of four stages:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=251-254}}&lt;ref group=web name=AdvaitaYogaAshrama /&gt;
* '''Samanyasa''' or ''Sampatti''s,&lt;ref&gt;Adi Shankara, ''Tattva bodha'' (1.2)&lt;/ref&gt; the "fourfold discipline" (''sādhana-catustaya''), cultivating the following four qualities:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=251-254}}&lt;ref group=web name=AdvaitaYogaAshrama&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoga108.org/pages/show/55 |title=Advaita Yoga Ashrama, '&amp;#39;Jnana Yoga.

** '''''{{IAST|Nityānitya vastu viveka}}''''' (नित्यानित्य वस्तु विवेकम्) — The ability (viveka) to correctly discriminate between the eternal (''nitya'') substance (''[[Brahman]]'') and the substance that is transitory existence (''anitya'').
** '''''{{IAST|Ihāmutrārtha phala bhoga virāga}}''''' (इहाऽमुत्रार्थ फल भोगविरागम्) — The renunciation (''virāga'') of enjoyments of objects (''artha phala bhoga'') in this world (''iha'') and the other worlds (''amutra'') like heaven etc.
** '''''{{IAST|Śamādi ṣatka sampatti}}''''' (शमादि षट्क सम्पत्ति) — the sixfold qualities,
*** ''Śama'' (control of the {{IAST|antahkaraṇa}}).&lt;ref group=web &gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mimi.hu/yoga/antahkarana.html |title=Antahkarana- Yoga (definition) |publisher=En.mimi.hu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** ''Dama'' (the control of external sense organs).
*** ''[[Uparati]]'' (the cessation of these external organs so restrained, from the pursuit of objects other than that, or it may mean the abandonment of the prescribed works according to scriptural injunctions).{{refn|group=note|''nivartitānāmeteṣāṁ tadvyatiriktaviṣayebhya uparamaṇamuparatirathavā vihitānāṁ karmaṇāṁ vidhinā parityāgaḥ''[Vedāntasāra, 21]}}
*** ''[[Titiksha|Titikṣa]]'' (the tolerating of {{IAST|[[tāpatraya]]}}).
*** ''[[Śraddhā]]'' (the faith in [[Guru]] and [[Vedas]]).
***''[[Samadhana|Samādhāna]]'' (the concentrating of the mind on God and Guru).
** '''''{{IAST|Mumukṣutva}}''''' (मुमुक्षुत्वम्) — The firm conviction that the nature of the world is misery and the intense longing for ''moksha'' (''release from the cycle of births and deaths'').
* '''Sravana''', listening to the teachings of the sages on the [[Upanishads]] and Advaita Vedanta, and studying the Vedantic texts, such as the [[Brahma Sutras]]. In this stage the student learns about the reality of [[Brahman]] and the identity of atman;
* '''Manana''', the stage of [[Manana (reflection)|reflection on the teachings]];
* '''Nididhyāsana''', the stage of meditation on the truth "that art Thou".&lt;ref group=web name=AdvaitaYogaAshrama /&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100234232 Oxford Index, ''nididhyāsana'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Nididhyasana is a rational and cognitive process, which differs from [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] (meditation). It is necessary for gaining ''Brahmajnana'':{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=108}}
{{quote|आत्मा ब्रह्मेति वाक्यार्थे निःशेषेण विचारिते &lt;br&gt;By a thorough analysis of "Atman is Brahman" the direct knowledge "I am Brahman" is achieved ([[Panchadasi]] VII.58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|author=Swami Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=256|url= https://www.amazon.in/Pancadasi-Swami-Vidyaranya/dp/8171205070}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nididhyasana done independently of ''[[Listening|sravana]]'' does not lead to the realization of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanisads, Vol.3|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|pages=314–317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

===Advaita Vedanta===
[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (II.iv.5) defines Nididhyasana as the meditation for the sake of direct vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of the Vedanta: A Critical account of the Advaita Tradition|author=Swami Satchidanandendra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=372|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMkbWhjE2M4C&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Yajnavalkya]] tells his wife –

:आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यो मैत्रेयि, 
:आत्मनो व अरे दर्शनेन श्रवणेन मत्या विज्ञानेनेदं सर्वं विदितम् ||

:"The Self, my dear [[Maitreyi]], should be realized – should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon; 
:by the realization of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known." -  ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] St.II.iv.5)

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains Nididhyasana as meditation with determination. Sankara states:-

:श्रुतेः शतगुणं विद्यान्मननं मननादपि |
:निदिध्यासं लक्षगुणम् अनन्तं निर्विकल्पकम् ||

:"Reflection (manana) is hundred times superior to listening (sravana); 
:meditation (nididhyasana) is hundred times superior to reflection; nirvikalpaka samadhi is infinitely superior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=365|quote=Verse 365|url= https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sri-Samkaras-Vivekacudamni-S-Bhagavatpada/dp/8172764200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Suresvara]], Nididhyasana is the culmination of the practice of ''[[Listening|sravana]]'' and ''[[manan]]a'', which is an indirect intuition of [[Brahman]] and does not mean meditation but knowledge ([[vijñāna|vijnana]]) i.e. understanding the meaning of the [[Śruti|Sruti]] on the basis of ''vacya-vacaka'' relation underlying the [[Mahāvākyas|mahavakya]]. Suresvara states:-

:शास्त्रचार्यानुभवनैर्हेतुभिश्च समर्थितः|
:ईदृगैकात्म्यसंबोधो निदिध्यासनमुच्यते ||

:"Nididhyasana is so called when, instruction about the uniqueness of the Atman is justified 
:by (proper) reasons viz. the Sruti, (the instructions of) teachers and (one’s own) experience (of the same)."

Nididhyasana consists in acquisition of ''vakyarthajnana'' and this verse explains the purport of ''sunisnata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s vartika on Madhu Brahmana (Brhadaranyaka-Upanishad)|author=Suresvaracarya|publisher=Motilal Banarsi Dass|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9wiepM1y2EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vacaspati]], ''sravana'', ''manana'' and ''nidihyasana'' are a chain of causes contributory to the knowledge of the oneness of Brahman. The Vivarna school considers ''sravana'' as the principal cause but Suresvara treats ''sravana'' and ''manana'' to be co-existent, these two culminate into ''nididhyasana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s Vartika on Yajnavalkya’s Maitreyi Dialogue|author=Shoun Hino|publisher=Motilal Banarsi Dass|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvcrBnKaIgEC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dvaita Vedanta===
According to [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] the knowledge acquired by study ('sravana') and stabilized by reflection ('manana') is made the basis of steady contemplation ('nididhyasana'); these are the three stages of inquiry that take the form of ''Dhyana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Sri Madhvacarya|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=408|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8XVE0_TiLMC&amp;pg=PA380&amp;dq=nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9erVUvv1D6S27QbIuYCYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] has defined Nididhyasana as "the process by which intellectual conscience is transformed into a vital one there is stillness, a calm in which the soul lays itself open to the Divine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seeker’s Path|author=Sohan Singh|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5lMmeNKn68C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9erVUvv1D6S27QbIuYCYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Vedanta===
According to Michael James, who gives an Advaita Vedanta interpretation of Ramana Maharshi, Ramana's [[self-enquiry]] is the same as Nididhyasana and ''atma-vichara''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.in/2008/06/self-enquiry-underlying-philosophy-can.html Michael James, ''Self-enquiry: the underlying philosophy can be clearly understood only by putting it into practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24461">'''Nudge''' is a concept in [[behavioral science]], [[political theory]] and [[behavioral economics]] which proposes [[positive reinforcement]] and indirect suggestions as ways to [[Social influence|influence]] the behavior and [[decision making]] of groups or individuals. Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as [[education]], [[legislation]] or [[enforcement]]. The concept has influenced British and American politicians. Several nudge units exist around the world at the national level (UK, Germany, Japan and others) as well as at the international level (e.g. [[OECD]], [[World Bank]], [[United Nations|UN]]).

==Definition of a nudge==
[[File:Nudge_Toilet_1.jpg|thumb|Example of a nudge: a housefly painted onto the ceramic of a [[urinal]] in a men's public toilet]]
The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in [[cybernetics]] by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as "the art of the nudge" (sometimes referred to as micronudges&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Wilk, J. | year=1999 | chapter=Mind, nature and the emerging science of change: An introduction to metamorphology. | editor1=G. Cornelis|editor2=S. Smets|editor3=J. Van Bendegem | title=EINSTEIN MEETS MAGRITTE: An Interdisciplinary Reflection on Science, Nature, Art, Human Action and Society: Metadebates on science | volume=6 | pages=71–87 | publisher=Springer Netherlands | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2245-2_6| isbn=978-90-481-5242-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical [[psychotherapy]] tracing back to [[Gregory Bateson]], including contributions from [[Milton Erickson]], [[Paul Watzlawick|Watzlawick]], [[John Weakland|Weakland]] and Fisch, and [[Bill O'Hanlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=O'Hanlon, B.|author2=Wilk, J. | year=1987 | title=Shifting contexts : The generation of effective psychotherapy. | publisher=New York, N.Y.: Guilford Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this variant, the nudge is a microtargetted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention.

In 2008, [[Richard Thaler]] and [[Cass Sunstein]]'s book ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' brought nudge theory to prominence. It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.shponline.co.uk/features-content/full/cpd-article-nudge-nudge-think-think Dr. Jennifer Lunt and Malcolm Staves]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors refer to influencing behaviour without coercion as [[libertarian paternalism]] and the influencers as choice architects.&lt;ref name=speak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lucidez.pe/economia/richard-thaler-y-el-auge-de-la-economia-conductual-por-marco-carrasco/|title=Richard Thaler y el auge de la Economía Conductual|last=Carrasco-Villanueva|first=Marco|date=2017-10-18|language=es|work=Lucidez|access-date=2018-10-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as:

{{quote|''A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the [[choice architecture]] that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not.''}}

In this form, drawing on [[behavioral economics]], the nudge is more generally applied to influence behaviour.

One of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men's room [[Urinal|urinals]] at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which is intended to "improve the aim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A nudge makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way, by altering the environment so that automatic cognitive processes are triggered to favour the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual’s behaviour is not always in alignment with their intentions (termed a [[value-action gap]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common knowledge that humans are not fully rational beings; that is, people will often do something that is not in their own self interest, even when they are aware that their actions are not in their best interest.&lt;ref name="Kosters"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosters|first1=M|last2=Van der Heijden|first2=J|title=From mechanism to virtue: evaluating nudge theory|journal=Evaluation|date=2015|volume=21|issue=3|page=276–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, when hungry, dieters often under-estimate their ability to lose weight, and their intentions to eat healthy can be temporarily weakened until they are satiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordgren|first1=L.|last2=Van der Pligt|first2=J.|last3=van Harreveld|first3=F.|title=The instability of health cognitions: visceral states influence self-efficacy and related health beliefs|journal=Health Psychology|date=2008|volume=27|issue=6|page=722–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; describe two distinct systems for processing information as to why people sometimes act against their own self-interest: System 1 is fast, automatic, and highly susceptible to environmental influences; System 2 processing is slow, reflective, and takes into account explicit goals and intentions.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations are overly complex or overwhelming for an individual’s cognitive capacity, or when an individual is faced with time-constraints or other pressures, System 1 processing takes over decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; System 1 processing relies on various judgmental heuristics to make decisions, resulting in faster decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this can also lead to sub-optimal decisions. In fact, Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; trace maladaptive behaviour to situations in which System 1 processing over-rides an individual’s explicit values and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented that habitual behaviour is resistant to change without a disruption to the environmental cues that trigger that behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudging techniques aim to use judgmental heuristics to our advantage. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of nudges==
Nudges are small changes in environment that are easy and inexpensive to implement.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different techniques exist for nudging, including defaults, social proof heuristics, and increasing the salience of the desired option.

A default option is the option an individual automatically receives if he or she does nothing. People are more likely to choose a particular option if it is the default option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Pichert &amp; Katsikopoulos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pichert|first1=D.|last2=Katsikopoulos|first2=K.V.|title=Green defaults: information presentation and pro-environmental behavior|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|date=2008|volume=28|page=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a greater number of consumers chose the [[renewable energy]] option for electricity when it was offered as the default option.

A social proof heuristic refers to the tendency for individuals to look at the behavior of other people to help guide their own behavior. Studies have found some success in using social proof heuristics to nudge individuals to make healthier food choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheung|first1=T.|last2=Kroese|first2=F.|last3=Fennis|first3=B.|last4=de Ridder|first4=D.|title=The hunger games: using hunger to promote healthy choices in self-control conflicts|journal=Appetite|date=2017|volume=116|page=401–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an individual’s attention is drawn towards a particular option, that option will become more salient to the individual, and he or she will be more likely to choose to that option.  As an example, in [[snack]] shops at train stations in the Netherlands, consumers purchased more fruit and [[healthy diet|healthy snack]] options when they were relocated next to the cash register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of theory==
In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]].&lt;ref name=speak&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favorite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|publisher=''[[The Spectator]]''|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British [[Behavioural Insights Team]] in 2010. It is often called the "Nudge Unit", at the British [[Cabinet Office]], headed by [[David Halpern (psychologist)|David Halpern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/behavioral-insights-team/about#responsibilities|title=About us - Behavioural Insights Team - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and President [[Barack Obama]] sought to employ nudge theory to advance [[domestic policy]] goals during their terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/first-obama-now-cameron-embraces-nudge-theory-2050127.html|title=First Obama, now Cameron embraces 'nudge theory'|date=12 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the government of New South Wales established a Behavioural Insights community of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au/|title=Behavioural Insights Unit - What's new in the Behavioural Insights Unit|first=corporateName=Department of Premier and Cabinet; address=1 Farrer Place, Sydney, NSW, 2000; contact=+61 2 9228|last=5555|website=bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudge theory has also been applied to [[business management]] and [[corporate culture]], such as in relation to [[Environment, health and safety|health, safety and environment]] (HSE) and human resources. Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a "zero accident culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rydermarsh.co.uk/pdfs/SHP.0112.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cast No Shadow|website=Rydermarsh.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leading [[Silicon Valley]] companies are forerunners in applying nudge theory in corporate setting. These companies are using nudges in various forms to increase productivity and happiness of employees. Recently, further companies are gaining interest in using what is called "nudge management" to improve the productivity of their white-collar workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Philip|last2=Freibichler|first2=Wolfgang|year=2017|title=Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity|journal=Journal of Organization Design|volume=6:4|pages=|doi=10.1186/s41469-017-0014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral insights and nudges are currently used in many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carrasco-Villanueva |first=Marco |editor=上海社会科学院 [Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences]|title=2016上海青年汉学家研修计划论文集|language=zh|publisher=中国社会科学出版社 [China Social Sciences Press]|date=2016 |pages=368–392 |chapter=中国的环境公共政策：一个行为经济学的选择 [Environmental Public Policies in China: An Opportunity for Behavioral Economics]|isbn=978-1-234-56789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Nudging has also been criticised. Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said: "We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behaviour changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his ''The Ethics of Influence''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TlvWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=ethics+of+influence+sunstein#v=onepage&amp;q=ethics%20of%20influence%20sunstein&amp;f=false|title=The Ethics of Influence: Government in the Age of Behavioral Science|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2016-08-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107140707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish [[autonomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Christian|date=2015-10-12|title=On the Ethics of Public Nudging: Autonomy and Agency|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2672970|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;, threaten [[dignity]], violate liberties, or reduce [[welfare]]. He further defended nudge theory in his ''Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Rx3qAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300212693|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by arguing that [[choice architecture]] is inevitable and that some form of paternalism cannot be avoided. Ethicists have debated nudge theory rigorously&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=Adrien|last2=Grüne-Yanoff|first2=Till|date=2015-09-01|title=From Libertarian Paternalism to Nudging—and Beyond|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=341–359|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0268-x|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These charges have been made by various participants in the debate from Bovens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preference Change|last=Bovens|first=Luc|date=2009|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789048125920|series=Theory and Decision Library|pages=207–219|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2593-7_10|chapter = The Ethics of Nudge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to Goodwin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Tom|date=2012-06-01|title=Why We Should Reject 'Nudge'|journal=Politics|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2012.01430.x|issn=0263-3957}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung question their scientific credibility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Karen|date=2012-01-01|title=Nudge as Fudge|journal=The Modern Law Review|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=122–148|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.2012.00893.x|issn=1468-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Public opinion on the ethicality of nudges has also been shown to be susceptible to “partisan nudge bias”.&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;[https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/tannenbaum_fox_rogers.2017.pdf Tannenbaum, D., Fox, C. R., &amp; Rogers, T. (2017). On the misplaced politics of behavioural policy interventions. Nature Human Behaviour , 1 (10 July 2017), 1-7.]&lt;/ref&gt; Research from David Tannenbaum, Craig R. Fox, and Todd Rogers (2017) found that adults and policymakers in the United States found behavioral policies to be more ethical when they aligned with their own political leanings.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; Conversely, people found these same mechanisms to be more unethical when they differed from their politics.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; The researchers also found that nudges are not inherently partisan: when evaluating behavioral policies absent of political cues, people across the political spectrum were alike in their assessments.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt;

Some, such as Hausman &amp; Welch&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hausman|first=Daniel M.|last2=Welch|first2=Brynn|date=2010-03-01|title=Debate: To Nudge or Not to Nudge*|journal=Journal of Political Philosophy|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=123–136|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00351.x|issn=1467-9760}}&lt;/ref&gt; have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive{{clarify|date=February 2018}}) justice; Lepenies &amp; Malecka &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepenies|first=Robert|last2=Małecka|first2=Magdalena|date=2015-09-01|title=The Institutional Consequences of Nudging – Nudges, Politics, and the Law|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=427–437|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0243-6|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of law. Similarly, legal scholars have discussed the role of nudges and the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alemanno|first=A.|last2=Spina|first2=A.|date=2014-04-01|title=Nudging legally: On the checks and balances of behavioral regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/12/2/429/710410/Nudging-legally-On-the-checks-and-balances-of|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=429–456|doi=10.1093/icon/mou033|issn=1474-2640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kemmerer|first=Alexandra|last2=Möllers|first2=Christoph|last3=Steinbeis|first3=Maximilian|last4=Wagner|first4=Gerhard|date=2016-07-15|title=Choice Architecture in Democracies: Exploring the Legitimacy of Nudging - Preface|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2810229|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still [[homo economicus]], despite the proponents' claim to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugden|first=Robert|date=2017-06-01|title=Do people really want to be nudged towards healthy lifestyles?|journal=International Review of Economics|language=en|volume=64|issue=2|pages=113–123|doi=10.1007/s12232-016-0264-1|issn=1865-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been remarked that nudging is also a [[euphemism]] for [[psychological manipulation]] as practiced in [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Sunstein_809.pdf|format=PDF|title=NUDGING AND CHOICE ARCHITECTURE: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS|author=Cass R.

There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei)&lt;ref&gt;MÉREI Ferenc (1987): A perem-helyzet egyik változata: a szociálpszichológiai kontúr (A variant of the edge-position: the contour socialpsychological); Pszichológia (1987), 1, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;, Laszlo Garai&lt;ref&gt;Garai L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">An '''organizing principle''' is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a [[conceptual framework]]. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.

== Examples ==

* In a [[The Brookings Institution|Brookings Institution]] article, [[James Steinberg]] describes how [[counter-terrorism]] has become the organizing principle of U.S. national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Perhaps the most commonly agreed-upon "overclass" consists of leaders in [[international business]], [[International finance|finance]] and the [[war industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[David Rothkopf|Rothkopf, David J.]] | title = Superclass: the global power elite and the world they are making | publisher = [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-374-27210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the actions by the overclass have been rigorously studied, particularly with regards to notions of intersections between the overclass and specific races.  Most notable of these racial overclasses is the [[NEWBO]], or NEW Black Overclass in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29413966/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/cnbc-special-report-new-black-overclass/ |title=CNBC Special Report: The New Black Overclass |last1=Hawkins |first1=Lee |date=February 26, 2009 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=[[NBCNews.com]] |access-date=September 7, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers compare it to the more familiar ''[[underclass]]'':

{{quote|We now have a quite new phenomenon in the history of the republic: two radically isolated sectors of the population, the underclass and the overclass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9207">A '''peremptory norm''' (also called '''''jus cogens''''' or '''''ius cogens''''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|dʒ|ʌ|s|_|ˈ|k|oʊ|dʒ|ɛ|n|z|,_|ˌ|j|ʌ|s}};&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jus+cogens&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "compelling law") is a fundamental principle of [[international law]] that is accepted by the international community of [[sovereign state|states]] as a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] from which no [[derogation]] is permitted.

There is no universal agreement regarding precisely which norms are ''jus cogens'' nor how a norm reaches that status, but it is generally accepted that ''jus cogens'' includes the prohibition of [[genocide]], maritime [[piracy]], enslaving in general (to include [[slavery]] as well as the [[slave trade]]), [[torture]], [[refoulement]] and [[war of aggression|wars of aggression and territorial aggrandizement]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Cherif Bassiouni. (Autumn 1996) "International Crimes: 'Jus Cogens' and 'Obligatio Erga Omnes'." ''Law and Contemporary Problems''. Vol. 59, No. 4, Pg. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship has also proposed the idea of regional ''jus cogens''.&lt;ref&gt;Hasmath, Reza (2012). "[https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1366803 The Utility of Regional Jus Cogens]", Paper Presented at American Political Science Association Annual Meeting (New Orleans, USA), August 30-September 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of peremptory norms under international law==
Unlike ordinary [[Customary international law|customary law]], which has traditionally required consent and allows the alteration of its obligations between states through [[treaty|treaties]], peremptory norms cannot be violated by any state "through international treaties or local or special customs or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force".&lt;ref&gt;Prosecutor v. Furundzija, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 2002, 121 ''International Law Reports'' 213 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions of the necessity of such norms could be traced as far as 1758 (Emmerich de Vattel, Droit des gens) and 1764 (Christian Wolff, Jus Gentium), clearly rooting from principles of [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;Władysław Czapliński. Jus Cogens and the Law of Treaties. In C. Tomuschat and J. M. Thouvenin (eds). 2006. The Fundamental Rules of the International Legal Order. Netherlands: Koninklijke Brill NV, pp. 83–98&lt;/ref&gt;

But it was the judgments of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] that indicate the existence of such a peremptory norm.  In the [http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_A/A_01/03_Wimbledon_Arret_08_1923.pdf Wimbledon Case] in 1923, not mentioning peremptory norms explicitly but stating how state sovereignty is not inalienable.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni. 2011. Crimes Against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 266, see also Wimbledon Case, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 53 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], any treaty that conflicts with a peremptory norm is void.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 53, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331, 8 ''International Legal Materials''  679 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty allows for the emergence of new peremptory norms,&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 64, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331, 8 ''International Legal Materials''  679 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; but does not specify any peremptory norms. It does mention the prohibition on the threat of use of force and on the use of coercion to conclude an agreement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of states as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character."&lt;ref&gt;U.N. Doc. A/CONF.39/27 (1969), repinted in 63 Am. J. Int'l L. 875 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of peremptory norms is considered limited but not exclusively catalogued. They are not listed or defined by any authoritative body, but arise out of case law and changing social and political attitudes. Generally included are prohibitions on waging [[War of aggression|aggressive war]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], maritime [[piracy]], [[genocide]], [[Crime of apartheid|apartheid]], [[slavery]], [[torture]]. As an example, international tribunals have held that it is impermissible for a state to acquire territory through war.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Bossuyt en Jan Wouters (2005): ''Grondlijnen van internationaal recht'', Intersentia, Antwerpen enz., p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"&gt;Prosecutor v. Furundžija, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 2002, 121 ''International Law Reports'' 213 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the seemingly clear weight of condemnation of such practices, some critics disagree with the division of international legal norms into a hierarchy. There is also disagreement over how such norms are recognized or established. The relatively new concept of peremptory norms seems to be at odds with the traditionally consensual nature of international law considered necessary to state [[sovereignty]].

Some peremptory norms define criminal offences considered to be enforceable against not only states but also individuals. That has been increasingly accepted since the [[Nuremberg Trials]] (the first enforcement in world history of international norms upon individuals) and now might be considered uncontroversial. However, the language of peremptory norms was not used in connection with these trials, rather the basis of criminalisation and punishment of Nazi atrocities, was that civilisation could not tolerate their being ignored because it could not survive their being repeated.

There are often disagreements over whether a particular case violates a peremptory norm. As in other areas of law, states generally reserve the right to interpret the concept for themselves.

Many large states have accepted this concept. Some of them have ratified the Vienna Convention, while others have stated in their official statements that they accept the Vienna Convention as "codificatory". Some have applied the concept in their dealings with international organizations and other states.

==Examples==

===Execution of juvenile offenders===
The case of ''[[Michael Domingues v. United States]]'' provides an example of an international body's opinion that a particular norm is of a ''jus cogens'' nature. Michael Domingues had been convicted and sentenced to death in [[Nevada]], United States for two murders committed when he was 16 years old. Domingues brought the case in front of the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]] which delivered a non-legally binding report.&lt;ref name="The Michael Domingues Case 2001"&gt;The Michael Domingues Case: Argument of the United States, Office of the Legal Adviser, United States Department of State, ''Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2001'', pp. 303, 310–13&lt;/ref&gt; The United States argued that there was no ''jus cogens'' norm that "establishes eighteen years as the minimum age at which an offender can receive a sentence of death".&lt;ref name="The Michael Domingues Case 2001"/&gt; The Commission concluded that there was a "''jus cogens'' norm not to impose capital punishment on individuals who committed their crimes when they had not yet reached 18 years of age."&lt;ref&gt;The Michael Domingues Case: Report on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Report No. 62/02, Merits, Case 12.285 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has subsequently banned the execution of juvenile offenders. Although not necessarily in response to the above non-binding report, the Supreme Court cited evolving international norms as one of the reasons for the ban (''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'').

===Torture===
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] stated in ''Prosecutor v. Furundžija'' that there is a ''jus cogens'' for the prohibition against torture.&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"/&gt; It also stated that every state is entitled "to investigate, prosecute and punish or extradite individuals accused of torture, who are present in a territory under its jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"/&gt;  Therefore, there is universal jurisdiction over torture. The rationale for this is that "the torturer has become, like the pirate and the slave trader before him, ''[[hostis humani generis]]'', an enemy of all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Janis, M. and Noyes, J. International Law": Cases and Commentary (3rd ed.), Prosecutor v. Furundžija, Page 148 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Monism is the position that mind and body are not [[ontology|ontologically]] distinct entities (independent substances).

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim, J., "Mind–Body Problem", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.

Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, especially in the fields of [[sociobiology]], [[computer science]] (specifically, [[artificial intelligence]]), [[evolutionary psychology]] and the various [[neuroscience]]s.&lt;ref name="PsyBio"&gt;Pinel, J.

==Mind–body problem==

The mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between [[mind]]s, or [[mental processes]], and bodily states or processes.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

 }} &lt;!--Kim, J., "Problems in the Philosophy of Mind". ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.

Our perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] that arrive at our various [[Sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world, and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt;

A related problem is how someone's [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and muscles to contract. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[Epistemology|epistemologists]] and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

==Dualist solutions to the mind–body problem==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] is a set of views about the relationship between [[mind]] and [[matter]] (or [[Human body|body]]). It begins with the claim that mental [[phenomenon|phenomena]] are, in some respects, non-[[nature|physical]].&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern [[Sankhya]] and [[Yoga]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into [[purusha]] (mind/spirit) and [[prakriti]] (material substance).&lt;ref name="Sa" /&gt; Specifically, the [[Yoga Sutra]] of [[Patanjali]] presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind.

In [[Western Philosophy]], the earliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of [[Plato]] who maintained that humans' "intelligence" (a faculty of the mind or soul) could not be identified with, or explained in terms of, their physical body.&lt;ref name="Plato" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;Robinson, H. (1983): "Aristotelian dualism", Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 1, 123–44.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the best-known version of dualism is due to [[René Descartes]] (1641), and holds that the mind is a non-extended, non-physical substance, a "[[mental substance|res cogitans]]".&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with [[consciousness]] and [[self-awareness]], and to distinguish this from the brain, which was the seat of intelligence. He was therefore the first to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it still exists today.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

===Arguments for dualism===
The most frequently used argument in favor of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their [[self (psychology)|self]], their personality, their [[soul]], or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one [[ontology|ontological]] entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with [[empirical evidence]] from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt;

Another important argument in favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties.&lt;ref name="Ja"&gt;Jackson, F. (1982) "Epiphenomenal Qualia." Reprinted in Chalmers, David ed. :2002. ''Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of [[glutamate]] in the dorsolateral portion of the [[prefrontal cortex]] feels like.

Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events "[[qualia]]" or "raw feels".&lt;ref name="Ja" /&gt; There is something that it is like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – what it is like to see the color red.&lt;ref name="Nagel"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nagel, T. | title=What is it like to be a bat? | journal=Philosophical Review | issue=83 | pages=435–456 |year=1974|url=http://www.esalq.usp.br/lepse/imgs/conteudo_thumb/What-Is-It-Like-to-Be-a-Bat-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One possible explanation is that of a miracle, proposed by [[Arnold Geulincx]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche]], where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.

Another possible argument that has been proposed by [[C. S. Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.S | title=Miracles | year=1947 | isbn=978-0-688-17369-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Argument from Reason]]: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the [[consequent]] of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.

The [[p-zombie|zombie argument]] is based on a [[thought experiment]] proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by [[David Chalmers]] in his book ''[[The Conscious Mind]]''. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' argument is that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via [[physics]], the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chalmers, David | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-19-511789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Dennett have [[Philosophical zombie#Criticism|argued]] that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent,&lt;ref name="Dennett, Daniel 1995 322–6"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=The unimagined preposterousness of zombies |year=1995 |journal=J Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |pages=322–6 |url=http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/unzombie.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515115656/http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/unzombie.htm |archivedate=2017-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, Daniel | title=Consciousness Explained | publisher=Little, Brown and Co. | year=1991 | page=95 | isbn=978-0-316-18065-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!"&lt;ref name="Dennett, Daniel 1995 322–6"/&gt;

===Interactionist dualism===
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[René Descartes]] by [[Frans Hals]] (1648)]]
Interactionist dualism, or simply interactionism, is the particular form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the ''Meditations''.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; In the 20th century, its major defenders have been [[Karl Popper]] and [[John Carew Eccles]].&lt;ref name="PopE"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Popper, Karl  |author2=Eccles, John  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Self and Its Brain | publisher=Springer Verlag | year=2002 | isbn=978-3-492-21096-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt;

Descartes' famous argument for this position can be summarized as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be measured in terms of length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

At the same time, however, it is clear that Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have [[causality|causal]] effects on his body and vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the caregiver (mental event), and so on.

Descartes' argument crucially depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be "clear and distinct" ideas in his mind are [[logical truth|necessarily true]]. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;Dennett D., (1991), ''Consciousness Explained'', Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;Stich, S., (1983), ''From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]] (Bradford)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, G., 1949, The Concept of Mind, New York: Barnes and Noble&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Joseph Agassi]] suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. [[Pierre Duhem|Duhem]] has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=Privileged Access; ''Science in Flux, Boston Stidues in the Philosophy of Science'', 80| publisher=Reidel| location=Dordrecht| year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=La Scienza in Divenire | publisher=Armando | location=Rome | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forms of dualism===
[[File:DualismCausationViews3.svg|400px|thumb|Four varieties of dualism. The arrows indicate the direction of the causal interactions. Occasionalism is not shown.]]

====Psychophysical parallelism====
[[Psychophysical parallelism]], or simply '''parallelism''', is the view that mind and body, while having distinct ontological statuses, do not causally influence one another. Instead, they run along parallel paths (mind events causally interact with mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events) and only seem to influence each other.&lt;ref name="DuSEP"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was most prominently defended by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Although Leibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of substance, the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monad]], exists in the universe, and that everything is reducible to it, he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between "the mental" and "the physical" in terms of causation. He held that God had arranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with each other. This is known as the doctrine of [[pre-established harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Leibniz | first=Gottfried Wilhelm | title=Monadology | year=1714 | isbn=978-0-87548-030-5| title-link=Monadology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occasionalism====
[[Occasionalism]] is the view espoused by [[Nicholas Malebranche]] as well as Islamic philosophers  such as [[Al-Ghazali|Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali]] that asserts that all supposedly causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects by an act of God's intervention on each specific occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Property dualism====
[[Property dualism]] is the view that the world is constituted of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]] – the physical kind – and there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical bodies (at least, brains). How mental and physical properties relate causally depends on the variety of property dualism in question, and is not always a clear issue. Sub-varieties of property dualism include:

#[[Emergent materialism]] asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge  in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to, or explained in terms of, the physical substrate from which they emerge. They are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge, but opinions vary as to the coherence of [[top–down causation]], i.e. the causal effectiveness of such properties. A form of emergent materialism has been espoused by [[David Chalmers]] and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years,&lt;ref name="Chalmers"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chalmers |first=David | authorlink=David Chalmers | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 | isbn = 978-0-19-511789-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was already suggested in the 19th century by [[William James]].
#[[Epiphenomenalism]] is a doctrine first formulated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. [1874] "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555–580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world.&lt;ref name="DuSEP" /&gt; This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jackson, Frank | title=What Mary didn't know | journal=Journal of Philosophy | year=1986 |pages=291–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Property dualism#Non-reductive Physicalism|Non-reductive physicalism]] is the view that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia in the case of non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.
#[[Panpsychism]] is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [[complexity|complex]] structure in a compound object. So long as the ''reduction'' of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.

====Dual aspect theory====
[[Dual aspect theory]] or dual-aspect monism is the view that the [[mind|mental]] and the [[nature|physical]] are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance.  (Thus it is a mixed position, which is monistic in some respects). In modern philosophical writings, the theory's relationship to [[neutral monism]] has become somewhat ill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships into which they enter to determine whether the group can be thought of as mental, physical, both, or neither, dual-aspect theory suggests that the mental and the physical are manifestations (or aspects) of some underlying substance, entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as normally understood. Various formulations of dual-aspect monism also require the mental and the physical to be complementary, mutually irreducible and perhaps inseparable (though distinct).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atmanspacher | first1 = H | year = 2012 | title = Dual-aspect monism a la Pauli and Jung | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harald_Atmanspacher/publication/262956033_Dual-Aspect_Monism_a_la_Pauli_and_Jung/links/568a246308ae051f9af9ca21.pdf | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies: Special Issue on Monist Alternatives to Physicalism | volume = 19 | issue = 9–10| pages = 96–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Velmans | first1 = M | year = 2012 | title = Reflexive Monism: psychophysical relations among mind, matter and consciousness | url = https://www.academia.edu/2053423 | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies: Special Issue on Monist Alternatives to Physicalism | volume = 19 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 143–165 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171111113509/http://www.academia.edu/2053423/Reflexive_Monism_Psychophysical_relations_among_mind_matter_and_consciousness | archivedate = 2017-11-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Stubenberg.

==== Experiential dualism ====
This is a philosophy of mind that regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical well-being as not necessarily synonymous thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind.  An example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by [[B. Alan Wallace|Allan Wallace]] who notes that it is "experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Consciousness At The Crossroads: Conversations With The Dalai Lama On Brain Science And Buddhism|last=Wallace|first=Allen|publisher=Snow Lion|year=1999|isbn=9780545227209|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical world seems qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one.  This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another.  Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa.

However, unlike cartesian dualism or some other systems, experiential dualism does not posit two fundamental substances in reality: mind and matter.  Rather, experiential dualism is to be understood as a conceptual framework that gives credence to the qualitative difference between the experience of mental and physical states.  Experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework of [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka Buddhism]].

Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding fault with the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind as well in that these generally posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality.  Nonetheless, this does not imply that the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.&lt;blockquote&gt;In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed, physicalism, or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality, is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one's childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, for the simple reason that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hylomorphism is a theory that originates with [[Aristotle|Aristotelian philosophy]], which conceives [[ousia|being]] as a compound of [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. "Hylomorphism" is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη ''hyle'', "wood, matter", and μορφή, ''morphē'', "form".

==Monist solutions to the mind–body problem==
In contrast to [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], [[monism]] does not accept any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]], monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are [[physicalism|physicalist]].&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science.&lt;ref name="Stol"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, [[idealism]], states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, such as that of [[George Berkeley]], is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called [[panpsychism]], according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as [[Alfred North Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Anderson Weekes (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind (Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408022540/http://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind |date=2015-04-08 }}'', Albany, New York, State University of New York Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Ray Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers" /&gt;

[[Phenomenalism]] is the theory that representations (or [[sense data]]) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by [[Bertrand Russell]] and many of the [[logical positivists]] during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1918) ''Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays'', London: Longmans, Green.&lt;/ref&gt; A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza&lt;ref name="Spin" /&gt; and was popularized by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1886) ''Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen.'' Fifth edition translated as ''The Analysis of Sensations and the Relation of Physical to the Psychical'', New York: Dover. 1959&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century. This [[neutral monism]], as it is called, resembles property dualism.

===Physicalistic monisms===

====Behaviorism====
{{Main|Behaviorism}}
Behaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the 20th century, especially the first half.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of [[introspection]]ism.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Skinner, B.F. | title=Beyond Freedom &amp; Dignity | publisher=Bantam/Vintage Books |location=New York | year=1972 | isbn=978-0-553-14372-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to these developments in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; This is characterized by a strong [[verificationism]], which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or [[disposition]]s to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ryle, Gilbert | title=The Concept of Mind | publisher=Chicago University Press | location=Chicago | year=1949 |isbn=978-0-226-73295-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical behaviorism has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several perceived problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be [[counterintuitive]] when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.

====Identity theory====
{{Main|Type physicalism}}
Type physicalism (or type-identity theory) was developed by [[J. J. C. Smart|John Smart]]&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; and [[Ullin Place]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Place, Ullin | title=Is Consciousness a Brain Process? | journal=British Journal of Psychology | year=1956 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1956.tb00560.x | volume=47 | pages=44–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a direct reaction to the failure of behaviorism. These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states are something material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain. In very simplified terms: a mental state ''M'' is nothing other than brain state ''B''. The mental state "desire for a cup of coffee" would thus be nothing more than the "firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions".&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;
[[File:Anomalous Monism.png|thumb|right|250px|The classic Identity theory and Anomalous Monism in contrast. For the Identity theory, every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds (as indicated by the arrows) to a physical token of a single physical type. For anomalous monism, the token–token correspondences can fall outside of the type–type correspondences. The result is token identity.]]

Despite its initial plausibility, the identity theory faces a strong challenge in the form of the thesis of [[multiple realizability]], first formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]].&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt; For example, not only humans, but many different species of animals can experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt;

On the other hand, even granted the above, it does not follow that identity theories of all types must be abandoned. According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word "green" contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter ''e'' along with one each of the others.
The idea of token identity is that only particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/malebranche "Identity Theory"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2002 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Anomalous monism (see below) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Davidson, D.| title=Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2001 | isbn=978-88-7078-832-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these problems, there is a renewed interest in the type identity theory today, primarily due to the influence of [[Jaegwon Kim]].&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;

====Functionalism====
{{Main|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}
Functionalism was formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]] as a reaction to the inadequacies of the identity theory.&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt; Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical [[computational theory of mind|computational theory of the mind]].&lt;ref name="Block"&gt;Block, Ned. "What is functionalism" in ''Readings in Philosophy of Psychology'', 2 vols. Vol 1. (Cambridge: Harvard, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time or slightly after, [[D.M. Armstrong]] and [[David Kellogg Lewis]] formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, D., 1968, ''A Materialist Theory of the Mind'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by [[Wilfrid Sellars]] and [[Gilbert Harman]]. Another one, [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)#Psychofunctionalism|psychofunctionalism]], is an approach adopted by the [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Metaphysical naturalism|naturalistic philosophy of mind]] associated with Jerry Fodor and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]].

What all these different varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.&lt;ref name="Block" /&gt;

====Non-reductive physicalism====
{{Main|Physicalism}}

Non-reductionist philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with regard to mind–body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states, but 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory: mental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional states.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s [[anomalous monism]]&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism. He "thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason, such as akrasia or self-deception, the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one, but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Francesco M. &amp; Marraffa M.|title=The Unconscious, consciousness, and the Self illusion|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2013|volume=6|issue=1|pages=10–22|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A13-01.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303051022/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A13-01.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson uses the thesis of [[supervenience]]: mental states supervene on physical states, but are not reducible to them. "Supervenience" therefore describes a functional dependence: there can be no change in the mental without some change in the physical–causal reducibility between the mental and physical without ontological reducibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanton | first1 = W.L. | year = 1983 | title = Supervenience and Psychological Law in Anomalous Monism | url = | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 72–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because non-reductive physicalist theories attempt to both retain the ontological distinction between mind and body and try to solve the "surfeit of explanations puzzle" in some way; critics often see this as a paradox and point out the similarities to [[epiphenomenalism]], in that it is the brain that is seen as the root "cause" not the mind, and the mind seems to be rendered inert.

Epiphenomenalism regards one or more mental states as the byproduct of physical brain states, having no influence on physical states. The interaction is one-way (solving the "surfeit of explanations puzzle") but leaving us with non-reducible mental states (as a byproduct of brain states) – causally reducible, but ontologically irreducible to physical states. Pain would be seen by epiphenomenaliasts as being caused by the brain state but as not having effects on other brain states, though it might have effects on other mental states (i.e. cause distress).

====Weak emergentism====
{{Main|Emergentism}}
Weak emergentism is a form of "non-reductive physicalism" that involves a layered view of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science. Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, while others maintain that higher-order properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction. The latter group therefore holds a less strict, or "weaker", definition of emergentism, which can be rigorously stated as follows: a property P of composite object O is emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack property P if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties identical to those in O and has those parts in an identical configuration.

Sometimes emergentists use the example of water having a new property when Hydrogen H and Oxygen O combine to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water). In this example there "emerges" a new property of a transparent liquid that would not have been predicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases. This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state. Emergentists try to solve the notorious mind–body gap this way. One problem for emergentism is the idea of "causal closure" in the world that does not allow for a mind-to-body causation.&lt;ref&gt;Jaegwon Kim, Philosophy of Mind, Westview Press; 2 edition (July 8, 2005) {{ISBN|0-8133-4269-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eliminative materialism====
{{Main|Eliminative materialism}}
If one is a materialist and believes that all aspects of our common-sense psychology will find reduction to a mature [[cognitive neuroscience]], and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, more radical position: eliminative materialism.

There are several varieties of eliminative materialism, but all maintain that our common-sense "[[folk psychology]]" badly misrepresents the nature of some aspect of cognition. Eliminativists such as [[Patricia Churchland|Patricia]] and [[Paul Churchland]] argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence-like, the non-linguistic vector/matrix model of neural network theory or [[connectionism]] will prove to be a much more accurate account of how the brain works.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;

The Churchlands often invoke the fate of other, erroneous popular theories and [[ontology|ontologies]] that have arisen in the course of history.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt; For example, Ptolemaic astronomy served to explain and roughly predict the motions of the planets for centuries, but eventually this model of the solar system was eliminated in favor of the Copernican model. The Churchlands believe the same eliminative fate awaits the "sentence-cruncher" model of the mind in which thought and behavior are the result of manipulating sentence-like states called "[[propositional attitude]]s".

===Non-physicalist monisms===

====Idealism====
[[Idealism]] is the form of monism that sees the world as consisting  of minds, mental contents and or consciousness.
Idealists are not faced with explaining how  minds arise from bodies: rather, the world, bodies and objects are regarded as mere appearances held by minds. However, accounting for the mind–body problem is not usually the main motivation for idealism; rather, idealists tend to be motivated by [[skepticism]], intentionality, and the unique nature of ideas.
Idealism is prominent in Eastern religious and philosophical thought. It has gone through several cycles of popularity and neglect in the history of Western philosophy.

Different varieties of idealism may hold that there are
* multiple  minds ([[pluralistic idealism]])
* only one human mind ([[solipsism]])
* or a single [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], [[Anima Mundi]], [[Plotinus#One|One]] or [[Over-soul]].

====Neutral monism====
[[Neutral monism]], in [[philosophy]], is the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental.  This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical. These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape, just as we experience those properties. But these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether dualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.

==Mysterianism==
{{Main|New mysterianism}}
Some philosophers take an epistemic approach and argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed [[New mysterianism]]. [[Colin McGinn]] holds that human beings are [[Cognitive closure (philosophy)|cognitively closed]] in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as [[consciousness]] arise from their causal basis.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Colin. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 "Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226060901/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 |date=2016-12-26 }}, ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 98, No. 391, July 1989 (pp. 349–366), p. 350.
*Reprinted in O'Connor, Timothy and Robb, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BlSDUzfMxo0C&amp;pg=PA438 "Colin McGinn, Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?"], ''Philosophy of Mind: Contemporary Readings''. Routledge, 2003, p. 438ff.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.

A more moderate conception has been expounded by [[Thomas Nagel]], which holds that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that it might take a future scientific [[paradigm shift]] or revolution to bridge the [[explanatory gap]]. Nagel posits that in the future a sort of "objective [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]" might be able to bridge the gap between subjective conscious experience and its physical basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/#SH3b "Hard problem of Consciousness"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420211306/http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/ |date=2015-04-20 }}, ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Josh Weisberg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic criticism of the mind–body problem==
Each attempt to answer the mind–body problem encounters substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion.&lt;ref name="Hacker"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hacker, Peter | title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience | publisher=Blackwel Pub. | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory.&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wittgenstein, Ludwig | title=Philosophical Investigations | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1954 | isbn=978-0-631-14660-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt; This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a [[category error]] or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt;

Today, such a position is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as [[Peter Hacker]].&lt;ref name="Hacker" /&gt; However, [[Hilary Putnam]], the originator of functionalism, has also adopted the position that the mind–body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Putnam, Hilary | title=The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body, and World | publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York | year=2000 |isbn=978-0-231-10286-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Externalism and internalism==
Where is the mind located? If the mind is a physical phenomenon of some kind, it has to be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the mind is internal to the body ([[internalism]]) or the mind is external to it ([[externalism]]). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.

Proponents of internalism are committed to the view that neural activity is sufficient to produce the mind.
Proponents of externalism maintain that the surrounding world is in some sense constitutive of the mind.

Externalism differentiates into several versions. The main ones are [[semantic externalism]], [[cognitive externalism]] and [[phenomenal externalism]]. Each of these versions of externalism can further be divided into whether they refer only to the content or to the vehicles of the mind.

Semantic externalism holds that the semantic content of the mind is totally or partially defined by a state of affairs external to the body of the subject. [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[Twin Earth thought experiment]] is a good example.

Cognitive externalism is a very broad collection of views that suggests the role of the environment, of tools, of development, and of the body in fleshing out cognition. [[Embodied cognition]], the [[extended mind]], and [[enactivism]] are good examples.

Phenomenal externalism suggests that the phenomenal aspects of the mind are external to the body. Authors who addressed this possibility are Ted Honderich, Edwin Holt, Francois Tonneau, Kevin O'Regan, Riccardo Manzotti, Teed Rockwell and Max Velmans.

==Naturalism and its problems==
The thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material (or physical) world. Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other material thing seems to possess. Physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a material thing. The project of providing such an explanation is often referred to as the "[[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalization]] of the mental".&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt;

===Qualia===
{{Main|Qualia}}

Many mental states seem to be experienced subjectively in different ways by different individuals.&lt;ref name="Nagel" /&gt; And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential ''quality'', e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since no one has a perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.&lt;ref name="Ja" /&gt;

Yet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such experiences.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] an assumption about the possibility of [[reductionism|reductive explanations]]. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency).&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; In the case of mental states, this means that there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.

The 20th-century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] criticized the [[ontology|ontological]] assumptions underpinning such a reductive model, and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms. This is because, according to Heidegger, the nature of our subjective experience and its ''qualities'' is impossible to understand in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties". Another way to put this is that the very concept of qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of—or is semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of—substances that bear properties.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, Sept. 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem of explaining introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the [[explanatory gap]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]], ''Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap'', in: ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'', vol. 64, no. 4, October, 1983, 354–361&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different views of the nature of this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. [[David Chalmers]] and the early [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] interpret the gap as [[ontology|ontological]] in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because [[physicalism]] is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, F. (1986) "What Mary didn't Know", Journal of Philosophy, 83, 5, pp. 291–295.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as [[Thomas Nagel]] and [[Colin McGinn]]. According to them, the gap is [[epistemology|epistemological]] in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently.&lt;ref name="Nagel" /&gt; For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, C. "Can the Mind-Body Problem Be Solved", ''Mind'', New Series, Volume 98, Issue 391, pp. 349–366. a [http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf (online)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101441/http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to the famous "''Qualia Question''", which is: ''Does Red cause Redness''?

===Intentionality===
{{Main|Intentionality}}
[[File:John Searle 2002.jpg|thumb|[[John Searle]]—one of the most influential philosophers of mind, proponent of [[biological naturalism]] (Berkeley 2002)]]
[[Intentionality]] is the capacity of mental states to be directed towards (''about'') or be in relation with something in the external world.&lt;ref name="Searleint" /&gt; This property of mental states entails that they have [[mental content|contents]] and [[semantics|semantic referents]] and can therefore be assigned [[truth value]]s. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fodor, Jerry | title=Psychosemantics. The problem of meaning in the philosophy of mind | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-262-06106-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not make any sense to say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that [[Herodotus]] was a historian refers to Herodotus and to the fact that he was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.&lt;ref name="Int" /&gt;

==Philosophy of perception==
{{Main|Philosophy of perception}}
[[Philosophy of perception]] is concerned with the nature of [[Perception|perceptual experience]] and the status of perceptual objects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world. The main contemporary views within philosophy of perception include [[naive realism]], [[enactivism]] and [[Mental representation|representational]] views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macpherson, F. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, S. (2011)."The Contents of Perception", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/perception-contents/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of mind and science==
Humans are corporeal beings and, as such, they are subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind.&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[cognitive science]], [[cybernetics]], [[linguistics]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacology]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Pinker"&gt;Pinker, S. (1997) ''How the Mind Works''. tr. It: ''Come Funziona la Mente''. Milan:Mondadori, 2000. {{ISBN|88-04-49908-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiology===
{{Main|Neuroscience}}
The theoretical background of biology, as is the case with modern [[natural science]]s in general, is fundamentally materialistic. The objects of study are, in the first place, physical processes, which are considered to be the foundations of mental activity and behavior.&lt;ref name="Bear"&gt;Bear, M. F. et al. Eds. (1995). ''Neuroscience: Exploring The Brain''. Baltimore, Maryland, Williams and Wilkins. {{ISBN|0-7817-3944-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing success of biology in the explanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical refutation of its fundamental presupposition: "there can be no change in the mental states of a person without a change in brain states."&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt;

Within the field of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes:&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; [[Neurophysiology|Sensory neurophysiology]] investigates the relation between the processes of [[perception]] and [[stimulation]].&lt;ref name="Pinel"&gt;{{cite book | author=Pinel, J.P.J | title=Psychobiology | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=1997 | isbn=978-88-15-07174-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive neuroscience]] studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes.&lt;ref name="Pinel" /&gt; [[Neuropsychology]] describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain.&lt;ref name="Pinel" /&gt; Lastly, [[evolutionary biology]] studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenesis|phylogenetic]] development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages.&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt; Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the [[gene]]-based mechanism of [[natural selection]] does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Metzinger, Thomas | title=Being No One – The Self Model Theory of Subjectivity | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=2003 | pages=349–366 | isbn=978-0-262-13417-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Functional magnetic resonance imaging.jpg|thumb|Since the 1980s, sophisticated [[neuroimaging]] procedures, such as [[fMRI]] (above), have furnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain, shedding light on ancient philosophical problems.]]

The [[methodology|methodological]] breakthroughs of the neurosciences, in particular the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: one of the main goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: [[neural correlate]]).&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; Several groups are inspired by these advances.

===Computer science===
{{Main|Computer science}}
Computer science concerns itself with the automatic processing of [[information]] (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as [[computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sipser, M.| title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation | location=Boston, Mass. | publisher=PWS Publishing Co. | isbn=978-0-534-94728-6 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, [[computer programmer]]s have been able to develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).

Within AI, it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a more ambitious one: this distinction was coined by [[John Searle]] in terms of a [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|weak AI and strong AI]]. The exclusive objective of "weak AI", according to Searle, is the successful simulation of mental states, with no attempt to make computers become conscious or aware, etc. The objective of strong AI, on the contrary, is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Searle, John | title=Minds, Brains and Programs | journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | issue=3 | pages=417–424 |year=1980|url=http://cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program of strong AI goes back to one of the pioneers of computation [[Alan Turing]]. As an answer to the question "Can computers think?", he formulated the famous [[Turing test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing believed that a computer could be said to "think" when, if placed in a room by itself next to another room that contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of both the computer and the human being by a third party human being, the computer's responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the human. Essentially, Turing's view of machine intelligence followed the behaviourist model of the mind—intelligence is as intelligence does. The Turing test has received many criticisms, among which the most famous is probably the [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]] formulated by Searle.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;

The question about the possible sensitivity ([[qualia]]) of computers or robots still remains open. Some computer scientists believe that the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to the resolution of the "mind–body problem". They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers, it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain ([[wetware (brain)|wetware]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Russell, S.  |author2=Norvig, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Artificial Intelligence:A Modern Approach | location=New Jersey | publisher=Prentice Hall, Inc. | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-13-103805-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology}}
Psychology is the science that investigates mental states directly. It uses generally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like [[joy]], [[fear]] or [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessions]]. Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychology.org | title=Encyclopedia of Psychology | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513103646/http://www.psychology.org/ | archivedate=2008-05-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this is the [[Perception|psychology of perception]]. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the [[Form perception|perception of forms]]. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other.&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt; This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.

===Cognitive science===
[[Cognitive science]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes.  It examines what [[cognition]] is, what it does, and how it works.  It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It spans many levels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation. [[Mark Rowlands|Rowlands]] argues  that cognition is  enactive, embodied, embedded, affective and (potentially) extended. The position is taken that the "classical sandwich" of cognition sandwiched between perception and action is artificial; cognition has to be seen as a product of a strongly coupled interaction that cannot be divided this way.&lt;ref name=Rowlands&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Rowlands |authorlink=Mark Rowlands |chapter=Chapter 3: The mind embedded |pages=51 ''ff'' |year=2010 |isbn=978-0262014557 |publisher=MIT Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiwjpL-0hDgC&amp;pg=PA51 |title=The new science of the mind: From extended mind to embodied phenomenology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dave Ward |author2=Mog Stapleton |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1E7FogqvJ0C&amp;pg=PA89 |chapter=Es are good.

==Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition==
Most of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called [[analytic philosophy]] (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy).&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dummett, M.| title=Origini della Filosofia Analitica | publisher=Einaudi | year=2001 | isbn=978-88-06-15286-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt; In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, in relation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label ([[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to the discussion of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of [[thought]] and [[experience|perceptual experience]] in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt;

Immanuel Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', first published in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later become known as the philosophy of mind. Kant's first [[critique]] is generally recognized as among the most significant works of [[modern philosophy]] in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both [[Continental philosophy|continental]] and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental]] consciousness, or the life of the mind as conceived through universal [[category (Kant)|categories]] of consciousness.

In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''Philosophy of Mind'' (frequently translated as ''Philosophy of Spirit'' or [[Geist]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hegel, G.W.F | title=Phenomenology of Spirit | isbn=978-0-19-503169-0| year=1983 }}, translated by A.V. Miller with analysis of the text and foreword by J. N. Findlay (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) {{ISBN|0-19-824597-1}} .&lt;/ref&gt; the third part of his ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind: the "subjective mind/spirit", the mind of an individual; the "objective mind/spirit", the mind of society and of the State; and the "Absolute mind/spirit", the position of religion, art, and philosophy. See also Hegel's ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. Nonetheless, Hegel's work differs radically from the style of [[Anglosphere|Anglo-American]] philosophy of mind.

In 1896, [[Henri Bergson]] made in ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' "Essay on the relation of body and spirit" a forceful case for the ontological difference of body and mind by reducing the problem to the more definite one of memory, thus allowing for a solution built on the ''empirical test case'' of [[aphasia]].

In modern times, the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by [[Edmund Husserl]], focuses on the contents of the human mind (see [[noema]]) and how processes shape our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Husserl, Edmund | title=Logische Untersuchungen | isbn=978-3-05-004391-3| year=2008 }} trans.: Giovanni Piana. Milan: EST. {{ISBN|88-428-0949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. See Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'', Merleau-Ponty's ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'', Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and Simone de Beauvoir's ''[[The Second Sex]]''.

==Mind in Eastern philosophy==

===Mind in Hindu philosophy===

====Dualism====
[[Cartesian dualism|Substance Dualism]] is a common feature of several [[Āstika and nāstika#Āstika|orthodox Hindu schools]] including the [[Sāṅkhya]], [[Nyāya]], [[Yoga]] and [[Dvaita Vedanta]]. In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes [[samsara]], a cycle of death and rebirth. The [[Nyāya]] school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/#H2/|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004042359/http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/#H2/|archivedate=2012-10-04|df=}} Nyāya, Matthew R. Dasti&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as [[moksha]], liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.

====Vedanta monistic idealism====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|Śaṅkara]]
In the [[Advaita Vedanta]] of the 8th century Indian philosopher [[Śaṅkara]], the mind, body and world are all held to be the same unchanging eternal conscious entity called [[Brahman]]. Advaita, which means non-dualism, holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute [[consciousness]]. The fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. The only thing that exists is [[Brahman]], which is described as [[Satchitananda]] (Being, consciousness and bliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states "Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101653/http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/|archivedate=2015-06-26|df=}} Advaita Vedanta, Sangeetha Menon&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of monistic Vedanta is [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified non-dualism) as posited by the eleventh century philosopher [[Ramanuja]]. Ramanuja criticized Advaita Vedanta by arguing that consciousness is always [[intentionality|intentional]] and that it is also always a property of something. Ramanuja's Brahman is defined by a multiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity. This doctrine is called "[[samanadhikaranya]]" (several things in a common substrate).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055536/http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|archivedate=2014-07-17|df=}} Ramanuja, Shyam Ranganathan&lt;/ref&gt;

====Materialism====
Arguably the first exposition of [[empiricism|empirical]] [[materialism]] in the history of philosophy is in the [[Cārvāka]] school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the [[four elements]]), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/#H1|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611095345/http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/#H1|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}} Lokāyata/Cārvāka – Indian Materialism, Abigail Turner-Lauck Wernicki&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy of mind===
{{PancaKhandha}}
Buddhist teachings describe that the mind manifests moment-to-moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE Open |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream has been described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

A salient feature of [[Buddhist philosophy]] which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is the centrality of the doctrine of [[Anatta|not-self]] ([[Pāli]]. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous way of looking at the ever-changing stream of [[five aggregates|five interconnected aggregate factors]].&lt;ref name="Coseru"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-indian-buddhism/|title= Coseru, Christian, "Mind in Indian Buddhist Philosophy"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising ([[pratītyasamutpāda]]). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both [[determinism|causal determinist]] and [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalist]] conceptions of mind.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;

====Abhidharma theories of mind====
Three centuries after the death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a large body of literature called the [[Abhidharma]] in several contending [[Buddhist schools]]. In the Abhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as [[prapañca]] ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like [[self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|other]] upon an ever-changing stream of aggregate phenomena.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;
In this conception of mind no strict distinction is made between the conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the [[five senses]] and sixth for perception of mental phenomena.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (''manovijñāna'') and attention (''āvartana''), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.

Rejection of a permanent agent eventually led to the philosophical problems of the seeming continuity of mind and also of explaining how [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] continue to be relevant doctrines without an eternal mind. This challenge was met by the [[Theravāda]] school by introducing the concept of mind as a factor of existence. This "life-stream" ([[Bhavanga]]-sota) is an undercurrent  forming the condition of being. The continuity of a karmic "person" is therefore assured in the form of a [[mindstream]] (citta-santana), a series of flowing mental moments arising from the subliminal life-continuum mind ([[Bhavanga]]-citta), mental content, and attention.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;

====Indian Mahayana====
The [[Sautrāntika]] school held a form of [[phenomenalism]] that saw the world as imperceptible. It held that external objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later [[Yogācāra]] school of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its [[Internalism and externalism#Philosophy of mind|internalist]] stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of [[Vasubandhu]] have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of [[Idealism]]. Vasubandhu uses the [[dream argument]] and a [[mereology|mereological]] refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects as anything other than mental entities.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/|title=Gold, Jonathan C., "Vasubandhu"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201232037/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/|archivedate=2012-12-01|df=}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, [[neutral monism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)#Realist phenomenology|realist phenomenology]].

The Indian [[Schools of Buddhism#Mahāyāna schools|Mahayana schools]] were divided on the issue of the possibility of reflexive awareness (''[[svasaṃvedana]]''). [[Dharmakīrti]] accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogācāra school, comparing it to a lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects. This was strictly rejected by [[Mādhyamika]] scholars like [[Candrakīrti]]. Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by [[Shunyata|emptiness]], they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self-validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker [[Śāntarakṣita]]. In Śāntarakṣita's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the [[two truths doctrine]]. Thus he states: "By relying on the Mind-Only system, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this Middle Way system, know that no self exists at all, even in that [mind]." &lt;ref name="Blumenthal"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/saantarak-sita/|title= Blumenthal, James, "Śāntarakṣita"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (fall 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yogācāra school also developed the theory of the [[Vijñāna#Eight vijñānas|repository consciousness]] (''ālayavijñāna'') to explain continuity of mind in [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and accumulation of [[karma]]. This repository consciousness acts as a storehouse for karmic seeds ([[Bīja|bija]]) when all other senses are absent during the process of death and rebirth as well as being the causal potentiality of [[Dharma (Buddhism)#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmic phenomena]].&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; Thus according to [[B. Alan Wallace]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;No constituents of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental states and processes. Such subjective experiences do not emerge from the body, but neither do they emerge from nothing. Rather, all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate, and all subjective mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;B. Alan Wallace; [https://books.google.com/books?id=WeUYBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity], p. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tibetan Buddhism====
[[Tibetan Buddhist]] theories of mind evolved directly from the Indian Mahayana views. Thus the founder of the [[Gelug]] school, [[Je Tsongkhapa]] discusses the Yogācāra system of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] in his ''Explanation of the Difficult Points''.&lt;ref name="Sparham"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/tsongkhapa/|title= Sparham, Gareth, "Tsongkhapa"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; He would later come to repudiate [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s pragmatic [[idealism]]. 
According to the [[14th Dalai Lama]] the mind can be defined "as an entity that has the nature of mere experience, that is, 'clarity and knowing'. It is the knowing nature, or agency, that is called mind, and this is non-material."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=417|title=Talk by His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Cambridge, MA USA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019213407/http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=417|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}}, From MindScience, edited by Daniel Goleman and Robert F. Thurman, first in 1991 by Wisdom Publications, Boston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneously dual nature of mind is as follows:
:: 1. '''Clarity''' (''gsal'') – The mental activity which produces cognitive phenomena (''snang-ba'').
:: 2. '''Knowing''' (''rig'') – The mental activity of perceiving cognitive phenomena.
The 14th Dalai Lama has also explicitly laid out his theory of mind as '''experiential dualism''' which is described above under the different types of dualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because Tibetan philosophy of mind is ultimately [[soteriology|soteriological]], it focuses on meditative practices such as [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]] that allow a practitioner to experience the true reflexive nature of their mind directly. This unobstructed knowledge of one's primordial, empty and non-dual [[Buddha nature]] is called [[rigpa]].  The mind's innermost nature is described among various schools as pure luminosity or "clear light" ([[Ösel (yoga)|'od gsal]]) and is often compared to a crystal ball or a mirror. [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] speaks of mind thus:
"Imagine a sky, empty, spacious, and pure from the beginning; its essence is like this. Imagine a sun, luminous, clear, unobstructed, and spontaneously present; its nature is like this."

====Zen Buddhism====
The central issue in Chinese Zen philosophy of mind is in the difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind. Chinese Chan master [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huangpo]] described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts.&lt;ref name="Zeuschner"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|title=Zeuschner, Robert B., "The Understanding of Mind in the Northern Line of Ch'an (Zen)"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822105440/http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|archivedate=2012-08-22|df=}}, Philosophy East and West, V. 28, No. 1 (January 1978), pp. 69–79, University of Hawaii Press, Hawaii, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pure Buddha-mind is thus able to see things "as they truly are", as absolute and non-dual "thusness" ([[Tathatā/Dharmatā|Tathatā]]). This non-conceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind, as well as no difference between [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref name="Zeuschner"/&gt;

In the [[Shobogenzo]], the Japanese philosopher [[Dogen]] argued that body and mind are neither ontologically nor phenomenologically distinct but are characterized by a oneness called ''shin jin'' (bodymind). According to Dogen, "casting off body and mind" (''Shinjin datsuraku'') in [[zazen]] will allow one to experience things-as-they-are (''genjokoan'') which is the nature of original enlightenment (''[[hongaku]]'').&lt;ref name="Shaner"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|title=David E.

==Topics related to philosophy of mind==
There are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of [[death]] and its definitive character, the nature of [[emotion]], of [[perception]] and of [[memory]]. Questions about what a [[person]] is and what his or her [[Personal identity|identity]] consists of also have much to do with the philosophy of mind. There are two subjects that, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: [[free will]] and the [[self (philosophy)|self]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt;

===Free will===
{{Main| Free will}}
In the context of philosophy of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic [[determinism|determinists]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; According to this position, natural laws completely determine the course of the material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.&lt;ref name="Hond"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm | title=Philosopher Ted Honderich's Determinism web resource | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062050/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm | archivedate=2008-05-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argumentation is rejected, on the one hand, by the [[compatibilism|compatibilists]]. Those who adopt this position suggest that the question "Are we free?" can only be answered once we have determined what the term "free" means. The opposite of "free" is not "caused" but "compelled" or "coerced". It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination. A free act is one where the agent could have done otherwise if it had chosen otherwise. In this sense a person can be free even though determinism is true.&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt; The most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Paul, ''Freedom and Moral Sentiment: Hume's Way of Naturalizing Responsibility'' Oxford University Press: New York &amp; Oxford, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, this position is defended, for example, by [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dennett, Daniel | title=The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting | publisher=Bradford Books–MIT Press |location=Cambridge MA | year=1984 |isbn=978-0-262-54042-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are also many [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]] who reject the argument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt; These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Descartes|year=1649|title=Passions of the Soul|isbn=978-0-87220-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=Robert |year=2009 |title=Libertarianism |journal=Philosophical Studies |volume=144 |issue=1 |page=39 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2vg712u87804766 |doi= 10.1007/s11098-009-9365-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Libertarianism, the will does not have to be deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt;

===Self===
{{Main|Philosophy of self}}
The philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of "self". If by "self" or "I" one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the ''person'', some modern philosophers of mind, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered an illusion.&lt;ref name="DHof"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dennett, C.  |author2=Hofstadter, D.R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Mind's I | publisher=Bantam Books | year=1981 |isbn=978-0-553-01412-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the idea of an [[soul|immaterial soul]]. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of "self" as postulated by [[David Hume]], who could never catch himself ''not'' doing, thinking or feeling anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Searle, John | title=Mind: A Brief Introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press Inc, USA  | date=1 November 2004|isbn=978-0-19-515733-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the light of empirical results from [[developmental psychology]], [[developmental biology]] and [[neuroscience]], the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=LeDoux, Joseph | title=The Synaptic Self | location=New York | publisher=Viking Penguin | year=2002 | isbn=978-88-7078-795-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12214">[[File:Milk Bottles of the Late 19th century.jpg|thumb|right|Examples of returnable glass milk bottles from the late 19th century]]
A '''reusable bottle''' is a [[bottle]] that can be [[reuse]]d, as in the case as by the original bottler or by end-use consumers. Reusable bottles have grown in popularity by consumers for both environmental and health safety reasons. Reusable bottles are one example of [[reusable packaging]].

==Background, history==
[[File:Goupillon epicier.jpg|thumb|Assortment of cleaning brushes, including bottle brushes]]
Early [[glass bottle]]s were often reused, such as for milk, water, beer, soft drinks, yogurt, and other uses.  [[Mason jar]]s, for example, were developed and reused for home canning purposes.

With returnable bottles, a retailer would often collect empty bottles or would accept empty bottles returned by customers.  Bottles would be stored and returned to the bottler in reusable cases or crates. Some regions have a [[container deposit]] which is refunded after returning the bottle to the retailer. At the bottler, the bottles would be inspected for damage, cleaned, sanitized, and refilled.

More recently, many bottles have been designed for [[disposable|single-use]].  This often allows for thinner glass bottles and less expensive [[plastic bottle]]s and aluminum [[beverage can]]s.  On a cost basis, the decision has often been made for non-returnable bottles.

==Environmental consequences==
[[File:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|right|thumb|The [[waste hierarchy]]]]
The reuse of containers is often thought of as being a step toward more [[sustainable packaging]].  Reuse sits high on the [[waste hierarchy]].  When a container is used multiple times, the material required per use or per filling cycle is reduced.

Many potential factors are involved in environmental comparisons of returnable vs. non-returnable systems.  Researchers have often used [[life cycle analysis]] methodologies to balance the many diverse considerations.  Some comparisons show no clear winner but rather show a realistic view of a complex subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Singh|first=J | author2 =Krasowski, Singh  |date=January 2011 |title= Life cycle inventory of HDPE bottle-based liquid milk packaging systems
| journal = Packaging Technology and Science
|volume=24 |pages= 49–60|doi=10.1002/pts.909|citeseerx=10.1.1.1029.2590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Van Doorsselaer |first=K | author2 = Fox |year= 2000|title=Estimation of the energy needs in life cycle analysis of one-way and returnable glass packaging

Arguments in favor of reusing bottles, or recycling them into other products, are compelling. It is estimated that in the U.S. alone, consumers use 1,500 plastic water bottles every single second. But only about 23% of [[PET plastic]], which is the plastic used in disposable plastic water bottles, gets recycled. Thus, about 38 billion water bottles are thrown away annually, equating to roughly $1 billion worth of plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/norm-schriever/post_5218_b_3613577.html|title=Plastic Water Bottles Causing Flood of Harm to Our Environment.|last=Schriever|first=Norm|date=2013-07-29|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average American spends $242 per year per person on disposable, single use plastic water bottles. The environmental and cost consequences associated with disposable plastic water bottles are a strong argument for reusing bottles.

==Bottles intended for reuse by households==
[[File:Metal Water Bottles.jpeg|thumb|right|Metal water bottles]]
[[File:Woda.mineralna.w.skrzynkach.jpg|thumb|upright|Reusable [[mineral water]] bottles in crates]]
Reusable drinking bottles for water, coffee, salad dressing, soup, baby formula, and other beverages have gained in popularity by consumers in recent years, undoubtedly due to the costs and environmental problems associated with single use plastic water bottles and those used for other beverages. Common materials used to make reusable drinking bottles include glass, aluminum, stainless steel, and plastic. Reusable bottles include both single and double wall insulated bottles. Some baby bottles have an inner bag or bladder that can be replaced after each use.

==Health and safety concerns associated with reusable bottles==
=== Bacterial concerns ===
Reusable bottles can hold bacteria. Drinking from a reusable bottle can transfer bacteria from a person's mouth to the beverage it contains, which can contaminate both bottle and water. Contamination can cause bacterial or fungal growth in the liquid while it's stored. It is recommend that users clean reusable drinking bottles thoroughly before each used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Chemicals, Nutrients, Additives, &amp; Toxins: Plastic water bottles|url=http://www.foodsmart.govt.nz/whats-in-our-food/chemicals-nutrients-additives-toxins/plastic-packaging/water-bottles.htm|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users should take care to wash the [[bottle cap]] as well after each use for proper sanitation.

Some experts state that there's generally no harm in reusing your own drinking bottle, but the risk for ingesting harmful bacteria increases if you share your bottle with others. University of Nebraska Medical Center Microbiologist Pete Iwen, Ph.D., says, “If it’s my bottle, my germs, I probably would not be all that paranoid about reusing the bottle. The main issue occurs when sharing bottles. Microbes present in my mouth may be harmful to others.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNMC expert says wash reused water bottles to avoid bacteria, viruses; don't share them|url=http://app1.unmc.edu/publicaffairs/TodaySite/newsreleases/view_art.cfm?article_id=1290|website=University of Nebraska Medical Center|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical concerns ===
Plastic drinking bottles often contain the chemical [[Bisphenol A]] (BPA), which is made from [[polycarbonate]] and which shares [[resin identification code]] 7 with other plastics. Another chemical found in plastic drinking bottles is [[phthalate]]. Both of these chemicals are controversial because they are known [[endocrine disruptor]]s, which can interfere with the body's hormonal system.

A study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) found that participants who drank from polycarbonate bottles – which is the plastic commonly used in disposable plastic water bottles, other plastic drinking bottles, and baby bottles – for just one week showed a two-thirds increase in their urine of the chemical BPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/bpa-chemical-plastics-leach-polycarbonate-drinking-bottles-humans/|title=BPA, chemical used to make plastics, found to leach from polycarbonate drinking bottles Into humans|date=2009-05-21|work=News|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to BPA has been shown to interfere with reproductive development in animals and has been linked with cardiovascular disease and diabetes in humans. The study is the first to show that drinking from polycarbonate bottles increased the level of urinary BPA, and thus suggests that drinking containers made with BPA release the chemical into the liquid they contain, which people then  consume. The amount of BPA consumed as a result of drinking from plastic bottles was enough to increase the level of BPA excreted in the urine of the people who drank from those containers.

Other studies have shown that even BPA-free plastic bottles leach harmful chemicals into the liquids they contain, making the argument that the safest reusable drinking bottles are those made with either glass or stainless steel. Glass is non-toxic and inert, so it does not leach into the liquid that it contains, and stainless steel is one of the most inert metals, therefore it has a lower likelihood of leaching chemicals into the beverages it contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uniguide.com/bpa-free-water-bottles-glass-stainless-steel/|title=23 Best BPA Free Water Bottles: Glass, Stainless Steel &amp; Eco-Friendly {{!}} UniGuide|last=Stanton|first=Kristen M.|date=2018-08-20|work=UniGuide|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bisphenol A#Government and industry response|Several countries]] have banned the use of plastics containing BPA used for water and other food items. Leaching of [[phthalate]]s from [[PVC]] (resin identification code 3) is also a concern, but PVC is no longer used for water bottles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Another common material used to make reusable drinking bottles is aluminum. However, aluminum also has health safety concerns. A study by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health found that aluminum levels were over 20-times higher in the elderly than in middle aged people. The study cited a correlation between aluminum levels and “densities of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.” Furthermore, it found that lowering the amount of brain aluminum by using [[Chelation therapy|chelation]] was shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jansson|first=Erik T.|date=December 2001|title=Aluminum exposure and Alzheimer's disease|journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease|volume=3|issue=6|pages=541–549|issn=1875-8908|pmid=12214020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an argument in favor or lessening the amount of aluminum that the body is exposed to, hence making it a less favorable material for reusable drinking bottles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19971">'''Risk perception''' is the [[subjectivity|subjective]] judgement that people make about the characteristics and severity of a [[risk]]. The phrase is most commonly used in reference to [[natural hazards]] and threats to [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]] or [[health]], such as [[nuclear power]]. Several theories have been proposed to explain why different people make different estimates of the dangerousness of risks.  Three major families of theory have been developed: psychology approaches (heuristics and cognitive), anthropology/sociology approaches (cultural theory) and interdisciplinary approaches (social amplification of risk framework).

==Early theories==
The study of risk perception arose out of the observation that experts and lay people often disagreed about how risky various technologies and natural hazards were.

The mid 1960s saw the rapid rise of nuclear technologies and the promise for clean and safe energy.  However, public perception shifted against this new technology.  Fears of both longitudinal dangers to the environment and immediate disasters creating radioactive wastelands turned the public against this new technology.  The scientific and governmental communities asked why public perception was against the use of nuclear energy when all the scientific experts were declaring how safe it really was.  The problem, from the perspectives of the experts, was a difference between scientific facts and an exaggerated public perception of the dangers.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Mary 1985"&gt;Douglas, Mary. Risk Acceptability According to the Social Sciences. Russell Sage Foundation, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key early paper was written in 1969 by [[Chauncey Starr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 1969 | title = Social Benefits versus Technological Risks | url = | journal = Science | volume = 165 | issue = 3899| pages = 1232–1238 | doi=10.1126/science.165.3899.1232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr used a [[revealed preference]] approach to find out what risks are considered acceptable by society. He assumed that society had reached equilibrium in its judgment of risks, so whatever risk levels actually existed in society were acceptable. His major finding was that people will accept risks 1,000 times greater if they are voluntary (e.g. driving a car) than if they are involuntary (e.g. a nuclear disaster).

This early approach assumed that individuals behave rationally by weighing information before making a decision, and that individuals have exaggerated fears due to inadequate or incorrect information. Implied in this assumption is that additional information can help people understand true risk and hence lessen their opinion of danger.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Mary 1985"/&gt; While researchers in the engineering school did pioneer research in risk perception, by adapting theories from economics, it has little use in a practical setting. Numerous studies have rejected the belief that additional information, alone, will shift perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freudenburg | first1 = William R. | year = 1993 | title = Risk and Recreancy: Weber, the Division of Labor, and the Rationality of Risk Perceptions | url = | journal = Social Forces | volume = 71 | issue = 4| pages = 909–932 | doi=10.1093/sf/71.4.909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological approach==

The psychological approach began with research in trying to understand how people process information.  These early works maintained that people use cognitive heuristics in sorting and simplifying information, leading to biases in comprehension.  Later work built on this foundation and became the ''psychometric paradigm''. This approach identifies numerous factors responsible for influencing individual perceptions of risk, including dread, novelty, stigma, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tversky | first1 = Amos | last2 = Kahneman | first2 = Daniel | year = 1974 | title = Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases | url = | journal = Science | volume = 185 | issue = 4157| pages = 1124–1131 | doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid=17835457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also shows that risk perceptions are influenced by the emotional state of the perceiver.&lt;ref&gt;Bodenhausen, G.V. (1993). Emotions, arousal, and stereotypic judgments: A heuristic model of affect and stereotyping. In D.M. Mackie &amp; D.L. Hamilton (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and stereotyping: Interactive processes in group perception (pp. 13-37). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The valence theory  of risk perception only differentiates between positive emotions, such as happiness and optimism, and negative ones, such as fear and anger.  According to valence theory, positive emotions lead to optimistic risk perceptions whereas negative emotions influence a more pessimistic view of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = JS | last2 = Keltner | first2 = D | year = 2000 | title = Beyond valence: Toward a model of emotion-specific influences on judgment and choice | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 473–493 | doi=10.1080/026999300402763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also has found that, whereas risk and benefit tend to be positively correlated across hazardous activities in the world, they are negatively correlated in people's minds and judgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slovic|first1=Paul|title=Risk Perception and Affect|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2006|volume=15|issue=6|pages=322–325|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/15/6/322.full|accessdate=Sep 14, 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00461.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heuristics and biases===
The earliest psychometric research was done by psychologists [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]], who performed a series of gambling experiments to see how people evaluated probabilities. Their major finding was that people use a number of [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]] to evaluate information. These heuristics are usually useful shortcuts for thinking, but they may lead to inaccurate judgments in some situations – in which case they become [[cognitive bias]]es.
*''[[Representativeness]]'': is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event belongs to a class / processes by its similarity:
** [[base rate neglect|insensitivity to prior probability]]
** [[insensitivity to sample size]]
** [[gambler's fallacy|misconception of chance]]
** [[insensitivity to predictability]]
** [[illusion of validity]]
** [[regression fallacy|misconception of regression]]
*''[[Availability heuristic]]:'' events that can be more easily brought to mind or imagined are judged to be more likely than events that could not easily be imagined:
** biases due to retrievability of instances
** biases due to the effectiveness of research set
** biases of imaginability
** [[illusory correlation]]
*''[[Anchoring and Adjustment]] heuristic'': people will often start with one piece of known information and then adjust it to create an estimate of an unknown risk – but the adjustment will usually not be big enough:
** insufficient adjustment
** biases in the evaluation of conjunctive and disjunctive event ([[conjunction fallacy]])
** anchoring in the assessment of subjective probability distributions
*Asymmetry between gains and losses: People are risk averse with respect to gains, preferring a sure thing over a gamble with a higher [[expected utility]] but which presents the possibility of getting nothing. On the other hand, people will be risk-seeking about losses, preferring to hope for the chance of losing nothing rather than taking a sure, but smaller, loss (e.g. [[insurance]]).
*Threshold effects: People prefer to move from uncertainty to certainty over making a similar gain in certainty that does not lead to full certainty. For example, most people would choose a vaccine that reduces the incidence of disease A from 10% to 0% over one that reduces the incidence of disease B from 20% to 10%.

Another key finding was that the experts are not necessarily any better at estimating probabilities than lay people. Experts were often overconfident in the exactness of their estimates, and put too much stock in small samples of data.&lt;ref name="Slovic, Paul 1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slovic | first1 = Paul | last2 = Fischhoff | first2 = Baruch | last3 = Lichtenstein | first3 = Sarah | year = 1982 | title = Why Study Risk Perception? | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 83–93 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1982.tb01369.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive Psychology===
The majority of people in the public express a greater concern for problems which appear to possess an immediate effect on everyday life such as hazardous waste or pesticide-use than for long-term problems that may affect future generations such as climate change or population growth.&lt;ref&gt;"Slimak &amp; Dietz, 2006Koger" cited in Susan M., and Deborah Du Nann. Winter. The Psychology of Environmental Problems: Psychology for Sustainability. 3rd ed. New York: Psychology, 2010. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt; People greatly rely on the scientific community to assess the threat of environmental problems because they usually do not directly experience the effects of phenomena such as climate change. The exposure most people have to climate change has been impersonal; most people only have virtual experience though documentaries and news media in what may seem like a “remote” area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Swim, Janet, Susan Clayton, Thomas Doherty, Robert Gifford, George Howard, Joseph Reser, Paul Stern, and Elke Weber. Psychology &amp; Global Climate Change. Publication. American Psychological Association, 2010. Web. 10 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.apa.org/science/about/publications/climate-change-booklet.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, coupled with the population’s wait-and-see attitude, people do not understand the importance of changing environmentally destructive behaviors even when experts provide detailed and clear risks caused by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;"Sterman, 2008" cited in Koger, Susan M., and Deborah Du Nann. Winter. The Psychology of Environmental Problems: Psychology for Sustainability. 3rd ed. New York: Psychology, 2010. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychometric paradigm===
Research within the psychometric paradigm turned to focus on the roles of affect, emotion, and stigma in influencing risk perception.  [[Melissa Finucane]] and [[Paul Slovic]] have been among the key researchers here.  These researchers first challenged Starr's article by examining expressed [[preference]] – how much risk people say they are willing to accept. They found that, contrary to Starr's basic assumption, people generally saw most risks in society as being unacceptably high. They also found that the gap between voluntary and involuntary risks was not nearly as great as Starr claimed.

Slovic and team found that perceived risk is quantifiable and predictable.  People tend to view current risk levels as unacceptably high for most activities.&lt;ref&gt;Slovic, Paul, ed. The Perception of Risk. Earthscan, Virginia. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  All things being equal, the greater people perceived a benefit, the greater the tolerance for a risk.&lt;ref name="Slovic, Paul 1982"/&gt;  If a person derived pleasure from using a product, people tended to judge its benefits as high and its risks as low.  If the activity was disliked, the judgments were opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = Robin | last2 = Mendelsohn | first2 = Robert | year = 1993 | title = Perceived Risk, Dread, and Benefits | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 259–264 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1993.tb01077.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research in psychometrics has proven that risk perception is highly dependent on intuition, experiential thinking, and emotions.

Psychometric research identified a broad domain of characteristics that may be condensed into three high order factors: 1) the degree to which a risk is understood, 2) the degree to which it evokes a feeling of dread, and 3) the number of people exposed to the risk. A dread risk elicits visceral feelings of terror, uncontrollable, catastrophe, inequality, and uncontrolled. An unknown risk is new and unknown to science.  The more a person dreads an activity, the higher its perceived risk and the more that person wants the risk reduced.&lt;ref name="Slovic, Paul 1982"/&gt;

==Anthropology/sociology approach==

The anthropology/sociology approach posits risk perceptions as produced by and supporting social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wildavsky | first1 = Aaron | last2 = Dake | first2 = Karl | year = 1990 | title = Theories of Risk Perception: Who Fears What and Why? | url = | journal = American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Daedalus) | volume = 119 | issue = 4| pages = 41–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this view, perceptions are socially constructed by institutions, cultural values, and ways of life.

===Cultural theory===

One line of the [[Cultural Theory of risk]] is based on the work of anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]] and political scientist [[Aaron Wildavsky]] first published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary and Aaron Wildavsky. Risk and Culture. University of California Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In cultural theory, Douglas and Wildavsky outline four “ways of life” in a grid/group arrangement.  Each way of life corresponds to a specific social structure and a particular outlook on risk.  Grid categorizes the degree to which people are constrained and circumscribed in their social role.  The tighter binding of social constraints limits individual negotiation.  Group refers to the extent to which individuals are bounded by feelings of belonging or solidarity.  The greater the bonds, the less individual choice are subject to personal control.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Michael, Richard Ellis, Aaron Wildavsky.  Cultural theory. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four ways of life include: Hierarchical, Individualist, Egalitarian, and Fatalist.

Risk perception researchers have not widely accepted this version of cultural theory.  Even Douglas says that the theory is controversial; it poses a danger of moving out of the favored paradigm of individual rational choice of which many researchers are comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary.  Risk and Blame: Essays in Cultural theory.  New York: Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, writers who drawn upon a broader cultural theory perspective have argued that risk-perception analysis helps understand the public response to terrorism in a way that goes far beyond 'rational choice'. As John Handmer and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] write:

{{cquote| In the area of embodied risk, people are not as fearful of themselves as perhaps they should be on the issues of illicit drug use, unsafe sex and so on. Yet with the compounding of both more abstract and more embodied risk this package appears to have met its goal to generate support for government policy. Fear of 'outsiders' and of a non-specific, invisible and uncontrollable threat was a powerful motivator in shaping perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2005 | author= John Handmer and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] | title= Trust Us, and Be Scared: The Changing Nature of Contemporary Risk  | url= https://www.academia.edu/3791859/Trust_Us_and_Be_Scared_The_Changing_Nature_of_Contemporary_Risk | journal= Global Society | volume= 21 | issue=  1 | pages=119–30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===National Culture and Risk Survey===
The First National Culture and Risk Survey of [[cultural cognition]] found that a person's worldview on the two social and cultural dimensions of "hierarchy-egalitarianism," and "individualism-solidarism" was predictive of their response to risk.&lt;ref name="First National"&gt;{{cite web|title=First National Risk &amp; Culture Study|url=http://www.culturalcognition.net/projects/first-national-risk-culture-study.html|publisher=The Cultural Cognition Project at Yale Law School|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary approach==

===Social amplification of risk framework===

The Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), combines research in psychology, sociology, anthropology, and communications theory.  SARF outlines how communications of risk events pass from the sender through intermediate stations to a receiver and in the process serve to amplify or attenuate perceptions of risk.  All links in the communication chain, individuals, groups, media, etc., contain filters through which information is sorted and understood.

The framework attempts to explain the process by which risks are amplified, receiving public attention, or attenuated, receiving less public attention.  The framework may be used to compare responses from different groups in a single event, or analyze the same risk issue in multiple events.  In a single risk event, some groups may amplify their perception of risks while other groups may attenuate, or decrease, their perceptions of risk.

The main thesis of SARF states that risk events interact with individual psychological, social and other cultural factors in ways that either increase or decrease public perceptions of risk.  Behaviors of individuals and groups then generate secondary social or economic impacts while also increasing or decreasing the physical risk itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kasperson
|first= Roger E. |first2= Ortwin |last2=Renn |first3= Paul |last3= Slovic | first4= Halina |last4=Brown | first5=Jacque|last5= Emel |first6= Robert |last6=Goble |first7= Jeanne|last7= Kasperson |first8= Samuel |last8=Ratick | title= The Social Amplification of Risk: A Conceptual Framework |journal= Risk Analysis |volume= 8 | issue=2 |year=1988 | pages=177–187 | url=http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2010/5307/pdf/ren27.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01168.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These '''ripple effects''' caused by the amplification of risk include enduring mental perceptions, impacts on business sales, and change in residential property values, changes in training and education, or social disorder.  These secondary changes are perceived and reacted to by individuals and groups resulting in third-order impacts.  As each higher-order impacts are reacted to, they may ripple to other parties and locations.  Traditional risk analyses neglect these ripple effect impacts and thus greatly underestimate the adverse effects from certain risk events.  Public distortion of risk signals provides a corrective mechanism by which society assesses a fuller determination of the risk and its impacts to such things not traditionally factored into a risk analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kasperson, Jeanne X., Roger E. Kasperson.  The Social Contours of Risk.  Volume I: Publics, Risk Communication &amp; the Social Amplification of Risk.  Earthscan, Virginia.  2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saudade''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˌ|s|aʊ|ˈ|d|ɑː|d|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;"[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/saudade Saudade]" in ''Oxford Dictionaries''. Oxford University Press. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-pt|sɐwˈðaðɨ|eu}}, {{IPA-pt|sawˈdadi|br}} or {{IPA-pt|sawˈdadʒi|}}, {{IPA-gl|sawˈðaðe|lang}}; plural '''''saudades''''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/default.aspx?pal=saudade|title=Significado / definição de saudade no Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa|author=Priberam Informática, S.A.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a deep emotional state of [[Nostalgia|nostalgic]] or profound [[Melancholia|melancholic]] longing for an absent something or someone that one loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never return.&lt;ref name="Bell, A.F. 1912 p. 402"&gt;Bell, A. F. (1912) ''In Portugal''. London and New York: The Bodley Head. Quoted in [[Shirlee Emmons|Emmons, Shirlee]] and Wilbur Watkins Lewis (2006) ''Researching the Song: A Lexicon.'' Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; One English translation of the word is '''missingness''', although it might not convey the feeling of deep emotion attached to the word "saudade".  Stronger forms of ''saudade'' might be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as a lost lover, or a family member who has gone [[missing person|missing]], [[moving (address)|moved away]], separated, or died.

''Saudade'' was once described as "the love that remains" after someone is gone. ''Saudade'' is the recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events that once brought excitement, pleasure, well-being, which now triggers the senses and makes one live again. It can be described as an emptiness, like someone (e.g., one's children, parents, sibling, grandparents, friends, pets) or something (e.g., places, things one used to do in childhood, or other activities performed in the past) that should be there in a particular moment is missing, and the individual feels this absence. It brings sad and happy feelings together: sadness for missing and happiness for experiencing the past.

==History==
[[File:The Portuguese Empire.png|alt=|thumb|left|The distant lands of the [[Portuguese Empire]] made a special longing for the loved ones of explorers and sailors]]
The word ''saudade'' was used in the [[Cancioneiro da Ajuda]] (13th century), in the [[Cancioneiro da Vaticana]] and by poets of the time of King [[Denis of Portugal]]&lt;ref&gt;Basto, Cláudio. "Saudade em português e galego". ''Revista Lusitana'', Vol XVII, Livraria Clássica Editora, Lisboa 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; (reigned 1279–1325).
Some specialists say the word may have originated during the [[Portugal in the period of discoveries|Great Portuguese Discoveries]], giving meaning to the sadness felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in [[shipwreck]]s, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word has been found in earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The [[Reconquista]] also offers a plausible explanation.

The state of mind has subsequently become a "Portuguese way of life": a constant feeling of absence, the sadness of something that's missing, wishful longing for completeness or wholeness and the yearning for the return of what is now gone, a desire for presence as opposed to absence—as it is said in Portuguese, a strong desire to ''matar as saudades'' (lit. ''to kill the saudades'').

In the latter half of the 20th century, ''saudade'' became associated with the longing for one's homeland, as hundreds of thousands of Portuguese-speaking people left in search of better futures in South America, North America, and Western Europe. Besides the implications derived from a wave of emigration trend from the motherland, historically speaking ''saudade'' is the term associated with the decline of Portugal's role in world politics and trade. During the so-called "Golden Age", synonymous with the era of discovery, Portugal  rose to the status of a [[world power]], and its monarchy became one of the richest in Europe. But with the competition from other European nations, the country went both colonially and economically into a prolonged period of decay. This period of decline and resignation from the world's cultural stage marked the rise of ''saudade'', aptly described by a sentence in Portugal's [[A Portuguesa|national anthem]]: ''Levantai hoje de novo o esplendor de Portugal'' (Lift up once again today the splendour of Portugal).

==Definition==
The ''[[Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa]]'' defines ''saudade'' (or ''saudades'') as "A somewhat melancholic feeling of incompleteness. It is related to thinking back on situations of privation due to the absence of someone or something, to move away from a place or thing, or to the absence of a set of particular and desirable experiences and pleasures once lived."&lt;ref&gt;''Dicionário Houaiss da língua portuguese'' (Brazilian Portuguese Dictionary).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dictionary from the Royal Galician Academy, on the other hand, defines ''saudade'' as an "intimate feeling and mood caused by the longing for something absent that is being missed. This can take different aspects, from concrete realities (a loved one, a friend, the motherland, the homeland...) to the mysterious and transcendent. It is quite prevalent and characteristic of the galician-portuguese world, but it can also be found in other cultures."

===Related words===
Saudade is a word in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]] that claims [[Untranslatability|no direct translation]] in English. In Portuguese, "''Tenho saudades tuas''" (European Portuguese) or "''Estou com saudades de ti/você''" (Brazilian Portuguese), translates as "I have (feel) ''saudade'' of you" meaning "I miss you", but carries a much stronger tone. In fact, one can have ''saudade'' of someone whom one is with, but have some feeling of loss towards the past or the future. For example, one can  have "saudade" towards part of the relationship or emotions once experienced for/with someone, though the person in question is still part of one's life, as in "Tenho saudade do que fomos" (I feel "saudade" of the way we were). Another example can illustrate this use of the word saudade: "Que saudade!" indicating a general feeling of longing, whereby the object of longing can be a general and undefined entity/occasion/person/group/period etc. This feeling of longing can be accompanied or better described by an abstract will to be where the object of longing is.

Despite being hard to translate in full, ''saudade'' has equivalent words in other cultures, and is often related to music styles expressing this feeling such as the ''[[blues]]'' for African-Americans, ''[[Sehnsucht]]'' in German, ''[[wikt:dor#Romanian|dor]]'' in Romania, ''[[Tizita]]'' in Ethiopia, ''[[Hiraeth]]'' in Welsh, or ''Assouf'' for the [[Tuareg people]], appocundria in Neapolitan. In Slovak, the word is ''clivota'' or ''cnenie'', and in Czech, the word is ''stesk''. In Turkish, the word ''[[Hasret]]'' meaning longing, yearning or nostalgia has similar connotations.

The similar melancholic music style is known in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] as '''sevdah''' (ultimately from Arabic سَوْدَاء sawdā' : 'black [bile]', translation of the Greek µέλαινα χολή, mélaina cholē from which the term melancholy is derived).

==Elements==
[[File:Bertha Worms - Saudades de Nápoles, 1895.JPG|thumb|''Saudades de Nápoles'' (Missing Naples), 1895 by [[Bertha Worms]].]]

''Saudade'' is similar but not equal to [[nostalgia]], a word that also exists in Portuguese.

In the book ''In Portugal'' of 1912, A. F. G. Bell writes: {{quotation|The famous saudade of the Portuguese is a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the past or towards the future; not an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness.&lt;ref name="Bell, A.F. 1912 p. 402"/&gt;}}

A stronger form of ''saudade'' may be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as old ways and sayings; a lost lover who is sadly missed; a faraway place where one was raised; loved ones who have died; feelings and stimuli one used to have; and the faded, yet golden memories of youth. Although it relates to feelings of melancholy and fond memories of things/people/days gone by, it can be a rush of sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate and the hope of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide [[consolation]].

To F. D. Santos, ''Saudade'' as a noun has become a longing for longing itself: {{quotation|There was an evolution from saudades (plural) to Saudade (singular, preferably written with a capital S), which became a philosophical concept. ... Saudade has an object; however, its object has become itself, for it means 'nostalgia for nostalgia', a meta-nostalgia, a longing oriented toward the longing itself. It is no more the Loved One or the 'Return' that is desired, based on a sense of loss and absence. Now, Desire desires Desire itself, as in the poetry of ''love for love's sake'' in Arabic, or as in Lope de Vega's famous epigram about the Portuguese who was crying for his love for Love itself. Or, rather, as poetess Florbela Espanca put it, ''I long for the longings I don't have'' ('Anoitecer', Espanca 1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Santos|first1=Filipe D.|title=Education and the Boarding School Novel, The Work of José Régio|date=2017|publisher=Sense Publishers|location=Rotterdam|isbn=978-94-6300-739-9|page=102|url=https://books.google.pt/books?id=KqENDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Music===
As with all emotions, ''saudade'' has been an inspiration for many songs and compositions. "[[Sodade]]" (''saudade'' in [[Cape Verdean Creole]]) is the title of the [[Cape Verde]] singer [[Cesária Évora]]'s most famous song. [[Étienne Daho]], a French singer, also produced a song of the same name. ''[[The Good Son (album)|The Good Son]]'', a 1990 album by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], was heavily informed by Cave's mental state at the time, which he has described as ''saudade''. He told journalist Chris Bohn: "When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory of things that I thought were lost for me, I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was ''saudade''. It's not nostalgia but something sadder."

[[File:Cesária Évora 2008.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|upright=.79|Cape Verdean pop singer [[Cesária Évora]] had her biggest hit singing about ''saudade'']]
The usage of ''saudade'' as a theme in Portuguese music goes back to the 16th century, [[Portugal in the period of discoveries|the golden age of Portugal]]. ''Saudade'', as well as love suffering, is a common theme in many [[villancico]]s and [[cantiga]]s composed by Portuguese authors; for example: "Lágrimas de Saudade" (''tears of saudade''), which is an anonymous work from the ''[[Cancioneiro de Paris]]''. [[Fado]] is a Portuguese music style, generally sung by a single person (the ''fadista'') along with a [[Portuguese guitar]]. The most popular themes of fado are ''saudade'', nostalgia, jealousy, and short stories of the typical city quarters. [[Fado]] and ''saudade'' are intertwined key ideas in Portuguese culture. The word fado comes from Latin ''fatum'' meaning "fate" or "[[destiny]]". Fado is a musical cultural expression and recognition of this unassailable determinism which compels the resigned yearning of ''saudade'', a bitter-sweet, [[Existentialism|existential]] yearning and hopefulness towards something over which one has no control.

Spanish singer [[Julio Iglesias]], whose father is a [[Galician people|Galician]], speaks of ''saudade'' in his song "Un Canto a Galicia" (which roughly translates as "a song/chant for Galicia"). In the song, he passionately uses the phrase to describe a deep and sad longing for his motherland, Galicia. He also performs a song called "Morriñas", which describes the Galicians as having a deeply strong ''saudade''.

The Paraguayan guitarist [[Agustin Barrios]] wrote several pieces invoking the feeling of ''saudade'', including ''Choro de Saudade'' and ''Preludio Saudade''. The term is prominent in Brazilian popular music, including the first [[bossa nova]] song, "[[Chega de Saudade]]" ("No more ''saudade''", usually translated as "No More Blues"), written by [[Tom Jobim]].
Jazz pianist [[Bill Evans]] recorded the tune "Saudade de Brasil" numerous times. In 1919, on returning from two years in Brazil, the French composer [[Darius Milhaud]] composed a suite, ''[[Saudades do Brasil]]'', which exemplified the concept of ''saudade''. "Saudade (Part II)" is also the title of a flute solo by the band [[Shpongle]]. The singer [[Amália Rodrigues]] typified themes of ''saudade'' in some of her songs. J-Rock band [[Porno Graffitti]] has a song entitled "サウダージ", "Saudaaji" transliterated ("Saudade"). The alternative rock band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love And Rockets]] has a song named "Saudade" on their album ''[[Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven]]''. June 2012 brought Bearcat's release of their self-titled indie album that included a song called "Saudade".

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[jazz]]/Rock guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]] recorded a composition called "Saudade", the centerpiece of his 1996 album ''Focus in Time''. The Belgian electronic music band [[Arsenal_(Belgian_band)|Arsenal]] recorded a song called "Saudade" on their album ''Outsides'' (2005). The jazz fusion group [[Trio Beyond]], consisting of [[John Scofield]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], and [[Larry Goldings]] released in 2006 an album dedicated to drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] (1945–1997), called ''[[Saudades (Trio Beyond album)|Saudades]]''. Dance music artist Peter Corvaia released a progressive house track entitled "Saudade" on HeadRush Music, a sub-label of [[Toes in the Sand Recordings]]. New York City post-rock band [[Mice Parade]] released an album entitled ''[[Obrigado Saudade]]'' in 2004. [[Chris Rea]] also recorded a song entitled "Saudade Part 1 &amp; 2 (Tribute To Ayrton Senna)" as a tribute to [[Ayrton Senna]], the Brazilian three-times Formula One world champion killed on the track in May 1994. There is an ambient/noise/shoegazing band from Portland, Oregon, named Saudade. The rock band [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] has a Portuguese guitarist [[Nuno Bettencourt]]; the influence of his heritage can be seen in the band's album ''[[Saudades de Rock]]''. During recording, the mission statement was to bring back musicality to the medium. "Nancy Spain", a song by Barney Rush, made famous by an adaptation by [[Christy Moore]], is another example of the use of ''saudade'' in contemporary Irish music, the chorus of which is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No matter where I wander I'm still haunted by your name&lt;br /&gt;
The portrait of your beauty stays the same&lt;br /&gt;
Standing by the ocean wondering where you've gone&lt;br /&gt;
If you'll return again&lt;br /&gt;
Where is the ring I gave to Nancy Spain?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American singer/songwriter [[Grayson Hugh]] wrote a song called "Saudade" that he performed with jazz guitarist Norman Johnson on Johnson's 2013 album "Get It While You Can". 

Kingston-Upon-Hull IDM Electronica, Downtempo and Deep Groove legend, [[Steve Cobby]], of [[Fila Brazillia]], Solid Doctor, Heights of Abraham, the [[Twilight_as_Played_by_The_Twilight_Singers|Twilight Singers debut]] notoriety and other musical incarnations and collaborations, released a 12 track album " Saudade"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevecobby.co.uk/album/saudade|title=Saudade, by Steve Cobby|website=Déclassé Recordings}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2014 on DÉCLASSÉ Recordings.

==Literature==

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] author [[Fernando Pessoa]]'s posthumous collection of writings ''[[The Book of Disquiet]]'' is written almost entirely in a tone of saudade, and deals with themes of nostalgia and alienation.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Australian author [[Suneeta Peres Da Costa]]'s novella ''Saudade'' follows Maria, a young girl from a Goan immigrant family, growing up in a political hierarchy of racism and colonialism&lt;ref&gt;Saudade, Peres Da Costa, Giramondo Publishing, March 2018 https://giramondopublishing.com/product/saudade/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:Localización de Galicia.svg|alt=|thumb|The Spanish region of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (red) lies north of Portugal and shares a cultural history of ''saudade''.]]
''Saudade'' is also associated with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], where it is used similarly to the word ''morriña'' (longingness). Yet, morriña often implies a deeper stage of ''saudade'', a "''saudade'' so strong it can even kill," as the Galician saying goes. Morriña was a term often used by emigrant Galicians when talking about the Galician motherland they left behind. Although ''saudade'' is also a Galician word, the meaning of ''longing for something that might return'' is generally associated with ''morriña''. A literary example showing the understanding of the difference and the use of both words is the song ''Un canto a Galicia'' by [[Julio Iglesias]]. The word used by Galicians speaking Spanish has spread and become common in all Spain and even accepted by the [[Real Academia Española|Academia]].&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=morri%C3%B1a morriña]'' in the Spanish-language ''[[Diccionario de la Real Academia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portugal, ''morrinha'' is a word to describe sprinkles, while ''morrinhar'' means "to sprinkle." (The most common Portuguese equivalents are ''chuvisco'' and ''chuviscar'', respectively.) ''Morrinha'' is also used in northern Portugal for referring to sick animals, for example of sheep [[dropsy]],&lt;ref name="DRAE"/&gt; and occasionally to sick or sad people, often with irony. It is also used in some Brazilian regional dialects for the smell of wet or sick animals.

In [[Goa]], [[India]], which was a Portuguese colony until 1961, some Portuguese influences still remain. A suburb of [[Margão]], Goa's largest city, has a street named Rua de Saudades. It was aptly named because that very street has the Christian cemetery, the Hindu ''[[shmashana]]'' (cremation ground) and the Muslim ''qabrastan'' (cemetery). Most people living in the city of Margão who pass by this street would agree that the name of the street could not be any other, as they often think fond memories of a friend, loved one, or relative whose remains went past that road. The word ''saudade'' takes on a slightly different form in Portuguese-speaking Goan families for whom it implies the once-cherished but never-to-return days of glory of Goa as a prized possession of Portugal, a notion since then made redundant by the irrevocable cultural changes that occurred with the end of the Portuguese regime in these parts.

In [[Cape Verdean Creole]] there is the word ''sodadi'' (also spelled ''sodade''), originated in the Portuguese ''saudade'' and exactly with the same meaning.

In the [[metaphysics]] of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], the '''ship of Theseus''' — or  '''Theseus's paradox''' — is a [[thought experiment]] that raises the question of whether a ship—standing for an object in general—that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally [[Identity (philosophy)|the same object]].

==The thought experiment==

First, suppose that the famous ship sailed by the hero [[Theseus]] in a great battle has been kept in a harbour as a museum piece. As the years go by some of the wooden parts begin to rot and are replaced by new ones. After a century or so, all of the parts have been replaced.  Is the "restored" ship still the same object as the original?

Second, suppose that each of the removed pieces were stored in a warehouse, and after the century, technology develops to cure their rotting and enable them to be put back together to make a ship. Is this "reconstructed" ship the original ship? And if so, is the restored ship in the harbour still the original ship too?

==Proposed resolutions==

===No identity over time===
This theory states that two ships, while identical in all other ways, are not identical if they exist at two different times. Each ship-at-time is a unique "event".  So even without replacement of parts, the ships in the harbour are different at each time.  This theory is extreme in its denial of the everyday concept of identity, which is relied on by most people in everyday use.

The concept of identity might then be replaced with some other metaphysical device to fill its role. For example, we might consider "Ship Of Theseusness" to be a property or class which is applied to all the events in the harbour as well as to the reconstructed ship-events.

This solution was first introduced by the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] who attempted to solve the paradox by introducing the idea of a river where water replenishes it. [[Arius Didymus]] quoted him as saying "upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow".&lt;ref&gt;Didymus, Fr 39.2, Dox. gr. 471.4&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch disputed Heraclitus' claim about stepping twice into the same river, citing that it cannot be done because "it scatters and again comes together, and approaches and recedes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Plutarch |authorlink=Plutarch |title=On the 'E' at Delphi |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/misctracts/plutarchE.html |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continual identity over time via final cause===
According to the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] system of Aristotle and his followers, [[four causes]] or reasons describe a thing; these causes can be analyzed to get to a solution to the paradox. The [[formal cause]] or 'form' (perhaps best parsed as the cause of an object's form or of its having that form) is the design of a thing, while the [[material cause]] is the matter of which the thing is made.  Another of Aristotle's causes is the 'end' or [[final cause]], which is the intended purpose of a thing. The ship of Theseus would have the same ends, those being, mythically, transporting Theseus, and politically, convincing the Athenians that Theseus was once a living person, though its material cause would change with time. The [[efficient cause]] is how and by whom a thing is made, for example, how artisans fabricate and assemble something; in the case of the ship of Theseus, the workers who built the ship in the first place could have used the same tools and techniques to replace the planks in the ship.

According to Aristotle, the "what-it-is" of a thing is its formal cause, so the ship of Theseus is the 'same' ship, because the formal cause, or design, does not change, even though the matter used to construct it may vary with time. In the same manner, for Heraclitus's paradox, a river has the same formal cause, although the material cause (the particular water in it) changes with time, and likewise for the person who steps in the river.

This argument's validity and soundness as applied to the paradox depend on the accuracy not only of Aristotle's expressed premise that an object's formal cause is not only the primary or even sole determiner of its defining characteristic(s) or essence ("what-it-is") but also of the unstated, stronger premise that an object's formal cause is the sole determiner of its ''identity'' or "''which''-it-is" (''i.e.'', whether the previous and the later ships or rivers are the "same" ship or river).  This latter premise is subject to attack by [[indirect proof]]{{Clarify|reason=What's the difference between direct proof and indirect proof?|date=December 2017}} using arguments such as "Suppose two ships are built using the same design and exist at the same time until one sinks the other in battle.  Clearly the two ships are not the same ship even before, let alone after, one sinks the other, and yet the two have the same formal cause; therefore, formal cause cannot by itself suffice to determine an object's identity" or " [...] therefore, two objects' or object-instances' having the same formal cause does not by itself suffice to make them the same object or prove that they are the same object."{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===One ship in two locations===
In this theory, both the reconstructed and restored ships claim identity with the original, as they can both trace their histories back to it.   As such they are both identical with the original. As identity is a transitive relation, the two ships are therefore also identical with each other, and are a single ship existing in two locations at the same time.

===Two ships with non-transitive identity===
In this theory, the reconstructed and restored ships are considered to be separate objects, both are identical to the original, but they are not identical to each other.  This requires us to drop the transitivity of identity, ie. deny that "A = B" and "B = C" entails "A = C".

===Non-atomic logic===
A basic principle of [[logical atomism]] is that facts in the world exist independently of one another.  Only if we deny this principle then we can claim the following:   the restored ship claims continuity of parts with the original over time and so, in the absence of other arguments, claims identity with the original. However when the reconstructed ship is completed and announced to the world, it presents a better claim on continuity, which changes the status of the restored ship making it lose its identity with the original.  As a theory of observer-independent reality, this is hard to conceive; it involves both [[action at a distance]] and a violation of [[logical atomism]].  However it is more acceptable to Kantian style metaphysicists who  view their subject as a theory of psychology rather than reality, as it described what biological humans are likely to believe in practice. (For example, if these were real ships on display to the public for a fee, it seems likely that the public would pay to see the reconstructed rather than restored ship.)

===Definitions of "the same"===
One common argument found in the philosophical literature is that in the case of Heraclitus' river one is tripped up by two different definitions of "the same", in other words the [[vagueness]] of the term. In one sense, things can be "qualitatively identical", by sharing some properties. In another sense, they might be "numerically identical" by being "one". As an example, consider two different marbles that look identical. They would be qualitatively, but not numerically, identical; a marble can be numerically identical only to itself.

===Gradual loss of identity===
As the parts of the ship are replaced, the identity of the ship gradually changes, as the name "Theseus' Ship" is a truthful description only when the historical memory of Theseus' use of the ship - his physical contact with, and control of, its matter - is accurate. For example, the museum curator, prior to any restoration, may say with perfect truthfulness that the bed in the captain's cabin is the same bed in which Theseus himself once slept; but once the bed has been replaced, this is no longer true, and the claim would then be an imposture, because a different description would be more accurate, i.e.; "a replica of Theseus' bed." The new bed would be as foreign to Theseus as a completely new ship. This is true of every other piece of the original boat. As the parts are replaced, the new boat becomes exactly that: a new boat. Hobbes' proposed restored boat built from the original parts will be the original ship, as its parts are the actual pieces of matter that participated in Theseus' journeys.

===Four-dimensionalism===
{{Main|Perdurantism}}
[[Ted Sider]] and others have proposed that considering objects to extend across time as four-dimensional causal series of three-dimensional "time-slices" could solve the ship of Theseus problem because, in taking such an approach, all four-dimensional objects remain numerically identical to themselves while allowing individual time-slices to differ from each other.  The aforementioned river, therefore, comprises different three-dimensional time-slices of itself while remaining numerically identical to itself across time; one can never step into the same river-time-slice twice, but one can step into the same (four-dimensional) river twice.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis, "Survival and Identity" in Amelie O. Rorty [ed.] The Identities of Persons (1976; U. of California P.) Reprinted in his Philosophical Papers I.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical study ==
A 2010 psychology study reported that 20 members of the public considered the restored ship to be  the original while 24 considered the reconstructed to be the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ship of Theseus: Using Mathematical and Computational Models for Predicting Identity Judgments |url=http://www.cognitive-modeling.com/proceedings/papers/0045/paper0045.pdf |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The paradox had been discussed by other ancient philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]] and [[Plato]] prior to Plutarch's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Parmenides|last= Plato | first =  | translator-last=N. Fowler | translator-first=Harold |authorlink= Plato|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1925|location = London|pages = 139|url = http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg009.perseus-eng1:139|volume = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]]. Several [[#Variations|variants]] are known, including the '''grandfather's axe''', which has had both head and handle replaced, and the similar idea "[[Trigger's Broom]]".

This particular version of the paradox was first introduced in [[Greece|Greek]] [[legend]] as reported by the historian, biographer, and essayist [[Plutarch]]:

{{Quote|The ship wherein [[Theseus]] and the youth of [[Athens]] returned from [[Crete]] had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of [[Demetrius Phalereus]], for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.|Plutarch|''Theseus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Plutarch | first = | authorlink = Plutarch | coauthors = | title = Theseus (23.1) | work = | publisher = The Internet Classics Archive | date = | url = http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html | doi = | accessdate = 2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{anchor|hobbes_planks}}&lt;!-- Used for internal article link --&gt;
Plutarch thus questions whether the ship would remain the same if it were entirely replaced, piece by piece. Centuries later, the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] introduced a further puzzle, wondering what would happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a second ship.&lt;ref name='hobbes'&gt;''De Corpore'', ch 11.7&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes asked which ship, if either, would be the original Ship of Theseus.

==Applications==

The paradox appears in several more applied fields of philosophy.  

In [[philosophy of mind]], the ship is replaced by a person whose identity over time is called into question.

In both [[philosophy of law]] and practical [[law]], the paradox appears when the ownership of an object or of the rights to its name are disagreed in court. For example, groups of people such as companies, sports teams, and musical bands may all change their parts and see their old members re-form into rivals, leading to legal actions between the old and new entities. Also, texts and computer programs may be edited gradually but so heavily that none of the original remains, posing the legal question of whether the owners of the original have any claim on the result.

In [[ontological engineering]] such as the design of practical databases and AI systems, the paradox appears regularly when data objects change over time.

There are many more [[List of Ship of Theseus examples|examples]] of the paradox found in real-life and in fiction.

'''''The Copernican Revolution''''' is a 1957 book by the philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], in which the author provides an analysis of the [[Copernican Revolution]], documenting the pre-Ptolemaic understanding through the [[Ptolemaic system]] and its variants until the eventual acceptance of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian system]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhn argues that the Ptolemaic system provided broader appeal than a simple astronomical system but also became intertwined in broader philosophical and theological beliefs. Kuhn argues that this broader appeal made it more difficult for other systems to be proposed.&lt;ref name=butter&gt;

==Summation==
Kuhn summarized at the end of ''The Copernican Revolution'', citing the permanent achievements of Copernicus and Newton, while comparing the incommensurability of Newtonian physics with Aristotelian concepts that preceded the then new physics. Kuhn also noted that discoveries, such as that produced by Newton, were not in agreement with the prevailing world view during his lifetime.&lt;ref name=westman/&gt;

'''"The Three Types of Legitimate Rule"''' (''Die drei reinen Typen der legitimen Herrschaft'') is an [[essay]] written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[economist]] and [[sociologist]], explaining his [[tripartite classification of authority]].  Originally published in the journal ''Preussische Jahrbücher'' 187, 1-2, 1922, an English [[translation]], translated by Hans Gerth, was published in the journal ''Berkeley Publications in Society and Institutions'' 4(1): 1-11, 1958. Weber also refers to the three types of legitimate rule in his famous essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| Weber's ideas about legitimate rule also appear in his ''[[Basic Concepts in Sociology]]'' and ''[[The Theory of Social and Economic Organization]]''.

The translation of the German word [[Herrschaft (sociology)|Herrschaft]] is at the heart of understanding Weber's point about political legitimacy.  The translation ''Rule'' was employed in the 1958 essay translation by the key early Weber translator [[Hans Gerth]], and is in the title of the essay as translated here.  Other translators of Weber including  Alexander M. Henderson and [[Talcott Parsons]], translated Herrschaft as ''authority''.  Weber translators Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters discuss the difficulties in translating Herrschaft as well, typically using "dominion" and "domination" in addition to the original German Herrschaft&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Weber, [[belief]]s in the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of a [[political system]] go beyond [[philosophy]] and they directly contribute to the state system stability and [[authority]].&lt;ref name=rb294&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.294&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers have an explanation for their [[Superior (hierarchy)|superiority]], an explanation that is commonly accepted but during a crisis can be questioned.&lt;ref name=rb294/&gt; Weber sees only three categories of legitimation strategies (which he calls "[[pure type]]s") used to justify the right of rulers to rule:
* '''[[Legal authority]]''' is based on a system of [[law|rule]]s that is applied administratively and judicially in accordance with known principles. The persons who administer those rules are appointed or elected by legal procedures. Superiors are also subject to rules that limit their powers, separate their private lives from official duties and require written documentation.&lt;ref name=rb294/&gt;
* '''[[Traditional authority]]''' is based on a system in which authority is legitimate because it "has always existed". People in power usually enjoy it because they have inherited it. Officials consist either of personal retainers (in a [[Patrimonialism|patrimonial]] regime) or of personal loyal allies, such as [[vassal]]s or tributary lords (in a [[feudal regime]]). Their prerogatives are usually similar to those of the ruler above them, just reduced in scale, and they too are often selected based on inheritance.&lt;ref name=rb295&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.295&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Charismatic authority]]''' is based on the [[charisma]] of the leader, who shows that he possesses the right to lead by virtue of magical powers, prophecies, heroism, etc. His followers respect his right to lead because of his unique qualities (his charisma), not because of any tradition or legal rules. Officials consist of those who have shown personal devotion to the ruler, and of those who possess their own charisma.&lt;ref name=rb295/&gt;

The types of authority change over time, when the ruled are no longer satisfied with the system.&lt;ref name=rb297&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.297&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after the death of a charismatic leader his followers, if they lack the charisma of their predecessor, will try to institute a system based on tradition or law. On the other hand, these systems can be challenged by the appearance of a new charismatic leader, especially during economic or military crises.

These 'pure types' are almost always found in combination with other 'pure types' &amp;mdash; for example, [[familial charisma]] (important in [[kingship]] and the [[Indian caste system]]) is a combination of charismatic and traditional elements, while [http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3632148.html institutional charisma] (existing in all [[church organization]]s, but absent from a [[priesthood]] that fails to develop such an organization) is a mixture of charismatic and legal elements.

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Veritas''', meaning ''truth'', is the [[goddess]] of [[truth]], a daughter of Chronos, the God of Time (who has been identified with [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn-Cronus]], perhaps first by Plutarch), and the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]. She is also sometimes considered the daughter of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]] ''Olympian Ode 10'': But come, Muse, you and the daughter of Zeus, unforgettable Truth: with the hand that puts things right, keep from me the blame for lying, for wronging my friend. Approaching from far away, the future has arrived and made me ashamed of my deep debt. Still, payment with interest has a way of dissolving the bitter reproach of men.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D10]&lt;/ref&gt; or a creation of [[Prometheus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]] ''[[Aesop's Fables|Fables]]'' 530 (from [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] Appendix 5): [[Prometheus]], that potter who gave shape to our new generation, decided one day to sculpt a statue of Truth, using all his skill so that she would be able to regulate people's behaviour. As he was working, an unexpected summons from mighty Jupiter called him away. Prometheus left cunning Trickery in charge of his workshop (Trickery had recently become one of the god's apprentices). Fired by ambition, Trickery used the time at his disposal to fashion with his sly fingers a figure of the same size and appearance as Truth with identical features. When he had almost completed the piece, which was truly remarkable, he ran out of clay to use for her feet. The master returned, so Trickery quickly sat down in his seat, quaking with fear. Prometheus was amazed at the similarity of the two statues and wanted it to seem as if all the credit were due to his own skill. Therefore, he put both statues in the kiln and when they had been thoroughly baked, he infused them both with life: sacred Truth walked with measured steps, while her unfinished twin stood stuck in her tracks. That forgery, that product of subterfuge, thus acquired the name of Falsehood, and I readily agree with people who say that she has no feet: every once in a while something that is false can start off successfully, but with time the Truth is sure to prevail.[http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1472872/phaedrus095]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macey|first1=Samuel L.|title=Patriarchs of Time: Dualism in Saturn-Cronus, Father Time, the Watchmaker God, and Father Christmas|date=2010|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=9780820337975|pages=34-36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_z_R89DaPkC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elusive goddess is said to have hidden in the bottom of a [[holy well]].&lt;ref&gt;This aphorism is attributed [[Democritus]]: "Of truth we know nothing, for truth is in a well."

Veritas is also the name given to the [[Roman virtue]] of [[Honesty|truthfulness]], which was considered one of the main virtues any good Roman should possess. The Greek goddess of truth is [[Aletheia]] ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀλήθεια}}). The German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that the truth represented by ''aletheia'' (which essentially means "unconcealment") is different from that represented by ''veritas'', which is linked to a Roman understanding of rightness and finally to a Nietzschean sense of justice and a will to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=B.

In [[Western culture]], the word may also serve as a [[motto]].

==Mottos==
This [[Latin]] word "''veritas''" now appears in the [[motto]]s of many [[college]]s and [[university|universities]]. It is typically capitalized in mottoes (as "''Veritas''") for being an ideal (such as: Truth, Kindness and Beauty).  ''Veritas'' is the motto of [[Hutchesons' Grammar School]], [[Harvard University]], [[The University of Western Ontario]], [[Drake University]], [[Knox College (Illinois)]], [[Bilkent University]], the University of California - Hastings College of the Law, as well as the [[Dominican Order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Providence College]] and [[Molloy College]] which is run by the Dominicans. Additionally, the word appears in mottoes that are phrases, or lists e.g. the [[Buckley School (New York City)|Buckley School]] of the [[New York City|City of New York]] employs the phrase ''Honor et Veritas'', the [[University of Indonesia]]'s motto is "Veritas, Probitas, Iustitia", the [[University of Cape Coast]] in [[Ghana]]'s motto is "Veritas Nobis Lumen", the [[University of Michigan]]'s motto is: "Artes, Scientia, Veritas". [[Doshisha University]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]'s motto is "[[Veritas vos liberabit|Veritas Liberabit Vos]]".

[[Caldwell College]] in [[Caldwell, New Jersey]] issues a "Veritas Award" each year in honor of the [[Dominican Sisters]] who founded and administer the college. "Veritas" is included in the motto of [[Indiana University]] and [[Yale University]], ''Lux et Veritas'' ("Light and Truth"). It also appears on the [[California State University]]'s motto ''Vox Veritas Vita'' ("Speak the Truth as a way of Life"). "[[Veritas vos liberabit]]" ("The Truth Will Set You Free") is the motto of The [[Johns Hopkins University]]. ''Veritas Curat'' ("Truth Cures") is the motto of the [[JIPMER|Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research]], a medical school in [[Puducherry]], [[India]]. [[Howard University]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], goes by the motto "Veritas et Utilitas", translated to "Truth and Service", which is also a motto "Truth-Service" of [[Payap University]], [[Thailand]]. It also exists in the logo of [[Seoul National University]], Korea: "Veritas Lux Mea" &amp;ndash; meaning "Truth is my light". [[Villanova University]] also uses Veritas in its school motto, ''Veritas, Unitas, Caritas'' ("Truth, Unity, Love"). [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden also uses Veritas in its school motto, "Gratiae veritas naturae".

The [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], the U.S. Navy's primary counterintelligence arm and law enforcement agency, uses the motto on its official seal.

'''Waste hierarchy''' is a tool used in the evaluation of processes that [[Environmental protection|protect the environment]] alongside [[resource consumption|resource]] and [[energy consumption]] to most favourable to least favourable actions.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite web|first1=Wenke |last1=Hansen |first2=Maria |last2=Christopher |first3=Maic |last3=Verbuecheln |date=December 2002| title=EU Waste Policies and Challenges for Local and Regional Authorities|url=http://ecologic.eu/sites/files/download/projekte/1900-1949/1921-1922/1921-1922_background_paper_waste_en.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy establishes preferred program priorities based on [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;  To be sustainable, waste management cannot be solved only with technical end-of-pipe solutions and an integrated approach is necessary.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental Protection Agency |date=2013|title=Non-Hazardous Waste Management Hierarchy|url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/hierarchy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''waste management hierarchy''' indicates an order of preference for action to reduce and manage waste, and is usually presented diagrammatically in the form of a pyramid.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Environmental Program |year=2013 |url=http://www.unep.org/ietc/Portals/136/Publications/Waste%20Management/UNEP%20NWMS%20English.pdf |title=Guidelines for National Waste Management Strategies Moving from Challenges to Opportunities|isbn=978-92-807-3333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy captures the progression of a material or product through successive stages of [[waste management]], and represents the latter part of the [[Product lifecycle|life-cycle for each product]].&lt;ref name=UNEP/&gt;

The aim of the '''waste hierarchy''' is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste.  The proper application of the waste hierarchy can have several benefits. It can help prevent emissions of greenhouse gases, reduces pollutants, save energy, conserves resources, create jobs and stimulate the development of green technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waste-to-Energy Research and Technology Council |date=2009|title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.wtert.eu/default.asp?Menue=14&amp;ShowDok=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life-cycle thinking==

All products and services have [[environmental impact]]s, from the extraction of [[raw materials]] for production to manufacture, distribution, use and disposal.   Following the waste hierarchy will generally lead to the most [[resource-efficient]] and environmentally sound choice but in some cases refining decisions within the hierarchy or departing from it can lead to better environmental outcomes.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission|title=Life Cycle Thinking and Assessment for Waste Management|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/publications/pdf/Making_Sust_Consumption.pdf |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Product lifecycle|Life cycle]] thinking and assessment can be used to support decision-making in the area of [[waste management]] and to identify the best environmental options. It can help policy makers understand the benefits and trade-offs they have to face when making decisions on waste management strategies. [[Life-cycle assessment]] provides an approach to ensure that the best outcome for the environment can be identified and put in place.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  It involves looking at all stages of a product’s life to find where improvements can be made to reduce environmental impacts and improve the use or [[reuse]] of resources.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  A key goal is to avoid actions that shift negative impacts from one stage to another.  Life cycle thinking can be applied to the five stages of the waste management hierarchy.

For example, life-cycle analysis has shown that it is often better for the environment to replace an old washing machine, despite the waste generated, than to continue to use an older machine which is less [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]]. This is because a washing machine’s greatest environmental impact is during its use phase. Buying an energy-efficient machine and using low- temperature detergent reduce environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

The European Union Waste Framework Directive has introduced the concept of life-cycle thinking into [[waste policies]].&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  This duality approach gives a broader view of all environmental aspects and ensures any action has an overall benefit compared to other options.  The actions to deal with waste along the hierarchy should be compatible with other [[environmental initiative]]s.

== European Union waste framework directive ==

In 1975, The European Union’s [[Waste Framework Directive]] (1975/442/EEC) introduced for the first time the waste hierarchy concept into European waste policy.&lt;ref name=ECWaste&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission |date=2014 |title=EU Waste Legislation |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312223737/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized the importance of [[waste minimization]], and the [[Environmental protection|protection of the environment]] and [[human health]], as a priority. Following the 1975 Directive, European Union policy and legislation adapted to the principles of the waste hierarchy.

In 1989, it was formalized into a hierarchy of management options in the European Commission's Community Strategy for Waste Management and this waste strategy was further endorsed in the Commission's review in 1996.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK&gt;{{cite web|author=Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs|title=Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-applying-the-waste-hierarchy |publisher=gov.uk |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the European Union parliament introduced a new ''five-step waste hierarchy'' to its waste legislation, Directive 2008/98/EC, which member states must introduce into national waste management laws.&lt;ref name=ECWaste/&gt; Article 4 of the directive lays down a five-step hierarchy of waste management options which must be applied by Member States in this priority order.&lt;ref name=ECWaste/&gt;  Waste prevention, as the preferred option, is followed by reuse, recycling, recovery including [[energy recovery]] and as a last option, safe disposal. Among engineers, a similar hierarchy of waste management has been known as ARRE strategy: avoid, reduce, recycle, eliminate.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=197|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges for local and regional authorities ==
The task of implementing the waste hierarchy in waste management practices within a country may be delegated to the different levels of government (national, regional, local) and to other possible factors including industry, private companies and households. Local and regional authorities can be particularly challenged by the following issues when applying the waste hierarchy approach.&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt; 
* A coherent [[waste management]] strategy must be set up
* Separate [[garbage collection|collection]] and [[waste sorting|sorting]] systems for many different waste streams need to be established.
* Adequate [[waste treatment|treatment]] and disposal facilities must be established.
* An effective horizontal co-operation between local authorities and municipalities and a vertical co-operation between the different levels of government, local to regional and when beneficial, also at the national level need to established
* Finding financing for the establishing or upgrading of expensive sustainable waste management infrastructure to address the needs of managing waste
* A lack of data available on waste management strategies must be overcome and monitoring requirements must be met to implement the waste programs
* The enforcement and control of business plans and practices be established and applied to maximize benefits to the environment and human health
* A lack of administrative capacity at the regional and local level. The lack of finances, information, and technical expertise must be overcome for effective implementation and success of the waste management policies.

==Source reduction==
[[Source reduction]] involves efforts to reduce [[hazardous waste]] and other materials by modifying industrial production. Source reduction methods involve changes in manufacturing technology, [[raw material]] inputs, and product formulation. At times, the term "pollution prevention" may refer to source reduction.

Another method of source reduction is to increase incentives for recycling.  Many communities in the United States are implementing [[variable-rate pricing]] for waste disposal (also known as Pay As You Throw - [[PAYT]]) which has been effective in reducing the size of the [[municipal waste]] stream.&lt;ref name="ecocycle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocycle.org/zero/pay_throw.cfm|title=Pay-As-You-Throw - Let's Start|accessdate=2006-11-26|author=Mark Ruzzin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source reduction is typically measured by efficiencies and cutbacks in waste. [[Toxics use reduction]] is a more controversial approach to source reduction that targets and measures reductions in the upstream use of toxic materials. Toxics use reduction emphasizes the more preventive aspects of source reduction but, due to its emphasis on toxic chemical inputs, has been opposed more vigorously by chemical manufacturers. Toxics use reduction programs have been set up by legislation in some states, e.g., [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Oregon]]. The 3 R's represent the 'Waste Hierarchy' which lists the best ways of managing waste from the most to the least desirable. Many of the things we currently throw away could be reused again with just a little thought and imagination.

'''''Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad''''', 271 U.S. 500 (1926), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that a law passed by the US colonial government of the [[Philippines]] in 1921, Act No. 2972 of the [[Philippine Legislature]], known as the "Chinese Bookkeeping Act", was unconstitutional. It prevented business records from being kept in the [[Chinese language]].
