[[File:Adonis Mazarin Louvre MR239.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of the Roman deity ''Adonis'', who is revered as the primary deity in Adonism.]]
'''Adonism''' is a [[Modern paganism|Neopagan]] religion founded in 1925 by the German esotericist Franz Sättler (1884-c.1942), who often went by the pseudonym of Dr. Musalam. Although Sättler claimed that it was the continuation of an ancient pagan religion, it has been recognised by academics as being "instead the single-handed creation of a highly gifted and educated man", this figure being Sättler himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 07.&lt;/ref&gt; Adonism is a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion, revolving around a belief that there are five principal gods: [[Bel (mythology)|Belus]], [[Bêlit|Biltis]], [[Adonis]], [[Dido]] and [[Moloch|Molchos]]. [[Adonis]] is the most prominent of these in the group's theology, being a benevolent figure that Sättler equated with the Christian figure of [[Satan]]. In contrast to Adonis, Molchos is believed by Adonists to be malevolent, and to be responsible for the enslavement of humanity through [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]: the religion therefore has "a pronounced anti-Christian bias".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 05, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born into the [[Bohemia]]n region of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Franz Sättler proved himself to be a talented linguist, gaining a doctorate in the subject and publishing the world's first Persian-German dictionary. Subsequently travelling across much of Europe, he was imprisoned by the French during the [[First World War]], where he first came across [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and the [[occult]], topics which greatly interested him. Briefly becoming an intelligence agent for the Czechoslovak government, he was again arrested and imprisoned, this time in Germany, and whilst imprisoned here he began formulating some of his esoteric ideas and writing books on the subject. Released in the mid-1920s, he went on to begin propagating Adonism through the foundation of his Adonistic Society. Sättler would face legal trouble and a public scandal due to his beliefs in the 1930s, leading to him renaming the Society the Alliance of Orion, before it was eventually shut down by the [[Nazi]] government in 1939. Sättler himself disappeared in the early years of the following decade, with some believing that he was executed by the Nazi authorities.

Scholar Hans Thomas Hakl stated that "The influence of Adonism... on the German magical scene is substantial. It definitely influenced the German magus [[Friedrich Wilhelm Quintscher]] (1893-1945)... and also the [[Fraternitas Saturni]], the most interesting occult fraternity in modern Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 08.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the group's adherents have also claimed that Adonism was an influence on the German magician [[Franz Bardon]] (1909–1958), although this remains debatable as Bardon's magical beliefs differed to "a noticeable degree".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 08.&lt;/ref&gt; Hakl would also compare Sättler with two of his contemporaries in the European occult movement of the early twentieth century, the Englishman [[Aleister Crowley]] and the Armenian [[George Gurdjieff]], but noted that he never received the posthumous fame that these two experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs and practices ==
Sättler erroneously claimed that Adonism was an ancient religion which had been followed by the [[Babylon|Chaldeans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Egyptian|Egyptians]] and [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]]. He also made the claim that it survived in part amongst the [[Yezidis]] of the Middle East, and also among the people of Nuristan (a fictional place he considered to be separate to the actual [[Nuristan]] in [[Afghanistan]]). It was in this latter city that he claimed that there was a large temple, the "Bit Nur" (House of Light), where he claimed the original ancient Adonist scriptures were kept. Other than Sättler’s claims however, there is no evidence that Nuristan or the Bit Nur have ever existed. Sättler claimed that it was in this temple that he first learned about Adonism, and where he was given the name of Dr Mussalam.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adonism is a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion, believing in a number of different gods, of which there are five principal deities. Adonists believe that the first two of these were the primordial god [[Bel (mythology)|Belus]] and his consort [[Bêlit|Biltis]], and that they emerged from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]]. According to Adonistic beliefs, Belus and Biltis had a child, [[Moloch|Molchos]], who was a malevolent deity and who created a world populated with deformed monsters; because of the horror of it, Belus and Biltis destroyed this world, before going on to give birth to two more children, a benevolent son named Adonis and a daughter called Dido. Adonis then created our world, basing humanity upon the likeness of both himself and his sister, however Molchos then killed Adonis out of jealousy, taking control of the world. Being resurrected by Dido, Adonis then went on to try to protect humanity from Molchos' machinations, for instance telling one human, a man called [[Noah]], to build a wooden ark to save him and the other animal species from the [[Great Flood]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molchos, however, was not finished in his attempts to harm humanity. Aside from attacking them with plagues and sickness, he also sent false prophets such as [[Moses]], [[Zarathustra]], [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] to convert people to his [[monotheism|monotheistic]] worship under such names as [[Jehovah]], [[Ormuzd]] and [[Allah]]. Within these religions that venerate Molchos, such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], Adonists believe that Adonis, the creator and benefactor of humanity was demonised as such figures as [[Satan]], [[Ahriman]] and [[Iblis]]. Through the domination of these monotheistic religions, Adonists believe that Molchos maintained control of the world, but that in 2000 CE, Adonis will face Molchos in a final battle, defeating him and bringing about a [[Golden Age]], which will last until the universe is once more subsumed under Chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary way in which Adonis and Dido are celebrated in Adonistic religious practice is by the sensual enjoyment of [[sexual intercourse]], both of the [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]] varieties. Indeed, Sättler summarised his faith by remarking that "Adonism is worship of the Devil [i.e. Adonis] with an erotic background." He was therefore a prominent proponent of sexual reform in early nineteenth-century Germany, holding to beliefs that would later be legally accepted in the last decades of that century. Adonism also holds to a great belief in tolerance for other human beings, with Sättler stating that "The most important virtue of the Adonist is tolerance and the area in which he can practice it is boundless", and also holding to a personal maxim: "To understand everything means to pardon everything."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Sättler's early life: 1884-1925 ===
[[File:Musallam.jpg|thumb|right|A picture of the young Franz Sättler.]]
Sättler was born on 7 March 1884 as the son of a police constable in [[Most (Most District)|Most]], a city in northern [[Bohemia]], a Czech region which was then a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. There he attended elementary and then [[grammar school]], where he excelled in languages, learning [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] by the time that he left. He had also begun writing for a local newspaper. He began attending the [[Charles University of Prague]], where he initially studied [[philology]], but becoming bored of this, switched to [[Oriental studies]]. At the university, he became a favourite student of Professor Max Grünert, who gave Sättler the notes for a [[Persian language|Persian]]-German  dictionary that had been left unfinished by Dr Jakob Polak. Sättler completed the task, producing the first ever dictionary between the two languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he travelled to [[Montenegro]] and [[Albania]], being paid to do so by the Austrian Institute of Military Geography, who employed him to check the accuracy of their maps. The following year, he travelled to [[Dresden]] in Germany, where he met his literary idol, [[Karl May]], whose German-language adventure novels had inspired him as a child. In the latter part of 1906 and much of 1907, he again went travelling, this time visiting Albania, [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] (which he used as inspiration for several novels that he would later write), and in 1908 he then travelled to the north of Europe, visiting [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 he began studying for a [[doctorate]], earning it by writing a [[dissertation]] on the Arabian dialect of [[Hadramaut]], while in the same year marrying Anastasia Goldschmidt. Gaining employment at a private school for foreign languages in [[Prague]], he co-wrote two books on how to study the German language with the owner of the school. Using what he described as the "direct learning method", he attempted to teach people the language using the methods developed by [[Jan Amos Comenius]]. He then worked as a private tutor both in the house of Count Khevenhüller in [[Beirut]] and the consular school in [[Salonika]]. It was while he was here that the [[First World War]] broke out across Europe, and he began travelling across the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which was on the side of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French army subsequently invaded and occupied Saloniki at a time when he was staying there, and being a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he and his wife were taken prisoner and deported to an [[internment camp]] near [[Lourdes]] in France, where he was held until 1919. It was here that he befriended the camp's chief officer, M. Parizot, who was actively involved in the esoteric movement of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. Following their many discussions on the subject, Parizot transferred his library of occult books to the camp in order that Sättler could read them. These texts included the works of such figures as [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Annie Besant]], [[Charles Leadbeater]], [[Camille Flammarion]] and [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and these texts "formed the intellectual basis of his later occult career."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, following the end of the war, Sättler was released from his imprisonment, and travelled to [[Austria]], and then on to Germany, where he was apparently involved in intelligence work on behalf of the newly formed nation-state of [[Czechoslovakia]], using the pseudonym of Dr. Erich Bauer. In 1922 he was captured by the German authorities and sentenced to a four-year imprisonment in [[Brandenburg an der Havel]]. Here, he was once more allowed the use of the prison library, writing several books, including ''Buch der orientalischen Geheimnisse'' (Book of Oriental Secrets) and ''Zauberbibel'' (Magical Bible), the latter of which was divided into seven sections, each of which looked at a different occult practice: [[cartomancy]], [[astrology]], the interpretation of dreams, [[chiromancy]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[alchemy]] and [[necromancy]]. Meanwhile, Sättler divorced his wife, probably due to his affairs with other women.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sättler and the Adonistic Society: 1926-1931 ===
Being released from the German prison, Sättler returned to Austria in 1926, settling down in the city of [[Vienna]]. It was here that he first began propagating Adonism through the foundation of his Adonistic Society (known as the ''Adonistische Gesellschaft'' in his native German language), and "According to its published constitution and bylaws, this group was founded on 1 May 1925 - in other words, one year before Sättler actually came back to Vienna."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; "By 1927 Sättler had developed the whole doctrine of Adonism and written all the major treatises on it", declaring in the Society's constitution that the main group was also accompanied by the Adonistic Publishing House, the Master Lodge Hekate in Vienna, and various study lodges scattered across the German-speaking part of Europe. Whether these genuinely existed or not is unknown, although it is quite possible that they didn't, as his Adonistic Society was relatively small, not even being a registered organisation and the Austrian authorities in fact suspected him of being guilty of criminal fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the Adonistic Society was a sister organisation to an international group known as ''Nizâm-el Khâf'', which he claimed had branches in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Tehran]] and other major Asian cities; according to scholar Hans Thomas Hakl, this organisation was "almost certainly fictitious".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to entice interested individuals to join, Sättler described his Adonistic Society as a "large spiritual community" where "magical energies are continuously circulating, the inexhaustible source of which is the Master Lodge Hekate", so named after the [[Hekate|ancient Greek goddess of witchcraft]]. Membership applications and payment were to be sent directly to Sättler, and new members had to wait two years before they were permitted to learn the "deeper secrets" of Adonism, before they would be allowed to subscribe to a twelve-lesson course ending in an exam, successful completion of which would allow them to attain the third degree of a ''Châkim Kabâlit'', or a master of magic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sättler likely began an affair with his assistant in the Hekate Lodge, Justine Schnattinger, who herself worked under the pseudonym of "Madame Ariela" as a [[clairvoyant]], [[spirit medium]] and astrological councillor. Sättler was also a friend of the occultist [[Friedrich Wilhelm Quintscher]], who had joined the Society, but in 1929 their friendship broke up, possibly due to jealousy over Schnattinger. Quintscher remained devoted to the Adonist religion, continuing to propagate "its doctrine, cosmology, and principles even after he had broken with Sättler" and founding an Adonistic group called the Ateschga-Taganosyn. One of the members of this group was Brother Silias, also known as Josef Anton Schuster (1896–1968), who wrote a magical diary that became famous among the German occult movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The decline and death of Sättler: 1932-1942 ===
Although he had published a wide variety of books, both occult-based and otherwise (including a joke book), and had become entirely financially reliant on his publisher, Bartels of [[Berlin]], he was finding it very hard to make a living. In 1929 he began selling magical cures and other items which included talismans, love potions and even powder that allegedly belonged to the [[Dalai Lama]] to supplement this income, as well as founding a stock company called Olbia-Gold, through which he defrauded stock holders by telling them that he had discovered a gold treasure at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]] in Greece. With all these money-making activities that he was involved with, he became embroiled in a financial scandal in 1932, after which various journals began accusing him of being a fraud and a criminal. Facing criminal charges for defrauding customers of the Olbia-Gold company, he fled to Greece, where he was arrested in a case of [[mistaken identity]] by police who suspected him of being "a much more important Czech swindler."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigating his papers in Vienna, police came upon a list of the eighty German members of the Adonistic Society, causing yet another scandal in the press, who felt it shocking that so many members of "high society" were involved with such a secretive occult group that they accused of committing [[orgy|sexual orgies]]. With Sättler out of reach, police instead began investigating Quintscher and his alternate Adonist group, but he denied a continuing connection to his former friend. Meanwhile, Sättler continued with the Society, this time based in Greece, finding a new publisher, Biosophischer Verlag, who began printing his new monthly magazine, entitled ''Lucifer''. Finding it hard to get new members (who would bring with them the membership fees and donations that he needed to survive), Sättler dissolved the Hekate Lodge and renamed the Society the Alliance of Orion (''Orion Bund'' in German). Nonetheless, the group was having significant problems within Germany itself as it faced opposition from the [[Nazi Party]] who had recently taken control of the government, with some figures in the regime declaring the group to be a part of a [[Jews|Jewish]]-[[Freemason conspiracy|Masonic conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Sättler had apparently left Greece and moved to [[Petralka]] in [[Slovakia]], from where he offered courses in nature healing and magic. Meanwhile, in Germany, the Nazi government banned all quasi-Masonic organisations in July 1937, and while initially the Alliance of Orion was unusually exempt, they too were illegalised in June 1939. In the early 1940s, the Nazis ordered the invasion of much of the rest of Europe, leading to the [[Second World War]], and it was in this period that all historical trace of Sättler vanishes. It is unknown how he died, although it has been claimed that it was either in a Vienna prison or in [[Mauthausen concentration camp]], although neither of these remain proven.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adonism after Sättler: 1943-present ===
The first attempt to recreate the Adonist Society occurred in the 1950s by "an otherwise unknown" individual known as Walter Koblizek. He lived in [[Rosenheim]] near [[Munich]] in [[West Germany]], and published a brochure announcing the re-creation of the group, but nothing more appeared of it, and Koblizek died in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Adolf Hemberger (1929–1991), the holder of the Chair for Scientific Theory and Methodology of Research at the [[University of Gießen]], collected Sättler's rare works, making copies of them through [[mimeograph]]ing or [[photocopy]]ing them and distributing them among his friends and members of his magical study groups, C 72. In the 1970s, Hemberger had plans of reviving the Adonist Society, but these never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another German academic, Professor Helmut Möller of the [[University of Göttingen]], published a German language essay on Sättler in a 1990 ''festschrift'' in honour of Ellic Howe, an academic who had specialised in the study of ceremonial magical groups like the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Möl90|Möller 1990]].&lt;/ref&gt; His work was expanded upon by Hans Thomas Hakl, an Austrian independent scholar, who also made an examination of Sättler in the German language, which he followed by publishing an edited version in the English language, appearing in ''The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 07.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aestivation.png|thumb|A diagram showing some kinds of petal or sepal aestivation in flower buds. A: quincuncial; B: twisted ,C: cochleate; D: contorted; E: valvate; F: open.]]
'''Aestivation''' or '''estivation''' refers to the positional arrangement of the parts of a flower within a flower bud before it has opened. Aestivation is also sometimes referred to as '''praefoliation''' or '''prefoliation''', but these terms may also mean [[vernation]]: the arrangement of leaves within a vegetative bud.

Aestivation can be an important taxonomic diagnostic; for example [[Malvaceae]] flower buds have valvate sepals, with the exception of the genera ''[[Fremontodendron]]'' and ''[[Chiranthodendron]]'', which have sometimes been misplaced as a result.

The terms used to describe aestivation are the same as those used to describe leaf vernation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Hickey, M.|author2 =King, C. |year=2001 |title= The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Classes of aestivation include:

[[File:Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung I 1798-1799.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first volume, showing a portrait of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]].]]
The '''''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung''''' (''General music newspaper'') was a German-language periodical published in the 19th century. Comini (2008) has called it "the foremost German-language musical periodical of its time".&lt;ref&gt;Comini, Alessandra (2008) ''The Changing Image of Beethoven: A Study in Mythmaking''. Sunstone Press. {{ISBN|0-86534-661-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-86534-661-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It reviewed musical events taking place in many countries, focusing on the German-speaking nations, but also covering France, Italy, Russia, Britain, and even occasionally America.&lt;ref name=Barbour /&gt;

Its impartiality and adherence to basic principles of credibility and discretion regarding the personal position of those reviewed, assured and established itself in a high position as a periodical in the musical German society of the time, exercising great influence on the period.

==History==
The periodical appeared in two series: a weekly [[magazine]] published between 1798 and 1848, and a revived version which lasted from 1866 to 1882.&lt;ref name="ripm.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ripm.org/journals/AMZ.php |title=''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'': prepared by Karl Kügle |access-date=2009-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521100516/http://www.ripm.org/journals/AMZ.php |archive-date=2008-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher was [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] in [[Leipzig]] for the first period of publication and for the first three years of the second period; for the remainder of the periodical's history it was published by J. Reiter-Biedermann.&lt;ref name="ripm.org" /&gt; For a time during the second era it went by the title ''Leipziger Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' ("AmZ of Leipzig").

Much important material appeared in the magazine, including the serialized first version of [[Georg August Griesinger]]'s biography of [[Joseph Haydn]], and articles by scholar [[Gustav Nottebohm]] and critic [[Eduard Hanslick]].&lt;ref name="ripm.org" /&gt; The journal employed the famous critic [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] and published his influential review of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]. Both [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Franz Liszt]] published in the journal.

Somewhat less to its credit, the magazine also published the so-called "Rochlitz anecdotes," a series of vignettes about [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] written by the first editor. Today these anecdotes are widely considered to be heavily contaminated by material coming entirely from Rochlitz's own imagination (see [[Biographies of Mozart]] and [[Mozart's compositional method]]).

=== Editors ===
The editors of the ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' during its first 50-year period were:&lt;ref name=Barbour&gt;Barbour, J. Murray (1948) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/890433 "''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'': Prototype of Contemporary Musical Journalism."] ''Notes'', Second Series, 5:325–337. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]], for the first twenty years; he continued to contribute material for another seventeen.
* [[Gottfried Christoph Härtel]], the owner of the journal's publishing house, anonymously taking on editorship of the journal for ten years
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Fink]], who edited for fourteen years
* [[Carl Ferdinand Becker (organist)|Carl Ferdinand Becker]], a Leipzig organist, in 1842
* [[Moritz Hauptmann]], cantor at [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig]] in 1843
* a three-year hiatus without an editor
* [[Johann Christian Lobe]], for the last two and a half years.

=== ''Répertoire international de la presse musicale'' ===
The ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' has published volumes on both series:
*Ole Hass, ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung 1798–1848''. 14 vols. ''Répertoire International de la Presse Musicale'' (Baltimore, Maryland: RIPM, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripm.org/pdf/Introductions/ALZintroEnglish.pdf Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apolysis''' ({{lang-grc|ἀπόλυσις}} "discharge, lit. absolution") is the separation of the [[cuticle]] from the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] in [[arthropod]]s and related groups ([[Ecdysozoa]]). Since the cuticle of these animals is also the skeletal support of the body and is inelastic, it is shed during growth and a new covering of larger dimensions is formed. During this process, an arthropod becomes dormant for a period of time. [[Enzyme]]s are secreted to digest the inner layers of the existing cuticle, detaching the animal from the outer cuticle. This allows the new cuticle to develop without being exposed to the environmental elements.&lt;ref name="McGavin 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGavin|first=George C|title=Essential Entomology: An Order-by-Order Introduction|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198500025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Triplehorn 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Triplehorn|first=Charles A|title=Borror and DeLong's introduction to the study of insects.|year=2005|publisher=Thomson, Brooks/Cole|location=Australia|isbn=9780030968358|edition=7th|author2=Johnson, Norman F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jurenka&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jurenka, Russell |title=Insect Physiology |journal=Physiology and Maintenance |url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c03/E5-25-53-00.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After apolysis, [[ecdysis]] occurs. Ecdysis is the actual emergence of the arthropod into the environment and always occurs directly after apolysis. The newly emerged animal then hardens and continues its life.

The simplest propulsive systems are composed of [[cilia]] and [[flagella]]. Swimming has evolved a number of times in a range of organisms including [[arthropod]]s,  [[fish]], [[mollusc]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.

==Evolution of swimming==
Swimming evolved a number of times in unrelated lineages.  Supposed jellyfish fossils occur in the [[Ediacaran]], but the first free-swimming animals appear in the Early to Middle [[Cambrian]].  These are mostly related to the [[arthropod]]s, and include the [[Anomalocaridid]]s, which swam by means of lateral lobes in a fashion reminiscent of today's [[cuttlefish]].  Cephalopods joined the ranks of the [[nekton]] in the late Cambrian,&lt;ref name='Kroger2009'&gt;{{cite journal| last2 = Yun-bai| first1 = B.| first2 = Y.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many terrestrial animals retain some capacity to swim, however some have returned to the water and developed the capacities for aquatic locomotion. Most [[apes]] (including humans), however, lost the swimming [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/behavior-water |title=Behavior In Water|publisher=[[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]]| accessdate =2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Pedro Renato Bender, a research fellow at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]'s Institute for Human Evolution, proposed a theory to explain the loss of that instinct. Termed the Saci last common ancestor hypothesis (after [[Saci (Brazilian folklore)|Saci]], a Brazilian folklore character who cannot cross water barriers), it holds that the loss of instinctive swimming ability in apes is best explained as a consequence of constraints related to the adaptation to an arboreal life in the [[last common ancestor]] of apes.&lt;ref name="bender"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/16924/Dissertation%20Convergence%20Bender%203%20August%202014.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The use of convergence as a tool in the reconstruction of human past, with special focus on water use in hominin evolution|publisher=WIReDSpace (Wits Institutional Repository on DSpace)| accessdate =2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bender hypothesized that the ancestral ape increasingly avoided deep-water bodies when the risks of being exposed to water were clearly higher than the advantages of crossing them.&lt;ref name="bender"/&gt; A decreasing contact with water bodies then could have led to the disaappearance of the [[doggy paddle]] instinct.&lt;ref name="bender"/&gt;

===Ciliates===
[[Ciliates]] use small flagella called [[cilia]] to move through the water. One ciliate will generally have hundreds to thousands of cilia that are densely packed together in arrays. During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|thumb|70px|left|Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation]]

===Flagellates===
Certain organisms such as [[bacteria]] and animal sperm have [[flagellum]] which have developed a way to move in liquid environments. A rotary motor model shows that bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum. The direction of rotation of the flagella in bacteria comes from the occupancy of the proton channels along the perimeter of the flagellar motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Brady, Richard M. |title= Torque and switching in the bacterial flagellar motor. An electrostatic model|journal= Biophysical Journal |volume= 64 |issue= 4| year = 1993 | pages = 961–973|bibcode = 1993BpJ....64..961B |doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81462-0 |pmid= 7684268|pmc= 1262414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movement of sperm is called [[sperm motility]]. The middle of the mammalian spermatozoon contains mitochondria that power the movement of the flagellum of the sperm. The motor around the base produces torque, just like in bacteria for movement through the aqueous environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Mortimer, Sharon T.|title= A critical review of the physiological importance and analysis of sperm movement in mammals |journal= Human Reproduction Update | volume= 3 |issue= 5 | year = 1997 | pages = 403–439 | doi=10.1093/humupd/3.5.403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudopodia===
Movement using a pseudopod is accomplished through increases in pressure at one point on the [[cell membrane]].  This pressure increase is the result of [[actin]] polymerization between the cortex and the membrane.  As the pressure increases the [[cell membrane]] is pushed outward creating the pseudopod.  When the pseudopod moves outward, the rest of the body is pulled forward by cortical tension.  The result is cell movement through the [[fluid]] medium.  Furthermore, the direction of movement is determined by [[chemotaxis]].  When chemoattraction occurs in a particular area of the [[cell membrane]], [[actin]] polymerization can begin and move the cell in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. P.

[[File:Penaeus diagram pleopods.png|thumb|right|[[Shrimp]] paddle with special swimming legs ([[pleopods]])]]
[[File:Daphnia pulex.png|thumb|right|[[Daphnia]] swims by beating its antennae]]

Among the [[radiata]], jellyfish and their kin, the main form of swimming is to flex their cup shaped bodies. All [[jellyfish]] are free-swimming, although many of these spend most of their time swimming passively.  Passive swimming is akin to gliding;  the organism floats, using currents where it can, and does not exert any energy into controlling its position or motion.  Active swimming, in contrast, involves the expenditure of energy to travel to a desired location.

In [[bilateria]], there are many methods of swimming. The [[arrow worm]]s ([[chaetognatha]]) undulate their finned bodies, not unlike fish. [[Nematode]]s swim by undulating their fin-less bodies. Some [[Arthropod]] groups can swim - including many [[crustacean]]s. Most crustaceans, such as [[shrimp]], will usually swim by paddling with special swimming legs ([[pleopods]]). [[Swimming crab]]s swim with modified walking legs ([[pereiopod]]s). [[Daphnia]], a crustacean, swims by beating its antennae instead.

There are also a number of forms of swimming [[mollusc]]s.  Many free-swimming [[sea slug]]s, such as [[sea angel]]s, flap fin-like structures. Some shelled molluscs, such as [[scallop]]s can briefly swim by clapping their two shells open and closed. The molluscs most evolved for swimming are the [[cephalopod]]s.

Among the [[Deuterostomia]], there are a number of swimmers as well. [[Feather star]]s can swim by undulating their many arms [http://video.mx.msn.com/watch/video/beautiful-swimming-feather-star/8dw7iajz]. [[Salp]]s move by pumping waters through their gelatinous bodies. The deuterosomes most evolved for swimming are found among the [[vertebrate]]s, notably the [[fish]].

{{main|Jet propulsion}}

[[Jet propulsion]] is a method of aquatic locomotion where animals fill a muscular cavity and squirt out water to propel them in the opposite direction of the squirting water. Most organisms are equipped with one of two designs for jet propulsion; they can draw water from the rear and expel it from the rear, such as jellyfish, or draw water from front and expel it from the rear, such as salps. Filling up the cavity causes an increase in both the mass and drag of the animal. Because of the expanse of the contracting cavity, the animal's velocity fluctuates as it moves through the water, accelerating while expelling water and decelerating while vacuuming water. Even though these fluctuations in drag and mass can be ignored if the frequency of the jet-propulsion cycles is high enough, jet-propulsion is a relatively inefficient method of aquatic locomotion.

All [[cephalopod]]s can move by [[jet propulsion]], but this is a very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish.&lt;ref name="mollusca12-11"/&gt; The relative efficiency of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases. Since the Paleozoic, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity.&lt;ref name="mollusca12"&gt;{{The Mollusca|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stop-start motion provided by the jets, however, continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed - not least when capturing prey or avoiding predators.&lt;ref name="mollusca12"/&gt; Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name=Cephalopods&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-19-852761-9|author1=Marion Nixon |author2=J.Z. Young |author2link=John Zachary Young |year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|title=The brains and lives of cephalopods}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Preface}} and they can out accelerate most fish.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1990&gt;{{cite book|title=Squid as Experimental Animals|author=Daniel L.

|isbn = 978-0-306-43513-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygenated water is taken into the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle cavity]] to the [[gill]]s and through muscular contraction of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the [[hyponome]], created by a fold in the mantle. Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece, &amp; Mitchell, p.612&lt;/ref&gt; Most cephalopods float (i.e. are [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]]), so do not need to swim to remain afloat.&lt;ref name="mollusca12-11"&gt;{{The Mollusca|chapter=11: Evolution of Buoyancy and Locomotion in recent cephalopods|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Squid]] swim more slowly than fish, but use more power to generate their speed. The loss in efficiency is due to the amount of water the squid can accelerate out of its mantle cavity.&lt;ref name="Levinton"&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S. Marine Biology: Function, Biodiversity, Ecology. 3rd ed. New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jellyfish]] use a one-way water cavity design which generates a phase of continuous cycles of jet-propulsion followed by a rest phase. The Froude efficiency is about 0.09, which indicates a very costly method of locomotion. The metabolic cost of transport for jellyfish is high when compared to a fish of equal mass.

Other jet-propelled animals have similar problems in efficiency. [[Scallop]]s, which use a similar design to jellyfish, swim by quickly opening and closing their shells, which draws in water and expels it from all sides. This locomotion is used as a means to escape predators such as [[starfish]]. Afterwards, the shell acts as a [[hydrofoil]] to counteract the scallop's tendency to sink. The Froude efficiency is low for this type of movement, about 0.3, which is why it's used as an emergency escape mechanism from predators. However, the amount of work the scallop has to do is mitigated by the elastic hinge that connects the two shells of the bivalve. Squids swim by drawing water into their mantle cavity and expelling it through their siphon. The Froude efficiency of their jet-propulsion system is around 0.29, which is much lower than a fish of the same mass.

Much of the work done by scallop muscles to close its shell is stored as elastic energy in abductin tissue, which acts as a spring to open the shell. The elasticity causes the work done against the water to be low because of the large openings the water has to enter and the small openings the water has to leave. The inertial work of scallop jet-propulsion is also low. Because of the low inertial work, the energy savings created by the elastic tissue is so small that it's negligible. Medusae can also use their elastic mesoglea to enlarge their bell. Their mantle contains a layer of muscle sandwiched between elastic fibers. The muscle fibers run around the bell circumferentially while the elastic fibers run through the muscle and along the sides of the bell to prevent lengthening. After making a single contraction, the bell vibrates passively at the resonant frequency to refill the bell. However, in contrast with scallops, the inertial work is similar to the hydrodynamic work due to how medusas expel water - through a large opening at low velocity. Because of this, the negative pressure created by the vibrating cavity is lower than the positive pressure of the jet, meaning that inertial work of the mantle is small. Thus, jet-propulsion is shown as an inefficient swimming technique.&lt;ref name="Levinton"/&gt;

==Fish==

{{See also|Fish locomotion}}

Many [[fish]] swim through water by creating [[Undulatory locomotion|undulations]] with their bodies or oscillating their [[Fish fin|fins]]. The undulations create components of forward thrust complemented by a rearward force, side forces which are wasted portions of energy, and a normal force that is between the forward thrust and side force. Different fish swim by undulating different parts of their bodies. Eel-shaped fish undulate their entire body in rhythmic sequences. Streamlined fish, such as salmon, undulate the caudal portions of their bodies. Some fish, such as sharks, use stiff, strong fins to create dynamic lift and propel themselves. It is common for fish to use more than one form of propulsion, although they will display one dominant mode of swimming &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;McNeill Alexander, R. Exploring Biomechanics: Animals in Motion. 2nd ed. New York, New York: W. H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gait changes have even been observed in juvenile reef fish of various sizes. Depending on their needs, fish can rapidly alternate between synchronized fin beats and alternating fin beats.&lt;ref name="Hale et al"&gt;Hale, Melina, R. Day, D. Thorsen, M. Westneat. 2006. Pectoral fin coordination and gait transitions in steadily swimming juvenile reef fishes. The Journal of Experimental Biology (209): 3708-3718.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Guinness World Records]] 2009'', ''[[Hippocampus zosterae]]'' (the dwarf seahorse) is the slowest moving fish, with a top speed of about {{convert|5|ft|cm}} per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness Book of World Records]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; They swim very poorly, rapidly fluttering a [[dorsal fin]] and using [[pectoral fin]]s (located behind their eyes) to steer. Seahorses have no [[caudal fin]].

===Body-caudal fin (BCF) propulsion===
*Anguilliform: Anguilliform swimmers are typically slow swimmers. They undulate the majority of their body and use their head as the fulcrum for the load they are moving. At any point during their undulation, their body has an amplitude between 0.5-1.0 wavelengths. The amplitude that they move their body through allows them to swim backwards.   Anguilliform locomotion is usually seen in fish with long, slender bodies like [[eels]], [[lampreys]], [[oarfish]], and a number of [[catfish]] species.
*Subcarangiform, Carangiform, Thunniform: These swimmers undulate the posterior half of their body and are much faster than anguilliform swimmers. At any point while they are swimming, a wavelength &lt;1  can be seen in the undulation pattern of the body. Some Carangiform swimmers include nurse sharks, bamboo sharks, and reef sharks. Thunniform swimmers are very fast and some common Thunniform swimmers include tuna, white sharks, salmon, jacks, and mako sharks{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Thunniform swimmers only undulate their high [[aspect ratio]] caudal fin, so they are usually very stiff to push more water out of the way.
*Ostraciiform: Ostraciiform swimmers oscillate their caudal region, making them relatively slow swimmers.  Boxfish, torpedo rays, and momyrs employ Ostraciiform locomotion. The cow fish uses Osctraciiform locomotion to hover in the water column.&lt;ref name="Sfakiotakis et al"&gt;Sfakiotakis, Michael, D. Lane, B. Davies. 1999. Review of Fish Swimming Modes for Aquatic Locomotion. Journal of Oceanic Engineering (24:2) 237-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Median paired fin (MPF) propulsion===
*Tetraodoniform, Balistiform, Diodontiform: These swimmers oscillate their median fins. They are typically slow swimmers, and some notable examples include the [[oceanic sunfish]] (which has extremely modified anal and dorsal fins), puffer fish, and triggerfish.
*Rajiform, Amiiform, Gymnotiform: This locomotory mode is accomplished by undulation of the pectoral and median fins. During their undulation pattern, a wavelength &gt;1 can be seen in their fins. They are typically slow to moderate swimmers, and some examples include rays, bowfin, and knife fishes. The [[black ghost knife fish]] is a Gymnotiform swimmer that has a very long ventral ribbon fin. Thrust is produced by passing waves down the ribbon fin while the body remains rigid. This also allows the ghost knife fish to swim in reverse.
*Labriform: Labriform swimmers are also slow swimmers. They oscillate their pectoral fins to create thrust. Oscillating fins create thrust when a starting vortex is shed from the trailing edge of the fin. As the foil departs from the starting vortex, the effect of that vortex diminishes, while the bound circulation remains, producing lift. Labriform swimming can be viewed as continuously starting and stopping. [[Wrasses]] and surf perch are common Labriform swimmers.&lt;ref name="Sfakiotakis et al" /&gt;

===Hydrofoils===
[[File:Triakis semifasciata monterey.jpg|thumb|right|The [[leopard shark]] angles its [[pectoral fin]]s so they behave as hydrofoils to control the animal's [[Flight dynamics|pitch]]]]

[[Hydrofoils]], or [[fin]]s, are used to push against the water to create a normal force to provide thrust, propelling the animal through water. Sea turtles and penguins beat their paired hydrofoils to create lift. Some paired fins, such as pectoral fins on leopard sharks, can be angled at varying degrees to allow the animal to rise, fall, or maintain its level in the water column. The reduction of fin surface area helps to minimize drag, and therefore increase efficiency. Regardless of size of the animal, at any particular speed, maximum possible lift is proportional to (wing area) x (speed)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Dolphins and whales have large, horizontal caudal hydrofoils, while many fish and sharks have vertical caudal hydrofoils. Porpoising (seen in cetaceans, penguins, and pinnipeds) may save energy if they are moving fast. Since drag increases with speed, the work required to swim unit distance is greater at higher speeds, but the work needed to jump unit distance is independent of speed. Seals propel themselves through the water with their caudal tail, while sea lions create thrust solely with their pectoral flippers.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

===Drag powered swimming===
[[File:Hippocampus.jpg|thumb|140px|right|The slowest-moving fishes are the [[sea horse]]s, often found in [[Coral reef fish|reefs]]]]

As with moving through any fluid, friction is created when molecules of the fluid collide with organism. The collision causes drag against moving fish, which is why many fish are streamlined in shape. Streamlined shapes work to reduce drag by orienting elongated objects parallel to the force of drag, therefore allowing the current to pass over and taper off the end of the fish. This streamlined shape allows for more efficient use of energy locomotion. Some flat-shaped fish can take advantage of pressure drag by having a flat bottom surface and curved top surface. The pressure drag created allows for the upward lift of the fish.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;

Appendages of aquatic organisms propel them in two main and biomechanically extreme mechanisms. Some use lift powered swimming, which can be compared to flying as appendages flap like wings, and reduce drag on the surface of the appendage. Others use drag powered swimming, which can be compared to oars rowing a boat, with movement in a horizontal plane, or paddling, with movement in the parasagittal plane.

Drag swimmers use a cyclic motion where they push water back in a power stroke, and return their limb forward in the return or recovery stroke. When they push water directly backwards, this moves their body forward, but as they return their limbs to the starting position, they push water forward, which will thus pull them back to some degree, and so opposes the direction that the body is heading. This opposing force is called [[drag (physics)|drag]]. The return-stroke drag causes drag swimmers to employ different strategies than lift swimmers. Reducing drag on the return stroke is essential for optimizing efficiency. For example, ducks paddle through the water spreading the webs of their feet as they move water back, and then when they return their feet to the front they pull their webs together to reduce the subsequent pull of water forward. The legs of water beetles have little hairs which spread out to catch up and move water back in the power stroke, but lay flat as the appendage moves forward in the return stroke. Also, the water beetle's legs have a side that is wider and is held perpendicular to the motion when pushing backward, but the leg is then rotated when the limb is to return forward, so that the thinner side will catch up less water.&lt;ref name="Lauder"&gt;Lauder, G., and Jayne, B. Pectoral fin Locomotion in Fishes: Testing Drag-Based Models Using Three-Dimensional Kinematics. Oxford Journals. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag swimmers experience a lessened efficiency in swimming due to resistance which affects their optimum speed. The less drag a fish experiences, the more it will be able to maintain higher speeds. Morphology of the fish can be designed to reduce drag, such as streamlining the body. The cost of transport is much higher for the drag swimmer, and when deviating from its optimum speed, the drag swimmer is energetically strained much more than the lift swimmer. There are natural processes in place to optimize energy use, and it is thought that adjustments of metabolic rates can compensate in part for mechanical disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Ohlberger"&gt;Ohlberger, J., G. Staaks, and F. Hoker. Swimming efficiency and the influence of morphology on swimming costs in fishes. J Comp Physiol B. 176: 17-25. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semi-aquatic animals compared to fully aquatic animals exhibit exacerbation of drag. Design that allows them to function out of the water limits the efficiency possible to be reached when in the water. In water swimming at the surface exposes them to resistive wave drag and is associated with a higher cost than submerged swimming.  Swimming below the surface exposes them to resistance due to return strokes and pressure, but primarily friction. Frictional drag is due to fluid viscosity and morphology characteristics. Pressure drag is due to the difference of water flow around the body and is also affected by body morphology.  Semi-aquatic organisms encounter increased resistive forces when in or out of the water, as they are not specialized for either habitat. The morphology of otters and beavers, for example, must meet needs for both environments. Their fur decreases streamlining and creates additional drag. The platypus may be a good example of an intermediate between drag and lift swimmers because it has been shown to have a rowing mechanism which is similar to lift-based pectoral oscillation. The limbs of semi-aquatic organisms are reserved for use on land and using them in water not only increases the cost of locomotion, but limits them to drag-based modes.&lt;ref name="Fish"&gt;Fish, Frank E. Biomechanics and Energetics in Aquatic and Semiaquatic Mammals: Platypus to Whale. Chicago Journals. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although they are less efficient, drag swimmers are able to produce more thrust at low speeds than lift swimmers. They are also thought to be better for maneuverability due to the large thrust produced.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, J., and M. Westneat. Mechanical Performance of aquatic  rowing and flying. The Royal Society. 10.1098. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphibians==
[[File:Frog žába.gif|thumb|Common toad (''Bufo bufo'') swimming]]
Most of the Amphibia have a larval state, which has inherited anguilliform motion, and a laterally compressed tail to go with it, from fish ancestors.
The corresponding tetrapod adult forms, even in the tail-retaining sub-class [[Urodeles]], are sometimes aquatic to only a negligible extent (as in the genus
[[Salamandra]], whose tail has lost its suitability for aquatic propulsion), but the majority of [[Urodeles]], from the newts to the giant salamander Megalobatrachus,
retain a laterally compressed tail for a life that is aquatic to a considerable degree, which can use in a carangiform motion.&lt;ref name="Lighthill "&gt;Lighthill , MJ. Hydromechanics of Aquatic Animal Propulsion- Annu. Rev. Fluid. Mech. - 1969 1-413-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the tailless [[amphibians]] (the [[frogs]] and [[toads]] of the sub-class [[Anura (frog)|Anura]]) the majority are aquatic to an insignificant extent in adult life, but in that considerable minority that are mainly aquatic we encounter for the first time the problem of adapting the tailless-tetrapod structure for aquatic propulsion. The mode that they use is unrelated to any used by fish. With their flexible back legs and webbed feet they execute something close to the leg movements of a human 'breast stroke,' rather more efficiently because the legs are better streamlined.&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

==Reptiles==
[[File:CrocoLoco-swimming-01.jpg|thumb|Nile crocodile (''[[Crocodylus niloticus]]'') swimming]]
From the point of view of aquatic propulsion, the descent of modern members of the class [[Reptilia]] from archaic tailed [[Amphibia]] is most obvious in the case of the order [[Crocodilia]] ([[crocodiles]] and [[alligators]]), which use their deep, laterally compressed tails in an essentially carangiform mode of propulsion (see [[Fish locomotion#Carangiform]]).&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

Terrestrial [[snakes]], in spite of their 'bad' hydromechanical shape with roughly circular cross-section and gradual posterior taper, swim fairly readily when required, by an anguilliform propulsion (see [[Fish locomotion#Anguilliform]]).&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

[[Cheloniidae]] (true [[turtles]]) have found a beautiful solution to the problem of [[tetrapod]] swimming through the development of their forelimbs into flippers of high-aspect-ratio wing shape, with which they imitate a bird's propulsive mode more accurately than do the eagle-rays themselves.

==Fin and flipper locomotion==
{{main|Fin and flipper locomotion}}
[[File:Otariidae Phocidae Comparative Anatomy.svg|thumb|Comparative skeletal anatomy of a typical otariid seal and a typical phocid seal]]
Aquatic reptiles such as [[sea turtles]] and extinct species like [[Pliosauroids]] predominantly use their pectoral flippers to propel themselves through the water and their pelvic flippers for maneuvering. During swimming they move their pectoral flippers in a [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventral motion]], causing forward motion. During swimming, they rotate their front flippers to decrease drag through the water column and increase efficiency. Newly hatched sea turtles exhibit several behavioral skills that help orientate themselves towards the ocean as well as identifying the transition from sand to water. If rotated in the pitch, yaw or roll direction, the hatchlings are capable of counteracting the forces acting upon them by correcting with either their pectoral or pelvic flippers and redirecting themselves towards the open ocean.

Among mammals [[otariids]] ([[fur seals]]) swim primarily with their front flippers, using the rear flippers for steering, and [[phocids]] ([[true seals]]) move the rear flippers laterally, pushing the animal through the water.

==Escape reactions==
[[File:Caridoid escape reaction.gif|200px|thumb|Animated representation of [[caridoid escape reaction|lobstering]]|left]]

Some arthropods, such as [[lobster]]s and [[shrimp]]s, can propel themselves backwards quickly by flicking their tail, known as lobstering or the [[caridoid escape reaction]].

Varieties of fish, such as teleosts, also use fast-starts to escape from predators. Fast-starts are characterized by the muscle contraction on one side of the fish twisting the fish into a C-shape. Afterwards, muscle contraction occurs on the opposite side to allow the fish to enter into a steady swimming state with waves of undulation traveling alongside the body. The power of the bending motion comes from fast-twitch muscle fibers located in the central region of the fish. The signal to perform this contraction comes from a set of [[Mauthner cells]] which simultaneously send a signal to the muscles on one side of the fish.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;Wakeling, James M. and Ian A. Johnston. "Body bending during fast-starts in fish can be explain in terms of muscle torque and hydrodynamic resistance." The Journal of Experimental Biology 202.6 (1999): 675-682.&lt;/ref&gt; Mauthner cells are activated when something startles the fish and can be activated by visual&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Eaton, Robert C. et al. "The Mauthner-initiated startle response in teleost fish." F. exp. Biol. 66 (1977): 65-81.&lt;/ref&gt; or sound-based stimuli.

Fast-starts are split up into three stages. Stage one, which is called the preparatory stroke, is characterized by the initial bending to a C-shape with small delay caused by hydrodynamic resistance. Stage two, the propulsive stroke, involves the body bending rapidly to the other side, which may occur multiple times. Stage three, the rest phase, cause the fish to return to normal steady-state swimming and the body undulations begin to cease. Large muscles located closer to the central portion of the fish are stronger and generate more force than the muscles in the tail. This asymmetry in muscle composition causes body undulations that occur in Stage 3. Once the fast-start is completed, the position of the fish has been shown to have a certain level of unpredictability, which helps fish survive against predators.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

The rate at which the body can bend is limited by resistance contained in the inertia of each body part. However, this inertia assists the fish in creating propulsion as a result of the momentum created against the water. The forward propulsion created from C-starts, and steady-state swimming in general, is a result of the body of the fish pushing against the water. Waves of undulation create rearward momentum against the water providing the forward thrust required to push the fish forward.&lt;ref name="Wakeling"&gt;Wakeling, J.M. "Biomechanics of fast-start swimming in fish." Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A.131 (2001): 31-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==
{{See also|Froude number}}

The Froude propulsion efficiency is defined as the ratio of power output to the power input:

{{math|''nf'' {{=}} 2''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / (''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}

where U1 = free stream velocity and U2 = jet velocity. A good efficiency for carangiform propulsion is between 50 and 80%.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

===Minimizing drag===
Pressure differences occur outside the boundary layer of swimming organisms due to disrupted flow around the body.  The difference on the up- and down-stream surfaces of the body is pressure [[drag (physics)|drag]], which creates a downstream force on the object.  Frictional drag, on the other hand, is a result of fluid viscosity in the [[boundary layer]].  Higher [[turbulence]] causes greater frictional drag.&lt;ref name=Levinton/&gt;

[[Reynolds number]] (Re) is the measure of the relationships between inertial and viscous forces in flow ((animal's length x animal's velocity)/kinematic viscosity of the fluid).  Turbulent flow can be found at higher Re values, where the boundary layer separates and creates a wake, and laminar flow can be found at lower Re values, when the boundary layer separation is delayed, reducing wake and kinetic energy loss to opposing water momentum.&lt;ref name="Feldkamp"&gt;Feldkamp, S.D. "Swimming in the California sea lion: morphometrics, drag, and energetics." J. exp. Biol. 131, 117-135 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

The body shape of a swimming organism affects the resulting drag.  Long, slender bodies reduce pressure drag by streamlining, while short, round bodies reduce frictional drag; therefore, the optimal shape of an organism depends on its niche.  Swimming organisms with a fusiform shape are likely to experience the greatest reduction in both pressure and frictional drag.&lt;ref name=Feldkamp/&gt;

Wing shape also affects the amount of drag experienced by an organism, as with different methods of stroke, recovery of the pre-stroke position results in the accumulation of drag.

High-speed ram ventilation creates laminar flow of water from the gills along the body of an organism.

The secretion of mucus along the organism's body surface, or the addition of long-chained polymers to the velocity gradient, can reduce frictional drag experienced by the organism.

===Buoyancy===
Many aquatic/marine organisms have developed organs to compensate for their weight and control their [[buoyancy]] in the water.  These structures, make the density of their bodies very close to that of the surrounding water.  Some hydrozoans, such as siphonophores, has gas-filled floats; the Nautilus, Sepia, and Spirula ([[Cephalopods]]) have chambers of gas within their shells; and most [[teleost]] fish and many [[lantern fish]] (Myctophidae) are equipped with [[swim bladders]].  Many aquatic and marine organisms may also be composed of low-density materials.  Deep-water teleosts, which do not have a swim bladder, have few lipids and proteins, deeply ossified bones, and watery tissues that maintain their buoyancy.  Some [[sharks]]' livers are composed of low-density lipids, such as hydrocarbon [[squalene]] or [[wax esters]] (also found in Myctophidae without swim bladders), which provide buoyancy.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

Swimming animals that are denser than water must generate lift or adapt a [[benthic]] lifestyle.  Movement of the fish to generate hydrodynamic lift is necessary to prevent sinking.  Often, their bodies act as [[hydrofoils]], a task that is more effective in flat-bodied fish.  At a small tilt angle, the lift is greater for flat fish than it is for fish with narrow bodies.  Narrow-bodied fish use their fins as hydrofoils while their bodies remain horizontal.  In sharks, the [[heterocercal]] tail shape drives water downward, creating a counteracting upward force while thrusting the shark forward.  The lift generated is assisted by the pectoral fins and upward-angle body positioning.  It is supposed that [[tunas]] primarily use their pectoral fins for lift.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

Buoyancy maintenance is metabolically expensive.  Growing and sustaining a buoyancy organ, adjusting the composition of biological makeup, and exerting physical strain to stay in motion demands large amounts of energy.  It is proposed that lift may be physically generated at a lower energy cost by swimming upward and gliding downward, in a "climb and glide" motion, rather than constant swimming on a plane.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

===Temperature===
Temperature can also greatly affect the ability of aquatic organisms to move through water.  This is because temperature not only affects the properties of the water, but also the organisms in the water, as most have an ideal range specific to their body and metabolic needs.

[[Q10 (temperature coefficient)]], the factor by which a rate increases at a 10&amp;nbsp;°C increase in temperature, is used to measure how organisms' performance relies on temperature.  Most have increased rates as water becomes warmer, but some have limits to this and others find ways to alter such effects, such as by endothermy or earlier recruitment of faster muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcinek|first=David J.|author2=Susanna B. Blackwell|author3=Heidi Dewar|author4=Ellen V. Freund|author5=Charles Farwell|author6=Daniel Dau|author7=Andrew C. Seitz|author8=Barbara A.

For example, ''Crocodylus porosus'', or estuarine crocodiles, were found to increase swimming speed from 15&amp;nbsp;°C to 23&amp;nbsp;°C and then to have peak swimming speed from 23&amp;nbsp;°C to 33&amp;nbsp;°C.  However, performance began to decline as temperature rose beyond that point, showing a limit to the range of temperatures at which this species could ideally perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elsworth|first=Peter G.|author2=Frank Seebacher|author3=Craig E. Franklin|title=Sustained Swimming Performance in Crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus): Effects of Body Size and Temperature|journal=Journal of Herpetology|date=April 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=363–368|doi=10.1670/0022-1511(2003)037[0363:sspicc]2.0.co;2|citeseerx=10.1.1.667.6790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submergence===
The more of the animal's body that is submerged while swimming, the less energy it uses. Swimming on the surface requires two to three times more energy than when completely submerged. This is because of the bow wave that is formed at the front when the animal is pushing the surface of the water when swimming, creating extra drag.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zj395mz_GYkC&amp;pg=PA150 Nature's Flyers: Birds, Insects, and the Biomechanics of Flight]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary evolution==
[[File:penguinu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chinstrap penguin]] leaping over water]]
[[File:Swimming dog bgiu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dog paddle|Swimming dog]]]]

While [[tetrapod]]s lost many of their natural adaptations to swimming when they evolved onto the land, many have re-evolved the ability to swim or have indeed returned to a completely aquatic lifestyle.

Primarily or exclusively aquatic animals have re-evolved from terrestrial tetrapods multiple times: examples include [[amphibians]] such as [[newts]], [[reptiles]] such as [[crocodile]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]] and [[mosasaur]]s, [[marine mammal]]s such as [[cetaceans|whales]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[otter]]s, and [[bird]]s such as [[penguin]]s. Many species of [[snakes]] are also aquatic and live their entire lives in the water. Among invertebrates, a number of [[insect]] species have adaptations for aquatic life and locomotion. Examples of [[aquatic insect]]s include [[dragonfly]] larvae, [[Corixidae|water boatmen]], and [[Dytiscidae|diving beetle]]s. There are also [[Diving bell spider|aquatic spiders]], although they tend to prefer other modes of locomotion under water than swimming proper.

Even though primarily terrestrial tetrapods have lost many of their adaptations to swimming, the ability to swim has been preserved or re-developed in many of them. It may never have been completely lost.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Examples are: Some breeds of [[dog]] swim recreationally. Umbra, a world record-holding dog, can swim 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) in 73 minutes, placing her in the top 25% in human long-distance swimming competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdogv.com/swim.html SWIMMING DOG VIDEOS Swimming Background&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although most [[cat]]s hate water, adult cats are good swimmers. The [[fishing cat]] is one wild species of cat that has evolved special adaptations for an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle – webbed digits. Tigers and some individual jaguars are the only big cats known to go into water readily, though other big cats, including lions, have been observed swimming.  A few domestic cat breeds also like swimming, such as the [[Turkish Van]].

[[Horses]], [[moose]], and [[elk]] are very powerful swimmers, and can travel long distances in the water. [[Elephants]] are also capable of swimming, even in deep waters. Eyewitnesses have confirmed that [[camel]]s, including [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel|Bactrian]] camels, can swim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mcamelswim.html The Straight Dope Mailbag: The Straight Dope Mailbag: Is the camel the only animal that can't swim?]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that there is little deep water in their natural habitats.

Both domestic and wild [[rabbit]]s can swim. Domestic rabbits are sometimes trained to swim as a circus attraction. A wild rabbit famously swam in [[Jimmy Carter rabbit incident|an apparent attack]] on U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s boat when it was threatened in its natural habitat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsoftheodd.com/article1021.html News of the Odd - Jimmy Carter Attacked by Killer Rabbit (April 20, 1979)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[guinea pig]] (or cavy) is noted as having an excellent swimming ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Harkness|first= John E.|last2= Wagner|first2= Joseph E.|title= The Biology and Medicine of Rabbits and Rodents|publisher= Williams &amp; Wilkins|year= 1995|pages= 30–39|isbn= 978-0-683-03919-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mice]] can swim quite well. They do panic when placed in water, but many lab mice are used in the [[Morris water maze]], a test to measure learning. When mice swim, they use their tails like [[flagella]] and kick with their legs.

Many snakes are excellent swimmers as well. Large adult [[anaconda]]s spend the majority of their time in the water, and have difficulty moving on land.

Many [[monkeys]] can naturally swim and some, like the [[proboscis monkey]], [[crab-eating macaque]], and [[rhesus macaque]] swim regularly.

==Human swimming==
{{Main|Human swimming|History of swimming}}
Swimming has been known amongst humans since prehistoric times; the earliest record of swimming dates back to [[Stone Age]] paintings from around 7,000 years ago.  Competitive swimming started in [[Europe]] around 1800 and was part of the first modern [[1896 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], though not in a form comparable to the contemporary events.  It was not until 1908 that regulations were implemented by the [[FINA|International Swimming Federation]] to produce [[Swimming (sport)|competitive swimming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kehm | first = G | title = Olympic Swimming and Diving:Great Moments in Olympic History | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=U2Kr_xFY2eUC&amp;pg=PA14 14] | publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4042-0970-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Autonomic Networking''' follows the concept of [[Autonomic Computing]], an initiative started by [[IBM]] in 2001. Its ultimate aim is to create self-managing networks to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of the [[Internet]] and other networks and to enable their further growth, far beyond the size of today.

== Increasing size and complexity ==

The ever-growing management complexity of the [[Internet]] caused by its rapid growth is seen by some experts as a major problem that limits its usability in the future.

What's more, increasingly popular [[smartphones]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], networked audio and video equipment,  and [[game consoles]] need to be interconnected. [[Pervasive Computing]] not only adds features, but also burdens existing networking infrastructure with more and more tasks that sooner or later will not be manageable by human intervention alone.

Another important aspect is the price of manually controlling huge numbers of vitally important devices of current network infrastructures.

== Autonomic nervous system ==

The [[autonomic nervous system]] (ANS) is the part of the nervous system of the higher life forms that is not consciously controlled. It regulates bodily functions and the activity of specific organs. As proposed by [[IBM]], future communication systems might be designed in a similar way to the ANS. 

== Components of autonomic networking ==
As autonomics conceptually derives from biological entities such as the human autonomic nervous system, each of the areas can be metaphorically related to functional and structural aspects of a living being. In the human body, the autonomic system facilitates and regulates a variety of functions including respiration, blood pressure and circulation, and emotive response. The autonomic nervous system is the interconnecting fabric that supports feedback loops between internal states and various sources by which internal and external conditions are monitored.

=== Autognostics ===
[[Autognostics]] includes a range of self-discovery, awareness, and analysis capabilities that provide the autonomic system with a view on high-level state. In metaphor, this represents the perceptual sub-systems that gather, analyze, and report on internal and external states and conditions – for example, this might be viewed as the eyes, visual cortex and perceptual organs of the system. [[Autognostics]], or literally "self-knowledge", provides the autonomic system with a basis for response and validation.

A rich autognostic capability may include many different "perceptual senses". For example, the human body gathers information via the usual five senses, the so-called sixth sense of proprioception (sense of body position and orientation), and through emotive states that represent the gross wellness of the body. As conditions and states change, they are detected by the sensory monitors and provide the basis for adaptation of related systems. Implicit in such a system are imbedded models of both internal and external environments such that relative value can be assigned to any perceived state - perceived physical threat (e.g. a snake) can result in rapid shallow breathing related to fight-flight response, a phylogenetically effective model of interaction with recognizable threats.

In the case of autonomic networking, the state of the network may be defined by inputs from:
* individual network elements such as switches and network interfaces including
** specification and configuration
** historical records and current state
* traffic flows
* end-hosts
* application performance data
* logical diagrams and design specifications

Most of these sources represent relatively raw and unprocessed views that have limited relevance. Post-processing and various forms of analysis must be applied to generate meaningful measurements and assessments against which current state can be derived.

The autognostic system interoperates with:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Configuration management|configuration management]] - to control network elements and interfaces
* [[Autonomic Networking#Policy management|policy management]] - to define performance objectives and constraints
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autodefense|autodefense]] - to identify attacks and accommodate the impact of defensive responses

=== Configuration management ===
Configuration management is responsible for the interaction with network elements and interfaces. It includes an accounting capability with historical perspective that provides for the tracking of configurations over time, with respect to various circumstances. In the biological metaphor, these are the hands and, to some degree, the memory of the autonomic system.

On a network, remediation and provisioning are applied via configuration setting of specific devices. Implementation affecting access and selective performance with respect to role and relationship are also applied. Almost all the "actions" that are currently taken by human engineers fall under this area. With only a few exceptions, interfaces are set by hand, or by extension of the hand, through automated scripts.

Implicit in the configuration process is the maintenance of a dynamic population of devices under management, a historical record of changes and the directives which invoked change. Typical to many accounting functions, configuration management should be capable of operating on devices and then rolling back changes to recover previous configurations. Where change may lead to unrecoverable states, the sub-system should be able to qualify the consequences of changes prior to issuing them.

As directives for change must originate from other sub-systems, the shared language for such directives must be abstracted from the details of the devices involved. The configuration management sub-system must be able to translate unambiguously between directives and hard actions or to be able to signal the need for further detail on a directive. An inferential capacity may be appropriate to support sufficient flexibility (i.e. configuration never takes place because there is no unique one-to-one mapping between directive and configuration settings). Where standards are not sufficient, a learning capacity may also be required to acquire new knowledge of devices and their configuration.

Configuration management interoperates with all of the other sub-systems including:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autognostics|autognostics]] - receives direction for and validation of changes
* [[Autonomic Networking#Policy management|policy management]] - implements policy models through mapping to underlying resources
* [[Autonomic Networking#Security|security]] - applies access and authorization constraints for particular policy targets
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autodefense|autodefense]] - receives direction for changes

=== Policy management ===
Policy management includes policy specification, deployment, reasoning over policies, updating and maintaining policies, and enforcement. [[Policy-based management]] is required for:
* constraining different kinds of behavior including security, privacy, resource access, and collaboration
* configuration management
* describing business processes and defining performance
* defining role and relationship, and establishing trust and reputation

It provides the models of environment and behavior that represent effective interaction according to specific goals. In the human nervous system metaphor, these models are implicit in the evolutionary "design" of biological entities and specific to the goals of survival and procreation. Definition of what constitutes a policy is necessary to consider what is involved in managing it. A relatively flexible and abstract framework of values, relationships, roles, interactions, resources, and other components of the network environment is required. This sub-system extends far beyond the physical network to the applications in use and the processes and end-users that employ the network to achieve specific goals. It must express the relative values of various resources, outcomes, and processes and include a basis for assessing states and conditions.

Unless embodied in some system outside the autonomic network or implicit to the specific policy implementation, the framework must also accommodate the definition of process, objectives and goals. Business process definitions and descriptions are then an integral part of the policy implementation. Further, as policy management represents the ultimate basis for the operation of the autonomic system, it must be able to report on its operation with respect to the details of its implementation.

The policy management sub-system interoperates (at least) indirectly with all other sub-systems but primarily interacts with:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autognostics|autognostics]] - providing the definition of performance and accepting reports on conditions
* [[Autonomic Networking#Configuration management|configuration management]] - providing constraints on device configuration
* [[Autonomic Networking#Security|security]] - providing definitions of roles, access and permissions

=== Autodefense ===
Autodefense represents a dynamic and adaptive mechanism that responds to malicious and intentional attacks on the network infrastructure, or use of the network infrastructure to attack IT resources. As defensive measures tend to impede the operation of IT, it is optimally capable of balancing performance objectives with typically over-riding threat management actions. In the biological metaphor, this sub-system offers mechanisms comparable to the immune system.

This sub-system must proactively assess network and application infrastructure for risks, detect and identify threats, and define effective both proactive and reactive defensive responses. It has the role of the warrior and the security guard insofar as it has roles for both maintenance and corrective activities. Its relationship with security is close but not identical – security is more concerned with appropriately defined and implemented access and authorization controls to maintain legitimate roles and process. Autodefense deals with forces and processes, typically malicious, outside the normal operation of the system that offer some risk to successful execution.

Autodefense requires high-level and detailed knowledge of the entire network as well as imbedded models of risk that allow it to analyze dynamically the current status. Corrections to decrease risk must be considered in balance with performance objectives and value of process goals – an overzealous defensive response can immobilize the system (like the immune system inappropriately invoking an allergic reaction). The detection of network or application behaviors that signal possible attack or abuse is followed by the generation of an appropriate response – for example, ports might be temporarily closed or packets with a specific source or destination might be filtered out. Further assessment generates subsequent changes either relaxing the defensive measures or strengthening them.

Autodefense interoperates closely with:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Security|security]] - receives definition of roles and security constraints, and defines risk for proactive mitigation
* [[Autonomic Networking#Configuration management|configuration management]] - receives details of network for analysis and directs changes in elements in response to anticipated or detected attack
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autognostics|autognostics]] - receives notification of detected behaviors

It also may receive definition of relative value of various resources and processes from policy management in order to develop responses consistent with policy.

=== Security ===
Security provides the structure that defines and enforces the relationships between roles, content, and resources, particularly with respect to access. It includes the framework for definitions as well as the means to implement them. In metaphor, security parallels the complex mechanisms underlying social interactions, defining friends, foes, mates and allies and offering access to limited resources on the basis of assessed benefit.

Several key means are employed by security – they include the well-known 3 As of authentication, authorization, and access (control). The basis for applying these means requires the definition of roles and their relationships to resources, processes and each other. High-level concepts like privacy, anonymity and verification are likely imbedded in the form of the role definitions and derive from policy. Successful security reliably supports and enforces roles and relationships.

Autodefense has a close association with security – maintaining the assigned roles in balance with performance exposes the system to potential violations in security. In those cases, the system must compensate by making changes that may sacrifice balance on a temporary basis and indeed may violate the operational terms of security itself. Typically the two are viewed as inextricably intertwined – effective security somewhat hopefully negating any need for a defensive response. Security’s revised role is to mediate between the competing demands from policy for maximized performance and minimized risk with auto defense recovering the balance when inevitable risk translates to threat. Federation represents one of the key challenges to be solved by effective security.

The security sub-system interoperates directly with:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Policy management|policy management]] - receiving high-level directives related to access and priority
* [[Autonomic Networking#Configuration management|configuration management]] - sending specifics for access and admission control
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autodefense|autodefense]] - receiving over-riding directives under threat and sending security constraint details for risk assessment

=== Connection fabric ===
The connection fabric supports the interaction with all the elements and sub-systems of the autonomic system. It may be composed of a variety of means and mechanisms, or may be a single central framework. The biological equivalent is the central nervous system itself – although referred to as the autonomic system, it actually is only the communication conduit between the human body’s faculties.

== Principles of autonomic networking ==

Consequently, it is currently under research by many [[Autonomic Networking#Research projects|research projects]], how principles and paradigms of mother nature might be applied to [[Computer networking|networking]].

=== Compartmentalization ===
Instead of a [[protocol stack|layering approach]], autonomic networking targets a more flexible structure termed [[Network Compartment|compartmentalization]].

=== Function re-composition ===
The goal is to produce an architectural design that enables flexible, dynamic, and fully autonomic formation of large-scale networks in which the functionalities of each constituent network node are also composed in an autonomic fashion

=== Atomization ===
Functions should be divided into atomic units to allow for maximal re-composition freedom.

=== Closed control loop ===
A fundamental concept of [[Control theory]], the [[closed control loop]], is among the fundamental principles of autonomic networking. A closed control loop maintains the properties of the controlled system within desired bounds by constantly monitoring target parameters.

[[File:Mendel seven characters.svg|thumb|right|Mendel first studied pea plants.  The characteristics of the peas in different generations could be tracked by using beans.]]
'''Beanbag genetics''' is a conceptual model of [[genetics]] which was used by early [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelians]], who used to keep colored beans in bags as a way of tracking [[Mendelian ratio]]s.  To be able to understand beanbag genetics, the meaning of population has to change. Population is no longer a group of individuals in an area but are all the [[Allele]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in an area that assort and segregate separately. All of the alleles become the [[gene pool]]. When using the beanbag approach, there are two ways that the gene pool can be viewed. The first is to view the gene pool as all the alleles that represent all the traits in the population be viewed at once. The second, the gene pool could only be alleles for a single trait in the population. Once the alleles are chosen for the gene pool they are selected for at random. Phrase was first coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] in criticizing the work of [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] who treated [[gene]]s as independent entities to simplify their mathematical analysis of [[population genetics]].{{sfn|Dronamraju|p=ix}} Mayr created the name, beanbag, because all the alleles were thought of like beans in a beanbag. The beanbag full of beans would be considered the gene pool for the population.

==Studies==
The paper 'Perils of “industrial gene” and “beanbag genetics”' written in 2008 by Dr. Lakhotia, discusses that [[biotechnology]] needs to be reassessed before continuing down the path that it is going down now. Dr. Lakhotia believes that overall everything in our [[genome]] needs to be looked at rather than just [[coding regions]]. We do know that our genetic material forms and organic system that is built by multiple smaller units working together. Since we know that multiple smaller units are used, scientists need to look at more than just the structural gene. We should look at the entire genome because know that even in the non-coding regions of our DNA is involved in the regulatory network.

==Debate==

The debate of BeanBag Genetics has been occurring for many years now. One thing scientist have agreed on is that BeanBag genetics is too simplistic and needs to be built upon. Sir Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright are two scientist that were once a part of this debate. Fisher's assumptions were that: traits are determined by many loci with independent effects, populations are well mixed, and mating is random. Wright's assumptions were his Shifting balance theory that included: Random Drift, Individual selection, and Interdeme Selection. As both argue their theories, people agree with Fisher's theory because it works and is a well developed theory. Other people agree with Wright because his theory is closer to the real world and provides an aesthetically pleasing view of evolution. Even though both theories have parts that are right they both are wrong as well. Fisher's theory does not explain the diversity of the world and Wright's theory is just a metaphor not a well developed theory. So how do they know which theory is correct? Even though both theories are right and wrong, they both see a part of a larger picture.

Bradyspory may occur because seed release is spontaneous but very gradual, or because seed release does not occur until triggered to do so by some environmental event. The latter case is termed [[serotiny]].

'''Concurrent MetateM''' is a [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent]] language in which each agent is programmed using a set of (augmented) [[temporal logic]] specifications of the behaviour it should exhibit. These specifications are executed directly to generate the behaviour of the agent. As a result, there is no risk of invalidating the logic as with systems where logical specification must first be translated to a lower-level implementation.

The root of the MetateM concept is [[Gabbay's separation theorem]]; any arbitrary temporal logic formula can be rewritten in a [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] ''past&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;future'' form. Execution proceeds by a process of continually matching rules against a history, and ''firing'' those rules when [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]s are satisfied. Any instantiated future-time consequents become commitments which must subsequently be satisfied, iteratively generating a model for the formula made up of the program rules.

==Temporal Connectives==
The Temporal Connectives of Concurrent MetateM can divided into two categories, as follows:

* Strict past time connectives: '●' (weak last), '◎' (strong last), '◆' (was), '■' (heretofore), {{'}}''S''{{'}} (since), and {{'}}''Z''{{'}} (zince, or  weak since).
* Present and future time connectives: '◯' (next), '◇' (sometime), '□' (always), {{'}}''U''{{'}} (until), and {{'}}''W''{{'}} (unless).

The connectives {◎,●,◆,■,◯,◇,□} are unary; the remainder are binary.

===Strict past time connectives===

====Weak last====
'''●ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ was true in the previous time. If ●ρ is interpreted at the beginning of time, it is satisfied despite there being no actual previous time.  Hence "weak" last.

====Strong last====
'''◎ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ was true in the previous time.  If ◎ρ is interpreted at the beginning of time, it is not satisfied because there is no actual previous time.  Hence "strong" last.

====Was====
'''◆ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ was true in any previous moment in time.

====Heretofore====
'''■ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ was true in every previous moment in time.

====Since====
'''ρ''S''ψ''' is satisfied now if ψ is true at any previous moment and ρ is true at every moment after that moment.

====Zince, or weak since====
'''ρ''Z''ψ''' is satisfied now if (ψ is true at any previous moment and ρ is true at every moment after that moment) OR ψ has not happened in the past.

===Present and future time connectives===

====Next====
'''◯ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ is true in the next moment in time.

====Sometime====
'''◇ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ is true now or in any future moment in time.

====Always====
□'''ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ is true now and in every future moment in time.

====Until====
'''ρ''U''ψ''' is satisfied now if ψ is true at any future moment and ρ is true at every moment prior.

====Unless====
'''ρ''W''ψ''' is satisfied now if (ψ is true at any future moment and ρ is true at every moment prior) OR ψ does not happen in the future.

'''Constructive journalism''' is an emerging domain within [[journalism]] that is slowly getting grounded within academia&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine [http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/ "Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology"]. "University of Pennsylvania Scholarly Commons". 1 August 2011. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Alexander L. &amp; Hammonds, Keith H.  [http://engagingnewsproject.org/enp_2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ENP_SJN-report.pdf "The Power of Solutions Journalism"]. "University of Texas at Austin". 1 August 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
and involves the field of communication that is based around reporting solution-focused news, instead of revolving only around negative and conflict-based stories. The idea behind constructive journalism is to give stories more context and make the consumer of the news more intelligent. By giving more background and also reporting what is going good, so that people are more able to create a realistic view of the world. Instead of only reporting the issues, with constructive journalism the journalist also addresses what the consumer can do with the information. What can I do to change it? etc. 

The journalist does not reflect his or her opinion and also does not render or implement what those solutions are, but tries to inform the society of what solutions there might be. Pioneers of constructive journalism say that as a journalist you have a big impact on the way people think, because of the way you construct the news. Journalists need to be aware of that responsibility more by being more careful in the way they construct their stories. They think that many journalist, who use a very cynical way of reporting the news, forget that by reporting everything that is going wrong from a distance, they also move the society.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/upworthy-media-role-climate-change-journalism/ "You will not believe what Upworthy can teach the media about sustainability"]. "The Guardian". 14 August 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lbs&gt;Sillesen, Lene Bech [http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/good_news_is_good_business_but.php?page=all/ "Good news is good business, but not a cure-all for journalism"]. "Columbia Journalism Review". 29 September 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It aims to avoid a negativity bias and incorporates findings from [[positive psychology]] research to produce novel frameworks for journalism.&lt;ref name="ivoh"&gt;Tenore, Mallary Jean [http://ivoh.org/constructive-journalism/ "How constructive journalism can improve the way media makers tell stories"]. "IVOH -Media as Agents of World Benefit". 2 September 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, instead of solely reporting on conflicts and problems, constructive journalism aims to gain a more comprehensive portrayal of the issues at hand.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;Albeanu, Catalina [https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/why-constructive-journalism-can-help-engage-the-audience/s2/a557706/ "Why constructive journalism can help engage the audience"]. "Journalism.co.uk". 18 August 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It aims to expose core causes of problems but also to report on emerging ideas and developments to shift society towards more impartial and sustainable paths.&lt;ref name=je&gt;Ellis, Justin [http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/01/with-knight-funding-solutions-journalism-network-wants-to-grow-reporting-on-positive-results-in-health-reporting/ "With Knight funding, Solutions Journalism Network wants to grow reporting on positive results in health reporting"]. "Nieman Foundation". 18 January 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Constructive journalism aims express how change is possible and highlights the role each member of society may play to foster it. Additionally, it strives to strengthen the ethics code of journalism by avoiding the distortion of information in order to provide a more real portrayal of the world. Constructive Journalism attempts to create an engaging narrative that is factually correct without exaggerating numbers or realities.

== Applications ==

According to the Danish journalist [[Cathrine Gyldensted]], the Canadian [[Family therapy|family systems therapist]] [[Karl Tomm]]'s four types of therapeutic questioning can be adopted into an interview approach that can also be used by journalists.&lt;ref name="positivenews"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine. [http://positivenews.org.uk/2014/culture/media/16246/challenge-power-anew-family-therapy/ "How can we challenge power anew? Try family therapy"]. ''Positive News''. 12 September 2014. Retrieved 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomm's original framework provides four types of questions a therapist can use in [[psychotherapy]] sessions to bring about positive therapeutic outcomes from clients. By using the same model in journalism, similarly constructive answers could be obtained from the interviewee.

In what he named the "interventive interviewing" devised to facilitate positive changes in family dynamics, Tomm divides questions into four types based on two intersecting dimensions that make up four quadrants.&lt;ref name=tomm&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tomm |first=Karl |title=Interventive Interviewing: Part III. Intending to Ask Lineal, Circular, Strategic, or Reflexive Questions? |journal=Family Process |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |date=March 1988 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1988.00001.x |url=http://www.familytherapy.org/documents/Interventive3.PDF |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGiTJ-Z_y6Q Karl Tomm og de 4 spørgsmålstyper (Karl Tomm and the 4 types of question)]. ''YouTube.com''. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dimension of intentionality differentiates between "orienting questions" that help interviewers (therapists) orient their views about the interviewees (clients) and "influencing questions" that challenge the interviewees' (clients') understanding of themselves. When used outside psychotherapy, such as in journalism, this dimension of intentionality is also interpreted as the temporal dichotomy between past-orientation and future-orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Myllerup, Bent. [http://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2013/10/07/your-strategy-asking-powerful-questions/ "Your Strategy for Asking Powerful Questions"]. ''agile42''. 7 October 2013. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second dimension of linear vs. circular assumptions, theoretically based on [[Gregory Bateson]]'s works on the nature of mind,&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. ''Steps to an ecology of mind''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. ''Mind and nature: A necessary unity''. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates between lineal assumptions that take a reductionist, deterministic approach and circular assumptions that take a holistic, systemic approach. The resulting four types of questions are:
# Linear Questions ("The Detective"): Basic investigative questions that deal with "Who did what?, Where?, When?, and Why?". This type of questions helps discover the factual aspect of the problem or issue.
# Circular Questions ("The Anthropologist"): This type of questions discovers relevant contextual perspective behind the facts. Examples: "How did this affect you (or other things/people/etc.)?" and "What is your explanation for A or B?".
# Reflexive Questions ("The Future Scientist"): In reflective questions, the interviewer suggests a new perspective on a given topic, thereby nudging the interviewee to reflect on a new possibility of constructive solutions to the problem or issue. Examples: "What do you think A believes, when he is in that situation?", "How would you approach this problem?", and "What action should be taken in order to do A or B?"
# Strategic Questions ("The Captain"): Directs the interviewee into commitment of the solution. Examples: "What should be done?", "Will you do it?", and "When will you do it?"

Gyldensted reports that conventional journalists tend to be past-oriented and hence leave out future-oriented questions, especially the "Future Scientist". &lt;ref name="cg" /&gt; For example, in a four-hour press conference with a former Danish prime minister, the press asked 59% "Detective", 19.4% "Captain", 18.7% "Anthropologist", and only 3% "Future Scientist" questions out of a total of more than 130 questions. "As a consequence," she writes, "[journalists] miss out on asking questions that explore new perspectives, solutions and visions, and on triggering actions based on those perspectives." An ideal, constructive interview requires a balance among all four types of questions, because "[a]n interview containing all four roles of questioning [...] reveals the problem and the involved parties (Detective), provides reflection on what has happened (Anthropologist), points towards a solution or maps a bigger vision (Future Scientist), and commits decision-makers (Captain)." These four types of questions, being grounded in family therapy, is especially effective in [[political journalism]], because the interviewer can encourage "mediation in political debates" and hence facilitate constructive collaboration among politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine.

== Media corporations working with Constructive Journalism ==

In Scandinavia this domain has been evolving since 2007. 
In December 2007 the editor-in-chief and CEO of Danish Media corporation Berlingske Media, Lisbeth Knudsen, wrote an editorial where she reflected on the natural but also detrimental effects of journalism's negativity bias, and called for more positive and constructive story ideas.&lt;ref name=lk&gt;Knudsen, Lisbeth [http://lisbethknudsen.blogs.berlingske.dk/2007/12/01/gode-historier-er-negative-historier/ "Gode historier er negative historier"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221181806/http://lisbethknudsen.blogs.berlingske.dk/2007/12/01/gode-historier-er-negative-historier/ |date=2014-12-21 }}.

'''Contemporary Sant Mat Movements''' are [[esoteric]] philosophy movements active in the United States, Europe, [[Latin America]], and especially India. These movements assert that [[Sant Mat]] shares a lineage with [[Sikhism]] and contains elements of thought found in [[Hinduism]], such as [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. They further assert that Sant Mat also contains elements found in [[Sufism]] and has inspired and influenced a number of religious groups and organizations. They refer to this spiritual path as the "Science of the Soul" or ‘[[Sant Mat]]’, meaning ‘teachings of the saints’. More recently it has been described as "The Way of Life" or "Living the Life of Soul." It incorporates a practical [[yoga]] system known as [[Surat Shabd Yoga]].

Contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to incorporate a personal and private path of spiritual development in the common tradition of mystics past and present. They discuss the irrelevance of rituals, priestly class, mandatory contributions, or compulsory gatherings.

==Introduction==
The basic teaching of contemporary Sant Mat, as described by its Masters, is that everything lies inside us and that God is within. The outside world is only an image or a reflection of the inner reality.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Thakar (1989). Newspaper interview, Lagos Nigeria. Reprinted in Heart Of Compassion, Kirpal Light Satsang, 1991 {{ISBN|0-917019-11-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; So self-knowledge or knowledge of the higher self and God-knowledge (taken as a practical project rather than a theoretical inquiry) are the topics of Sant Mat.&lt;ref name="link2"&gt;Singh, Kirpal (1955). Night Is A Jungle, Ruhani Satsang Books. [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/god_man.htm Online_version].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirpal Singh]] describes [[Sant Mat]] as a synonym for ''[[Surat Shabd Yoga]]'', the [[yoga]] of the [[Sound Current]], or more simply ''Shabd yoga'', a meditation technique he asserts was taught and practiced originally in northern India.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Kirpal. (1999). ''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/contents.htm Naam or Word]''. Blaine, WA: Ruhani Satsang Books. {{ISBN|0-942735-94-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh writes that practitioners of Shabd yoga position the path as not requiring the physical torture of penance and austerities that marked many of the yogas and spiritual paths throughout the ages. Thus it is sometimes called "[[Sahaja|Sehaj]]" (easy) yoga.&lt;ref name="link5"&gt;Singh, Kirpal. Man Know Thyself. Ruhani Satsang Books. [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/knowthy.htm Online_version]&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely accepted translations of the Indian term "Sant Mat" are "Teachings of the Saints" and "Path of the Masters." These are both incidentally the titles of prominent works on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Kirpal (1976). The Way of the Saints: Sant Mat. Sant Bani ashram. {{ISBN|0-89142-026-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="link4"&gt;Johnson, Julian (1985). The Path of the Masters: The Science of Surat Shabd Yoga : The Yoga of the audible Life Stream. Radha Soami Satsang Beas. {{ISBN|1-199-61327-4}} (Originally published much earlier, perhaps in the 1950s.)&lt;/ref&gt; Another commonly accepted definition of the term is found in [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/knowthy.htm Man Know Thyself] by [[Sant Kirpal Singh]]:

:Man is constantly changing or introducing new names and terminologies to describe this Science. The Masters were called Sants, and the nature of knowledge Mat, thus giving us the term 'Sant-Mat', which is at present mostly used to name the Path of the Masters. Other terms, such as Shabd Yoga, Surat Shabd Yoga, Sehaj Yoga, are also used to describe the same Science. In the Sanskrit language, the word 'Sant' means Master of the highest Order, and 'Mat' is a confirmed opinion or statement made by an adept after personal experience. The foundation of this Science, therefore, is the result of a critical study, minute investigation, and the lifelong personal verification of facts based on practical experience of the Self in man. This experience of the Self is something that a competent Master is prepared to give to each individual who approaches him. Sant Mat, therefore, is the teaching, system and path of the Saints.&lt;ref name="link5" /&gt;

However, terminology, names, and groups are not considered to be of any importance in Sant Mat:

:The Masters do not attach any importance to names, designations, or the fact that many religious sects, groups and circles, have claimed this Science as their own and named it after their leaders or founders. They look upon these groups as schools where man — the noblest being in Creation — can study with other men as children of one and the same Almighty Father.&lt;ref name="link5" /&gt;

==Origins==
{{details|Sant Mat}}
Sant Mat (literally, "school of the [[Sant (India)|Sant]]s") was a loosely associated group of teachers that assumed prominence in the northern part of the Indian sub-continent from about the 13th century. Their teachings are distinguished theologically by inward loving devotion to a divine principle, and socially by an [[egalitarian]]ism opposed to the qualitative distinctions of the Hindu caste hierarchy and to the religious differences between Hinduism and Islam.&lt;ref name=Woodhead&gt;Woodhead, Linda &amp; Fletcher, Paul. ''Religion in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations'' (2001) pp.71-2. Routledge (UK) {{ISBN|0-415-21784-9}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical reach==
Contemporary Sant Mat movements exist all over the world.

[[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], the mission begun by [[Baba Jaimal Singh]] at the turn of the 19th century, has its headquarters known as "Dera Baba Jaimal Singh", near the river [[Beas River|Beas]] in [[northern India]] since 1891. His Master [[Shiv Dayal Singh]] had perhaps 500 initiates, and if one wanted to see the Master it was necessary to travel to his home in Agra. His lineage continues at Radhasoami Central Satsang, at Dayalbagh, Agra, in India. Baba Jaimal Singh had perhaps 2500 initiates and did not travel more than a few hundred miles from Beas while he was a Master. Baba Sawan Singh did not travel outside of India, but is believed to have had as many as one lac (100,000) initiates, some of whom were foreigners. [[Charan Singh (guru)]] did travel overseas and the present master [[Gurinder Singh]], travels to nearly 90 countries.  Today the [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], is leading the way forward and encompassing all the teachings of the saints.&lt;ref name="link4" /&gt;

[[Sant Kirpal Singh]] visited Europe and the United States in 1955 and 1963, and Europe, America, and Latin America in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/kirpal.htm Ruhani Satsang USA website, Tour reports]&lt;/ref&gt; The various spiritual leaders who claim to lead this movement now frequently travel all over the world.

==General tenets==
The most central tenet is the need to be initiated by a living Master or [[Satguru]] ("sat" meaning true and "guru" meaning Master or Spiritual Teacher). "Competent Master" is another common formulation: the Master must be competent in the sense of having been commissioned by God, not just a person who feels like working in the role of a guru:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a sad affair that there are thousands of imitators, of false copies, but it doesn't mean that the world is devoid of truth and that a Master is not available to the people...It has always been a law that at least one complete master would be on earth to bring God's truth to the people. One such Master can benefit the entire world just as one sun can glorify and light up the entire world. [16] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Technically speaking Sant Mat practice involves listening to the [[Shabd|Inner Sound]], also known in the Holy Bible as 'The Word' or 'logos' contemplating the [[Light (theology)|Inner Light]], and (eventually) [[Astral projection|leaving the human body at will]] - a practice sometimes referred to as "dying while living". The principal intent is to awaken the Soul and unite it with God.&lt;ref&gt;"My dear souls, I should call you souls because we are from God. It is told to us" 'Your soul bears the seal of God. It belongs to God, give it unto God.' These words from the Bible and other scriptures were told by God himself when he came into the human garb. He came because Man has been misled. God is the only one who has sympathy with these suffering souls. He wants to end their suffering: 'Come back to me. Enjoy perfection, as I am perfect.'" LTLOS, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Sant Mat is a practical and not a theoretical investigation.&lt;ref&gt;"The present day is an age of the practical life. People do not believe unless there is something practical. So we must have all our Truth in a practical way, and it will appeal to all. This Truth will prevail. Times are changing. This is the only thing that can appeal to everybody. This is the only ground on which all of us can sit together. So I wish each one of you to be practical. Do not try to reform others. Reform your own self." LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/ocean.htm The Ocean of Intoxication].&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to be different in a radical sense from other disciplines or kinds of knowledge which can be taught. It claims to be a meta-knowledge or method of going beyond knowledge and deprecates the mind and mental processes, at all times describing a dichotomy between the mind and the soul, in which the mind is only a negative copy or imitation of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Anyone whose soul is under the mind's influence and control becomes an image of the mind, for he forgets his true self. We call this ego or I-hood for one thinks 'I am everything.' Yet, one does not know that true 'I.' If one has forgotten one's true Self, then who is it that will realize the Lord?" LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/listen.htm Oh Mind, Listen For Once].&lt;/ref&gt; The mind is to become still and quiet so that the soul can begin to experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Once, I remember, a very learned pundit came to our Master. I was there. He had a talk with my Master. At the end he said, "Will you kindly initiate me?" He was initiated. Then he told the Master, "Master, I will become proficient within three months. I'll do everything You say and come back." Master said, "All right, what more is wanted?" He came back after six months, and fortunately I was there because I had the privilege to be back with the Master. He said, "Master, previously l had been putting in eight hours a day in worship, and my mind never disturbed me. Now I cannot sit for a moment." You see? It is because in the outward performances, the mind gets food. You light the candle, you offer flowers, then you do this and that. The mind gets food. But in this way, the mind meets its death. He would prefer to go into the mouth of a cannon rather than enter within." LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/lok/servant.htm Are You The Servant Of Your Mind?]&lt;/ref&gt; The soul has its own internal sources of knowledge, and when properly connected to its inner sources, no outer education or knowledge is required or desired.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The second essential tenet is the mystical role of the Sound Current:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Prajapatir vai idam-agree asit Tasya vak dvitiya asit Vak vai Paramam Brahma''&lt;/blockquote&gt; (from Vedas)

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the beginning was [[Prajapati]] (the Creator),
With Him was the [[Vāk|Vak]] (the Word),
And the Vak (the Word) was verily the
Supreme [[Brahman]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents compare this with the verses of John 1 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201;&amp;version=31 John] to assert their special use of comparative religion (seeking the common thread in all religions and esoteric phenomena). ''Naam or Word'' [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/contents.htm], written by [[Sant Kirpal Singh]], explores this theme. It asserts that the Sound Current is the esoteric form of God which is available to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;"When we meditate on that light of God and that music, we will find access to God himself. The music we hear in this outer world is the outer expression of that inner music. In the Jap Ji, twenty-seventh stanza, you will find Nanak marvelling at God's mansion...he says that in God's house he found all music, so many instruments, so many kinds and types of songs, and so many singers. Then Nanak further explains that all this universe, the Judge and air and fire and everything there is, is going on because of music....Everything is Music. God is also music and he controls everything with music." And You Will Fly Up To God (see [16]). p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guru, who is a human being, has merged with the Sound Current in such a manner that he is a living manifestation of it (the Word made flesh).&lt;ref name="link42"&gt;Way of Life, 2002. "'Word made flesh and dwelt amongst us.' The Word God came into this world in human flesh and began to dwell with us. Why? So that the competency of the Word God, who has created everything, maintains everything, and is full God, will work in this world in the same capacity as it works in the highest heavens. " p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not just the Guru can achieve this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way &lt;ref name="link42" /&gt;

===Helping factors===
Beyond the two main tenets, Contemporary Sant Mat movements emphasize an ethical lifestyle and selfless service. They assert that these are not spirituality as such, but are necessary preparation for true spirituality to commence.&lt;ref&gt;An Ethical Lifestyle, Selfless Service. Video tape recording, Edition Naam USA. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A self-introspective diary or daily diary tracking ethical lifestyle in five cardinal disciplines is sometimes recommended as a way to self-monitor one's own ethical condition. The five cardinal virtues tracked by
the diary are ''Ahimsa'' or [[Nonviolence]], Truthfulness, [[Chastity]], love for all regardless of caste, creed, wealth, or intellectual attainments (i.e., [[Humility]]), and finally the maintenance of a strict [[Vegetarian]] diet. Drugs and alcohol are also to be avoided, as is the company of worldly-minded people.&lt;ref name="link45"&gt;And You Will Fly Up To God, p. 57-75, "The Daily Diary".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selfless Service]] or Seva means devoting oneself to mental, physical, or financial service to the Guru, and the sangat (or devotees).  Mental service means keeping constant remembrance of God by means of repetition of the Mantra (known as [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]) or by other means keeping the Guru in mind. Physical service means doing some physical work, as in the situation where one helps dig a well at an ashram or gives a talk about the Master to the public. Financial service means giving money to the mission of the Master (to his organization) instead of spending it on oneself. The concept of Financial Seva is quite similar to [[tithe|tithing]] as known generally in Christianity. Also, just as a very general rule, at least 10% of one's time should be spent in meditation.&lt;ref name="link45" /&gt;

===Practices===
Contemporary Sant Mat movements assert that the "Master" or [[Guru]] is provided by God as the channel through which God manifests in the world - God is believed to be unknowable and inconceivable, so he has created Gurus as a way in which to be available. Only humans are capable of interacting with a Master, as other forms of life are asserted to be incapable of doing so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Teachers of contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to teach a spiritual path which is intentionally easier than others described in the ancient scriptures as it requires nothing more than sitting quietly and looking and listening within.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Specifics of this process include connecting one's soul or attention, called ''[[Surat (soul)]]'' with the inner Current of Light and Sound of God, the [[Shabd]]. Adherents believe this Sound Current cannot be heard by the uninitiated; it is made manifest at the time of initiation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} An essential component of the practice involves sitting still with eyes closed, with one's attention focused at the "third eye center", located between and behind the two eyebrows, while (mentally) repeating one or more [[mantra]]s given by the Guru to the disciple at the time of initiation. This is called [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|simran]] (repetition) and its primary function is to still the mind while remembering (or being connected to) the Guru via the mantra he provided. However listening to the Sound Current by plugging the ears with the thumbs and listening at the right side or above is equally as important. Sound is considered to be the source of the Light, and to contain everything required. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The concept of [[Satsang]] is also a common thread in contemporary Sant Mat movements' practices. Satsang means literally "gathering of Truth." These gatherings serve as the formal meeting place of the Master and his devotees when he is present in physical form, but also, more often, follow the tradition of early Christianity and take place in the homes of disciples or in any convenient location as times of remembrance of the Master and the need for meditation.&lt;ref&gt;"You may also gather together in one of your homes to listen to one of Master's tapes or read from the religious scriptures or talk about Master's mission or His teachings. That will also be a satsang." And You Will Fly Up to God, p. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Sant Mat movements, not everyone automatically qualifies for [[Initiation]]; many teachers require that prospective followers be spiritually “ready”. This was especially true in earlier times, when people made more time available. There are definite criteria for judging whether or not a person is indeed ready for initiation: they must be ready to eschew drugs and alcohol, lead a disciplined and chaste lifestyle, avoid spiritual healing and other forms of meditation, and commit to several hours of meditation per day.&lt;ref name="link2" /&gt;

==Sects==
There are many sects within contemporary Sant Mat movements, with different leaders and varying belief systems. Examples include [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], [[Radha Swami Satsang, Dinod]] and the [[Sawan Kirpal Ruhani Mission]].

The work of [[David C. Lane]] provides a partial catalogue of various sects related to the Radha Soami Satsang Beas and attempts to study their formation from a socio-economic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, David, [http://elearn.mtsac.edu/dlane/radhabook.html The Radhasoami tradition: A Critical History of Guru Successorship]'' (1992).  Garland Publishers, New York {{ISBN|0-8240-5247-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] has also extensively studied groups related to Radha Soami Satsang Beas.&lt;ref&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark. ''Radhasoami Reality'' (1995). Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-01092-7}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Radha+Soami#PPP9,M1 Excerpts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contemporary movements described as having a Sant Mat origin==
The [[Quan Yin Method]] of meditation promoted though the spiritual teachings of [[Supreme Master Ching Hai]] also has notable similarities to Sant Mat. The religious movement [[Eckankar]] is considered by some to be an offshoot of the Sant Mat tradition. Paul Twitchell, who founded Eckankar, was an initiate of Sant [[Kirpal Singh]].

The [[Divine Light Mission]], founded by [[Hans Ji Maharaj]] and succeeded by his sons Guru Maharaj Ji ([[Prem Rawat]]) and [[Satpal Maharaj]], was characterized as part of the Sant Mat tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Kranenborg, Reender (Dutch language) ''Neohindoeïstische bewegingen in Nederland : een encyclopedisch overzicht'', published by Kampen Kok cop.

'''DVB-SH''' ("'''Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite services to Handhelds'''") is a physical layer standard for delivering IP based media content and data to handheld terminals such as mobile phones or PDAs, based on a hybrid satellite/terrestrial [[downlink]] and for example a [[GPRS]] uplink. The [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB Project]] published the DVB-SH standard in February 2007.&lt;ref name="dvb-sh"&gt;[http://www.dvb.org/news_events/news/dvb_approves_dvbsh_specif/index.xml dvb.org: DVB approves DVB-SH specification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302152406/http://www.dvb.org/news_events/news/dvb_approves_dvbsh_specif/index.xml |date=2008-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DVB-SH system was designed for frequencies below 3&amp;nbsp;GHz, supporting UHF band, L Band or S-band. It complements and improves the existing [[DVB-H]] physical layer standard. Like its sister specification (DVB-H), it is based on DVB IP Datacast (IPDC) delivery, electronic service guides and service purchase and protection standards. 

DVB-SH specifies two operational modes: 

* SH-A: specifies the use of [[COFDM]] modulation on both satellite and terrestrial links with the possibility of running both links in [[Single-frequency network|SFN]] mode.
* SH-B: uses [[Time-Division Multiplexing]] (TDM) on the satellite link and COFDM on the terrestrial link.

== Comparison with DVB-H ==
[[File:Frequencies.jpg|thumb|left|500px|DVB-SH supported spectrum]]
The DVB-SH incorporates a number of enhancements when compared to DVB-H:

*More alternative coding rates are available
*The omission of the [[64QAM]] modulation scheme
*The inclusion of support for 1.7&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth and 1k FFT
*FEC using Turbo coding
*Improved time interleaving
*Support for antenna diversity in terminals

Recently, results from BMCO forum {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110722033828/http://www.fub.it/public/Montagna020408.pdf Alcatel April 2008]) shows a radio improvement of at least 5.5 dB on signal requirements between DVB-H and DVB-SH in the UHF frequencies. The improvements to signal requirements translates to better  in-building penetration, better in-car coverage and extension of outdoor coverage. DVB-SH chipsets are being developed now by [[DiBcom]] and [[NXP Semiconductors]], and are expected to be available in beginning of 2008. Initial specifications show that the chipsets supports both UHF and S-Band and are compatible with DVB-H.

[[DiBcom]] has announced a DVB-SH chip with availability in 2008 Q3. [http://www1.dibcom.info/Images/Upload/pdf/CP/PR_DVB-SH_MWC_%20080204_UK.pdf Dibcom DVB-SH 2008 Q3]. 
The chip  "has dual RF tuners supporting VHF, UHF, L-Band and S-Band frequencies".

== Project organization ==

French [[Agence de l'innovation industrielle]] is now financing this effort through [[TVMSL]], a project led by [[Alcatel-Lucent]] that plans to develop a DVB-SH standard suitable for hybrid satellite and terrestrial transmission. Other partners involved in TVMSL are [[Sagem Wireless]], [[Alenia Spazio|Alenia]], [[Radio Frequency Systems|RFS]], [[Philips]], [[DiBcom]], [[TeamCast]], [[UDcast]], [[CNRS]], [[INRIA]], [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|CEA-LETI]].&lt;ref&gt;

DVB-SH in S-band is seen as an alternative in Europe. Recent field trials and studies showed better performance in radio than DVB-H standard that would lead to much cheaper costs for network deployments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In [[France]] again, [[SFR]] and [[Alcatel-Lucent]] teamed up to deploy a DVB-SH trial. The results confirmed the theorical assumptions on the superiority of the DVB-SH to DVB-H, being the natural evolution of this legacy one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=56989 SFR and Alcatel-Lucent tests in the field validate the fundamental assumptions for the deployment of a DVB-SH Mobile TV terrestrial network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11007">{{short description|A global agenda for action in marine conservation}}
'''''Defying Ocean's End''''' (DOE) is a global agenda for action in [[marine conservation]] compiled in a 2004 [[Island Press]] book.  It is also the title of a 2003 [[Los Cabos]] ([[Mexico]]) conference, where the agenda was formulated.

The ''DOE'' website describes itself as "a practical agenda of action to safeguard the ocean for future generations to come.  This dynamic strategy-including costs and recommendations-is a collective voice for those seeking to reverse the disturbing trends we are witnessing in the ocean today.  As never again, we have an opportunity now to respond to this crisis, by moving beyond localized and ''ad hoc'' initiatives - however good they might be - to coordinated global action."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org ''Defying Ocean's End'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The website also lists a "DOE Office" charged with distributing the agenda.  The office is composed of Dr. [[Sylvia Earle]], [[Arlo Hemphill]], Tim Noviello and Linda K. Glover:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/doe_office.asp ''Defying Ocean's End'' Office Biographies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201090309/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/doe_office.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Defying Ocean's End'' book==

==Los Cabos conference==
''Defying Ocean's End'' was launched at a conference held in Los Cabos, Mexico on May 29 to June 3, 2003.  The conference was organized by [[Conservation International]]; convened by American [[oceanographer]], Dr. Sylvia Earle, and [[Intel Corporation]] co-founder, [[Gordon Moore]]; and chaired by Graeme Kelleher. It included the participation of nearly 150 experts from more than 20 countries, representing the fields of [[ocean science]], finance, and conservation.  A select group of senior representatives from world governments, corporations and the media were also in attendance.  In addition to Conservation International, a number of large, international conservation organizations collaborated on the conference.  These included [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[The Ocean Conservancy]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/partners.asp ''DOE'' Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201095229/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/partners.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conference was sponsored by the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], [[BP]], [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]], [[Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines]] and the Alexander Henry Foundation.

The conference was structured into 5 regional case studies, 7 thematic working groups, and a business team focused on developing Action Plans which addressed specific issues and outcomes - with priorities, and costs identified—for 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year timeframes. Five case studies were presented to all Conference participants, which addressed lessons learned and recommendations in very different regions: The [[Caribbean]], [[Seamounts]], [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic Waters]], The [[Coral Triangle]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

Break-out discussions were divided into seven Thematic Working Groups on widely ranging science, conservation, social, economic and legal topics:

*Ocean-Use Planning and [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Areas]]
*Economic Incentives and Disincentives
*Land-Ocean Interface
*Maintaining/Restoring Functional [[Marine Ecosystems]]
*Communication
*Ocean Governance
*The Unknown Ocean

A Business Team led by Larry Linden of [[Goldman Sachs]] worked with all groups to identify key cost drivers and estimate reasonable total solution costs.

===Results===
The DOE website lists the following "high level" results:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/about.asp About DOE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201084945/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/about.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Global Governance: Treat the 60% of the world ocean outside of national Exclusive Economic Zones as a World Ocean Public Trust. Establish legal and implementation approaches concerning ocean uses in the high seas - including fisheries - under coordinated, international multi-use zoning regimes.
* Fisheries Reform: Use market-based mechanisms and changes to subsidies to reform fisheries through development of [[sustainable fishing]] projects, and the establishment of a global fund to provide incentives for the adoption of sustainable practices.
* Communications: Implement global and regional communications plans; focus on educating the general public worldwide to ocean problems. Initiate global all-media campaigns on major issues. In developing nations, tailor the message to local cultural concerns, understanding and information networks (e.g., tribal elders), and build local capacity for disseminating the message.
* Marine Protected Areas/Large Marine Ecosystems: Create, consolidate, and strengthen marine protected areas (MPAs) into a globally representative network. Develop/implement coordinated, global large marine ecosystem (LME) programs in identified priority regions. Provide more robust multi-use zoning and enforcement mechanisms to protect these LMEs. Establish LME/MPA protections over 5% of the world ocean within the next 10 years (0.7% currently).
* Global Science: Develop an expanded applied research program focused on top priority marine environments high in endemism and biodiversity - seamounts, shallow- and deep-water reefs, continental slopes, caves and blue holes.

'''Dog-whistle politics''' is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different, or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup. The analogy is to a [[dog whistle]], whose [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] whistling sound is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans.

The term can be distinguished from "[[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]]" used in some specialist professions, in that dog-whistling is specific to the political realm. The messaging referred to as the dog-whistle has an understandable meaning for a general audience, rather than being incomprehensible.

==Origin and meaning==
According to [[William Safire]], the term "dog whistle" in reference to politics may have been derived from its use in the field of [[opinion poll]]ing. Safire quotes Richard Morin, director of polling for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as writing in 1988,&lt;blockquote&gt;subtle changes in question-wording sometimes produce remarkably different results... researchers call this the 'Dog Whistle Effect': Respondents hear something in the question that researchers do not&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"&gt;{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |date=2008 |title=Safire's political dictionary |edition=Rev. |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=190 |isbn=0-19-534334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and speculates that campaign workers adapted the phrase from political pollsters.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190" /&gt;

In her 2006 book, ''Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia'', academic [[Amanda Lohrey]] writes that the goal of the dog-whistle is to appeal to the greatest possible number of electors while alienating the smallest possible number. She uses as an example Australian politicians using broadly appealing words such as "family" and "values", which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lohrey|first=Amanda|title=Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia|year=2006|publisher=Black Inc.|location=Melbourne, Vic.|isbn=1-86395-230-6|pages=48–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian political theorist [[Robert E. Goodin]] argues that the problem with dog-whistling is that it undermines democracy, because if voters have different understandings of what they were supporting during a campaign, the fact that they were seeming to support the same thing is "democratically meaningless" and does not give the dog-whistler a [[Mandate (politics)|policy mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating Democracy: Democratic Theory and Practice after the Deliberative Turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=224–228|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage==

===Australia===
The term was first picked up in [[Australian politics]] in the mid-1990s, and was frequently applied to the political campaigning of [[John Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant Barrett, ''The official dictionary of unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Howard Government|his 11 years]] as [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian prime minister]] and particularly in his fourth term, Howard was accused of communicating messages appealing to anxious Australian voters using code words such as "un-Australian", "mainstream", and "illegals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soutphommasane|first=Tim|title=Reclaiming patriotism: nation-building for Australian progressives|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-521-13472-2|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelber|first=Katharine|title=Speech matters: getting free speech right|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia, Qld.|isbn=0-7022-3873-2|pages=end-notes|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable example was the Howard government's message on refugee arrivals. The Howard government's tough stance on refugee arrivals was popular with voters, but the government was accused of using the issue to additionally send veiled messages of support to voters with racist leanings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Garran|first=Robert|title=True believer: John Howard, George Bush and the American alliance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC|year=2004|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74114-418-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC&amp;pg=PA18 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining [[plausible deniability]] by avoiding overtly racist language.&lt;ref name=TAIFear&gt;Josh Fear, ''[https://www.tai.org.au/documents/downloads/DP96.pdf Under the Radar: Dog-whistle politics in Australia]'', [[The Australia Institute]], September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the publicity of the [[Australian citizenship test]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=TAIFear /&gt; It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from particular geographic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Editorial | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=No question about a citizenship test | date=December 13, 2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

During the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 Canadian federal election]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative party]] led by incumbent Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] was accused of communicating 'code' words in a debate to appeal to his party's base supporters. Midway through the election campaign the Conservative Party hired Australian political strategist [[Lynton Crosby]] as a political adviser when they fell to third place in the polls behind the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-hire-high-profile-australian-strategist-to-reboot-campaign/article26315392/|title=Controversial Australian strategist to help with Tories' campaign|first=Steven|last=Chase|date=11 September 2015|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a televised election debate Stephen Harper, while discussing the government's controversial decision to remove certain immigrants and refugee claimants from accessing Canada's health care system made reference to '[[Old Stock Canadians]]' as being in support of the government's position. Opposition leader reacted calling his words racist and divisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/harper-old-stock-canadians-debate-1.3233615|title=Harper's 'old-stock Canadians' line is part deliberate strategy: pollster|date=18 September 2015|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, the phrase "a band of youths" in Paris tends to mean North African descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Reflections-Revolution-Europe-Immigration-Islam/dp/0307276759|date=2009|page=14|title=Reflections on the Revolution In Europe|first=Christopher|last=Caldwell|access-date=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[Lynton Crosby]], who had previously managed [[John Howard]]'s four election campaigns in Australia, worked as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] adviser during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 UK general election]], and the term was introduced to British political discussion at this time.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"/&gt; In what Goodin calls "the classic case" of dog-whistling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating democracy: democratic theory and practice after the deliberative turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=226|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby created a campaign for the Conservatives with the slogan "Are you thinking what we're thinking?": a series of posters, billboards, TV commercials and direct mail pieces with messages like "It's not racist to impose limits on immigration" and "how would you feel if a bloke on early release attacked your daughter?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lees-Marshment|first=Jennifer|title=Political marketing: principles and applications|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-43128-X|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on controversial issues like unsanitary hospitals, land grabs by gypsies and restraints on police behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCallister|first=J.F.O.|title=Whistling In the Dark?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1044651,00.html|accessdate=9 September 2012|newspaper=Time |date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seawright|first=David|title=The British Conservative Party and one nation politics|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=0-8264-8974-5|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour MP [[Diane Abbott]] described the 2013 [["Go Home" vans]] advertising campaign by the British [[Home Office]] as an example of dog-whistle politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/26/go-home-ad-campaign-court-challenge|title='Go home' ad campaign targeting illegal immigrants faces court challenge|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|last2=Gidda|first2=Mirren|date=2013-07-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07|last3=Syal|first3=Rajeev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/governments-go-home-vans-backed-by-immigration-minister-mark-harper-8889358.html|title=Government's 'Go home' vans backed by Immigration Minister Mark Harper|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-GB|first=James|last=Legge|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016 [[Mayor of London]] and Conservative [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] [[Boris Johnson]] was accused of "dog whistle racism" by [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] when Johnson suggested [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] held a grudge against the United Kingdom due to his "ancestral dislike of the [[British Empire]]" as a result of his "part-Kenyan" heritage after Obama expressed his support for the UK to vote to remain in the [[European Union]] ahead of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|UK's referendum on EU membership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] |user= johnmcdonnellMP|number= 723481596096090112 |date= 22 April 2016 |title= Mask slips again.

In the [[2016 London Mayoral Election]], Conservative candidate [[Zac Goldsmith]] was accused of running a dog-whistle campaign against Labour's [[Sadiq Khan]], playing on Khan's Muslim faith by suggesting he would target Hindus and Sikhs with a "jewellery tax" and attempting to link him to extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=15 March 2016  |title= The deafening dogwhistle of Zac Goldsmith’s London mayoral campaign leaflets |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2016/03/deafening-dogwhistle-zac-goldsmith-s-london-mayoral-campaign-leaflets |publisher = [[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bienkov |first=Adam |date=4 October 2016 |title=Ethnic minority Tories say Zac Goldsmith's dog-whistle campaign badly damaged party  |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/10/04/ethnic-minority-tories-zac-goldsmith-damaged-party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The phrase "[[states' rights]]", literally referring to powers of individual state governments in the United States, was described in 2007 by David Greenberg in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' as "code words" for institutionalized segregation and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2007/11/dogwhistling_dixie.html | title=Dog-Whistling Dixie.

{{quote|Y'all don't quote me on this. You start out in 1954 by saying, "[[Nigger]], nigger, nigger." By 1968, you can't say "nigger" &amp;mdash; that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like [[forced busing]], states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me &amp;mdash; because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger."|Lee Atwater, Republican Party strategist in an anonymous interview in 1981}}

Atwater was contrasting this with [[Ronald Reagan]]'s campaign, which he felt "was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference."  However, others like U.S. law professor and author of the 2014 book ''Dog Whistle Politics'' [[Ian Haney-López]] described Reagan as "blowing a dog whistle" when the candidate told stories about "[[Cadillac]]-driving '[[welfare queen]]s' and 'strapping young bucks' buying T-bone steaks with [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]" while he was campaigning for the presidency.&lt;ref name="Lopez_2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haney López |first=Ian |date=2014 |title=Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=4 |isbn=978-0-19-996427-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ Full Show: Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I].

According to López, conservative middle-class whites, convinced by powerful economic interests that minorities are the enemy, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime but inadvertently also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, [[union busting]], cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of the population since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ Full Show: Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I].

Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision denying the [[Citizenship in the United States|U. S. citizenship]] of any [[African American]]. To most listeners the criticism seemed innocuous, Safire wrote, but "sharp-eared observers" understood the remark to be a pointed reminder that Supreme Court decisions can be reversed, and a signal that, if re-elected, Bush might nominate to the Supreme Court a justice who would overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190" /&gt; This view is echoed in a 2004 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article by Peter Wallsten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/13/nation/na-dred13 | title=Abortion Foes Call Bush's Dred Scott Reference Perfectly Clear

'''Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium''' (also known as extraradical mycelium) is the collection of filamentous [[fungal]] hyphae emanating from [[ectomycorrhizas]]. It may be composed of fine, [[hydrophilic]] hypha which branches frequently to explore and exploit the soil matrix or may aggregate to form [[rhizomorphs]]; highly differentiated, [[hydrophobic]], enduring, transport structures.

=== Overview ===

Apart from [[mycorrhizas]], extramatrical mycelium is the primary vegetative body of ectomycorrhizal fungi. It is the location of [[mineral]] acquisition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Landeweert R, Hoffland E, Finlay RD, Kuyper TW, van Breemen N |title=Linking plants to rocks: ectomycorrhizal fungi mobilize nutrients from minerals.|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=2001|volume=16|issue=5|pages=248–254|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470102122X|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02122-X|pmid=11301154}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[enzyme]] production,&lt;ref name="TedersooNaadel2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tedersoo|first1=Leho|last2=Naadel|first2=Triin|last3=Bahram|first3=Mohammad|last4=Pritsch|first4=Karin|last5=Buegger|first5=Franz|last6=Leal|first6=Miguel|last7=Kõljalg|first7=Urmas|last8=Põldmaa|first8=Kadri|title=Enzymatic activities and stable isotope patterns of ectomycorrhizal fungi in relation to phylogeny and exploration types in an afrotropical rain forest|journal=New Phytologist|volume=195|issue=4|year=2012|pages=832–843|issn=0028-646X|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04217.x|pmid=22758212}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a key means of colonizing new root tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=I.C.|author2=Cairney, J.

=== Exploration type ===

The mycelial growth pattern, extent of biomass accumulation, and the presence or absence of [[rhizomorphs]] are used to classify fungi by exploration type. Agerer first proposed the designation of exploration types in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agerer|first=R.|title=Exploration types of ectomycorrhizae A proposal to classify ectomycorrhizal mycelial systems according to their patterns of differentiation and putative ecological importance|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2001|volume=11|pages=107–114|doi=10.1007/s005720100108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept has since been widely employed in studies of ectomycorrhizal [[ecology]]. Four exploration types are commonly recognized: Contact, Short-distance, Medium-distance and Long-distance.

''Contact'' exploration types possess a predominantly smooth mantle and lack rhizomorphs with ectomycorrhizas in close contact with the surrounding [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. 
''Short-distance'' exploration types also lack rhizomorphs but the mantle is surrounded by frequent projections of hyphae, which emanate a short distance into the surrounding substrate. Most ectomycorrhizal [[ascomycetes]] are included in this group. 
''Medium-distance'' exploration types are further divided into three subtypes defined by the growth range and differentiation of its rhizomorphs. ''Medium-distance Fringe'' form interconnected hyphal networks with rhizomorphs that divide and fuse repeatedly. ''Medium-distance Mat'' types form dense hyphal mats which aggregate into a homogeneous mass. Finally, the ''Medium-distance Smooth'' sub-type has rhizomorphs with smooth mantles and margins. [[File:HYPHAE.png|thumbnail|right|Fungal Hyphae Cells 1- Hyphal wall 2- Septum 3- Mitochondrion 4- Vacuole 5- Ergosterol crystal 6- Ribosome 7- Nucleus 8- Endoplasmic reticulum 9- Lipid body 10- Plasma membrane 11- Spitzenkörper/growth tip and vesicles 12- Golgi apparatus]]
''Long-distance'' exploration types are highly differentiated, forming rhizomorphs that contain hollow vessel-like transport tubes. Long distance types are associated with increased levels of organic nitrogen uptake compared to other exploration types and are thought to be less competitive in disturbed systems in contrast to short distance types which are able to regenerate more efficiently after a [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lilleskov|first=E. A|author2=Hobbie, E. A. |author3=Horton, T. R. |title=Conservation of ectomycorrhizal fungi: exploring the linkages between functional and taxonomic responses to anthropogenic N deposition. Fungal Ecology|journal=Fungal Ecology|year=2011|volume=4|issue=2|pages=174–183|doi=10.1016/j.funeco.2010.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration type is primarily consistent within a given [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]. However, some fungal genera which contain a large number of [[species]] have a great diversity of extramatrical hyphal morphology and are known to contain more than one exploration type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agerer|first=R.|title=Fungal relationships and structural identity of their ectomycorrhizae|journal=Mycological Progress|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=67–107|doi=10.1007/s11557-006-0505-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, extrapolating exploration type to species known only by lineage is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tedersoo|first=L.|author2=Smith, M. E|title=Lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi revisited: Foraging strategies and novel lineages revealed by sequences from belowground.|journal=Fungal Biology Reviews|year=2013|volume=27|issue=3–4|pages=83–99|doi=10.1016/j.fbr.2013.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, Fungi fail to fit into a defined exploration type, falling instead along a gradient. Exploration type also fails to take into account other aspects of hyphal morphology, such as the extent to which hyphae cross into deeper [[soil horizons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genney|first=D.R.|author2=Anderson, I. C. |author3=Alexander, I. J. |title=Fine-scale distribution of pine ectomycorrhizas and their extramatrical mycelium.|journal=The New Phytologist|year=2006|volume=170|issue=2|pages=381–90|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field studies have shown that extramatrical mycelium is more likely to proliferate in [[mineral soil]]s than in [[organic material]], and may be particularly absent in fresh [[leaf litter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindahl|first=B.D.|author2=Ihrmark, K. |author3=Boberg, J. |author4=Trumbore, S. E. |author5=Högberg, P. |author6=Stenlid, J. |author7=Finlay, R. D. |title=Spatial separation of litter decomposition and mycorrhizal nitrogen uptake in a boreal forest.|journal=New Phytologist|year=2007|volume=173|issue=3|pages=611–20|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01936.x |pmid=17244056}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the presence of different ectomycorrhizal groups in different [[soil horizons]] suggest that different groups have evolved specialized [[niche separation]], possibly attributable to exploration type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landeweert|first=R.|author2=Leeflang, P. |author3=Kuyper, T. W. |author4=Hoffland, E. |author5=Rosling, A. |author6=Wernars, K. |author7=Smit, E. |title=Molecular identification of ectomycorrhizal mycelium in soil horizons.|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2003|volume=69|issue=1|pages=327–33|pmc=152382 |pmid=12514012 |doi=10.1128/aem.69.1.327-333.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological implications ==

=== Community assembly ===

[[File:Laccaria, DOE.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ectomycorrhizal Laccaria fruit bodies in forest community]]
Because ectomycorrhizas are small and possess a limited contact area with the surrounding soil, the presence of extramatrical hyphae significantly increases the [[surface area]] in contact with the surrounding environment. Increased surface area means greater access to necessary nutrient sources. Additionally, the presence of rhizomorphs or [[mycelial cords]], can act comparably to [[xylem]] tissue in plants, where hollow tubes of vessel hyphae shuttle water and [[solubilized]] nutrients over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cairney|first=J. W. G.|title=Translocation of solutes in ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic rhizomorphs.|journal=Mycological Research|year=1992|volume=96|issue=2|pages=135–141|doi=10.1016/S0953-7562(09)80928-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The abundance and spatial distribution of host root tips in the [[rhizosphere]] is an important factor mediating ectomycorrhizal [[Community (ecology)|community assembly]]. Root density may select for the exploration types best suited for a given root spacing. In [[Pine]] systems, Fungi that display short-distance exploration types are less able to colonize new roots spaced far from the mycorrhiza, and long-distance types dominate areas of low root density. Conversely, short-distance exploration types tend to dominate areas of high root density where decreased carbon expenditure makes them more competitive than long-distance species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peay|first=K. G|author2=Kennedy, P. G. |author3=Bruns, T. D. |title=Rethinking ectomycorrhizal succession: are root density and hyphal exploration types drivers of spatial and temporal zonation?|journal=Fungal Ecology|year=2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=233–240|doi=10.1016/j.funeco.2010.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The growth of extramatrical mycelium has a direct effect on the mutualistic nutrient trading between ectomycorrhizal fungi and their hosts. Increased hyphal occupation of the soil allows the fungus to take greater advantage of water and nutrients otherwise inaccessible to plant roots and to more efficiently transport these resources back to the plant. Conversely, the increased costs in carbon allocation associated with supporting a fungal partner with an extensive mycelial system presents a number of questions related to the [[costs and benefits]] of ectomycorrhizal mutualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weigt|first=R. B.|author2=Raidl, S. |author3=Verma, R. |author4=Agerer, R. |title=Exploration type-specific standard values of extramatrical mycelium – a step towards quantifying ectomycorrhizal space occupation and biomass in natural soil.|journal=Mycological Progress|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=287–297|doi=10.1007/s11557-011-0750-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon cycling ===

Although there is evidence that certain species of mycorrhizal fungi may obtain at least a portion of their carbon via [[saprotrophic nutrition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Talbot|first=J.M.|author2=Allison, S. D. |author3=Treseder, K. K. |title=Decomposers in disguise: mycorrhizal fungi as regulators of soil C dynamics in ecosystems under global change.|journal=Functional Ecology|year=2008|volume=22|issue=6|pages=955–963|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bulk of mycorrhizal carbon acquisition happens by way of trading for host-derived [[Photosynthate|photosynthetic products]]. Mycorrhizal systems represent a major [[carbon sink]]. Laboratory studies predict that around 23% of plant-derived carbon is allocated to extrametrical mycelium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rygiewicz|first=P.T.|author2=Andersen, C. P.|title=Mycorrhizae alter quality and quantity of carbon allocated below ground.|journal=Nature|year=1994|volume=369|issue=6475|pages=58–60|doi=10.1038/369058a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; although an estimated 15-30% of this is lost to fungal respiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hasselquist|first=N.J.|author2=Vargas, R. |author3=Allen, M. F. |title=Using soil sensing technology to examine interactions and controls between ectomycorrhizal growth and environmental factors on soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dynamics.|journal=Plant and Soil|year=2009|volume=331|issue=1–2|pages=17–29|doi=10.1007/s11104-009-0183-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HeinemeyerHartley2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heinemeyer|first1=Andreas|last2=Hartley|first2=Iain P.|last3=Evans|first3=Sam P.|last4=Carreira De La Fuente|first4=José A.|last5=Ineson|first5=Phil|title=Forest soil CO2flux: uncovering the contribution and environmental responses of ectomycorrhizas|journal=Global Change Biology|volume=13|issue=8|year=2007|pages=1786–1797|issn=1354-1013|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01383.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carbon allocation is distributed unequally to extramatrical mycelium depending on fungal taxa, nutrient availability, and the age of the associated mycorrhizas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosling|first=A.|author2=Lindahl, B. D. |author3=Finlay, R. D. |title=Carbon allocation to ectomycorrhizal roots and mycelium colonising different mineral substrates.|journal=New Phytologist|year=2004|volume=162|issue=3|pages=795–802|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=B.|author2=Nara, K. |author3=Hogetsu, T. |title=Spatiotemporal transfer of carbon-14-labelled photosynthate from ectomycorrhizal Pinus densiflora seedlings to extraradical mycelia.|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2002|volume=12|issue=2|pages=83–88|doi=10.1007/s00572-001-0157-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the carbon allocated to extramatrical mycelium accumulates as fungal [[biomass]], making up an estimated one-third of the total [[microbial]] biomass and one-half of the total [[dissolved organic carbon]] in some forest soils.&lt;ref name="Högberg 2002 791–795"/&gt; Carbon also supports the production of [[sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarp]]s and [[sclerotia]], with various taxa investing differentially in these structures rather than in the proliferation of extramatrical mycelium. Carbon acquisition also goes toward the production of fungal exudates. Extramatrical hyphae excrete a range of compounds into the soil matrix, accounting for as much as 40% of total carbon usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fransson|first=P.M.A.|author2=Anderson, I. C. |author3=Alexander, I. J. |title=Ectomycorrhizal fungi in culture respond differently to increased carbon availability.|journal=Microbiology Ecology|year=2007|volume=61|issue=1|pages=246–57|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2007.00343.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exudates are released primarily at the growing front, and are used in functions such as [[mineralization (soil)|mineralization]] and [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Y.P.|author2=Unestam, T. |author3=Lucas, S. D. |author4=Johanson, K. J. |author5=Kenne, L. |author6=Finlay, R. |title=Exudation-reabsorption in a mycorrhizal fungus, the dynamic interface for interaction with soil and soil microorganisms.|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=1999|volume=9|issue=3|pages=137–144|doi=10.1007/s005720050298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have attempted projections of the role that extramatrical mycelium may play in [[carbon sequestration]].  Although estimates of the life span of individual ectomycorrhizas very considerably, turnover is generally considered on a scale of months. [[File:Ectomycorrhizae002.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cortinarius ectomycorrhizas and extramatrical mycelium on ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' roots]]After death, the presence ectomycorrhizas on root tips, may increase the rate of root [[decomposition]] for some [[Taxonomy (biology)|fungal taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koide|first=R.T.|author2=Fernandez, C. W. |author3=Peoples, M. S. |title=Can ectomycorrhizal colonization of Pinus resinosa roots affect their decomposition?|journal=New Phytologist|year=2011|volume=191|issue=2|pages=508–14|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03694.x|pmid=21418224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides host plant death and mycorrhizal turnover, rates of carbon sequestration may also be affected by disturbances in the soil, which cause sections of the extramatrical mycelium to become severed from the host plant. Such disturbances, such as those caused by animal disruption, [[mycophagous]] invertebrates or habitat destruction, may have a notable impact on turnover rates. These variables make it difficult to estimate the turnover rates of mycorrhizal biomass in forest soils and the relative contribution of extramatrical mycelium to carbon sequestration.

=== Mycelial networks ===

The presence of long-distance extramatrical hyphae may affect forest health via the formation of common mycelial networks, in which hyphal connections form between plant hosts and can facilitate the transfer of carbon and nutrients between hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selosse|first=M.A.|author2=Richard, F. |author3=He, X. |author4=Simard, S. W. |title=Mycorrhizal networks: des liaisons dangereuses?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.07.003 |pmid=16843567 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=621–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycelial networks may also be responsible for facilitating the transport of [[allelopathic]] chemicals from the supplying plant directly to the rhizosphere of other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barto|first=E.K.|author2=Hilker, M. |author3=Müller, F. |author4=Mohney, B. K. |author5=Weidenhamer, J. D. |author6=Rillig, M. C. |title=The fungal fast lane: common mycorrhizal networks extend bioactive zones of allelochemicals in soils.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2011|volume=6|issue=11|pages=e27195.|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0027195 |pmid=22110615 |pmc=3215695}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ectomycorrhizal fungi increase [[primary production]] in host plants, with [[Trophic level|multi trophic]] effects. In this way, extramatrical mycelium is important to the maintenance of soil [[food webs]],&lt;ref name="Pollierer 2007 729–36"/&gt; supplying a significant nutritive source to invertebrates and [[microorganisms]].

== Mineral access ==

=== Enzyme production ===

The [[enzymatic activity|enzymatic activities]] of ectomycorrhizal fungi are highly variable between species. These differences are correlated with exploration type (particularly the presence or absence of rhizomorphs) rather than lineage or host association- suggesting that similar morphologies of extraradical mycelium are an example of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name="TedersooNaadel2012"/&gt; Differences in [[enzymatic activity]], and hence the ability to degrade [[organic compounds]] dictate fungal nutrient access, with wide ranging ecological implications.

=== Phosphorus ===

Because diverse ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa differ greatly in their [[metabolic activity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trocha, L. K.|first=L. K.|author2=Mucha, J. |author3=Eissenstat, D. M. |author4=Reich, P. B. |author5=Oleksyn, J. |title=Ectomycorrhizal identity determines respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates in root tips: a test using Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur saplings.|journal=Tree Physiology|year=2010|volume=30|issue=5|pages=648–54|doi=10.1093/treephys/tpq014}}&lt;/ref&gt; they also often differ in their capacity to trade nutrients with their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=T. I.|author2=Malajczuk, N. |author3=Grove, T. S. |title=The ability of 16 ectomycorrhizal fungi to increase growth and phosphorus uptake of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and E. diversicolor F. Muell.|journal=Plant and Soil|year=1993|volume=153|issue=2|pages=155–164|doi=10.1007/BF00012988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus acquisition by mycorrhizal fungi, and the subsequent transfer to plant hosts, is thought to be one of the main functions of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. Extramatrical mycelium is the site of collection for phosphorus within the soil system. This relationship is so strong that starving host plants of phosphorus is known to increase the growth of extramatrical mycelium tenfold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallander|first=H.|author2=Nylund, J. E.|title=Effects of excess nitrogen and phosphorus starvation on the extramatrical mycelium of ectomycorrhizas of Pinus sylvestris L.|journal=New Phytologist|year=1992|volume=120|issue=4|pages=495–503|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb01798.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrogen ===

Recently, [[Isotope|Isotopic]] studies have been used to investigate relative trading between ectomycorrhizal fungi and plant hosts and to assess the relative importance of exploration type on nutrient trading ability. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N values are elevated in ectomycorrhizal Fungi and depleted in fungal hosts, as a result of nutrient trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogberg|first=P.|author2=Hogberg, M.

E. |author4=Ekblad, A. |author5=Nasholm, T. |title=Nitrogen isotope fractionation during nitrogen uptake by ectomycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal Pinus sylvestris.|journal=New Phytologist|year=1999|volume=142|issue=3|pages=569–576|doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00404.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal species with exploration types producing greater amounts of extraradical mycelium are known to accumulate greater amounts &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N &lt;ref name="TedersooNaadel2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobbie|first=E.A.|author2=Agerer, R.|title=Nitrogen isotopes in ectomycorrhizal sporocarps correspond to belowground exploration types|journal=Plant and Soil|year=2009|volume=327|issue=1–2|pages=71–83|doi=10.1007/s11104-009-0032-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both root tips and fruit bodies, a phenomenon partially attributed to higher levels of N cycling within these species.

[[File:Amanita phalloides.R.H. 17.jpg|thumbnail|right| ''Amanita phalloides'' mycelium]]
Determining the [[longevity]] of extramatrical mycelium is difficult, and estimates range from just a few months to several years. Turnover rates are assessed in a variety of ways including direct observation and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;[[Carbon dating|C dating]]. Such estimates are an important variable in calculating the contribution that ectomycorrhizal fungi have to [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref name="Cairney 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cairney|first=J.

In order to differentiate ectomycorrhizal mycelium from the mycelium of [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic fungi]], biomass estimates are often done by [[ergosterol]] or phospholipid fatty acid analysis, or by using sand-filled bags, which are likely to be avoided by saprotrophic fungi because they lack [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name="Cairney 2012"/&gt;

'''Field acceleration method''' (FAM) is the target state variable of the field acceleration method is [[induction motor]] [[torque]]. In FAM theory, co-ordinate transformation is not involved. It attempts to avoid electromagnetic transients which cause delay in torque control response. First, electromagnetic transients of [[three-phase]] induction motor are analyzed. Initial attempt is made to derive `equivalent circuits valid for both steady state and transient states in induction motor.

The key point of FAM control is that the exciting current is kept constant in magnitude and continuous in the equivalent circuit. The speed of rotating air gap flux is made free or adjustable. This means that the magnetic field in the air gap is kept constant in its amplitude and that its speed is adjustable so that a desired value of torque is produced. When the air gap flux is kept constant, other variables like voltages, current and torque are functions of slip frequency only. By accelerating or decelerating rotation of the air gap flux to choose the slip frequency, the torque can be controlled as desired.

==Electromagnetic transients==
To obtain very quick torque control response in induction motor, it is required to suppress electromagnetic transients which might be caused by the control. Then it is necessary to investigate the electromagnetic transients of an induction motor. Within the induction motor, the largest inductance is the exciting inductance of exciting reactance. Exciting current flows there. If it is accompanied by any transient, delay time constant will be very large. it is necessary to avoid transients of exciting current. It is therefore necessary to maintain continuity of amplitude and phase of exciting current.

==Types of control==
FAM control of induction motor torque has two types of control namely current control and voltage control. Constant exciting current produces good linearity’s between torque and slip frequency. In current control, the primary current is the control input to the induction motor whereas the primary terminal voltage is the control input in voltage control. Two transient phenomena are associated with induction motor operation. One is the mechanical transient of the dynamic system driven by induction motor and the other is the electromagnetic transient within the induction motor. In the first, speed and position of the motor shaft are state variables whereas in latter voltage, current, magnetic field are the state variables. Even though the two systems are interconnected but they can be treated separately. In numerical analysis of electromagnetic transients, it is assumed that the related dynamic state variables are constant and the instantaneous value of the motor torque is found and is fed into the analysis of transients in the dynamic system.

==Performance==
In FAM control, torque can be controlled by the vector of secondary current.FAM control provides the induction motor with very superior steady state performances based on its T equivalent three circuits which behave same when viewed from primary terminals but differ due to different phenomena occurring in the secondary side.

Since reports of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) began to emerge in the [[United States]] in the 1980s, the HIV epidemic has frequently been linked to [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and other [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) by epidemiologists and medical professionals. The first official report on the virus was published by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) on June 5, 1981 and detailed the cases of five young gay men who were hospitalised with serious infections.&lt;ref&gt;CDC (1981, 5th June) 'Pheumocystis Pneumonia - Los Angeles', MMWR, Vol. 30.                        No. 21. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/june_5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, The New York Times reported that 41 homosexuals had been diagnosed with [[Kaposi’s Sarcoma]], and eight had died less than 24 months after the diagnosis was made.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times (1981, 3rd July) "Rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals" https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html?&amp;pagewanted=2&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, the condition was referred to in the medical community as ([[Gay-related immune deficiency]] (GRID), "gay cancer," and "gay compromise syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, G.A, et al (1982) 'Attempted immune stimulation in the "gay compromise syndrome"'. BMJ, 1982 October 16; 285(6348): 1082.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until July 1982 that the term [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) was suggested to replace GRID,&lt;ref&gt;Grmek, M.D. (1990) 'History of AIDS: Emergence and origin of a modern pandemic', New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and even then it was not until September that the CDC first used the AIDS acronym in an official report.&lt;ref&gt;MMWR Weekly (1982) 'Current Trends Update on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) – United States', September 24, 31(37); 507-508, 513-514.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now well understood that HIV does not only affect the [[gay community]] but can also infect anybody, regardless of sex, ethnicity, or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 AIDS epidemic update |publisher=Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011837/http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, HIV still severely affects MSM across the globe.  MSM are only a small percentage of the U.S. population, but they are consistently the population group most affected by the HIV/AIDS virus and are the largest proportion of American citizens with an AIDS diagnosis who have died.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"&gt;Center for Disease Control. “HIV among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)” (2010). Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimates that 2 to 20% of MSM are infected with HIV, depending on the region they live in.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"&gt;Men who have sex with men, HIV prevention and care” Geneva, November 2005.

{{Main|Men who have sex with men}}
Men who have sex with men (abbreviated as '''MSM''', also known as '''males who have sex with males''') are [[male|male person]]s who engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex, regardless of how they personally identify themselves. Many MSM choose not to (or cannot for other reasons) identify as [[homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men |publisher=UNAIDS |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320001221/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the label excludes men who identify as gay or bisexual, but who have never had sex with another man, including many gay teenagers.

The terms MSM and women who have sex with women (WSW) have been used in medical scholarship since at least 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Rebecca M. and Ilan H. Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and "WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt; But, the term has been attributed to Glick ''et al.'', because their usage in a 1994 study solidified the concept in medical terminology.&lt;ref name="Young Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young RM, Meyer IH |title=The trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": erasure of the sexual-minority person in public health discourse |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1144–1149 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15961753 |pmc=1449332 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046714 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick M, Muzyka BC, Salkin LM, Lurie D |title=Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of AIDS |journal=J.

Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and “WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
Determining the number of men who have ever had sex with another man is difficult worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 3% and as high as 16% of men have had sex at least once with a man. Their estimate includes victims of sexual abuse in addition to men who regularly or voluntarily have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
| url = http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/sw_toolkit/Between_men_full_version.pdf
| title = Between Men – HIV/STI prevention for men who have sex with men
| page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimates that 6-20% of men worldwide have sex with other men at some point during their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Geneva 2005"&gt;“Men who have sex with men, HIV prevention and care” Geneva, November 2005. UNAIDS. http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/jc1233-msm-meetingreport_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates about the U.S. population of MSM vary. The Center for Disease Control estimates that men who have sex with men represent about 2% of the American population.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; A 2005 study estimates that among U.S. men aged 15 to 44, an estimated 6% of have engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at some point in their lives, and about 2.9% have had at least one male partner in the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Of these men, 71% are White, 15.9% are Hispanic, and 8.9% are black. The percentage of men who were MSM varied by state, with the lowest percentage in South Dakota (3.3%) and the highest in the District of Columbia (13.2%).  However, the same study found that 57% of men who have sex with men identify as bisexual or straight.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, S., Fallon, S., Friedman, S., Thompson, D., Gates, G., Liberti, T., &amp; Malow, R.

The CDC reported  that in 2009 that male-to-male sex (MSM)  accounted for 61% of all new HIV infections in the U.S. and that those who had a history of recreational [[drug injection]] accounted for an additional 3% of new infections. Among the approximately 784,701 people living with an HIV diagnosis, 396,810 (51%) were MSM. About 48% of MSM living with an HIV diagnosis were white, 30% were black, and 19% were Hispanic or Latino. Although the majority of MSM are white,  non-whites accounted for 54% of new infections HIV related MSM infections in 2008.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt;

In 2010  the CDC reported that MSM represented approximately 4 percent of the male population in the United States but male-to-male sex accounted for 78 percent  of new HIV infections among men and 63 percent of all new infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECEMBER 2012 2 HIV Infections by Route  of Transmission|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2012/hiv-infections-2007-2010.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men overall accounted for 76% of all adults and adolescents living with HIV infection at the end of 2010 in the United States, and 80% (38,000) of the estimated 47,500 new HIV infections.  69% of men  living with HIV were gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.  39% (14,700) of new HIV infections in US men were in blacks, 35% (13,200) were in whites, and 22% (8,500) were in Hispanics/Latinos.  The rate of estimated new HIV infections among black men (per 100,000) was 103.6—six and a half times that of white men (15.8) and more than twice the rate among Hispanic/Latino men (45.5) as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among Men in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/men/index.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC (2015) reported  that gay and bisexual men accounted for 82% (26,375 out of 1,242,000 adults and adolescents) of HIV diagnoses among males and 67% of all diagnoses in the United States, while six percent (2,392) of HIV diagnoses were attributed to injection drug use (IDU) and another 3% (1,202) to male-to-male sexual contact plus IDU.  Heterosexual contact accounted for 24% (9,339) of all HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV in the United States: At A Glance|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all gay and bisexual men with HIV infection classified as AIDS in the United States in 2015, African Americans accounted for the highest number (3,928; 39%), followed by whites (3,096; 31%) and Hispanics/Latinos (2,430; 24%). At the end of 2014, 508,676 gay and bisexual men were living with diagnosed HIV infection (53% of everyone living with diagnosed HIV in the US). Of gay and bisexual men living with diagnosed HIV, 157,758 (31%) were African American, 212,558 (42%) were white, and 109,857 (22%) were Hispanic/Latino. From 2005 to 2014 diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men increased 22% but has increased less than 1% between 2010 and 2014. HIV diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 increased 87% between 2005 and 2014, but with diagnoses declining 2% between 2010 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among African American Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/bmsm.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2010 study estimated that for every 100,000 MSM, 692 will be diagnosed with HIV. This makes MSM 60 times more likely to contract the virus than other men and 54 times more likely than women.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, D.W., C Johnson, A Lansky, J Prejean, R Stein, P Denning, Z Gaul, H Weinstock, J Su, &amp; N Crepaz.

Since its height in 1993-1994 the death rate due to HIV  has fallen more than 9 other leading causes of death, yet as of 2013 HIV continues to be one of the 10  leading causes of death among persons 25-44, especially among men, African Americans and in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortality Slide Series|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/slidesets/cdc-hiv-epa5-mortality-slides-2013.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also as regards HIV relation to mortality, a study  in the [[United Kingdom]]   reported that in 2008 the overall mortality rate among the HIV-diagnosed  population aged 15–59 years remained more than five times higher than that in the general population. However, as the study acknowledges  data  on  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  on  mortality among  gay and bisexual men as well as  among other populations, is very limited, and  methods to use  this are  problematic.&lt;ref name="wiley.com"&gt;Wiley Online Library: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12045/pdf Ten-year mortality trends among persons diagnosed with HIV infection in England and Wales in the era of antiretroviral therapy: AIDS remains a silent killer - Simmons - 2013 - HIV Medicine - Wiley Online Library], accessdate: April 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
A 2007 study analyzing two large population surveys found that "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women."&lt;ref name=MedicalNews&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/82330.php Sexual Behavior Does Not Explain Varying HIV Rates Among Gay And Straight Men]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodreau SM, Golden MR |title=Biological and demographic causes of high HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevalence in men who have sex with men |journal=Sex Transm Infect |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=458–462 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17855487 |pmc=2598698 |doi=10.1136/sti.2007.025627}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2006 study found that men who reported 4 or more male sexual partners were at increased risk of HIV infection. Study participants who reported amphetamine or heavy alcohol use before sex were more likely to have HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"&gt;BA Koblin. “Risk factors for HIV infection among men who have sex with men” (2006) AIDS, 20. 731-739.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kaiser Family Foundation study indicated that fewer Americans view HIV as a top health priority today compared to ten years ago. In 1996, 25% of Americans viewed HIV as an “urgent problem” to their community but in 2009, only 17% listed it as “urgent.” The percentage of 18- to 29-year-olds that were personally concerned about contracting the virus dropped from 28% in 1995 to 17% in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation. (2009) “2009 Survey of Americans on HIV/AIDS: summary of findings on the domestic epidemic.”&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 6 major U.S. cities found that only one in 4 teenage men who have sex with men believed they were personally at risk for contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref&gt;MacKellar DA, Valleroy LA, Secura GM, et al. (2007) Perceptions of lifetime risk and actual risk for acquiring HIV among young men who have sex with men. AIDS Behav:263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unprotected anal intercourse===

The HIV virus is more easily transmitted through unprotected [[anal intercourse]] than through unprotected [[vaginal intercourse]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.avert.org/men-sex-men.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and men who report unprotected receptive anal intercourse are at increased risk of contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"/&gt; Generally, the receptive partner is at greater risk of contracting the HIV virus because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body through semen exchange. The insertive partner is also at risk because STIs can enter through the [[urethra]] or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa22.htm Center for Disease Control; "Can I get HIV from anal sex?"]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study of HIV positive men found men who had unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the past year were put at risk for contracting the virus. The study found that men who reported engaging in UAI had increased from 30% in 1996 to 42% in 2000. Almost half of all men who participated in UAI in 1996-1997 said that they had not known the HIV status of their partner &lt;ref&gt;Dodds, J.P., D.E. Mercey, J.V. Parry &amp; A.M. Johnson. (2004) Increasing risk behaviour and high levels of undiagnosed HIV infection in a community sample of homosexual men. Sex Transm Infect; 80:236-240&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that risk factors for HIV infection are anal intercourse with a man in the past 12 months, having unstable housing, and having inhaled [[alkyl nitrites]] (“poppers”).&lt;ref&gt;Mimiaga, M., Reisner, S., Cranston, K., Isenberg, D., Bright, D., Daffin, G., Bland, S., &amp; Driscoll, M. (2009). Sexual mixing patterns and partner characteristics of black msm in Massachusetts at increased risk for HIV infection and transmission. Journal of Urban Health, 86(4), 602-623.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study on the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM found that majority protected their partners during sexual activity, but a sizeable number of men continue to engage in sexual behaviors that place themselves and others at risk for HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;Crepaz, Nicole, Marks, Gary; Liau, Adrian; Mullins, Mary M; Aupont, Latrina W; Marshall, Khiya J; Jacobs, Elizabeth D; Wolitski, Richard J; (2009) “Prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM in the United States: a meta-analysis”, AIDS, 80, 23:1617-1629&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condom fatigue===
Although HIV transmission rates fell throughout the 1990s, they hit a plateau at the end of the decade. The increasing rates of sexually transmitted diseases in major cities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom led to reports in the gay and mainstream media of [[condom fatigue]] and "AIDS optimism" as causes of the new "laxness" in safe sex practices.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"&gt;Adam, Barry D., Winston Husbands, James Murray, and John Maxwell. (2005): AIDS optimism, condom fatigue, or self-esteem? Explaining unsafe sex among gay and bisexual men, Journal of Sex Research, 42:3, 238-248&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by research on the tendency of couples (heterosexual or homosexual) to use [[condoms]] less over time.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, P., Miller, L., &amp; Rothspan, S.

Interpretations of condom use and nonuse among young Norwegian gay men. Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 15(1), 58-83.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2010 study found that gay and bisexual men choose to have unprotected sex for a variety of reasons and cannot be generalized. [[Erectile dysfunction]], mental health problems and [[Mood disorder|depression]], lack of communication or intimacy, and a [[subculture]] of unprotected sex were all listed as reasons why men had sex without condoms voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"/&gt;

==Prevention==
In the late 1980s the first direct advocacy groups for people with HIV/AIDS were created. Notably, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ([[ACT UP]]) formed at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center]] in New York in the wake of the antiretroviral drug [[Zidovudine|AZT]] to petition better access to drugs as well as cheaper prices, public education about AIDS and the prohibition of AIDS-related discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History - 1988, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published a paper in 2005 offering specific policy solutions for alleviating the spread of the HIV virus in the MSM population for specific regions around the world. They pointed to “a profound lack of knowledge” and stigma about sexual identity as worldwide barriers to preventing transmission and encouraging those infected to seek treatment. The UNAIDS program has recommended that the South African government implement “sex positive” policies to reduce societal stigma around homosexuality and promote the use of water-based lubricants. Particularly in Morocco, the program has advocated distributing condoms in prisons. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to acknowledge the sexuality of its constituents. According to UNAIDS, the “Government has made significant progress in recognizing the issue of male-to-male sexual health and HIV.” In Latin America, outreach to rural areas is critical to ensuring care to all individuals. The United Nations also emphasizes a focus on LGBT populations that are most vulnerable in Latin American nations. In Jamaica, as in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is outlawed so there are unique challenges to HIV prevention in the MSM community. The UN is trying to implement community-based strategies in Jamaica while still ensuring the anonymity of the people served. In Norway, UNAIDS has observed an increasing number of MSM who have untreated sexually transmitted infections, and their emphasis is on promoting condom use within the gay community. Despite Canada’s “liberal and progressive” reputation on the world stage, HIV-related stigma is still related to the gay community. The United Nations believes the United States needs to recognize [[sexual education]] as a fundamental human right. Additionally, better research on MSM in the U.S. would positively affect funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Geneva 2005"/&gt;

Studies have shown that although there is a large market for vaginal microbicides in developing nations, rectal microbicides are stigmatized and less researched. No microbicide has yet been proven to effectively protect against the risks of unprotected anal intercourses, but advocates believe greater funding for research is needed since condom usage rates are so low. However, stigma and homophobia would potentially be barriers to individuals buying the product. The authors mention this is especially a concern in Caribbean countries where HIV prevalence is high but homosexuality is still illegal and highly stigmatized (See [[HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean]].) &lt;ref&gt;

===Access to testing===
UNAIDS has observed “sero-selection” (choosing a partner based on their HIV status) becoming increasingly prevalent in partner choice and transmission in the United States.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"/&gt; A 2008 CDC study found that one in five (19%) of MSM in major U.S. cities were infected with HIV and almost half (44%) were unaware of their infection.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; Many HIV-infected individuals do not seek treatment until late in their infection (an estimated 42% do not seek treatment until they begin to experience signs of illness.) Furthermore, a significant portion of individuals who are tested for HIV never return for their test results. Studies have advocated for funding and implementation of HIV tests that can be administered outside medical settings since 2003. Home testing is considered especially important because 8%-39% of partners tested in studies of partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) were found to have a previously undiagnosed HIV infection that their partner was unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Janssen, M.D., I. M. Onorato, M.D., R. O. Valdiserri, M.D., T. M. Durham, M.S., W. P. Nichols, M.P.A., E. M. Seiler, M.P.A., H. W. Jaffe, M.D. “Advancing HIV Prevention: New Strategies for a Changing Epidemic -- United States, 2003” (2003) The Body Pro: HIV Resource for Health Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, OraQuick, the first rapid HIV home-testing kit, went on sale for $40. The test is nearly 100% accurate when it predicts HIV-negative results for HIV-negative individuals. However, for HIV-positive individuals that are not yet producing the antibodies detected by the test, it produces a false negative 93% of the time. Although the manufacturer, OraSure Technologies, is not advertising the test for use for selection of partners,  experts have suggested that it may prevent unprotected sexual contact with partners that lie about or are unaware of their HIV status.&lt;ref name="Donald G. 2012"&gt;McNeil Jr., Donald G. “Another Use for Rapid Home H.I.V. Test: Screening Sexual Partners.” The New York Times. October 5th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study examined how the OraQuick test would identify the behavior of 27 self-identified gay men who frequently had unprotected sex with acquaintances. The researchers gave each participant 16 tests to use over the course of three months. 101 potential partners were tested, and 10 were positive. None of the participants had sex with someone who tested positive.  23 other potential partners refused testing and left the encounter. 2 men admitted they were HIV-positive. Most participants said they would continue using home tests after the study ended to test potential partners on their own. The researchers considered home testing to be an effective prevention method for high-risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo-Dieguez, Alex, Timothy Frasca, Ivan Balan, Mobolaji Ibitoye, and Curtis Dolezal. “Use of a Rapid HIV Home Test Prevents HIV Exposure in a High Risk Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men.” AIDS and Behavior. Volume 16, Number 7 (2012), 1753-1760.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the test’s $40 cost is considered a major deterrent to commonplace partner testing.

The '''International Association for Plant Taxonomy''' ('''IAPT''') promotes an understanding of [[plant]] [[biodiversity]], facilitates international communication of research between [[botany|botanists]], and oversees matters of uniformity and stability in plant names. The IAPT was founded on July 18, 1950 at the Seventh [[International Botanical Congress]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT|IAPT web site]].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the IAPT headquarters is located in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]. Its current president, since 2017, is [[Patrick S. Herendeen]] of the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]]; vice-president is [[Gonzalo Nieto Feliner]] of the [[Real Jardín Botánico]], Madrid; and secretary-general is [[Karol Marhold]] of the Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.

Both the taxonomic journal '''''Taxon''''' and the series '''''Regnum Vegetabile''''' are published by the IAPT.  The latter series includes the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', the ''Index Nominum Genericorum'', and ''Index Herbariorum''.

==Purpose==
The IAPT's primary purpose is the promotion and understanding of biodiversity—the discovery, naming, [[taxonomic classification|classification]], and [[systematics]] of plants—for both living and [[Paleobotany|fossil plants]]. Additionally, it promotes the study and [[conservation biology|conservation]] of plant biodiversity, and works to raise awareness of the general public to this issue. The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant systematics, [[plant taxonomy|taxonomy]], and [[botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]]. This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.

{{cquote | IAPT was founded in 1950 as a not-for-profit organisation for the purposes of publication of a periodical (''Taxon'') dealing with activities of the association and with objects of general importance for plant taxonomy, the publication of books and indices of utility for plant taxonomists (''Regnum Vegetabile''), the establishment and maintenance of committees for specific taxonomic and nomenclatural purposes, and the organization of international symposia on problems of plant systematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT2004|''Taxon'' '''53''' (1): 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The IAPT also seeks to achieve uniformity and stability in [[Botanical name|plant names]].  It accomplishes this through the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', previously known as the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'', and through the oversight of the International Bureau for Plant Taxonomy and Nomenclature.

==Publications and online resources==
===''Taxon''===
&lt;!-- [[Taxon (journal)]] redirects to this section. --&gt;
''Taxon''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0040-0262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the bi-monthly journal of the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense. Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. ''Taxon'' also contains matters related to [[botanical nomenclature]], and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT2004|''Taxon'' '''53''' (1): 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals to amend the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN). Publication of such matters in ''Taxon'' satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant Biosystematics, reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news in the world of plant systematics.  Although the journal is "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idTAXON|TAXON - Journal of the IAPT]].&lt;/ref&gt; it has been in the past criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDavis1973|Davis &amp; Heywood 1973]], pp.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Regnum Vegetabile''===
&lt;!-- [[Regnum Vegetabile]] redirects to this section. --&gt;
''Regnum Vegetabile''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0080-0694}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a published series of books on topics of interest to plant taxonomists. Many of the volumes are literature surveys or monographs in the area of plant systematics. There are several volumes of general use:
*''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (Vol. 159, 2018) The ''ICN'' is a set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal names that are given to plants. The current edition is known as the "Shenzhen Code", as it was drafted in 2017 at the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China.
*''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'', 8th edition (Vol. 151, 2010) Companion to the ''ICN'', this volume sets forth rules regarding the names of plant [[cultivar]]s.
*''Index Nominum Genericorum'' (Vols. 100-102 &amp; 113) An index of all published [[Genus|generic]] names covered by the ''ICN'', including the place of publication and information about the type species. The index is prepared in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution. An electronic version is available [http://botany.si.edu/ing/ online].
*''Index Herbariorum'', the first six editions (Vol. 15, 31, 86, 92, 93, 106, 109, 114, 117, 120) A directory and guide to the [[Herbarium|herbaria]] of the world, including contact information, abbreviation codes, and important collections located in each herbarium. ''Index Herbariorum'' is now an online database, managed by The New York Botanical Garden, and available for [http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/IndexHerbariorum.asp on-line searching].
*''International Directory of Botanical Gardens'' (Updated as Vol. 95, 1977) A directory to [[botanical garden]]s and [[Arboretum|arboreta]] around the world.

The series includes many additional volumes of interest to specialists in specific subdisciplines of botany, in addition to the ones listed above.

===Databases===
In addition to electronic versions of its print publications, the IAPT maintains the following:
* "Names in Current Use"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/ncu/default.htm Names in Current Use (NCU)]&lt;/ref&gt; - A database of scientific names of extant botanical genera.

== Awards ==

The IAPT established two Engler Medals in honour of [[Adolf Engler]] in 1986: the Engler Medal in Gold awarded every six years for outstanding lifetime contributions to plant taxonomy and presented since 1987 at each International Botanical Congress (IBC), and the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu lato) awarded from 1987 to 2001 for a monograph or other work in systematic botany and presented from 1990 to 2002 at various meetings, congresses, symposia, etc. In 2002 the latter medal was divided into three awards for outstanding publications in these areas: the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu stricto) awarded for monographic or floristic plant systematics; the Stafleu Medal awarded for historical, bibliographic, and/or nomenclatural aspects of plant systematics; and the Stebbins Medal awarded for phylogenetic plant systematics and/or plant evolution. The medals honor [[Adolf Engler]] (24 Mar. 1844-10 Oct. 1930), [[Frans Antonie Stafleu]] (8 Sep. 1921-16 Dec. 1997), and [[George Ledyard Stebbins, Jr.]] (6 Jan. 1906-19 Jan. 2000).{{sfn|IAPT|2017}}

==Projects==

===Code Club===
In 2016, in partnership with [[Code Club|Code Club U.K.]], KCJ licensed the rights to Code Club Canada, which runs volunteer-led Code Clubs for free across Canada. There are now over 150 Code Clubs registered, throughout every province and territory.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt; These clubs, set up at schools, libraries and community centers for a minimum of 8 weeks host free coding activities for children aged 7-12.

===Code Create Teach===
In 2016, Kids Code Jeunesse, in partnership with Lighthouse Labs,&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt; embarked on a national campaign to inspire teachers to incorporate the basics of coding and computational thinking into their classrooms.&lt;ref name="Terri Coles" /&gt; From April to December 2018, KCJ will be hosting free, full-day Code Create Teach workshops which will provide K-12 educators with the tools to help them teach their students how to experiment with technology.&lt;ref name="Galang" /&gt; Two workshops are planned for each Canadian province and territory allowing KCJ to reach over 1500 teachers. During the workshops, KCJ instructors provide tips and guidelines to bring coding into the classroom, as well as combine unplugged activities with hands-on coding activities. These methods gives attendees the opportunity to connect with other teachers in purposeful and learner-driven way.&lt;ref name="Saint-Amant-Ringuette" /&gt; Following the Code Create Teach workshops, each teacher is given a free classroom kit of [[Micro Bit|micro:bits]], a pocket-sized programmable microcontroller designed to make learning and teaching code easy and fun.&lt;ref name="Galang"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Galang |first1=Jessica |title=LIGHTHOUSE LABS AND KIDS CODE JEUNESSE LAUNCH PROGRAM TO HELP TEACHERS LEARN TO CODE |url=https://betakit.com/lighthouse-labs-and-kids-code-jeunesse-launch-program-to-equip-teachers-with-coding-knowledge/ |website=Betakit |accessdate=20 July 2018 |date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Code MTL===
In 2017, KCJ was contracted for CodeMTL, a project designed to KCJs coding workshops to over 65 schools in the Commission Scolaire de Montréal, Quebec's largest school board.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt; 

===CanCode===
In January 2018, the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development announced that Kids Code Jeunesse was one the recipients of the inaugural CanCode program. This program is part of the Canadian Government's Innovation and Skills Plan which has the stated intention to invest $50 million by March 2019 to increase the opportunities for children and teachers to master digital skills. With the funds received, Kids Code Jeunesse has been able to extend the training it provides to Canada's youth and aims to support over 70,000 children and 2000 teachers.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;

[[File:Miles Glacier Bridge, damage and kludge, 1984.jpg|240px|thumbnail|Part of the [[Miles Glacier Bridge]], with a "kludge" (temporary fix) to make the bridge usable after [[1964 Alaska earthquake|earthquake]] damage.]]

A '''kludge''' or '''kluge''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ʌ|dʒ|,_|k|l|uː|dʒ}}) is a [[workaround]] or quick-and-dirty solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend and hard to maintain. This term is used in diverse fields such as [[computer science]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[Internet slang]], [[evolutionary neuroscience]], and government. A software kludge (often called "spaghetti code") is frequently the result of hacking. See photo of "A network kludge" at right. 

== Pronunciation and etymology ==
The word has alternate spellings (''[[Wikt:kludge|kludge]]'' and ''[[Wikt:kluge|kluge]]''), pronunciations ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ʌ|dʒ}} and {{IPAc-en|k|l|uː|dʒ}}, rhyming with ''judge'' and ''stooge'' respectively) and several proposed [[etymologies]].

=== Jackson W. Granholm ===
In the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed., 1989), the ''kludge'' entry cites one source for this word's earliest recorded usage, definition and [[etymology]]: Jackson W. Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article, which appeared in the American [[computer magazine]] ''[[Datamation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kludge''' {{IPA|/kluːdʒ/}} Also '''kluge'''. [J. W. Granholm's jocular invention: see first quot.; cf. also ''bodge'' v., ''fudge'' v.]&lt;ref&gt;This ''OED2'' defines these two ''kludge'' [[Cognate (etymology)|cognates]] as ''bodge'' "to patch or mend clumsily" and ''fudge'' "to fit together or adjust in a clumsy, makeshift, or dishonest manner".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;'An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole' (Granholm); esp. in ''Computing'', a machine, system, or program that has been improvised or 'bodged' together; a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or 'bug'. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although ''OED'' accepts Granholm's definition and credits him with the invention, examples of its use before the 1960s exist.

A source of some confusion has been Granholm's jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer, Phineas Burling, of the firm "Fink and Wiggles" (for [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]]) as confirming the Germanic origin of the word.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing. Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word "kludge" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn (then Bishop's Lynn) and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields.

The word "kludge" is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German "klug" (Dutch ''kloog'', Swedish ''Klag'', Danish ''Klog'', Gothic ''Klaugen'', Lettish ''Kladnis'' and Sanskrit ''Veklaunn''), originally meaning "smart" or "witty". In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word "Kludge" eventually came to mean "not so smart" or "pretty ridiculous". Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, "An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole."

It is in this latter sense that "Kludge" is used by computer hardware men. Today "kludge" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly. The amateur may readily presume that "that's the way computers are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=How to Design a Kludge
|author=Jackson W. Granholm
|publisher=Datamation
|year=February 1962
|pages=30–31
|url= http://neil.franklin.ch/Jokes_and_Fun/Kludge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Claims about derivation from the German adjective ''{{lang|de|klug}}'' ("clever") are unlikely for the following reasons:
* There is no equivalent usage in German
* Both pronunciations of the word contain the [[soft G|soft "g"]] ({{ipa|[[dʒ]]}}), which is not present in German
* The word emerges in English only in the 20th century

=== Yiddish ===
American [[Yiddish]] speakers use ''{{transl|yi|klug}}'' ({{lang|yi|{{linktext|קלוג}}}}) to mean "too smart by half", the reflected meaning of German ''{{lang|de|klug}}'' ("clever").  This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary, as well as the  pronunciation variation from German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/|title=Yiddish Dictionary Online ייִדיש װערטערבוך אַפֿן װעב|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European surname ===
It may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge (be that German, Dutch or Scandinavian). Even if Burling's etymology were true, it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers, who began using the term in the 20th century, could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding 400 years.

This ''OED2'' entry also includes the verb ''kludge'' ("to improvise with a kludge or kludges") and ''kludgemanship'' ("skill in designing or applying kludges").

=== Military jargon ===
The [[Jargon File]] (a.k.a. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary''), which is a [[glossary]] of computer programmer slang maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]], differentiates ''kludge'' from ''kluge'' and cites usage examples predating 1962.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kludge'''
# /kluhj/ n. Incorrect (though regrettably common) spelling of ''kluge'' (US). These two words have been confused in American usage since the early 1960s, and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II.
# [TMRC] A ''crock'' that works. (A long-ago ''Datamation'' article by Jackson Granholme {{sic}} similarly said: "An ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing whole.")
# v. To use a kludge to get around a problem. "I've kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up properly later."&lt;ref name="jargon"&gt;{{cite web
|title=The Jargon File
|author=Eric S. Raymond
|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/K/kludge.html
|accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This Jargon File entry notes ''kludge'' apparently derives via British military slang from [[Scots language|Scots]] ''cludge'' or ''cludgie''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=cludgie&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=both SND Cludgie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=4749&amp;startset=1107921&amp;query=CLUDGIE&amp;fhit=cludgie&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=sndn#fhit SND Cludie]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "a common toilet", and became confused with U.S. ''kluge'' during or after World War II.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kluge''': /klooj/ [from the German 'klug', clever; poss. related to Polish &amp; Russian 'klucz' (a key, a hint, a main point)]
# n. A [[Rube Goldberg]] (or [[Heath Robinson]]) device, whether in hardware or software.
# n. A clever programming trick intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner. Often used to repair bugs. Often involves ad-hockery and verges on being a crock.
# n. Something that works for the wrong reason.
# vt. To insert a kluge into a program. "I've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug, but there's probably a better way."
# &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Worcester Polytechnic Institute|WPI]]] n. A feature that is implemented in a rude manner.&lt;ref name="jargon"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This entry notes ''kluge'', which is now often spelled ''kludge'', "was the original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of hardware kluges". The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from [[navy|naval]] slang (cf. [[jury rig]]) or printing equipment.

''Kluge'' "was common Navy slang in the [[World War II]] era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea". A 1947 article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'' recorded the classic [[shaggy dog story]] "'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a 'kluge' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function."&lt;ref name="folklore"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Folklore from G. I. Joe, New York Folklore Quarterly
|volume=III, No. 4
|pages=285–297
|author=Agnes Nolan Underwood
|date=Winter 1947
|publisher=New York Folklore Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''kluge'' as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to 1947, as evidenced by the article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'',&lt;ref name="folklore"/&gt; but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense. The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On being drafted into the navy, Murgatroyd gave his profession as "kluge maker". Not wanting to seem ignorant, the clerk simply wrote this down. Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing, he said he was making a kluge, and actually he was one of the world's best kluge makers. Not wanting to seem ignorant, his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions, until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore.

One day the admiral came to inspect the ship. When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker, the admiral asked him what a kluge was&amp;nbsp;– the first person ever to do so. Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain, but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was. After a couple of days, he returned with a complex object.

"Interesting," said the admiral, "but what does it do?" In reply, Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship. As the thing sank, it went "kluge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://our-local.co.uk/index.php?topic=23170.5;wap2|title=Obsolete Occupations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jargon File further includes ''kluge around'' "to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge", ''kluge up'' "to lash together a quick hack to perform a task". After Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article popularized the ''kluge'' variant ''kludge'', both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as 'kludge'. ... British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Paper feeder ===

Another hypothesis dates to 1907, "when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from [[Oslo, Norway]] named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm". In 1919, the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which, by 1929, allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St. Paul, MN. While the automatic feeder was a success, unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being "temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair&amp;nbsp;— but oh, so clever!" The Kluge brothers continued to innovate, and the company remained active as of 2017. Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name, it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions. The Free Online Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC) claims that the term kluge "was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, was used exclusively for ''hardware'' kluges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/kluge|title=FOLDOC – Computing Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin. FOLDOC goes on to say, "[[TMRC]] and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang (see also [[foobar]]). It seems likely that 'kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war (many in MIT's venerable [[Building 20]], which housed TMRC until the building was demolished in 1999)." This would explain the term's introduction to the software community.

This explanation points to a Norwegian surname as the source, with no connection to German.

=== Acronym ===

Other suggested [[folk etymologies]] or [[backronyms]] for ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' is from '''k'''lumsy, '''l'''ame, '''u'''gly, '''d'''umb, but '''g'''ood '''e'''nough, or '''k'''lutzy '''l'''ashup, '''u'''nder-'''g'''oing '''e'''ngineering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The term ''kludge'' would then seem to have independent origins, possibly in Britain. The terms tended to merge because of their similar pronunciations and meanings. However, ''kluge'' seems to have the sense of overcomplicated, while ''kludge'' has only the sense of poorly done.

Cf. German {{lang|de|{{linktext|Kloß}}}} ("clod", diminutive {{lang|de|Klößchen}}), [[Low German|Low Saxon]] ''klut'', ''klute'', Dutch {{lang|nl|kluit}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=Adelung&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=DK01431|title=Wörterbuchnetz – Grammatisch-Kritisches Wörterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps related to Low German diminutive ''klütje'' ("dumpling, clod"), Danish [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutland dial.]] ''klyt'' ("piece of bad workmanship, kludge"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Aage|title=Et par etymologier|journal=Danske Studier|year=1926|pages=90|url=http://danskestudier.dk/materiale/1926.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011|editor1-first=Gunnar|editor1-last=Knudsen|editor2-first=Marius|editor2-last=Kristensen|publisher=Nordisk Forlag|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Standard [[Danish language|Danish]] {{lang|da|kludder}} ("mess, disorder").

=== Aerospace engineering ===
In [[aerospace]], a kludge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flightworthy in order to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured. The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film. Dialog between space crew and Ted approximately 30 minutes into the movie, following capsule power down. Ted says, "I'm in Huntsville kludging up a simulator of the XRV." The film was based on the [[Marooned (novel)|1964 novel]] of the same name.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first [[United States|US]] [[space station]], [[Skylab]]. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], began development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the [[S-IVB]] stage of the [[Saturn 1B]] and [[Saturn V]] launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the [[Apollo Applications Program]], but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter.

The Airlock Module's manufacturer, [[McDonnell Douglas]], even recycled the hatch design from its [[Project Gemini|Gemini spacecraft]] and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module. The Skylab project, managed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later [[Johnson Space Center]]) as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight.  Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it "the kludge".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Computer science ===
In modern [[computer science|computing]] terminology, a "kludge" (or often a "'''hack'''") is a solution to a problem, doing a task, or fixing a system that is inefficient, inelegant ("hacky") or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless (more or less) works. To "kludge around something" is to avoid a [[Computer bug|bug]] or some difficult condition by building a kludge, perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a [[workaround]], only without the grace. A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility, but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative. Note that a hack might be a kludge, but that ''hack'' could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Kidder
|first=Tracey
|title=[[The Soul of a New Machine]]
|publisher=Avon
|year=1982
|isbn=978-0-380-59931-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of [[cruft]].

Something might be a kludge if it fails in [[corner case]]s, but this is a less common sense, as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage. More commonly, a kludge is a poorly working [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] which was expected to work adequately. An intimate knowledge of the context (i.e., problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment) is typically required to build a corner case kludge. As a consequence, they are sometimes ironically praised.

An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s. The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long, increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}

A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a [[computer program]]. Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it, the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area, add code which divides by two when it is used, after the original code has been executed.

In computer networking, use of [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translation) (RFC 1918) or [[Port address translation|PAT]] (Port Address Translation) to cope with the  shortage of [[Internet Protocol|IPv4]] addresses is an example of a kludge.

In [[FidoNet]] terminology, ''kludge'' refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message.

=== Evolutionary neuroscience ===
{{see also|Evolutionary baggage}}
The ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' metaphor has been adapted in fields such as [[evolutionary neuroscience]], particularly in reference to the [[human brain]].

The neuroscientist [[David Linden]] discusses how [[intelligent design]] proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The transcendent aspects of our human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience (love, memory, dreams, and a predisposition for religious thought) result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history. It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings ''despite'' the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history. Rather, we have them precisely ''because'' of that history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-674-02478-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The research psychologist [[Gary Marcus]]'s book ''Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind'' compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like [[manifold vacuum]]-powered [[windshield wipers]]&amp;nbsp;– when you accelerated or drove uphill, "Your wipers slowed to a crawl, or even stopped working altogether."

&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, the vertebrate eye's [[retina]] that is installed backward, facing the back of the head rather than the front. As a result, all kinds of stuff gets in its way, including a bunch of wiring that passes through the eye and leaves us with a pair of [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]s, one in each eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the science fiction television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', genetically engineered human beings called [[Nietzschean (Andromeda)|Nietzschean]]s use the term disparagingly to refer to genetically unmodified humans.

In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s 1985 short story "Press Enter_", the antagonist, a reclusive hacker with unprecedented access to many databases, adopts the identity Charles Kluge.

In a 2012 article, the political scientist Steven Teles used the term "kludgeocracy" to criticize the complexity of social welfare policy in the United States. In the paper, Teles argues that institutional and political obstacles to passing legislation often drives policy makers to accept temporary, imperfect, fixes rather than carefully thought out reforms. &lt;ref name="teles_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teles|first1=Steven M.|title=Kludgeocracy in America|url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/kludgeocracy-in-america|journal=[[National Affairs]] |date=Fall 2017|issue=33|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawler_2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawler|first1=Joseph|title=Steven Teles Explains "Kludgeocracy"|url=http://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2012/12/14/steven_teles_explains_kludgeocracy_378.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|agency=Real Clear Policy|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cypripedium reginae.jpg|thumb|right|[[Showy lady slipper]] (''Cypripedium reginae'') has a pink '''labellum''']]
[[Image:Labelle orchidee.png|thumb|right|'''P:''' Petalum&lt;br /&gt;'''S:''' Sepalum&lt;br /&gt;'''L:''' '''Labellum''']]
In botany, the '''labellum''' (or '''lip''') is the part of the flower of an [[Orchidaceae|orchid]] or ''[[Canna (plant)|Canna]]'', or other less-known genera that serves to attract [[insect]]s, which [[pollination|pollinate]] the flower, and acts as a landing platform for them.

''Labellum'' (plural: ''labella'') is the Latin diminutive of ''labium'', meaning lip.

The labellum is a modified petal and can be distinguished from the other [[petal]]s and from the [[sepal]]s by its large size and its often irregular shape. It is not unusual for the other two petals of an orchid flower to look like the sepals, so that the labellum stands out as distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[[Liberty Hyde Bailey|Bailey, L. H.]] ''Gentes Herbarum: Canna x orchiodes''. (Ithaca), 1 (3): 120 (1923); Khoshoo, T. N. &amp; Guha, I. ''Origin and Evolution of Cultivated Cannas.'' Vikas Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;

In orchids, the labellum is the modified median petal that sits opposite from the fertile [[anther]] and usually highly modified from the other [[perianth]] segments. It is often united with the [[column (botany)|column]] and can be hinged or movable, facilitating pollination. Often, the orchid labellum is divided into three or more lobes. Some have modified fleshy lumps on the upper surface generally referred to as the '''callus''' (plural: ''calli''), with some being divided into multiple ridges or a central '''keel'''. When the callus is flat and broad, it is sometimes called a plate, which can have fringed margins. The callus can be highly modified with striking colors that may aid in pollinator deceit and mimicry.&lt;ref name="Dressler 1993"&gt;Dressler, R.L. 1993. ''Phylogeny and Classification of the Orchid Family''. Portland, Oregon: Dioscorides Press. pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzweil and Kocyan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kurzweil |first1=Hubert |last2=Kocyan |first2=Alexander |editor1-last=Kull |editor1-first=Tiiu |editor2-last=Arditti |editor2-first=Joseph |title=Orchid Biology: Reviews and Perspectives, VIII |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |year=2002 |pages=83-138 |chapter=Ontogeny of orchid flowers |isbn=1-4020-0580-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The labellum in orchids is often large and complex enough that terminology describing relative positions for structures on it becomes useful: the '''hypochile''' is the basal portion nearer the connection with the rest of the flower, the '''mesochile''' is the middle portion, and the '''epichile''' is the distal portion.&lt;ref name="Dressler 1993"/&gt;

His philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the ''Tractatus'', and a later period, articulated in the ''Philosophical Investigations''. The early Wittgenstein was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world and believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, he had solved all philosophical problems. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the assumptions of the ''Tractatus'', arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given [[language-game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/conant/Ian%20Proops%20The%20New%20Wittgenstein%20A%20Critique.pdf|title=PDF|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Wittgenstein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Karl Wittgenstein]] was one of the richest men in Europe.&lt;ref name=Bramann/&gt;|235x235px]]
According to a family tree prepared in Jerusalem after World War II, Wittgenstein's paternal great-great-grandfather was Moses Meier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wittgensteinchronology.com/4.html|title=Wittgenstein Family History - Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Chronology of his Life and Work|last=Preston|first=John|website=www.wittgensteinchronology.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] land agent who lived with his wife, Brendel Simon, in [[Bad Laasphe]] in the [[Siegen-Wittgenstein|Principality of Wittgenstein]], Westphalia.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:de:Schloss Wittgenstein|Schloss Wittgenstein]]. Various sources spell Meier's name Maier and Meyer.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1808, [[Napoleon]] issued a decree that everyone, including Jews, must adopt an inheritable [[Jewish surname|family surname]], and so Meier's son, also Moses, took the name of his employers, the [[Sayn-Wittgenstein]]s, and became Moses Meier Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein—who took the middle name "Christian" to distance himself from his Jewish background—married Fanny Figdor, also Jewish, who converted to [[Protestantism]] just before they married, and the couple founded a successful business trading in wool in Leipzig.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=4-5}} Ludwig's grandmother Fanny was a first cousin of the famous violinist [[Joseph Joachim]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=5}}

They had 11 children—among them Wittgenstein's father. Karl Otto Clemens Wittgenstein (1847–1913) became an industrial tycoon, and by the late 1880s was one of the richest men in Europe, with an effective monopoly on Austria's steel cartel.&lt;ref name="Bramann"&gt;Bramann, Jorn K. and Moran, John.

There were four girls: Hermine, [[Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein|Margaret]] (Gretl), Helene, and a fourth daughter Dora who died as a baby; and five boys: Johannes (Hans), Kurt, Rudolf (Rudi), [[Paul Wittgenstein|Paul]]—who became a concert pianist despite losing an arm in [[World War I]]—and Ludwig, who was the youngest of the family.&lt;ref name=Bartley16&gt;Bartley, William Warren.

For Wittgenstein, who highly valued precision and discipline, [[contemporary music]] was never considered acceptable at all.

[[Anthony Gottlieb]] tells a story about Paul practicing on one of the pianos in the Wittgensteins' main family mansion, when he suddenly shouted at Ludwig in the next room: "I cannot play when you are in the house, as I feel your scepticism seeping towards me from under the door!"&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;Gottlieb, Anthony.

The family Palace housed seven grand pianos&lt;ref&gt;Waugh p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; and each of the siblings pursued music "with an enthusiasm that, at times, bordered on the pathological."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest brother, Hans, was hailed as a musical prodigy. At the age of four, writes [[Alexander Waugh]], Hans could identify the [[Doppler effect]] in a passing siren as a quarter-tone drop in pitch, and at five started crying "Wrong! Wrong!" when two brass bands in a carnival played the same tune in different [[Key signature|keys]]. But he died in mysterious circumstances in May 1902, when he ran away to America and disappeared from a boat in [[Chesapeake Bay]], most likely having committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 24–26.

Two years later, aged 22 and studying chemistry at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]], the third eldest brother, Rudi, committed suicide in a Berlin bar.

Retrieved 11 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; before mixing himself a drink of milk and [[potassium cyanide]]. He had left several suicide notes, one to his parents that said he was grieving over the death of a friend, and another that referred to his "perverted disposition". It was reported at the time that he had sought advice from the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]], an organization that was campaigning against [[Paragraph 175]] of the German Criminal Code, which prohibited homosexual sex. His father forbade the family from ever mentioning his name again.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 22–23.

The second eldest brother, Kurt, an officer and company director, shot himself on 27 October 1918 at the end of World War I, when the Austrian troops he was commanding refused to obey his orders and deserted ''en masse''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=11}} According to Gottlieb, Hermine had said Kurt seemed to carry "...the germ of disgust for life within himself."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Wittgenstein wrote: "I ought to have... become a star in the sky. Instead of which I have remained stuck on earth."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=156}}

==1903–1906: Realschule in Linz==

===Realschule in Linz===
[[File:Realschule in Linz.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Realschule]]'' in Linz]]
Wittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was fourteen years old. Subsequently, for three years, he attended a school. After the deaths of Hans and Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Wiener Neustadt; having had no formal schooling, he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tutoring to pass the exam for the more technically oriented [[k.u.k.]] [[Realschule]] in [[Linz]], a small state school with 300 pupils.&lt;ref name="Waugh33"&gt;Waugh, p. 33.

* The successor institution to the ''Realschule'' in Linz is [[Bundesrealgymnasium Linz Fadingerstraße]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, when he was 14, he began his three years of formal schooling there, lodging nearby in term time with the family of Dr. Josef Strigl, a teacher at the local gymnasium, the family giving him the nickname Luki.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}}&lt;ref name="Sandgruber"&gt;Sandgruber, Roman.

Linz 2011. Retrieved 5 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On starting at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}} Historian [[Brigitte Hamann]] writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of [[High German]] with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable.&lt;ref name=Hamann15&gt;Hamann, Brigitte and Thornton, Thomas. ''Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship''. Oxford University Press, 2000 (first published 1996 in German), pp. 15–16, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: "''Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger Winde wegen Wienwärts''"&lt;ref name=Monk15&gt;Monk, pp.14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Monk can only be used as a source for the original German because this is incorrectly translated by Monk as "Wittgenstein wends his woeful windy way Vienna-wards"--&gt; ("Wittgenstein strolls wistfully Vienna-wards due to adverse winds"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark (5) in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}} He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931: "My bad spelling in youth, up to the age of about 18 or 19, is connected with the whole of the rest of my character (my weakness in study)."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}}

===Faith===
Wittgenstein was baptized as an infant by a Catholic priest and received formal instruction in Catholic doctrine as a child, as was common at the time.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; In an interview, his sister Gretl Stonborough-Wittgenstein says that their grandfather's "strong, severe, partly ascetic Christianity" was a strong influence on all the Wittgenstein children.&lt;ref&gt;Stonborough-Wittgenstein, Gretl. Reviewed in Portraits of Wittgenstein, Flowers &amp; Ground&lt;/ref&gt;  It was while he was at the ''Realschule'' that he decided he had lost his faith in God and became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=Monk18&gt;Monk, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless believed in the importance of the idea of [[confession]]. He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the ''Realschule''; Monk speculates that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.&lt;ref name=Monk18/&gt; As a teenager, Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual realism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately "shallow" thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts, his comes to an end."&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Value'', 1933-4, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's religious faith and his relationship with Christianity and religion, in general (for which he professed a sincere and devoted reverence{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}) would change over time, much like his philosophical ideas. In 1912, Wittgenstein wrote to Russell saying that Mozart and Beethoven were the actual sons of God.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=34}} However, Wittgenstein resisted formal religion, saying it was hard for him to "bend the knee",&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, 113&lt;/ref&gt; though his grandfather's beliefs continued to influence Wittgenstein—as he famously said, "I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view".&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig, reviewed in Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View, Tim Labron&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein referred to [[Augustine of Hippo]] in his ''Philosophical Investigations.'' Philosophically, Wittgenstein's thought shows fundamental alignment with religious discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. Ashford, "Wittgenstein's Theologians: A Survey of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Impact on Theology"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wittgenstein would become one of the century's fiercest critics of [[Scientism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monk|first1=Ray|title=Wittgenstein's Forgotten Lesson|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/regulars/ray-monk-wittgenstein|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=Prospect Magazine|issue=July 1999|publisher=Prospect Magazine|date=20 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With age, a deepening personal spirituality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, the temptation to think of God's existence as a matter of scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein, "Lectures on Religious Belief"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rush Rhees, "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Personal Recollections"&lt;/ref&gt; In Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'', he writes, "Is what I am doing [my work in philosophy] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." His close friend [[Norman Malcolm]] would write, "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Malcolm, "Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View"&lt;/ref&gt; At last, Wittgenstein writes, "Bach wrote on the title page of his ''[[Orgelbüchlein]]'', ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’  That is what I would have liked to say about my work."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Influence of Otto Weininger===
[[File:OttoWeiningerspring1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] (1880–1903)]]
While a student at the ''Realschule'', Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]]'s 1903 book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' (''[[Sex and Character]]'').
Weininger (1880–1903), who was also Jewish, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as [[Platonic realism|Platonic forms]], and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=19-26}} Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.&lt;ref&gt;p216, Philosophical Tales, Cohen, M., Blackwell 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated 23 August 1931, Wittgenstein wrote the following to [[G. E. Moore]];&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Moore,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Thanks for your letter. I can quite imagine that you don’t admire Weininger very much, what with that beastly translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It isn’t necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you just add a “∼” to the whole book it says an important truth.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In an unusual move, Wittgenstein took out a copy of Weininger's work on 1 June 1931 from the Special Order Books in the university library. He met Moore on 2 June where he probably gave Moore the copy of Weininger's work.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}

===Jewish background and Hitler===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Austria}}
There is much debate about the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews. The issue has arisen in particular regarding Wittgenstein's schooldays, because [[Adolf Hitler]] was, for a while, at the same school at the same time.&lt;ref name=McGuinnessStern&gt;For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as completely German, not Jewish, see McGuinness, Brian. "Wittgenstein and the Idea of Jewishness", and for an opposing view, see Stern, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FWAX4Ff69SwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wittgenstein:+Biography+and+Philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xwGKTNX8JYWenwfT0LiyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Was%20Wittgenstein%20a%20Jew%3F&amp;f=false "Was Wittgenstein Jewish?"], both in James Carl Klagge. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp. 231ff and p. 237ff respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Goldstein]] argues it is "overwhelmingly probable" the boys met each other: that Hitler would have disliked Wittgenstein, a "stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart ..."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Lawrence. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EvHPNoKvmf0C&amp;pg=PA167 ''Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and his Relevance to Modern Thought'']. Duckworth, 1999, p. 167ff. Also see [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2659846 "Clear and Queering Thinking"], review in ''Mind'', Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein's wealth and unusual personality may have fed Hitler's antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Marie. "Hi Ludwig", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 26 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein and Hitler were born just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his mathematics exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so they ended up two grades apart at the ''Realschule''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler started at the school on 17 September 1900, repeated the first year in 1901, and left in the autumn of 1905; see Kersaw, Ian. ''Hitler, 1889–1936''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000, p. 16ff.
* McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889–1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 51ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Monk estimates they were both at the school during the 1904–1905 school year, but says there is no evidence they had anything to do with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, p. 15.
* Brigitte Hamann argues in ''Hitler's Vienna'' (1996) that Hitler was bound to have laid eyes on Wittgenstein, because the latter was so conspicuous, though she told ''Focus'' magazine they were in different classes, and she agrees with Monk that they would have had nothing to do with one another.

In his own writings&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., MS 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein frequently referred to himself as Jewish, at times as part of an apparent self-flagellation. For example, while berating himself for being a "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" thinker, he attributed this to his own Jewish sense of identity, writing: "The saint is the only Jewish genius. Even the greatest Jewish thinker is no more than talented. (Myself for instance)."&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Value'', Ludwig Wittgenstein, (Oxford 1998), page 16e (see also, pages 15e–19e).&lt;/ref&gt; While Wittgenstein would later claim that "[m]y thoughts are 100% Hebraic,"&lt;ref&gt;M.O'C. Drury, "Conversations with Wittgenstein", in ''Recollections of Wittgenstein'', ed. R. Rhees, New York: Oxford University Press, revised edition, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Hans Sluga]] has argued, if so, "His was a self-doubting Judaism, which had always the possibility of collapsing into a destructive self-hatred (as it did in [[Otto Weininger|Weininger's]] case) but which also held an immense promise of innovation and genius."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Sluga]], ''The Cambridge companion to Wittgenstein'', (Cambridge 1996), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1906–1913: University==

===Engineering at Berlin and Manchester===
[[File:10. Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen.jpg|right|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen]]
[[File:1895 technische hochschule charlottenburg.jpg|right|thumb|The old [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin]]
He began his studies in mechanical engineering at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin, on 23 October 1906, lodging with the family of professor Dr. Jolles. He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a [[diploma]] (''Abgangzeugnis'') on 5 May 1908.

During his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in [[aeronautics]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=27}} He arrived at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the spring of 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near [[Glossop]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=29}} Specifically, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir [[Arthur Schuster]].&lt;ref name="Lemco 39–51"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lemco |first=Ian |date=22 January 2007 |title=Wittgenstein's Aeronautical Investigation |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=39–51 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2006.0163 |jstor=20462605 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=30-35}} At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein’s ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein’s innovative design was created. Wittgenstein’s design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and therefore creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.&lt;ref name="Lemco 39–51" /&gt;

[[File:11. With Eccles at the Kite-Flying Station in Glossop.jpg|right|thumb|Ludwig with Eccles at the Kite-Flying Station in [[Glossop]]]]
Work on the jet-powered propeller proved frustrating for Wittgenstein, who had very little experience working with machinery.&lt;ref name="Mays, p.137"&gt;Mays, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that “when things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw his arms around, stomp about, and swear volubly in German.”&lt;ref&gt;Mays, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing on the design of the propeller — a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.&lt;ref name="Mays, p.137" /&gt;

It was at this time that he became interested in the [[foundations of mathematics]], particularly after reading [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903), and [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903).&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, Michael (ed.). ''The Frege Reader''. Blackwell, 1997, pp. 194–223, 258–289.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=30}} He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=30}} In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the [[University of Jena]] to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} He wrote: "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics."&lt;ref name="Kanterian36"&gt;Kanterian, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival at Cambridge===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein 1910.jpg|right|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1910s]]
Wittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18 October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name="ConnorRobertson"&gt;O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wittgenstein.html "Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein"], St Andrews University. Retrieved 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was having tea with [[C. K. Ogden]], when, according to Russell, "an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics &amp; has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} He was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to [[C. D. Broad]], [[Eric Harold Neville|E. H. Neville]], and H. T. J. Norton.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in [[Formal (university)#Terminology|Hall]]. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]: "My German friend threatens to be an infliction."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|pp=88-89}}
Russell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=88}} Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: "I love him &amp; feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is ''the'' young man one hopes for."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} The role-reversal between Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein was soon such that Russell wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: "His [Wittenstein]'s criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography''. Routledge, 1998, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambridge Moral Sciences Club and Apostles===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|234x234px|[[Bertrand Russell]], 1907]]

In 1912 Wittgenstein joined the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club|Cambridge Moral Sciences Club]], an influential discussion group for philosophy dons and students, delivering his first paper there on 29 November that year, a four-minute talk defining philosophy as "all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Jack. [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1617&amp;context=russelljournal "Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club"], ''Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell'' Studies: Vol. 1, issue 2, article 3, winter 1982.
* Also see Klagge, James Carl and Nordmann, Alfred (eds.) ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: Public and Private Occasions''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, p. 332, citing Michael Nedo and Michele Ranchetti (eds.). ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: sein Leben in Bildern und Texten''. Suhrkamp, 1983, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He dominated the society and for a time would stop attending in the early 1930s after complaints that he gave no one else a chance to speak.&lt;ref name=Edmonds22&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 22–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club became infamous within popular philosophy because of a meeting on 25 October 1946 at [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Braithwaite]]'s rooms in [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], where [[Karl Popper]], another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was ''Are there philosophical problems?'', in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one—"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers"—at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein 'stormed out', but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion). It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the world, were ever in the same room together.&lt;ref&gt;Eidinow, John and Edmonds, David.

Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Maynard Keynes]] also invited him to join the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Russell and [[G. E. Moore]] had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not enjoy it and attended infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's unseriousness, style of humour, or the fact that the members were in love with one another.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=118}} He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the level of discussion; they took him back though in the 1920s when he returned to Cambridge. (He also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Moral Sciences Club.) {{fact|date=June 2018}}

=== Frustrations at Cambridge/Pre-war ===
Wittgenstein was quite vocal about his depression in his years at Cambridge, and before he went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=76}} Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he "felt the curse of those who have half a talent".{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=39}} He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein in Cambridge|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=75}} Unless he was lying, Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: "how can I be a logician before I'm a human being? For the most important thing is coming to terms with myself!"{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=63}} He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell’s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portraits of Wittgenstein vol.1|last=1:Flowers, 2:Ground|first=1:F.A, 2: Ian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig’s temperament was also recorded in the diary of David Pinsent. Pinsent writes "I have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these sulky fits", and "I am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now than usual", when talking about Wittgenstein's emotional fluctuations.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}}

===Sexual orientation and relationship with David Pinsent===
[[File:15. David Pinsent.jpg|thumb|293x293px|[[David Pinsent]]|right]]
[[File:Wittgenstein with friends drinking coffee.jpg|right|thumb|240x240px|Wittgenstein sitting with his friends and family in Vienna. Marguerite Respinger sits at the end of the left and the sculpture he made of her sits behind him on the mantel-place]]
Wittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men, and had a relationship with the latter two: [[David Pinsent|David Hume Pinsent]] in 1912, [[Francis Skinner]] in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=583-586}} He later revealed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=369}} Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein fell in love with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, modelling a sculpture of her and proposing marriage, albeit on condition that they would not have children.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=238-240, 318}}

Wittgenstein's relationship with David Pinsent (1891–1918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of [[David Hume]], Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and queer thinking: Wittgenstein's development and his relevance to modern thought''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the [[British Psychological Society|British Psychological Association]] in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912—the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including [[first class travel]], the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria – small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law.&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912–1914, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting [[Øystese]], Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic.&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912–1914, p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality – sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, p. 58ff. *See Von Wright, G. H. ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912–1914''. Basil Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being "absolutely sulky and snappish" at times, as well.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}} In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating "No—Beastly!" to 90 percent of what he shewed [archaic spelling] us!"&lt;ref name="Kanterian40"&gt;Kanterian, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: "He expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!"&lt;ref name=Kanterian40/&gt; The last time they saw each other was on 8 October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: "I got up at 6.15 to see Ludwig off. He had to go very early – back to Cambridge – as he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7.0 – to catch a 7.30 am train from New St Station. It was sad parting from him."&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;[[Georg Henrik von Wright|Von Wright, G. H.]] ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912–1914''. Basil Blackwell, 1990. p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.

==1913–1920: World War I and the ''Tractatus''==

===Work on ''Logik''===
[[File:Wittgenstein notes 1914.jpg|thumb|Entries from October 1914 in Wittgenstein's diary, on display at the [[Wren Library]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
Karl Wittgenstein died on 20 January 1913, and after receiving his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=71}} He donated some of his money, at first anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. Trakl requested to meet his benefactor but in 1914 when Wittgenstein went to visit, Trakl had already killed himself.  Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [[Skjolden]] in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing ''Logik'' (''Notes on Logic''), the predecessor of much of the ''Tractatus''.&lt;ref name=ConnorRobertson/&gt; While in Norway, Wittgenstein learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] to converse with the local villagers, and [[Danish language|Danish]] to read the works of the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart (philosopher)|Stewart, Jon.]] (ed.) ''Kierkegaard's Influence on Philosophy: German and Scandinavian Philosophy''. Ashgate Publishing, 2009, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that Wittgenstein began addressing what he considered to be a central issue in ''Notes on Logic'', a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that “[a]ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.”{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=58}} Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.

The problem lay in forming a primitive proposition which encompassed this and would act as the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, “The big question now is, how must a system of signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic!” {{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=59}} The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=96}} Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition by the time of the writing of the ''Tractatus''. The ''Tractatus'' does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, “Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.”&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: Side-By-Side-By-Side Edition''. Kegan Paul, 1922, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.

At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. [[David Edmonds (philosopher)|David Edmonds]] and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with "absolutely no intelligence whatever."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=262}} In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.&lt;ref name=Edmonds45/&gt; When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting ''Logik'' as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: "If I am not worth your making an exception for me ''even in some STUPID details'' then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I ''am'' worth it and you don't do it then—by God—''you'' might go there."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=103}} Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=200}} The two did not speak again until 1929.&lt;ref name=Edmonds45&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein immediately volunteered for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], despite being eligible for a medical exemption.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein had a double hernia, according to philosopher [[Iain King]], who recounts Wittgenstein's war record in an April 2014 article [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein's medical exemption is confirmed in [[Philosophy Now]] magazine [http://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism here (link to Philosophy Now)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He served first on a ship and then in an artillery workshop 'several miles from the action'.&lt;ref&gt;According to philosopher [[Iain King]], who described Wittgenstein's war record and its impact on his thinking [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was wounded in an accidental explosion, and hospitalised to [[Kraków]].&lt;ref&gt;From [[Iain King]], writing in April 2014 about Wittgenstein's war record and its impact on his thinking [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the [[7th Army (Austria-Hungary)|Austrian 7th Army]], where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the [[Brusilov Offensive]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=137-142}} Wittgenstein directed the fire of his own artillery from an observation post in no-man's land against Allied troops – one of the most dangerous jobs there was, since he was targeted by enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;From a July 2014 article in [[Philosophy Now]] magazine [http://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism here (link to Philosophy Now)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In action against British troops, he was decorated with the [[Military Merit Medal (Austria–Hungary)|Military Merit]] with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for "His exceptionally courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism," that "won the total admiration of the troops."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1917, he was sent as a member of a [[howitzer]] regiment to the Russian front, where he won several more medals for bravery including the [[Medal for Bravery (Austria-Hungary)|Silver Medal for Valour]], First Class.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=137}} In 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] as part of an artillery regiment. For his part in the final Austrian offensive of June 1918, he was recommended for the Gold Medal for Valour, one of the highest honours in the Austrian army, but was instead awarded the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swords&amp;nbsp;— it being decided that this particular action, although extraordinarily brave, had been insufficiently consequential to merit the highest honour.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=154}}
[[File:27. Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War]]
Throughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, including his contempt for the character of the other soldiers.&lt;ref name="Klagge2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klagge|first=James Carl|title=Wittgenstein in exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMzajTUpEp0C&amp;pg=PA68|date=22 December 2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01534-9|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s 1896 ''[[The Gospel in Brief]]'' at a bookshop in [[Tarnów]], and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as "the man with the gospels."{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=44, 116, 382–384}}&lt;ref&gt;* Also see Bill Schardt &amp; David Large, [http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/witty.htm "Wittgenstein, Tolstoy, and the Gospel in Brief"], ''The Philosopher'', Volume LXXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Completion of the ''Tractatus''===
[[File:Wittgenstein family Vienna 1917.jpg|thumb|The Wittgenstein family in [[Vienna]], Summer 1917, with Kurt (furthest left) and Wittgenstein (furthest right) in officers' uniforms.]]
In the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in one of his family's Vienna summer houses, Neuwaldegg. It was there in August 1918 that he completed the ''Tractatus'', which he submitted with the title ''Der Satz'' (German: proposition, sentence, phrase, set, but also "leap") to the publishers Jahoda and Siegel.&lt;ref name=Bartley33&gt;Bartley, pp. 33–39, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13 August, his uncle Paul died. On 25 October, he learned that Jahoda and Siegel had decided not to publish the ''Tractatus'', and on 27 October, his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent's mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8 May.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, pp. 33–34. For an original report, see "Death of D.H. Pinsent", ''Birmingham Daily Mail'', 15 May 1918: "Recovery of the Body. The body of Mr. David Hugh Pinsent, a civilian observer, son of Mr and Mrs Hume Pinsent, of Foxcombe Hill, near Oxford and Birmingham, the second victim of last Wednesday's aeroplane accident in West Surrey, was last night found in the Basingstoke Canal, at Frimley." Courtesy of [http://mikeinmono.blogspot.com/2009/08/that-sprawling-ink-blot.html "Wittgenstein in Birmingham"], mikeinmono, 3 August 2009. Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal. He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and, as a result of the defeat of the Austrian army, he was captured by [[Allies of World War I|Allied forces]] on 3 November in [[Trentino]]. He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp.

He returned to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]]. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.&lt;ref name=Bartley33/&gt;

==1920–1928: Teaching, the ''Tractatus'', Haus Wittgenstein==

===Teacher training in Vienna===
In September 1919 he enrolled in the ''Lehrerbildungsanstalt'' (teacher training college) in the ''Kundmanngasse'' in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=169}} [[Thomas Bernhard]], more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein's life: "the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity."&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching posts in Austria===
In the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family... That one can neither simulate nor dissimulate anything including a refined education I need hardly tell you."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in [[Trattenbach]], under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: "I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Klagge, James Carl. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Malcolm|Malcolm, Norman]]. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v03/n21/norman-malcolm/wittgensteins-confessions "Wittgenstein’s Confessions"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 3 No. 21, 19 November 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the less able, it seems that he became something of a tyrant. The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=195}} They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;&lt;ref name=Bartley107&gt;Bartley, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting "''Krautsalat!''" ("coleslaw" – i.e. shredded cabbage) when the headmaster played the piano, and "Nonsense!" when a priest was answering children's questions.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=196, 198}}

===Publication of the ''Tractatus''===
[[File:Wittgenstein2.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Ludwig Wittgenstein, schoolteacher, c. 1922]]While Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung'', part of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]'s journal ''Annalen der Naturphilosophie'', though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;For the introduction, see Russell, Bertrand. [http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/aintro.html Introduction], ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be ''thought'') and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nieli. ''Wittgenstein: From Mysticism to Ordinary Language''. SUNY Press, 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the ''Tractatus''.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 35ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|''The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.''
''Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages. And in fact both were right and both wrong; though the view of the ancients is clearer insofar as they have an acknowledged terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained.''|Wittgenstein, [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]], 6.371-2}}
An English translation was prepared in Cambridge by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by [[C. K. Ogden]]. It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.'' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.&lt;ref name="archiveTractatus"/&gt; This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ramsey translated "''Sachverhalt''" and "''Sachlage''" as "atomic fact" and "state of affairs" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent "''Sachverhalten''", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating "''Sachverhalt''" as "state of affairs" and "''Sachlage''" as ''situation''. The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness. See:

An aim of the ''Tractatus'' is to reveal the relationship between language and the world: what can be said about it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that the logical structure of language provides the limits of meaning. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: "What we can say at all can be said clearly," he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.&lt;ref name=Grayling16&gt;Grayling, A. C. ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 16ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in the preface: "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)."&lt;ref&gt;''Tractatus'' (Ogden translation), preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is 75 pages long—"As to the shortness of the book, I am ''awfully sorry for it'' ... If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me," he told Ogden—and presents seven numbered propositions (1–7), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):&lt;ref&gt;For the comment to Ogden, see Monk, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist''.
#: The world is everything that is the case.&lt;ref&gt;The English is from the original Ogden/Ramsey translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Was der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten''.
#: What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
# ''Das logische Bild der Tatsachen ist der Gedanke''.
#: The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
# ''Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz''.
#: The thought is the significant proposition.
# ''Der Satz ist eine Wahrheitsfunktion der Elementarsätze''.
#: Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
# ''Die allgemeine Form der Wahrheitsfunktion ist: &lt;math&gt;[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]&lt;/math&gt;. Dies ist die allgemeine Form des Satzes''.
#: The general form of a truth-function is: &lt;math&gt;[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]&lt;/math&gt;. This is the general form of proposition.

#: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

===Visit from Frank Ramsey, Puchberg===
[[File:Puchberg am Schneeberg-view.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited Wittgenstein in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]] in September 1923.]]
In September 1922 he moved to a secondary school in a nearby village, [[Hassbach (Lower Austria)|Hassbach]], but considered the people there just as bad—"These people are not human ''at all'' but loathsome worms," he wrote to a friend—and he left after a month. In November he began work at another primary school, this time in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg|Puchberg]] in the [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]] mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were "one-quarter animal and three-quarters human."

[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited him on 17 September 1923 to discuss the ''Tractatus''; he had agreed to write a review of it for ''Mind''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=212, 214–216, 220–221.}} He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, D.H. [http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/3484/5/RamseyText.html "Cambridge Philosophers I: F. P. Ramsey"], Philosophy 70, 1995, pp. 243–262.&lt;/ref&gt; After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} Ramsey wrote to [[John Maynard Keynes]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Wittgenstein's family] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Haidbauer incident, Otterthal===
{{main|Haidbauer incident}}
[[File:31. Wittgenstein, 1925.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1925]]
He moved schools again in September 1924, this time to [[Otterthal]], near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, ''Wörterbuch für Volksschulen'', published in Vienna in 1926 by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the ''Tractatus'' that was published in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="archiveTractatus"&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Tractatus and Teaching"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213064904/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html |date=13 February 2010 }}, Cambridge Wittgenstein archive. Retrieved 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A first edition sold in 2005 for £75,000.&lt;ref name="Ezard"&gt;Ezard, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/19/books.booksnews2 "Philosopher's rare 'other book' goes on sale"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as ''Der Vorfall Haidbauer'' (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=224, 232–233}} Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: "I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}}

Piribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}} Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of [[leukaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 162. Monk, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, in 1936, as part of a series of "confessions" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a "Ja, ja," though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not "to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it—to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought." Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, "This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness."{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=370-371}}

===The Vienna Circle===
{{See also|Vienna Circle}}
The ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up largely as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not actually the case. German philosopher [[Oswald Hanfling]] writes bluntly: "Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle's thought was at least as important as that of any of its members."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Essential Readings in Logical Positivism|last = Hanfling|first = Oswald |author-link=Oswald Hanfling |publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-631-12566-2|location = Oxford|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle whom his work had inspired. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/09/07/the-limits-of-science-and-scientists/|title=The Limits of Science—and Scientists - The Crux|date=7 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his autobiography, [[Rudolf Carnap]] describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that "there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems." As for Wittgenstein:
{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation ... the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Carnap, ''Autobiography'', in P.A. Schlipp (ed) ''The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap'', The Library of Living Philosophers, Volume 11, La Salle Open Court, 1963, pages 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Haus Wittgenstein===
{{Main|Haus Wittgenstein}}
[[File:Haus Wittgenstein, Stonborough House, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Wittgenstein worked on [[Haus Wittgenstein]] between 1926 and 1929.]]

{{rquote|right|"I am not interested in erecting a building, but in [...] presenting to myself the foundations of all possible buildings."|Wittgenstein&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Hyde, Lewis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/books/review/Hyde-t.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt "Making It"]. ''The New York Times'', 6 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926 Wittgenstein was again working as a gardener for a number of months, this time at the monastery of Hütteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''. Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that "This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty."&lt;ref name="Jeffries"&gt;Jeffries, Stuart. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,627752,00.html "A dwelling for the gods"], ''The Guardian'', 5 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150&amp;nbsp;kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of ''The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein'', said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: "It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor."&lt;ref name=Jeffries/&gt;

The house was finished by December 1928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: "Even though I admired the house very much....It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Wittgenstein said "the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and ''good'' manners, and expression of great ''understanding''... But ''primordial'' life, wild life striving to erupt into the open – that is lacking."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}} Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this "wild life striving to be in the open" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}}

==1929–1941: Fellowship at Cambridge==

===PhD and fellowship===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1930]]

According to Feigl (as reported by Monk), upon attending a conference in Vienna by mathematician Brouwer, Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the possibility of a "return to Philosophy". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: "Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=255}} Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the ''Tractatus'' as his thesis.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=271}} Moore wrote in the examiner's report: "I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree."&lt;ref&gt;R.

===Anschluss===

[[File:43. Ludwig Wittgenstein on holiday.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein on holiday in [[France]] with Gilbert Pattisson, July 1936]]
From 1936 to 1937, Wittgenstein lived again in Norway,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html Ludwig Wittgenstein: Return to Cambridge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103154319/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html |date=3 November 2007 }} from the Cambridge Wittgenstein Archive&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked on the ''Philosophical Investigations''. In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of "confessions" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]], himself a former mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] which he was soon to set up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history//Biographies/De_Valera.html MacTutor: Biography of Éamon de Valera] "The most important contribution de Valera made to mathematics both in Ireland and internationally was the foundation of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS) in 1940."&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:21. Photographs showing Wittgenstein’s house in Norway.jpg|left|thumb|213x213px|Photograph showing Wittgenstein’s house in [[Norway]], sent by Wittgenstein to [[G. E. Moore]], October 1936]]While he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the ''Anschluss''; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a citizen of the enlarged Germany and a Jew under the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two. It meant ''inter alia'' that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.&lt;ref name=Waugh137&gt;Waugh, pp. 137ff, 204–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 224–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.&lt;ref&gt;For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as a Jew, see Stern, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FWAX4Ff69SwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wittgenstein:+Biography+and+Philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xwGKTNX8JYWenwfT0LiyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Was%20Wittgenstein%20a%20Jew%3F&amp;f=false "Was Wittgenstein Jewish?"], in James Carl Klagge. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 237ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted ''Mischling'' status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 98, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim foreign currency, stocks and 1700&amp;nbsp;kg of gold held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein family trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb/&gt;

===Professor of philosophy===
[[File:46. Ludwig Wittgenstein in the Fellows' Garden.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein in the Fellows’ Garden at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], 1939]]
After G. E. Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired [[British subject|British citizenship]] soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1,700&amp;nbsp;kg of gold.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher [[Sofya Yanovskaya|Sophia Janowskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Moran, John. "Wittgenstein and Russia" ''New Left Review'' 73, May–June 1972, pp. 83–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Malcolm, at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938: {{quote|"At a meeting of the Moral Science Club, after the paper for the evening was read and the discussion started, someone began to stammer a remark. He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' – perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, pp. 23–4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Describing Wittgenstein's lecture program, Malcolm continues: {{quote|"It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After work, the philosopher would often relax by watching [[Western Movie|Westerns]], where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by [[Norbert Davis]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=528}}&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Josef. [http://www.mysteryfile.com/NDavis/Wit.html "Hard-boiled Wit: Ludwig Wittgenstein and Norbert Davis"], ''CADS'', no. 44, October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Malcolm wrote that Wittgenstein would rush to the cinema when class ended.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Wittgenstein's view on the [[foundations of mathematics]] had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]] who described Wittgenstein as "a ''very'' peculiar man". The two had many discussions about the relationship between computational logic and everyday notions of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Alan Turing: The Enigma |last = Hodges | first = Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Hodges | publisher = [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-784-70008-9|location = London|page = 194|title-link = Alan Turing: The Enigma }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Cora (ed.).

== 1941–1947: World War II and Guy's Hospital ==
[[File:50. Wittgenstein in Swansea (taken by Ben Richards).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Wittgenstein in [[Swansea]], Summer 1947]]
Monk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;For his desire that his students not pursue philosophy, see Malcolm, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1941, he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, delivering drugs from the pharmacy to the wards where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}}

In the new year of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein to his home in Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son recorded the weekend in his diary;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=434}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" Wittgenstein begged one of them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=432}} Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}} It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.

He had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from [[polio]]. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a [[City and Guilds]] exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought!"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=443}} Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-423}}

While Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November 1942, Grant and Reeve moved to the [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of £4 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, [[Jesmond]]&lt;ref name="Schardt"&gt;[http://www.newphilsoc.org.uk/OldWeb1/Wittgenstein/wittgenstein_upon_tyne.htm Wittgenstein Upon Tyne] Bill Schardt, Newcastle Philosophical Society. Retrieved December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) from 29 April 1943 until February 1944.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=447}}

In the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']]. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, "The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background." On the 30th of September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, "Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}

Wittgenstein had only maintained contact with Fouracre from Guy's hospital who had joined the army in 1943 after his marriage, only returning in 1947. Wittgenstein maintained frequent correspondence with Fouracre during his time away displaying a desire for Fouracre to return home urgently from the war.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}

In May 1947, Wittgenstein addressed a group of Oxford philosophers for the first time at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of [[René Descartes|Descartes']] [[Cogito ergo sum]] where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. [[Harold Arthur Prichard]] who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wittgenstein: If a man says to me, looking at the sky, ‘I think it will rain, therefore I exist,’ I do not understand him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Prichard: That’s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not?{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=496}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wittgenstein resigned the professorship at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing, and in 1947 and 1948 travelled to [[Ireland]], staying at Ross's Hotel in [[Dublin]] and at a farmhouse in [[Redcross]], [[County Wicklow]], where he began the manuscript volume MS 137, Band R. Seeking solitude he moved to ''Rosro'', a holiday cottage in [[Connemara]] owned by Maurice O'Connor-Drury.&lt;ref name=archivefinalyears/&gt;

He also accepted an invitation from [[Norman Malcolm]], then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at [[Ithaca, New York]]. He made the trip in April 1949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: "I haven't done any work since the beginning of March &amp; I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any." A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''. During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with [[philosophical skepticism]], that would eventually become the final fragments ''[[On Certainty]]''.
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein Blue Plaque, 76 Storey's Way, Cambridge, UK.jpg|thumb|The plaque at "Storey's End", 76 [[Storey's Way]], Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]]
He returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable [[prostate cancer]], which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. "Great loss for me and all of us," he wrote. "Greater than I would have thought." He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with [[Georg Henrik von Wright|G. H. von Wright]]; to London to stay with [[Rush Rhees]]; then to Oxford to see [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into ''Storey's End'' at 76 [[Storey's Way]], the home of his doctor, [[Edward Vaughan Bevan|Edward Bevan]], and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.&lt;ref name="archivefinalyears"&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre11.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Final Years"], Cambridge Wittgenstein archive.

By the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 79ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other manuscripts were later published as ''[[Remarks on Colour]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]''.&lt;ref name="archivefinalyears" /&gt; He wrote to Malcolm on 16 April 13 days before his death: "An extraordinary thing happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been ''absolutely'' certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up.—Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks &amp; it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now."&lt;ref name="Malcolm80"&gt;Malcolm, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Death bed.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein on his deathbed, 1951]]
Wittgenstein began work on his final manuscript, MS 177, on 25 April 1951. It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27 April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, "Good!" Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: "Tell them I've had a wonderful life." Norman Malcolm describes this as a "...strangely moving utterance."&lt;ref name=Malcolm80/&gt;{{rquote|left|''I won't say 'See you tomorrow' because that would be like predicting the future, and I'm pretty sure I can't do that.''|Wittgenstein, 1949&lt;ref&gt;Drury, ''Recollections'', p. 160; cf. ''The Danger of Words'' (1973) p. ix, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Four of Wittgenstein's former students arrived at his bedside—Ben Richards, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]]. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father [[Conrad Pepler]], also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.[[File:Wittgenstein Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein's grave at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish Burial Ground]] in [[Cambridge]]]]

Wittgenstein was given a Catholic burial at [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. [[Mark Goldie]], pages 62 and 63 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Drury later said he had been troubled ever since about whether that was the right thing to do.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=576-580}} In 2015 the ledger gravestone was refurbished by the British Wittgenstein Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishwittgensteinsociety.org/wittgensteins-grave|title=Wittgenstein's Grave -|website=www.britishwittgensteinsociety.org|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his religious views, Wittgenstein was said to be greatly interested in [[Catholicism]] and was sympathetic to it. In his university years, he expressed belief in the [[resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="res"&gt;{{Citation |quote=What inclines even me to believe in Christ's resurrection? I play as it were with the thought.–If he did not rise from the dead, then he decomposed in the grave like every human being. He is dead &amp; decomposed. In that case he is a teacher, like any other &amp; can no longer help; &amp; we are once more orphaned &amp; alone. And have to make do with wisdom &amp; speculation. It is as though we are in a hell, where we can only dream &amp; are shut out from heaven, roofed in as it were. But if I am to be REALLY redeemed,– I need certainty–not wisdom, dreams, speculation–and this certainty is faith. And faith is faith in what my heart, my soul, needs, not my speculative intellect. For my soul, with its passions, as it were with its flesh and blood, must be redeemed, not my abstract mind. Perhaps one may say: Only love can believe the Resurrection. Or: it is love that believes the Resurrection |p=33 |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein, Culture and Value |first=Peter |last=Finch |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to [[Norman Malcolm]], Wittgenstein saw Catholicism as more of a way of life than as a set of beliefs he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir|authors=Norman Malcolm; G. H. Von Wright|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199247592|pages=59–60|quote=I believe that Wittgenstein was prepared by his own character and experience to comprehend the idea of a judging and redeeming God. But any cosmological conception of a Deity, derived from the notions of cause or of infinity, would be repugnant to him. He was impatient with 'proofs' of the existence of God, and with attempts to give religion a rational foundation. ...I do not wish to give the impression that Wittgenstein accepted any religious faith—he certainly did not—or that he was a religious person. But I think that there was in him, in some sense, the possibility of religion. I believe that he looked on religion as a 'form of life' (to use an expression from the Investigations) in which he did not participate, but with which he was sympathetic and which greatly interested him. Those who did participate he respected — although here as elsewhere he had contempt for insincerity. I suspect that he regarded religious belief as based on qualities of character and will that he himself did not possess. Of Smythies and Anscombe, both of whom had become Roman Catholics, he once said to me: 'I could not possibly bring myself to believe all the things that they believe.' I think that in this remark he was not disparaging their belief. It was rather an observation about his own capacity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780826490278|author=Tim Labron|page=47|quote=Wittgenstein has no goal to either support or reject religion; his only interest is to keep discussions, whether religious or not, clear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein was said by some commentators to be [[agnostic]], in a qualified sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136731372|author=William Child|page=218|quote="Was Wittgenstein religious?

The idea of a God in the sense of the Bible, the image of God as the creator of the world, hardly ever engaged Wittgenstein's attention..., but the notion of a [[last judgement]] was of profound concern to him." – (Engelmann)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|year=2007|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|isbn=9781861893208|pages=145–146|author=Edward Kanterian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1953: Publication of the ''Philosophical Investigations''==
{{Main|Philosophical Investigations|Language-game|Private language argument}}
[[File:Kaninchen und Ente.png|thumb|Illustration of a "[[Rabbit–duck illusion|duckrabbit]]", discussed in the ''Philosophical Investigations'', section XI, part II]]
The ''[[Blue and Brown Books|Blue Book]]'', a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933–1934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language and is widely read as a turning-point in his philosophy of language.

''Philosophical Investigations'' was published in two parts in 1953. Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues the bewitchments of philosophical problems arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called "language gone on holiday."&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §107.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the "rough ground" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear."&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Wittgenstein left a voluminous archive of unpublished papers, including 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 pages. Choosing among repeated drafts, revisions, corrections and loose notes editorial work has found nearly one third of the total suitable for print.&lt;ref&gt;Stern D., "The Bergen Electronic Edition of Wittgenstein's Nachlass", ''[[European Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol 18, Issue 3, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; An Internet facility hosted by the [[University of Bergen]] allows access to images of almost all the material and to search the available transcriptions.&lt;ref&gt;The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen [http://wab.uib.no/wab_nachlass.page/ (WAB)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 two new boxes of Wittgenstein papers were found.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press release: [http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/unpublished-wittgenstein-archive-explored Unpublished Wittgenstein Archive explored]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' was the only nearly finished project and the book was published in 1953.

In 1999 a survey among American university and college teachers ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations."&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; The ''Investigations'' also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences.&lt;ref name="milproj"/&gt;

[[Peter Hacker]] argues that Wittgenstein's influence on 20th-century analytical philosophy can be attributed to his early influence on the Vienna Circle and later influence on the Oxford "ordinary language" school and Cambridge philosophers.&lt;ref name=hacker&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Hacker|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/58/Peter_Hacker|website=Philosophy Now|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interpreters===
Since Wittgenstein's death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between "early" and "late" Wittgenstein (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the ''Tractatus'' and those in ''Philosophical Investigations''), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein's unpublished papers (the ''[[Nachlass]]'').&lt;ref name="Glock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glock|first1=Hans-Johann|editor1-last=Kahane|editor1-first=Guy|editor2-last=Kanterian|editor2-first=Edward|editor3-last=Kuusela|editor3-first=Oskari|title=Wittgenstein and his interpreters: essays in memory of Gordon Baker|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9781405129220|pages=37–65|chapter=Perspectives on Wittgenstein: An Intermittently Opinionated Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of [[The New Wittgenstein]] school such as [[Cora Diamond]], [[Alice Crary]], and [[James F. Conant]].  While the ''Tractatus'', particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a "therapeutic" understanding of Wittgenstein's work—"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing."{{sfn|Crary|2000|p=1}} To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the ''Tractatus'' as "plain nonsense"—arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of [[John Wisdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John|last=Wisdom|title=Philosophy and Psycho-Analysis|publisher=Blackwell|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the review of ''The Blue Book'' written by [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]].&lt;ref name="Glock" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouwsma|first1=O. K.|title=The Blue Book|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=16 March 1961|volume=58|issue=6|pages=141–162|doi=10.2307/2023409|jstor=2023409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapeutic approach is not without critics: [[Hans-Johann Glock]] argues that the "plain nonsense" reading of the ''Tractatus'' "...is at odds with the external evidence, writings and conversations in which Wittgenstein states that the ''Tractatus'' is committed to the idea of ineffable insight."&lt;ref name="Glock" /&gt;

====Bertrand Russell====
In October 1944, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge around the same time as Russell who had been living in [[United States|America]] for several years. Russell returned to Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;&lt;blockquote&gt;Russell’s books should be bound in two colours…those dealing with mathematical logic in red – and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue – and no one should be allowed to read them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=471}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Philosophical Development|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1959|isbn=978-0041920154|location=New York|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Saul Kripke ====
[[Saul Kripke]]'s 1982 book ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]'' contends that the central argument of [[Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' centers on a devastating [[rule-following paradox]] that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language.  Kripke writes that this paradox is "the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date."&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''. Basil Blackwell Publishing, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as [[Gordon Baker]] and [[Peter Hacker]], who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has, however recently been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [[Martin Kusch]] (2006), and Wittgenstein scholar [[David G. Stern]] considers the book to be "the most influential and widely discussed" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David G. 2006.

'''MSU Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics (CMC)''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Факультет вычислительной математики и кибернетики (ВМК)}}), founded in 1970 by [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|Andrey Tikhonov]], is a part of [[Moscow State University]].

==Education==
CMC is the leading Russian research and training center in the fields of applied mathematics, computing and software development .{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Education at CMC combines in-depth theoretical studies, extensive practical exercises, and research.

Main 12 Master's programs:
* [[Mathematical physics]]
* [[Mathematical modeling]]
* Computational diagnostics
* [[Numerical methods]]
* [[Theory of probability]] and [[mathematical statistics]] 
* Operations research and [[systems analysis]] 
* Optimization and [[optimal control]]
* Mathematical cybernetics
* Software for computers and computer systems
* Networks software
* [[System programming]]
* [[Decision making]] in Economics and Finance

==History==
[[File:Tikhonov board.jpg|thumb|250px|Memorial board of [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|Andrey Tikhonov]] on the building of MSU Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics]]

A group of professors and scholars from [[MSU Faculty of Physics|Department of Physics]] and [[MSU Department of Mechanics and Mathematics|Department of Mechanics and Mathematics]] led by [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|Andrey Tikhonov]] founded CMC in 1970. The three departments are still closely connected.

Following companies work with CS MSU: [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Borland]], [[Software AG]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[IBM]]/[[Lotus Software|Lotus]], [[Samsung]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]].

Perhaps, ''Department of [[Applied Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]]'' would be a more precise name for this one. The word ''[[cybernetics]]'' historically refers to what [[Norbert Wiener]] introduced in his book ''Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and Machine'' (1948).  In the Soviet Union cybernetics was initially considered [[antiscientific]], and was prohibited. However, in 1960s more liberal scientific views were adopted, triggering a remarkable boom in research and education. That was later reflected in the name of this department founded in 1970. Since that time the CMC name became a well-recognized brand and is unlikely to change.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== iSun Car Technical Details ==
iSun underwent many changes since the 2001 American Solar Challenge, the basic layout of structural and aerodynamic features remained relatively constant. Some pictures of components, construction and testing are below.

=== Canopy ===
The car continued to utilize the three-wheeled configuration and a ‘bubble–style’ canopy with lexan windshield. The previous carbon fiber canopy was replaced with a kevlar model, in order to improve transmission of telemetry data (the carbon fiber was conductive and scrambled the signal).

=== Battery Pack ===
The battery pack consisted of hundreds of lithium polymer cells and charging circuitry. For optimal safety, the battery pack was housed in a removable, non-conductive, impact resistant Kevlar box that was firmly attached to the front of the chassis during racing.

=== Driver Position/Weight Distribution ===
Realizing that moving the driver further forward could improve the handling and probably reduce rolling resistance (we ended up with too much weight on the rear tire). This problem also arose from the fact that the car was designed to accommodate a 6 foot driver which is not at all a necessity. The other teams design for a 5’5” driver or smaller in order to have more precise weight distribution with the accompanying ballast. 

=== Ride Height ===
The current version of the car has a disproportionately large canopy. It's possible that reducing the size of the canopy could realize the greatest gains in improved aerodynamics for the car. Unfortunately, since the car is so low to the ground, and the air-foil is so thin, this canopy is necessary to meet the minimum driver eye height requirement of 70cm.

=== Front Track ===
Unable to incorporate full front fairings over the front wheels to reduce drag. The limiting factor is that the wheels are so close to the side of the vehicle, that when turning to pass the figure eight test, the apex of the wheel almost leaves the shadow cast by the car. It might be possible to still incorporate a full fairing, but it would be hard to interface it nicely with the shell. For the future, the suggestion is designing the fairing with the shell and molding them together, or as two separate parts.

=== Solar Array Design ===
Basically the process was to first determine how many cells would fit on the car. The modules were encapsulated by SunCat solar (who charges for each different size or module and for cutting cells as well). The challenge was to use as few module sizes as possible, and to cover the car with as many cells as possible. A mock up of the top shell totally covered with cells and drew modules over it had to be used. Settling on 6 sectors of modules, one in the front with a buck tracker, one in the back with a buck tracker, one on either side of the canopy with a boost tracker, and one up either side with a buck tracker (Buck and Boost refers to the maximum power point trackers that operate each module at peak efficiency given the solar load).

Obviously the challenge is to make sure your boost trackers will always be boosting (sector voltage always below battery voltage) and your buck trackers will always be bucking (sector voltage above battery voltage). This makes the layout more complicated as you have many variables to consider. Interconnecting modules under the car which makes for easy maintenance, testing and the option to change the configuration of the module sectoring if by choice.

=== Brakes Design ===
The method of designing the brakes was a bit suspect. Instead of looking at other solar cars, picking a friction co-efficient for other brake pads and calculated the force necessary to stop with the required deceleration (plus a safety factor). Then calculated the braking force that this would require from the driver. Having no actual test data made us end up with a design that was way overbuilt. It takes little effort from the driver the lock up the brakes with the current 9:1 ratio of pedal force to master cylinder force. It could probably do with 3:1 and save around 1 kg in the master cylinder brake linkage.

=== Steering ===
We originally used Lear Jet gearboxes and cables from Aeronvironment for the steering system. However, we found the cables gave too much friction to the system and prevented self-centering of the steering system. In testing we found self-centering steering to be a very important safety consideration–especially with the sensitive steering in the solar car. Self-centering also decreases driver fatigue as the solar car will tend to go in a straight line with little effort from the driver. The friction problem was solved with new (regular) cables and with breaking in of all the rodends in the steering system (ie. Putting them in a drill and wearing out some of the lining!). A third cable around the driver was pretentioned to get rid of the remaining backlash and we were off to the races.

=== Chassis Construction ===
The team ran out of nomex honeycomb at Bell Helicopter and so they had to use Aluminum for the top plate, this added some weight, but also some resistance to dropped tools, elbows and knees. All the hard points for the suspension, and battery mounting were reinforced with solid kevlar blocks, surrounded by putty (instead of, and filled into the honeycomb respectively). Also all the hard points were reinforced with extra plies of carbon and sheet adhesive. There were real problems with leaky molds for the side beams and shells. 

Made the molds directly from an NC at Formglass instead of having them machine a plug. This resulted in the foam and plywood molds warping in the oven and making leaks which resulted in poor adhesion of the plies to the core. I would rather have made plugs at Formglass and made chopped fiber molds from the plugs. These molds are cumber some, but they last forever. To stick the chassis plates together the team conducted some tests with wet layup carbon and methacrylate adhesive. A bead of adhesive proved to work extremely well and the test plates failed at the carbon just above the bead. The final design used a mechacrylate bead with wet layup carbon over it and has proved to work well. A black magic marker was used to color the wetlayup and is a large part of the reason that people say the car looks so nice!

=== Top and Bottom Shell ===
The top shell consists of a 3K plain weave carbon prepreg laminate (1 layer per side) sandwiching a lightweight 3/8 ” nomex honecomb core. The chassis and bottom shell, have been joined together as one structural component. These have also been constructed of the same 3K plain weave prepreg carbon fiber over both 3/” aluminum honeycomb (with core-bonding sheet adhesive) and 1/” nomex core, depending on the structural requirements of the region in question. Chassis ‘hard-points’ were reinforced with solid Kevlar 285 layups 3/8” thick to resist the out-of-plane compressive stresses resulting from tensioned bolts.

The bottom shell is reinforced under the drivers ass and is otherwise very light weight (1 ply either side). The top shell is made of carbon and this is the reason for the array fire in 2001. To prevent against this problem in 2002, much care needed to be taken with the wiring and installation of modules on the top shell. The whole job ended up with the array being much heavier than originally intended. Avoid carbon for the future–many cars have kevlar top shells that are light and stiff. I would also incorporate ribs into the top shell to keep it stiff under shock loading (Bumps, etc...) This makes it much easier for the driver to drive and is much easier on the cells themselves. The original design had no ribs and would deform (especially in the back) when the car was in motion. Another thing that many teams do is to incorporate most of the bottom shell into the top shell as one piece. This makes the chassis easier to work with, and gives the shell more rigidity as a closed shape. It also gives more options for driver egress as you can incorporate a latching system to swing the topshell open. However, this might not be advisable with our current chassis design.

The advice is to be creative, and not to use excessive safety factors (avoid the’ just in case’ doubling of safety factors–your car will end up too strong and too heavy). Testing will tell you if something needs to be redone.

[[File:Méristème couches.png|thumb|240px|'''Tunica-Corpus model''' of the apical meristem (growing tip). The epidermal (L1) and subepidermal (L2) layers form the outer layers called the [[Tunica (biology)|tunica]].  The inner L3 layer is called the corpus. Cells in the L1 and L2 layers divide in a sideways fashion, which keeps these layers distinct, whereas the L3 layer divides in a more random fashion.|right]]
A '''meristem''' is the [[biological tissue|tissue]] in most [[plant]]s containing undifferentiated cells ('''meristematic cells'''), found in zones of the plant where growth can take place. Meristematic cells give rise to various organs of a plant and are responsible for growth.

Differentiated plant cells generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type. Meristematic cells are incompletely or not at all [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]], and are capable of continued cellular division. Therefore, [[mitosis|cell division]] in the meristem is required to provide new cells for expansion and differentiation of tissues and initiation of new organs, providing the basic structure of the plant body. Furthermore, the cells are small and [[protoplasm]] fills the cell completely. The [[vacuole]]s are extremely small. The [[cytoplasm]] does not contain differentiated [[plastid]]s ([[chloroplast]]s or [[chromoplast]]s), although they are present in rudimentary form ([[proplastid]]s). Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities. The cell wall is a very thin ''primary cell wall'' as well as some are thick in some plants.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Maintenance of the cells requires a balance between two antagonistic processes: organ initiation and stem cell population renewal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

There are three types of meristematic tissues: ''[[Apical meristems|apical]]'' (at the tips), ''intercalary'' (in the middle) and ''lateral'' (at the sides). At the meristem summit, there is a small group of slowly dividing cells, which is commonly called the central zone. Cells of this zone have a stem cell function and are essential for meristem maintenance. The proliferation and growth rates at the meristem summit usually differ considerably from those at the periphery.

The term ''meristem'' was first used in 1858 by [[Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli]] (1817–1891) in his book ''Beiträge zur Wissenschaftlichen Botanik'' ("Contributions to Scientific Botany").&lt;ref&gt;Galun, Esra (2007). [http://www.worldcat.org/title/plant-patterning-structural-and-molecular-genetic-aspects/oclc/137324936&amp;referer=brief_results ''Plant Patterning: Structural and Molecular Genetic Aspects'']. World Scientific Publishing Company. p. 333. {{ISBN|9789812704085}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Greek word ''merizein'' (μερίζειν), meaning to divide, in recognition of its inherent function.

==Apical meristems==
Apical meristems are the completely undifferentiated (indeterminate) meristems in a plant. These differentiate into three kinds of primary meristems. The primary meristems in turn produce the two secondary meristem types. These secondary meristems are also known as lateral meristems because they are involved in lateral growth.[[File:Méristème coupe zones chiffres.png|thumb|250px|Organisation of an apical meristem (growing tip)&lt;br /&gt; 1 - Central zone&lt;br /&gt; 2 - Peripheral zone&lt;br /&gt;
3 - Medullary (i.e. central) meristem&lt;br /&gt;
4 - Medullary tissue]]
There are two types of apical meristem tissue: '''shoot apical meristem''' ('''SAM'''), which gives rise to organs like the leaves and flowers, and '''root apical meristem''' ('''RAM'''), which provides the meristematic cells for future root growth. SAM and RAM cells divide rapidly and are considered indeterminate, in that they do not possess any defined end status. In that sense, the meristematic cells are frequently compared to the [[stem cells]] in [[animal]]s, which have an analogous behavior and function.

The number of layers varies according to plant type. In general the outermost layer is called the '''tunica''' while the innermost layers are the '''corpus'''. In [[monocot]]s, the tunica determine the physical characteristics of the leaf edge and margin. In [[dicot]]s, layer two of the corpus determine the characteristics of the edge of the leaf. The corpus and tunica play a critical part of the plant physical appearance as all plant cells are formed from the meristems. Apical meristems are found in two locations: the root and the stem. Some Arctic plants have an apical meristem in the lower/middle parts of the plant. It is thought that this kind of meristem evolved because it is advantageous in Arctic conditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

===Shoot apical meristems===
[[File:Apical Meristems in Crassula ovata.png|thumb|350px|Shoot apical meristems of ''Crassula ovata'' (left). Fourteen days later, leaves have developed (right).]]

Shoot apical meristems are the source of all above-ground organs, such as leaves and flowers. Cells at the shoot apical meristem summit serve as stem cells to the surrounding peripheral region, where they proliferate rapidly and are incorporated into differentiating leaf or flower primordia.

The shoot apical meristem is the site of most of the embryogenesis in flowering plants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} [[Primordia]] of leaves, sepals, petals, stamens, and ovaries are initiated here at the rate of one every time interval, called a [[plastochron]]. It is where the first indications that flower development has been evoked are manifested. One of these indications might be the loss of apical dominance and the release of otherwise dormant cells to develop as auxiliary shoot meristems, in some species in axils of primordia as close as two or three away from the apical dome. The shoot apical meristem consists of 4 distinct cell groups:
* [[Stem cell]]s
* The immediate daughter cells of the stem cells
* A subjacent organizing center
* Founder cells for organ initiation in surrounding regions

The four distinct zones mentioned above are maintained by a complex signalling pathway.

CLV1 has been shown to interact with several [[cytoplasm]]ic proteins that are most likely involved in [[Signal transduction|downstream signalling]]. For example, the CLV complex has been found to be associated with [[GTPase|Rho/Rac small GTPase-related proteins]].&lt;ref name="Fletcher 2002"/&gt; These proteins may act as an intermediate between the CLV complex and a [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAPK), which is often involved in signalling cascades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valster, A.

Another important gene in plant meristem maintenance is ''[[WUSCHEL]]'' (shortened to ''WUS''), which is a target of CLV signaling in addition to positively regulating CLV, thus forming a feedback loop.&lt;ref name="WUS"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayer, K.

===Root apical meristem===
[[File:Root-tip-tag.png|thumb|right|10x microscope image of root tip with meristem&lt;br /&gt; 1 - quiescent center &lt;br /&gt; 2 - calyptrogen (live rootcap cells) &lt;br /&gt;
3 - rootcap &lt;br /&gt;
4 - sloughed off dead rootcap cells&lt;br /&gt;
5 - procambium]]
Unlike the shoot apical meristem, the root apical meristem produces cells in two dimensions. It harbors two pools of [[stem cells]] around an organizing center called the quiescent center (QC) cells and together produces most of the cells in an adult root.&lt;ref name=" Jose Sebastian 2013"&gt;Jose Sebastian and Ji-Young Lee (2013). Root Apical Meristems. In: eLS. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, Chichester. http://www.els.net [doi: 10.1002/9780470015902.a0020121.pub2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett, T"&gt;Tom Bennett and Ben Scheres (2010). Root development-two meristems for the price of one? Current Topics in Developmental Biology. {{DOI|10.1016/S0070-2153(10)91003-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its apex, the root meristem is covered by the root cap, which protects and guides its growth trajectory. Cells are continuously sloughed off the outer surface of the [[root cap]]. The QC cells are characterized by their low mitotic activity. Evidence suggests that the QC maintains the surrounding stem cells by preventing their differentiation, via signal(s) that are yet to be discovered. This allows a constant supply of new cells in the meristem required for continuous root growth. Recent findings indicate that QC can also act as a reservoir of stem cells to replenish whatever is lost or damaged.&lt;ref name=" Heidstra, R"&gt;Renze Heidstra and Sabrina Sabatini (2014). Plant and animal stem cells: similar yet different. Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology '''15'''(5):301-12 {{doi|10.1038/nrm3790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Root apical meristem and tissue patterns become established in the embryo in the case of the primary root, and in the new lateral root primordium in the case of secondary roots.

===Intercalary meristem{{anchor|intercalary}}===
In angiosperms, intercalary meristems occur only in [[monocot]] (in particular, grass) stems at the base of nodes and leaf blades. [[Horsetails]] also exhibit intercalary growth. Intercalary meristems are capable of cell division, and they allow for rapid growth and regrowth of many monocots. Intercalary meristems at the nodes of bamboo allow for rapid stem elongation, while those at the base of most grass leaf blades allow damaged leaves to rapidly regrow. This leaf regrowth in grasses evolved in response to damage by grazing herbivores.

===Floral meristem===
{{Further|ABC model of flower development}}
When plants begin developmental process known as flowering, the shoot apical meristem is transformed into an inflorescence meristem, which goes on to produce the floral meristem, which produces the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels of the flower.

In contrast to vegetative apical meristems and some efflorescence meristems, floral meristems cannot continue to grow indefinitely. Their future growth is limited to the flower with a particular size and form. The transition from shoot meristem to floral meristem requires floral meristem identity genes, that both specify the floral organs and cause the termination of the production of stem cells. ''AGAMOUS'' (''AG'') is a floral homeotic gene required for floral meristem termination and necessary for proper development of the [[stamen]]s and [[carpel]]s.&lt;ref name=" Fletcher 2002"/&gt; ''AG'' is necessary to prevent the conversion of floral meristems to inflorescence shoot meristems, but is identity gene ''[[LEAFY]]'' (''LFY'') and ''WUS'' and is restricted to the centre of the floral meristem or the inner two whorls.&lt;ref name="wus"&gt;Lohmann, J. U. et al. (2001) A Molecular Link between Stem Cell Regulation and Floral Patterning in Arabidopsis Cell 105: 793-803&lt;/ref&gt; This way floral identity and region specificity is achieved. WUS activates AG by binding to a consensus sequence in the AG’s second intron and LFY binds to adjacent recognition sites.&lt;ref name="wus" /&gt; Once AG is activated it represses expression of WUS leading to the termination of the meristem.&lt;ref name="wus" /&gt;

Through the years, scientists have manipulated floral meristems for economic reasons. An example is the mutant tobacco plant "Maryland Mammoth." In 1936, the department of agriculture of Switzerland performed several scientific tests with this plant. "Maryland Mammoth" is peculiar in that it grows much faster than other tobacco plants.

===Apical dominance===
[[Apical dominance]] is the phenomenon where one meristem prevents or inhibits the growth of other meristems. As a result, the plant will have one clearly defined main trunk. For example, in trees, the tip of the main trunk bears the dominant meristem. Therefore, the tip of the trunk grows rapidly and is not shadowed by branches. If the dominant meristem is cut off, one or more branch tips will assume dominance. The branch will start growing faster and the new growth will be vertical. Over the years, the branch may begin to look more and more like an extension of the main trunk. Often several branches will exhibit this behavior after the removal of apical meristem, leading to a bushy growth.

The mechanism of apical dominance is based on [[auxin|auxins]], types of plant growth regulators. These are produced in the apical meristem and transported towards the roots in the [[vascular cambium|cambium]]. If apical dominance is complete, they prevent any branches from forming as long as the apical meristem is active. If the dominance is incomplete, side branches will develop.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Recent investigations into apical dominance and the control of branching have revealed a new plant hormone family termed [[strigolactone]]s. These compounds were previously known to be involved in seed germination and communication with [[mycorrhizal fungi]] and are now shown to be involved in inhibition of branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|title=Branching out: new class of plant hormones inhibits branch formation|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7210/edsumm/e080911-01.html|date=2008-09-11|accessdate=2009-04-30|volume=455|issue=7210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity in meristem architectures===
The SAM contains a population of [[stem cells]] that also produce the lateral meristems while the stem elongates. It turns out that the mechanism of [[regulation]] of the stem cell number might be evolutionarily conserved. The ''CLAVATA'' gene ''CLV2'' responsible for maintaining the stem cell population in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is very closely related to the [[Maize]] gene ''FASCIATED EAR 2''(''FEA2'') also involved in the same function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Taguchi-Shiobara | title = The fasciated ear2 gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein that regulates shoot meristem proliferation in maize | journal=Genes &amp; Development | volume=15 | issue=20 | pages=2755–2766 | year=2001 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208501 | pmid=11641280 | last2=Yuan | first2=Z | last3=Hake | first3=S | last4=Jackson | first4=D | pmc=312812 | url=http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/15/20/2755|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Rice]], the ''FON1-FON2'' system seems to bear a close relationship with the CLV signaling system in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.&lt;ref name="Suzaki T. 2006 1591–1602"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suzaki T. | title = Conservation and Diversification of Meristem Maintenance Mechanism in Oryza sativa: Function of the FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 Gene | journal=Plant and Cell Physiol. | volume=47 | issue=12 | pages=1591–1602 | year=2006 | doi = 10.1093/pcp/pcl025 | pmid=17056620 | last2=Toriba | first2=T | last3=Fujimoto | first3=M | last4=Tsutsumi | first4=N | last5=Kitano | first5=H | last6=Hirano | first6=HY}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies suggest that the regulation of stem cell number, identity and differentiation might be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in [[monocots]], if not in [[angiosperms]]. Rice also contains another genetic system distinct from ''FON1-FON2'', that is involved in regulating [[stem cell]] number.&lt;ref name="Suzaki T. 2006 1591–1602"/&gt; This example underlines the [[innovation]] that goes about in the living world all the time.

===Role of the KNOX-family genes===
[[File: Linaria spur.jpg|thumb|200px | left |Note the long spur of the above flower. Spurs attract pollinators and confer pollinator specificity. ''(Flower: Linaria dalmatica)'']]
[[File:Cardamine hirsuta.jpg| thumb | 180px | right |Complex leaves of ''[[Cardamine hirsuta|C. hirsuta]]'' result from KNOX gene expression]]
[[Genetic screens]] have identified genes belonging to the [[KNOX (genes)|KNOX]] family in this function. These genes essentially maintain the stem cells in an undifferentiated state. The KNOX family has undergone quite a bit of evolutionary diversification while keeping the overall mechanism more or less similar. Members of the KNOX family have been found in plants as diverse as [[Arabidopsis thaliana]], [[rice]], [[barley]] and [[tomato]]. KNOX-like genes are also present in some [[algae]], mosses, ferns and [[gymnosperms]]. Misexpression of these genes leads to the formation of interesting morphological features. For example, among members of ''[[Antirrhinae]]'', only the species of the genus [[Antirrhinum]] lack a structure called [[spur]] in the floral region. A spur is considered an evolutionary [[innovation]] because it defines [[pollinator]] specificity and attraction. Researchers carried out [[transposon]] mutagenesis in ''Antirrhinum majus'', and saw that some insertions led to formation of spurs that were very similar to the other members of ''[[Antirrhinae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Golz J.F. | title = Spontaneous Mutations in KNOX Genes Give Rise to a Novel Floral Structure in Antirrhinum | journal=Curr. Biol. | volume=12 | issue=7 | pages=515–522 | year=2002 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00721-2 | last2=Keck | first2=Emma J. | last3=Hudson | first3=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the loss of spur in wild ''Antirrhinum majus'' populations could probably be an evolutionary innovation.

The KNOX family has also been implicated in [[leaf]] shape evolution ''(See below for a more detailed discussion)''. One study looked at the pattern of KNOX gene expression in ''[[A. thaliana]]'', that has simple leaves and ''[[Cardamine hirsuta]]'', a plant having [[complex leaves]]. In ''A. thaliana'', the KNOX genes are completely turned off in leaves, but in ''C.hirsuta'', the expression continued, generating complex leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hay and Tsiantis | title = The genetic basis for differences in leaf form between ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and its wild relative ''Cardamine hirsuta'' | journal=Nat. Genet. | volume=38 | pages=942–947 | year=2006 | doi = 10.1038/ng1835 | pmid=16823378 | last2=Tsiantis | first2=M | issue=8 | url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n8/abs/ng1835.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it has been proposed that the mechanism of KNOX gene action is conserved across all [[vascular plants]], because there is a tight [[correlation]] between KNOX expression and a [[complex leaf]] morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bharathan G, etal | title = Homologies in Leaf Form Inferred from KNOXI Gene Expression During Development | journal=Science | volume=296 | issue=5574 | pages=1858–1860 | year=2002 | doi = 10.1126/science.1070343 | pmid=12052958 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5574/1858.full?ijkey=bnKUf4w6lbaQY&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary meristems==
Apical meristems may differentiate into three kinds of primary meristem:
* '''Protoderm''': lies around the outside of the stem and develops into the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]].
* '''Procambium''': lies just inside of the protoderm and develops into primary [[xylem]] and primary [[phloem]]. It also produces the [[vascular cambium]], and [[cork cambium]], secondary meristems. The cork cambium further differentiates into the phelloderm (to the inside) and the phellem, or cork (to the outside). All three of these layers (cork cambium, phellem, and phelloderm) constitute the [[periderm]]. In roots, the procambium can also give rise to the pericycle, which produces lateral roots in eudicots.&lt;ref name=" Evert, Ray 2013"&gt;Evert, Ray, and Susan Eichhorn. Raven Biology of Plants. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ground meristem''': develops into the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] and the [[pith]]. Composed of [[parenchyma]], [[collenchyma]] and [[sclerenchyma]] cells.&lt;ref name="Evert, Ray 2013"/&gt;

These meristems are responsible for primary growth, or an increase in length or height, which were discovered by scientist Joseph D. Carr of North Carolina in 1943. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Secondary meristems==
There are two types of secondary meristems, these are also called the ''lateral meristems'' because they surround the established stem of a plant and cause it to grow laterally (i.e., larger in diameter).
* [[Vascular cambium]], which produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem. This is a process that may continue throughout the life of the plant. This is what gives rise to [[wood]] in plants. Such plants are called [[arborescent]]. This does not occur in plants that do not go through secondary growth (known as [[herbaceous]] plants).
* [[Cork cambium]], which gives rise to the periderm, which replaces the epidermis.
&lt;!-- Is this even remotely true?

===Basal meristems===
As the name implies, this type of meristem is not found at the tip of a root or shoot but near the base. This type of meristem allows for primary growth even after the apex of the shoot has been severed. For example, the presence of basal meristem is the reason grass can continue growing after mowing.
--&gt;

==Indeterminate growth of meristems==
Though each plant grows according to a certain set of rules, each new root and shoot meristem can go on growing for as long as it is alive. In many plants, meristematic growth is potentially '''indeterminate''', making the overall shape of the plant not determinate in advance. This is the '''primary growth'''. Primary growth leads to lengthening of the plant body and organ formation. All plant organs arise ultimately from cell divisions in the apical meristems, followed by cell expansion and differentiation. Primary growth gives rise to the apical part of many plants.

The growth of nitrogen-fixing nodules on legume plants such as soybean and pea is either determinate or indeterminate. Thus, soybean (or bean and Lotus japonicus) produce determinate nodules (spherical), with a branched vascular system surrounding the central infected zone. Often, Rhizobium infected cells have only small vacuoles. In contrast, nodules on pea, clovers, and Medicago truncatula are indeterminate, to maintain (at least for some time) an active meristem that yields new cells for Rhizobium infection. Thus zones of maturity exist in the nodule. Infected cells usually possess a large vacuole. The plant vascular system is branched and peripheral.

==Cloning==
Under appropriate conditions, each shoot meristem can develop into a complete, new plant or [[cloning|clone]]. Such new plants can be grown from shoot cuttings that contain an apical meristem. Root apical meristems are not readily cloned, however. This cloning is called '''asexual reproduction''' or '''[[vegetative reproduction]]''' and is widely practiced in [[horticulture]] to mass-produce plants of a desirable [[genotype]]. This process is also known as mericloning.

Propagating through cuttings is another form of vegetative propagation that initiates root or shoot production from secondary meristematic cambial cells. This explains why basal 'wounding' of shoot-borne cuttings often aids root formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackenzie | first1 = K.A.D | last2 = Howard | first2 = B.H | year = 1986 | title = The Anatomical Relationship Between Cambial Regeneration and Root Initiation in Wounded Winter Cuttings of the Apple Rootstock M.26 | url = | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 649–661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Induced Meristems ==
Meristems may also be induced in the roots of legumes such as [[soybean]], ''[[Lotus japonicus]]'', [[pea]], and ''[[Medicago truncatula]]'' after infection with soil bacteria commonly called [[Rhizobium]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Cells of the inner or outer cortex in the so-called "window of nodulation" just behind the developing root tip are induced to divide. The critical signal substance is the lipo-[[oligosaccharide]] [[Nod-factor]], decorated with side groups to allow specificity of interaction. The Nod factor receptor proteins NFR1 and NFR5 were cloned from several legumes including ''Lotus japonicus'', ''Medicago truncatula'' and soybean (''Glycine max''). Regulation of nodule meristems utilizes long-distance regulation commonly called "Autoregulation of Nodulation" (AON). This process involves a leaf-vascular tissue located [[Leucine-rich repeat|LRR]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[kinase]]s (LjHAR1, GmNARK and MtSUNN), CLE [[peptide]] signalling, and KAPP interaction, similar to that seen in the CLV1,2,3 system. LjKLAVIER also exhibits a nodule regulation [[phenotype]] though it is not yet known how this relates to the other AON receptor kinases.


(NOTE:-We have used the word " DIFFERENTIATION " for the process of dividing of tissues which makes them specific to particular shape,size, and function.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8645">'''Military art''' ({{ lang-fr|L'Art de la Guerre}}) (lit. art of war) is a field of [[Military theory|theoretical research]] and [[Military education and training|training]] methodology in [[military science]] used in the [[conduct of military operation]]s on land, in the maritime or air environments. Military art includes the study and application of the [[principles of warfare]] and [[laws of war]] that apply equally to the closely interrelated [[military strategy]], [[operational mobility|operational art]] and [[military tactics|tactics]]. Exercise of military art is highly dependent on the [[economics]] and [[logistics]] supporting the [[armed forces]], their [[military technology and equipment]], and reflects the social influences on the [[military organisation]] exercising military art. Often misunderstood due to its 19th-century perception as generally "including the entire subject of war",&lt;ref&gt;p.37, Halleck&lt;/ref&gt; it is primarily, as the term implies, the expression of [[creative thinking]] on the part of the [[Decision making|decision-makers]] in employing their forces,&lt;ref&gt;p.140, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt; with the map of the area of operations as a veritable [[Canvas#Canvas for painting|canvas]], and the movement of forces commonly marked on the map with arrows, as [[brush stroke]]s. Less imaginatively it was defined in France during the 19th century as &lt;blockquote&gt;
The art of war is the art of concentrating and employing, at the opportune moment, a superior force of troops upon the decisive point.&lt;ref&gt;p.7, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; and &lt;blockquote&gt;
The art of divining the intention of the enemy from slight indications is one which rarely misleads, and is one of the most precious attributes of [[military genius]].&lt;ref&gt;p.294, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not well known that many of the greatest military leaders in Europe and Asia, notably Japan, were themselves either accomplished [[artist]]s, or [[Art collector|collectors of art]].

In history, schools of thinking about military art can be divided during the ancient and medieval periods by the influence of [[infantry]] troops on tactics in Europe, and [[cavalry]] on tactics in [[Asia]], and the period commencing with the [[Early Modern period]] when firearms and artillery increasingly influenced employment of forces. The need for mobility, opportunity and decisiveness have tended to associate military art with offensive manoeuvre, cavalry, and therefore, before advent of late-19th century firearms, Asia.&lt;ref&gt;p.97, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe military art was primarily concerned with time of [[combat]], understanding the best way an [[occupied position]] can enhance [[Defense (military)|defensive potential]] of a small [[field army]] largely consisting of relatively [[Mobility (military)|low mobility]] troops, by often using [[high ground]], terrain [[choke point]]s or [[field entrenchment]]s. Due to relative lack of economic and logistic support, European military art theorists advocated [[Battle#Types|decisive battles]] that could bring a [[military campaign]] to a quick conclusion, thus reducing the economic cost of [[war]], notably through the [[shock tactics]] of the [[armoured cavalry]].
In Asia, due to a more developed and widespread [[horse breeding]] offering enhanced mobility, military art developed a more [[Offensive (military)|offensive-based]] way of thinking about military tactics, and military art was dominated by considerations of choosing [[point of attack]] and [[military communications]].

The confrontation between these two forms of military art that took place as a result of the [[Crusades]] and the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], and the contemporaneous introduction of [[artillery]] into warfare significantly changed thinking about military art in Europe, leading to wide-ranging experiments in [[tactical formation]] of troops, use of [[combined arms]] and exercise of [[maneuver warfare]] concepts and methods not only in tactics, but on a larger scale, including in use of naval forces. This later led to creation of European [[colonial empire]]s.

Although European military art on land can be argued not to have reached its developed stage until the 19th century in the attempt to defeat [[linear tactics]] that led to the [[First World War]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 115, Halleck&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimate sophistication during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]], great increases in the [[firepower]] of the European [[firearms]] and artillery were usually able to negate greater number and mobility of the Asian field forces, no-where more illustrated than during the [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|French Invasion of Egypt]] in 1798. The defining application of firepower and manoeuvre in military art became expressed during the conduct of [[strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II]] that sought to combine the shock of [[armoured warfare]] with mobility, and the traditional reliance on infantry in strengthened positions to first stop the German advances and during [[counter-attack]]s to achieve [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] of the enemy position, and in conducting [[deep operations]] to destroy the logistic support, literally starving German troops of supplies and ammunition, and forcing them to [[Surrender (military)|surrender]].

Military art in [[naval warfare]] likewise developed along the considerations of position versus speed, initially through use of [[galley]]s and later during the [[Age of Sail]]. However, increasingly [[naval tactics]] became dominated by the relative firepower of individual vessels, and this was demonstrated during the epic [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The use of naval forces in military art significantly expanded the [[scale of conflict]]s to global ranges. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries naval military art became concerned primarily with the firepower and the ability of ships to withstand it through use of increasing their [[armour]] until the introduction of [[naval aviation]] into consideration of [[naval battle]]s and [[naval strategy]].

Introduction of aircraft into [[warfare]] drastically altered the 19th century understanding of military art, and application of its principles. [[Aerial warfare]] became the ultimate solution to manoeuvre in delivery of firepower, and drastically increased the [[tempo of conflict]]s, making [[blitzkrieg]] possible during the Second World War. Aerial warfare also finally negated the advantage of a [[defensive position]] which left the defender as an easily detected and attacked target for the [[bomber]]s. While German [[industrial centres]] became just such targets for the Allied [[strategic bombing during World War II]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] the Soviet [[Red Army]] chose to adapt by developing concepts and methods suggested by theorists during the [[interwar period]] to a more offensive-based and dynamic conduct of operations coordinating ground and [[air offensive]]s.

The final development in military art came with the increased influence of the [[electronics]] and its implications for the ability by infantry to halt the breakthroughs using increasingly powerful [[infantry support weapon]]s, and the effect on the [[military communications]] by a new form of combat, [[electronic warfare]]. The potential of losing ability to exercise [[command and control]] over forces, particularly strategically significant forces, completely undermined much of the theoretical thinking of the Cold War. Some have argued that this was one of the factors, along with those of economic considerations, that eventually led to the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], and [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|Dissolution of the USSR]].

Since the end of the Cold War in Europe, application of military art has been sought primarily by conventional forces in combat operations against unconventional opponents, and this has many attempts to review [[military history]] in the effort to find solutions to successful conduct of operations against these forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28103">'''Neurodevelopmental framework for learning''', like all frameworks, is an organizing structure through which learners and learning can be understood. Intelligence theories and [[neuropsychology]] inform many of them. The framework described below is a neurodevelopmental framework for learning. The neurodevelopmental framework was developed by the [[All Kinds of Minds Institute]] in collaboration with Dr. Mel Levine and the [[University of North Carolina]]'s Clinical Center for the Study of Development and Learning. It is similar to other neuropsychological frameworks, including [[Alexander Luria]]'s [[cultural-historical psychology]] and psychological [[activity theory]], but also draws from disciplines such as [[speech-language pathology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]].  It also shares components with [[#Other learning frameworks|other frameworks]], some of which are listed below. However, it does not include a [[general intelligence factor]] (abbreviated '''g'''), since the framework is used to describe learners in terms of profiles of strengths and weaknesses, as opposed to using labels, diagnoses, or broad ability levels.  This framework was also developed to link with academic skills, such as reading and writing. Implications for education are discussed below as well as the connections to and compatibilities with several major educational policy issues.

This framework consists of 8 constructs, sometimes referred to as systems.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, M.D.  (1998). ''Developmental Variation and Learning Disorders'', Second Edition.  Cambridge, MA:  Educators Publishing Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the 8 constructs, this framework includes several "cross-construct" phenomena:  rate alignment (working at optimal speed), strategy use (working and thinking tactically), chunk size capacity – the amount of material that can be processed, stored or generated, and metacognition (degree of knowledge about learning and insight into one's own neurodevelopmental strengths and weaknesses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin | first1 = A.

==Other learning frameworks==
Numerous frameworks are available that describe development and help to organize observations of [[learning]] behavior.  Intelligence theories date back to the 19th century and the early 20th century, such as [[Charles Spearman]]'s concept of [[general intelligence factor]], or g.  Though there were exceptions (e.g., Thorndike), most theories of intelligence included g, a general index of cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Bolles"&gt;Bolles, R.C.  (1993).  ''The Story of Psychology:  A Thematic History''.  Pacific Grove, CA:  Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fancher, R.E.  (1990). ''Pioneers of Psychology, Second Edition''.  New York:  Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
An intelligence theory that has drawn considerable attention is [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory|Cattell-Horn-Carroll]] (CHC), which is grounded in extensive factor analytic research from cognitive ability test databases, as well as studies of development and heritability.  CHC is actually an amalgam of Cattell-Horn Gf-Gc theory and Carroll's three-tier model.&lt;ref&gt;
Carroll, J. B. (1993). ''Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor Analytic Studies''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework with the broadest level a general intelligence factor conceptually similar to Spearman's g.  This general factor was divided into eight narrower abilities, each consisting of narrow factors.  Cattell-Horn's model was similar on several fronts, including its hierarchical structure.  In the 1990s, Carroll's model was combined with Cattell-Horn's work by Flanagan, McGrew, and Ortiz (2000).&lt;ref&gt;
Flanagan, D.P., McGrew, K.S., &amp; Ortiz, S. (2000). The Wechsler Intelligence Scales and Gf- Gc Theory:  A contemporary approach to interpretation. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  CHC contains three strata:  stratum III is g, stratum II consists of broad cognitive abilities, and stratum I consists of narrow cognitive abilities.  The broad cognitive abilities (stratum II) include fluid reasoning (or Gf, forming and recognizing logical relationships among patterns, inferencing, and transforming novel stimuli) and comprehension-knowledge (or Gc, using language and acquired knowledge).  There is on-going discussion by proponents of CHC about g's importance in the framework.  
The Structure of Intellect (SOI) model includes three axes (with 5-6 components per axis) that form a 3-dimensional cube; because each dimension is independent, there are 150 different potential aspects of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guilford | first1 = J.P. | year = 1982 | title = Cognitive psychology's ambiguities: Some suggested remedies | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 48–59 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.89.1.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Howard Gardner]] has written about several categories of intelligence, as opposed to a hierarchical model.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1999). Intelligence Reframed. Multiple intelligences for the 21st century, New York: Basic Books.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Neuropsychologists have sought to map various mental abilities onto brain structures.  In so doing they have created frameworks that include factors and sub-components.  [[Alexander Luria|Luria]]&lt;ref name="Luria 1973"&gt;Luria, A.R.  (1973). ''The Working Brain:  An Introduction to Neuropsychology'' (B. Haigh, Trans.).  New York:  Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; organized brain functions into now-familiar categories, such as [[speech]] and [[memory]].  Luria's conception of [[attention]] included three units:  Unit 1 (brainstem and related areas) regulates cortical activity and levels of alertness, Unit 2 (lateral and posterior regions of neocortex) analyzes and stores newly received information, and Unit 3 (frontal lobes) programs and regulates activity.&lt;ref name="Luria 1973"/&gt;  More recently, the PASS (Planning, Attention, Successive, and Simultaneous) model&lt;ref&gt;Das, J.P., Naglieri, J.A., &amp; Kirby, J.R.  (1994). ''Assessment of Cognitive Processes: The PASS Theory of Intelligence''.  Boston:  Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; yields both a global index of ability while emphasizing specific cognitive processes.  For example, "successive" refers to information that is perceived, interpreted, and/or remembered in a serial order (e.g., language), whereas "simultaneous" refers to material that is perceived, interpreted, and/or remembered as a whole (e.g. visual-spatial).

'''New Chronology''' is an alternative [[chronology of the ancient Near East]] developed by English Egyptologist [[David Rohl]] and other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Rohl|title=The Lost Testament|year=2002|location= UK|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=David |last=Rohl|title= From Eden to Exile | year=2009|page= 2|ref=harv|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with ''A Test of Time: The Bible - from Myth to History'' in 1995. It contradicts mainstream [[Egyptology]] by proposing a major revision of the established [[Egyptian chronology]], in particular by re-dating Egyptian kings of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth]] through [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth]] Dynasties, bringing forward conventional dating by up to 350 years. Rohl asserts that the New Chronology allows him to identify some of the characters in the [[Hebrew Bible]] with people whose names appear in archaeological finds.

The New Chronology, one of several proposed radical revisions of the conventional chronology, has not been accepted in academic Egyptology, where the conventional chronology or small variations of it remain standard.&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first= Chris|title=Temporal Fugues |journal=Journal of Ancient and Medieval Studies|volume=XIII |year=1996|url= http://www.biblearchaeology.org/file.axd?file=temporalfugues.rtf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amélie Kuhrt]], head of Ancient Near Eastern History at [[University College London]], in one of the standard reference works of the discipline, notes, {{quote|Many scholars feel sympathetic to the critique of weaknesses in the existing chronological framework [...], but most archaeologists and ancient historians are not at present convinced that the radical redatings proposed stand up to close examination.&lt;ref name=Kuhrt&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=Amelie|authorlink=Amélie Kuhrt|title=The Ancient Near East c. 3000-330 BC|volume=I |series=Routledge History of the Ancient World series|location=London &amp; New York|year=1995|page= 14|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}
Rohl's most vocal critic has been [[Kenneth Kitchen]], one of the leading experts on biblical history and the author of the standard work on the conventional chronology of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the period most directly affected by the New Chronology's redating of the Nineteenth to Twenty-fifth Dynasties.

== Rohl's New Chronology ==
[[File:NC Egyptian chronology comparison.png|thumb|Chart comparing the New Chronology of [[David Rohl]] and the [[Egyptian chronology#Conventional chronology|conventional chronology]] of [[Ian Shaw (Egyptologist)|Ian Shaw]]]]

David Rohl's published works ''A Test of Time'' (1995), ''Legend'' (1998), ''The Lost Testament'' (2002), and ''The Lords of Avaris'' (2007) set forth Rohl's theories for re-dating the major civilisations of the ancient world. ''A Test of Time'' proposes a down-dating (bringing closer to the present), by several centuries, of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], thus needing a major revision of the [[conventional chronology of ancient Egypt]]. Rohl asserts that this would let scholars identify some of the major events in the Hebrew Bible with events in the archaeological record and identify some of the well-known biblical characters with historical figures who appear in contemporary ancient texts. Lowering the Egyptian dates also dramatically affects the dating of dependent chronologies, such as that currently used for the [[Greek Heroic Age]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]], removing the [[Greek Dark Ages]], and lowering the dates of the [[Trojan War]] to within two generations of a ninth-century-BC [[Homer]] and his most famous composition: the ''[[Iliad]]''.

Rejecting the Revised Chronology of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and the [[Glasgow Chronology]] presented at the Society for Interdisciplinary Studies's 1978 "Ages in Chaos" conference, the New Chronology lowers the Egyptian dates (established within the traditional chronology) by up to 350 years at points before the universally accepted fixed date of 664 BC for the sacking of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by [[Ashurbanipal]].

Before the 1995 publication of ''A Test of Time'', [[Thomas L. Thompson]], a [[theology|theologian]] associated with [[Biblical Minimalism]], had insisted that any attempt to write history based on a direct integration of biblical and extra-biblical sources was "not only dubious but wholly ludicrous".&lt;ref name="st131002"/&gt; Rohl explained his view on the issue in ''The Lost Testament'' (2007): "Is the Old Testament history or myth? The only way to answer that question is to investigate the biblical stories using the archaeological evidence, combined with a study of the ancient texts of the civilisations which had a role to play in the Bible story. But this has to be done with an open mind. In my view the biblical text – just like any other ancient document – should be treated as a potentially reliable historical source until it can be demonstrated to be otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl had previously remarked in ''A Test of Time'' (1995) that he "did not originally set out to challenge our current understanding of the Old Testament narratives. This has come about simply because of the need to explore the ramifications of my TIP [Egyptian Third Intermediate Period] research. I have no religious axe to grind – I am simply an historian in search of some historical truth."&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohl's redating is based on criticism of three of the four arguments which he considers are the original foundations of the conventional chronology for the Egyptian New Kingdom:
* He asserts that the identification of "[[Shishak|Shishaq]] [Shishak], King of Egypt" ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 14:25f; [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 12:2-9) with [[Shoshenq I]], first proposed by [[Jean-François Champollion]], is based on incorrect conclusions. Rohl argues instead that Shishaq should be identified with [[Ramesses II]] (probably pronounced Riamashisha), which would move the date of Ramesses' reign forward some 300 years.
* Rohl also asserts that the record in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] of the [[Sothic cycle|rising of Sirius]] in the ninth [[regnal year]] of [[Amenhotep I]], which is used in conventional chronology to fix that year to either 1542 BC or 1517 BC, has been misread, and instead should be understood as evidence for a reform in the Egyptian calendar. This negative view of Papyrus Ebers is exemplified in a statement by Professor Jürgen von Beckerath who is of the opinion that "The calendar on the verso of the Ebers Medical Papyrus is by now so disputed that we must ask ourselves whether we really possess a sure basis for the chronology of this period of Egyptian history which is, after all, of the greatest importance for fixing the sequence of historical events, as well as for neighbouring countries".&lt;ref&gt;Becherath, J. von, in Helk, W. (ed.) Abstracts for the 'High, Middle or Low? International Colloquium on Chronology held at [[Schloss Haindorf]] (1990), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Wolfgang Helck concludes that "We therefore think it is safer to start from the regnal dates rather than from interpretations of real or supposed Sirius (Sothic) or New Moon dates".&lt;ref&gt;Helck, W. in Helk, W. (ed.) Abstracts for the 'High, Middle or Low? International Colloquium on Chronology held at Schloss Haindorf (1990), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
* Papyrus Leiden I.350, which dates to the 52nd year of Ramesses II, records a lunar observation which places that year of Ramesses's reign in one of 1278, 1253, 1228 or 1203 BC within the date-range of the conventional chronology. Having questioned the value of the Ebers Papyrus, Rohl argues that, since the lunar cycle repeats itself every 25 years, it is only useful for fine tuning a chronology and could equally apply to dates 300 years later as in the New Chronology.

Thus, Rohl is of the opinion that none of these three foundations of the conventional Egyptian chronology are secure, and that the sacking of Thebes by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in 664 BC is the earliest fixed date in Egyptian history.

===Evidence adduced===
Rohl bases his revised chronology (the New Chronology) on his interpretation of numerous archeological finds and genealogical records from Egypt. For example:

* Rohl notes that no [[Apis (deity)|Apis]] bull burials are recorded in the Lesser Vaults at [[Saqqara]] for the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first]] and early [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second]] Dynasties. He also argues that the reburial sequence of the mummies of the New Kingdom pharaohs in the Royal Cache (TT 320) shows that these two dynasties were contemporary (thus explaining why there are too few Apis burials for the period). Rohl finds that in the royal burial ground at Tanis it appears that the tomb of [[Osorkon II]] of the 22nd Dynasty was built before that of [[Psusennes I]] of the 21st Dynasty; in Rohl's view this can only be explained if the two dynasties were contemporary.
* Rohl offers inscriptions that list three non-royal genealogies which, when one attributes 20 to 23 years to a generation, show, according to Rohl, that Ramesses II flourished in the 10th century BC as Rohl advocates. In the conventional chronology, all three genealogies would be missing seven generations. He also argues that there are no genealogies that confirm the conventional dates for Ramesses II in the 13th century BC.
* One of Rohl's methods is the use of [[archaeoastronomy]], which he employs to fix the date of a near-sunset solar [[eclipse]] during the reign of [[Akhenaten]] and observed from the city of [[Ugarit]]. Based on calculations, using computer astronomy programs, Rohl asserts that the only time when this eclipse could have occurred during the whole second millennium BC was on 9 May 1012 BC. This is approximately 350 years later than the conventional dates for Akhenaten (1353-1334 BC).
* Rohl's dates for Amenemhat III of the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] in the 17th century BC have found support in the work of astronomer David Lappin, whose research finds matches for a sequence of 37 out of 39 lunar month lengths recorded in 12th Dynasty contracts; the conventional chronology matches at best 21. According to Lappin, this pattern provides "startling" support for Rohl's chronology.&lt;ref name=st131002&gt;''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 13 October 2002, [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/article54642.ece How myth became history]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shishaq===
[[File:Sysw-&amp;-Shyshk.jpg|thumb|Comparison by David Rohl of (first line) the name ''Sysw'' (the [[hypocorism]] of Ramesses II) as it would have been written using 13th to 10th century Proto-Hebrew signs, and (second line) the biblical name Shyshk as it would have been written using ninth to seventh-century Early Hebrew signs. The signs are taken from pottery inscriptions dating to those periods (namely the Lachish VI ostracon and the Izbet Sartah abcedary).]]

Most Egyptologists accept Shishaq as an alternative name for Shoshenq I.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Paul S. ''David, Solomon and Egypt'' Continuum International Publishing Group - Sheffie (1 Nov 1999) {{ISBN|978-1-84127-021-0}} pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David ''The Oxford History of the Biblical World'' Oxford Paperbacks; New edition (26 Jul 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-19-513937-2}} p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kevin A ''The Campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I into Palestine'' Mohr Siebeck 2005 {{ISBN|978-3-16-148270-0}} p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl disputes that Shoshenq's military activity fits the biblical account of Shishaq on the grounds that the two kings' campaigns are completely different and Jerusalem does not appear in the Shoshenq inscription as a subjected town.&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'', pp. 122-27.&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that Ramesses did campaign against Israel and that he had a short form of his formal name which was in use in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 389-96.&lt;/ref&gt; That name was Sysw, whilst the early Hebrew alphabet did not distinguish between S and SH, so the biblical name may have originally been Sysq. Rohl has also argued that the qoph ending may be a later misreading of the early sign for waw which in the tenth century was identical to the seventh century sign for qoph. Thus 7th century Sysq may have been a mistaken later reading of tenth-century Sysw.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Rohl]], [http://thelegendgroup.msatt.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=90 Shoshenq, Shishak and Shysha], accessed 7 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that Ramesses II (hypocoristicon ''Sysa''), rather than Shoshenq I, should be identified with the biblical Shishak is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grisanti |first1= Michael A |first2= Davd M. |last2=Howard |title=Giving the Sense |publisher= Kregel Academic &amp; Professional |date=1 April 2004 |isbn= 978-0-8254-2892-0 |page=193 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stMd0QV97IYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Shishak+and+Sysw+David+Rohl&amp;num=100&amp;ei=KOd1SvaKKI_-ygTSzuz-Ag&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kevin Wilson agrees only partially with David Rohl. Wilson accepts that there is a mismatch between the triumphal relief of Shoshenq I and the biblical description of King Shishak. However, he does not think that this discrepancy gives sufficient reason for doubting the identification of Shoshenq I with King Shishak of the Bible. Wilson writes about Shoshenq's inscription, "Contrary to previous studies, which have interpreted the relief as a celebration of his Palestine campaign, neither the triumphal relief nor any of its elements can be utilized as a source for historical data about that campaign. … the triumphal relief can unfortunately play no role in the reconstruction of Shoshenq’s campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wilson |first1= Kevin A. |title= The Campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I into Palestine|year= 2005|publisher= Mohr Siebeck|isbn= 3-16-148270-0|page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson's view is not supported by Kenneth Kitchen who states: "That the great topographical list of Shoshenq I at Karnak is a document of the greatest possible value for the history and nature of his campaign against Judah and Israel is now clearly established beyond all dispute, thanks to the labours expended on that list by a series of scholars. However, the composition and interpretation of the list still require further examination and clarification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kitchen |first1= Kenneth A.|authorlink=Kenneth Kitchen |title= The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt|year= 1973|publisher=Aris &amp; Phillips|isbn= 9780856680014|page= 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading scholars who have studied the campaign relief point out that it is indeed a unique list of subjected towns and not a copy of an earlier campaign by a more celebrated pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Noth |first1= M. |title= ZDPV 61|year= 1938|pages= 277–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Albright |first1= W.

==Implications of the New Chronology==

The implications of a radical down-dating of the conventional Egyptian chronology, such as that proposed by Rohl and other revisionists, are complex and wide-ranging. The New Chronology affects the historical disciplines of Old Testament studies, Levantine archaeology, Aegean and Anatolian archaeology and Classical studies, and raises major issues concerning Mesopotamian chronology and its links with Egypt and Anatolia.

===Implications for Egypt and her neighbours===

Redating the reign of Ramesses II to three centuries later than that given by the conventional chronology would reposition the date of the [[Battle of Kadesh]] and revise the linked chronology of Hittite history, and would need a revision of the chronology of Assyrian history before 911 BC. Given the dependence of Hittite chronology on Egyptian chronology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of the Hittites |last=Burney |first=Charles Allen |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8108-6564-8 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74IJytg2XuUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Hittite+chronology+Egyptian#v=onepage&amp;q=Hittite%20chronology%20Egyptian&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; a lowering of Egyptian dates would result in a lowering of the end of the [[Hittite New Kingdom]] and a resulting reduction (or complete removal) of the Anatolian Dark Age.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lords of Avaris'', Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Amarna period, a [[chronological synchronism]] between Egypt and Assyria is attested through the correspondence of Pharaoh Akhenaten and a King Ashuruballit. In the conventional chronology, this Ashuruballit is identified with [[Ashur-uballit I]] of the early [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], but the New Chronology has proposed the addition of an otherwise unknown King Ashuruballit "II" during the Middle Assyrian "dark age" as the author of the [[Amarna letters]]. Given that the Ashuruballit I synchronism with Akhenaten has become the crucial link between Egyptian and Mesopotamian history in recent years, this issue is a key area of focus and dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Preface to the 2nd edition of ''TIPE''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for the Bible===

As explained above, the New Chronology rejects the identification of Shoshenq I with the biblical Shishaq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newchronology.org/cgi-bin/somsid.cgi?session=1251460988&amp;page=html/volumes/06|title=ISIS - Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum|work=newchronology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead offers Ramesses II (also known by his nickname "Sysa") as the real historical figure behind the Shishaq narrative.

Rohl identifies [[Labaya]], a local ruler in Canaan whose activities are documented in the Amarna Letters, with [[Saul]], and identifies [[David]] with Dadua ("Tadua"), also mentioned in Amarna Letter EA256. Saul and Labaya share the same demise - "both die in battle - against a coalition of city states from the coastal plain - on or near [[Mount Gilboa]], both as a result of betrayal."&lt;ref name=st131002/&gt; Both also have a surviving son whose name translates as "Man of Baal."

The New Chronology places [[Solomon]] at the end of the wealthy Late Bronze Age rather than in the relatively impoverished Early Iron Age. Rohl and other New Chronology researchers contend that this fits better with the Hebrew Bible's description of Solomon's wealth.&lt;ref name=st131002/&gt;

Furthermore, Rohl shifts the Israelite Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest from the end of the Late Bronze Age to the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age (from the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] to the Thirteenth/Hyksos period). Rohl claims that this solves many of the problems associated with the historicity issue of the biblical narratives. He makes use of the archaeological reports from [[Avaris]], in the eastern [[Nile Delta]], which show that a large Semitic-speaking population lived there during the Thirteenth Dynasty. These people were culturally similar to the population of Middle Bronze Age (MB IIA) Canaan. Rohl identifies these Semites as the people upon whom the biblical tradition of the Israelite Sojourn in Egypt was subsequently based.

Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (late MB IIB) archaeologists have revealed a series of city destructions which John Bimson and Rohl have argued correspond closely to the cities attacked by the Israelite tribes in the Joshua narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newchronology.org/cgi-bin/somsid.cgi?session=1251460988&amp;page=html/volumes/02|title=ISIS - Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum|work=newchronology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohl ''A Test of Time'', Chapter 14, pp. 299-325&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, the heavily fortified city of Jericho was destroyed and abandoned at this time. On the other hand, there was no city of Jericho in existence at the end of the Late Bronze Age, drawing William Dever to conclude that "Joshua destroyed a city that wasn’t even there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dever|first1=William G.|title=Recent Archeological Discoveries and Biblical Research|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ab7_GFJ-dKQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Dever+Joshua+destroyed+even+there&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2013-01-07|year=1990|origyear=1989|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=USA|isbn=0-295-97261-0|page=47|chapter=2. The Israelite Settlement in Canaan. New Archeological Models|quote=(Of course, for some, that only made the Biblical story more miraculous than ever&amp;mdash;Joshua destroyed a city that wasn't even there!)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl claims that it is this lack of archaeological evidence to confirm biblical events in the Late Bronze Age which lies behind modern scholarly skepticism over the reliability of the Hebrew Bible narratives before the Divided Monarchy period. He gives the example of Israeli professor of archaeology, [[Ze'ev Herzog]], who caused an uproar in Israel and abroad when he gave voice to the "fairly widespread" view held among his colleagues that "there had been no Exodus from Egypt, no invasion by Joshua and that the Israelites had developed slowly and were originally Canaanites,"&lt;ref name="Sturgis"&gt;M. Sturgis, ''It Ain’t Necessarily So: Investigating the Truth of the Biblical Past'' (Headlin, London, 2001), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that the Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest was “a history that never happened.”&lt;ref name="Sturgis" /&gt; However, Rohl contends that the New Chronology, with the shift of the Exodus and Conquest events to the Middle Bronze Age, removes the principal reason for that widespread academic skepticism.

==Identifications in the New Chronology==

===Personal identifications===

Rohl identifies:
*[[Nebkaure Khety]] IV (16th Pharaoh of the 10th Dynasty) with the Pharaoh who had dealings with [[Abraham]].
*[[Amraphel]] (Genesis 14) with [[Amar-Sin]], king of [[Sumer]] (1834-1825 BC/BCE by Rohl's chronology).
*[[Tidal (Bible)]], King of Goyim/King of Nations (Genesis 14), with [[Tishdal]], [[Hurrian]] ruler from the [[Zagros]] mountains.
*Zariku, governor of [[Ashur]], with king [[Arioch]] of [[Ellasar]].
*Kutir-Lagamar of [[Elam]] with [[Chedorlaomer]] of Elam.
*[[Amenemhat III]] with the Pharaoh of Joseph, and [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] with the [[Vizier]] of Amenemhat III.
* The "new king who did not know Joseph" in Exodus 1:8 is identified by Rohl with [[Sobekhotep III]].{{Request quotation|date=September 2017}}
*[[Neferhotep I]] with the adoptive grandfather of [[Moses]].
*[[Sobekhotep IV|Khanefere Sebekhotep IV]], brother and successor of Neferhotep, with Khenephres, the Pharaoh from whom Moses fled to [[Midian]].
*The [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] with Manetho's Tutimaeus, whom Rohl identifies with [[Dedumose II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rohl|first1=David|title=An Alternative to the Velikovskian Chronology of Ancient Egypt|url=http://davidrohl.blogspot.co.uk/|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ibni]], [[Middle Bronze Age]] ruler of [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], with [[Jabin]], king of Hazor in Joshua 11:10.
*[[Akish]] or [[Achish]], king of Gath, is identified with [[Šuwardata]], King of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] in the Amarna letters. ''Akish'' is believed to be a shortened form of the [[Hurrian]] name ''Akishimige'', "the Sun God has given." Shuwardata is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] name meaning "the Sun God has given."
*[[Aziru]] of the Amarna Letters is identified with [[Hadadezer bar Rehob|Hadadezer]], Syrian king in II Samuel.
*[[Labaya]], a ruler in the [[Amarna Letters]], with [[King Saul]].
*[[King David]] with Dadua in Amarna Letter [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]].
*[[Mutbaal]], writer of the letter, is identified with Ishbaal (aka [[Ishbosheth]]). The two names have exactly the same meaning: "Man of Baal." Following the death of his father (Labaya/Saul), Mutbaal/Ishbaal moved his center to [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]].
*"The Sons of Labaya," in the [[Amarna Letter EA 250|Amarna Letter 250]], with Mutbaal/Ishbaal and David/Dadua, the latter being the son-in-law of Labaya/Shaul.
*Benemina, also mentioned in [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is identified by Rohl with Baanah, Israelite chieftain in II Samuel 4, who would later betray and assassinate Ishbosheth.
*Yishuya, also mentioned in [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is identified with [[Jesse]] (''Ishai'' in Hebrew), father of David.
*Ayab, the subject of [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is held to be the same as the Biblical [[Yoav]] (English "[[Joab]]").
*Lupakku ("Man of Pakku"), Aramean army commander in the Amarna Letters, with Shobach ("He of Pakku"{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}), Aramean army commander in the Bible.
*[[Nefertiti]] with [[Neferneferuaten]] and with [[Smenkhkare]].
*[[Horemheb]] is identified with the Pharaoh who destroyed [[Gezer]] and later gave it to [[Solomon]], together with one of his daughters as a wife. When Horemhab took Gezer he was not yet the ruler, but was acting under [[Tutankhamun]]. However, he became Pharaoh not long after, and Tutankhamun died too young to have left any marriageable daughters.
*[[Ramses II]] ([[hypocoristicon]] = Shysha) with [[Shishaq]] in the Bible.
*[[Chancellor Bay|Irsu the Syrian]], who took over control of Egypt according to the [[Harris Papyrus]], with Arza, Master of the Palace of Israel according to I Kings 16:8-10.
*[[Sheshi]], a [[Hyksos]] ruler, with [[Sheshai]], a ruler of [[Hebron]] descended from [[Anak]] (Joshua 15:13-15).
*Io of the Line of [[Inachus]] with Queen [[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep]] of the 17th Dynasty of Egypt at Waset
*[[Cadmus#Founder of Thebes|Cadmus of Thebes]] with Cadmus in the line of Pelasgian rulers of Crete
*[[Inachus]] with [[Khyan|Anak-idbu Khyan]] of the Greater Hyksos
*[[Apepi (pharaoh)|Auserre Apepi]] of the Greater Hyksos with [[Epaphus]]
*[[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], son of biblical [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] with [[Meskiagkasher]] of the First Dynasty of [[Uruk]]
*[[Nimrod]], son of biblical [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] with [[Enmerkar]] ('Enmer the Hunter') of the First Dynasty of Uruk

===Geographical identifications===

Rohl, in addition to his chronology, also has some geographical ideas that are different from the conventional notions. These include:

*The [[Garden of Eden]] (the urheimat [homeland] of the Sumerians), according to Rohl, was located in what is now [[Tabriz#Early accounts|northwestern Iran]], between [[Lake Urmia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 16-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Tower of Babel]], according to Rohl, was built in the ancient Sumerian capital of [[Eridu]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;
*The site of the ancient city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] is "a little over 100 metres beneath the surface of the [[Dead Sea]]," a few kilometers south-by-southeast from [[En-Gedi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 120-124.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Amalekites]] defeated by [[King Saul]] were not the ones living in the [[Negev]] and/or the [[Sinai]], but a northern branch of this people, "in the territory of Ephraim, on the highlands of Amalek" - or, in an alternative translation "in the Land of Ephraim, the mountains of the Amalekites" (Judges 12:15). This is supported by the report that, immediately following his destruction of the Amalekites, "Saul went to Carmel and set up a monument" (I Samuel 15:12). Once Saul is removed from the Negev and the Sinai, "Saul's kingdom as described in the Bible is precisely the area ruled over by [[Labaya]] according to the el-Amarna letters."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', p. 318)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===In Egyptology===
Most Egyptologists have not adopted the New Chronology,&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org" /&gt; continuing to employ the standard chronology in mainstream academic and popular publications. Rohl's most vocal critic has been Professor [[Kenneth Kitchen]], formerly of [[Liverpool University]], who called Rohl's thesis "100% nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Symbiosis, symbolism, and the power of the past: Canaan, ancient Israel, and their neighbors from the Late Bronze Age through Roman Palaestina |editor1-last=Dever |editor1-first=William G. |last=Kitchen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |others=Seymour Gitin |chapter=Egyptian interventions in the Levant in Iron Age II |year=2003 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |location= |isbn=978-1-57506-081-1 |pages=113–132 [122] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KK3eFcbIGN0C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Rohl+Kitchen#v=onepage&amp;q=Rohl%20Kitchen&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, other Egyptologists recognise the value of Rohl's work in challenging the bases of the Egyptian chronological framework. Professor Erik Hornung acknowledges that "...there remain many uncertainties in the Third Intermediate Period, as critics such as David Rohl have rightly maintained; even our basic premise of 925 [BC] for Shoshenq’s campaign to Jerusalem is not built on solid foundations."&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. et al.: "Ancient Egyptian Chronology" (Handbook of Oriental Studies I, vol. 83, Brill, Leiden, 2006), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic debate on the New Chronology, however, has largely not taken place in Egyptological or archaeological journals. Most discussions are to be found in the [[Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences]]' ''Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum'' (1985–2006).&lt;ref&gt;ISIS archive, [http://www.newchronology.org Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum].&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Bennett (1996),&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org"/&gt; while saying "I am quite certain that Rohl’s views are wrong" notes that besides academic debate on problems with the conventional chronology, such as those associated with the [[Thera eruption]], a "far deeper challenge ... has been mounted in the public arena." The history of this challenge to mainstream consensus outside of academic debate originates with the 1991 ''Centuries of Darkness'' by [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], together with Rohl, co-founder of the [[Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences]]. ''Centuries of Darkness'' postulated 250 years of non-existent "phantom time" in the conventional chronology based on an archaeological "Dark Age".&lt;ref&gt;"In a special review issue of the ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'' these proposals were roundly rejected by experts in all disciplines in Old World archaeology, a result virtually assured by the failure of the authors to present more than an outline restructuring for Egyptian chronology." Bennett (1996:2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Kitchen's arguments against the New Chronology have focused on Rohl's Third Intermediate Period revision which proposes an overlap between the 21st and 22nd Dynasties. In particular Kitchen challenges the validity of the chronological anomalies raised by Rohl, questioning whether they are true anomalies and offering his own explanations for the apparent problems raised by Rohl. Kitchen accuses New Chronologists of being obsessed with trying to close gaps in the archaeological record by lowering the dating.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Grouping all radical revisions of Egyptian chronology together without distinction, [[Erik Hornung]], in his Introduction to the ''Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology'', makes the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will always be exposed to such attempts, but they could only be taken seriously if not only the arbitrary dynasties and rulers, but also their contexts, could be displaced.... In the absence of such proofs we can hardly be expected to "refute" such claims, or even to respond in any fashion ... It is thus neither arrogance nor ill-will that leads the academic community to neglect these efforts which frequently lead to irritation and distrust outside of professional circles (and are often undertaken with the encouragement of the media). These attempts usually require a rather lofty disrespect of the most elementary sources and facts and thus do not merit discussion. We will therefore avoid discussion of such issues in our handbook, restricting ourselves to those hypotheses and discussions which are based on the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. et al.: "Ancient Egyptian Chronology" (Handbook of Oriental Studies I, vol. 83, Brill, Leiden, 2006), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bennett (1996), whilst not accepting Rohl's thesis, suggests that such out-of-hand rejection may be inappropriate in Rohl's case, since "there is a world of difference between [Rohl's] intellectual standing and that of Velikovsky, or even Peter James" since, unlike "popular radicalisms" such as those of [[Immanuel Velikovsky|Velikovsky]], [[Robert Bauval|Bauval]] or [[Graham Hancock|Hancock]], "Rohl has a considerable mastery of his material."

Professor [[Amélie Kuhrt]], head of Ancient Near Eastern History at University College, London, in one of the standard reference works of the discipline, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An extreme low chronology has been proposed recently by a group devoted to revising the absolute chronology of the Mediterranean and Western Asia: P. James et al., ''Centuries of Darkness'', London, 1991; similar, though slightly diverging revisions, are upheld by another group, too, and partly published in the ''Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum''. The hub for the dating of other cultures is Egypt, so much of the work of both groups focuses on Egyptian evidence. Many scholars feel sympathetic to the critique of weaknesses in the existing chronological framework presented in these volumes, but most archaeologists and ancient historians are not at present convinced that the radical redatings proposed stand up to close examination.&lt;ref name=Kuhrt/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Radiocarbon dating===
In 2010 a series of corroborated [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] were published for dynastic Egypt which suggest some minor revisions to the conventional chronology, but do not support Rohl's proposed revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christopher Bronk Ramsey et al., |title=Radiocarbon-Based Chronology for Dynastic Egypt, |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5985/1554 |journal=''Science'' Vol. 328. no. 5985 (18 June 2010), pp. 1554 - 1557.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular media===
In 1995 Rohl published his version of the New Chronology, in the best-selling book ''A Test of Time'', accompanied by a 1995 Channel 4 three-part series ''Pharaohs and Kings - A Biblical Quest''. ''A Test of Time'' takes up the general scenario presented by James, adding many details omitted in 1991, including the "dramatic results" pertaining to [[Biblical chronology]]. Whilst the New Chronology has not been broadly accepted in academia, it has been widely disseminated to the public since the 1990s via Rohl's best-selling&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'' stayed in the top ten ''[[Sunday Times]]'' bestseller list for eight weeks in 1995 (from 17 September to 6 November, pp. 7-14).&lt;/ref&gt; books and the 1995 [[Channel 4]] television documentary, aired in the United States in 1996 on [[The Learning Channel]]. Berthoud (2008) contrasts the "near-unanimous" rejection of Rohl's theories in Egyptology with the "sensational effect" his books, combined with the television series, had on the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Berthoud, J-M. ''Creation Bible Et Science'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-2-8251-3887-8}}, 244f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction of some leading figures from the academic establishment has been very hostile. Kenneth Kitchen presented a "savage review" of ''Centuries of Darkness'' in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', and the [[British Museum]] banned ''A Test of Time'' from its museum store.&lt;ref&gt;Alden Bass (2003), [http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2503 Which Came First, the Pyramids or the Flood?], ''Apologetics Press :: Reason &amp; Revelation'', November 2003 - 23[11]:97-101&lt;/ref&gt;

===By evangelicals===

In December 1999 the Dutch language internet journal ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'' (Bible, History and Archaeology) devoted space to a debate about Rohl's New Chronology. According to evangelical scholar, J.G. van der Land, editor of the journal, Rohl's time-line resolves some archaeological anomalies surrounding ancient Egypt, but creates conflicts with other areas that make it untenable.&lt;ref name=vanderland&gt;van der Land, J.G. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/echroroh.html Pharaohs and the Bible: David Rohl's chronology untenable]", ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments were then countered by Peter van der Veen and Robert Porter.&lt;ref name=vanderveen&gt;van der Veen, P.G. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/engveen.html Is Rohl's Chronology inaccurate? A reply to BGA']," ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;Porter, R.M. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/enfilpo.html 'Did the Philistines settle in Canaan around 1200 BC?]", ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the final article in the issue, van der Land identified some new issues for Rohl's chronology arising from recent finds in Assyrian letters.&lt;ref&gt;van der Land, J.G. (2000), "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/engbaboe.html Conclusive evidence against Rohl's proposed New Chronology: An Assyrian chancellor's archive"], ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NIRA Dynamics AB''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] company focusing on research and development of signal processing and control systems for the [[automotive industry]]. It supplies automotive [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs) and suppliers in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia with its products and systems. In 2015, the number of vehicles equipped with NIRA's main product, TPI, exceeded the benchmark of 15,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niradynamics.se/ NIRA Dynamics AB]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NIRA was founded in 2001 and is located at Mjärdevi Science Park in [[Linköping]], Sweden.

During the early period, NIRA Dynamics developed the first two of its products: the anti-spin system '''NSC''' and a positioning system '''MAP'''.

NSC received the Volvo Technology Award and until 2004 was featured in the [[Volvo S40]] and V40 models under the name DSA (Dynamic Stability Assistance).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volvoclub.org.uk/tech/DSASystemVolvo40Series.pdf Volvo: Dynamic Stability Assistance]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, NSC is in series production and featured in a line of motorcycles from one of the world leading motorcycle manufacturers.

In 2008, NIRA was presented the European Automotive Chassis Product of the Year Award by Frost &amp; Sullivan for its product TPI.

Since 2014, NIRA has broadened its product portfolio with RSI (Road Surface Information), TGI (Tire Grip Indicator), LWI (Loose Wheel Indicator) and MAP (Map Aided Positioning).

NIRA Dynamics holds an [[ISO 9001:2000]] certificate stating that it has efficient and structured processes and tools to manage collaborative development projects in international environments.

==Technology and products==
NIRA Dynamics' core product is its '''Tire Pressure Indicator''' ('''TPI'''), an indirect [[tire-pressure monitoring system]] (TPMS) capable of detecting underinflation simultaneously in up to four [[tire]]s. At the moment, TPI is installed in several [[Audi]] models (the [[Audi A1|A1]], [[Audi A3|A3]], [[Audi A4|A4]], [[Audi A5|A5]], [[Audi A6|A6]], [[Audi A7|A7]], [[Audi A8|A8]], [[Audi Q3|Q3]], [[Audi Q5|Q5]], [[Audi Q7|Q7]], and [[Audi TT|TT]]); several [[Volkswagen]] models ([[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]], [[Volkswagen Beetle (A5)|Beetle]], [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]], [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]], [[Volkswagen Touran|Touran]], and [[Volkswagen Sharan|Sharan]]); several [[SEAT]] and [[Škoda Auto|Skoda]] models; as well as the [[Chery]] [[Chery Arrizo 7|Arrizo 7]] and the [[MG 3]]. It is also fitted to many Volvo, Fiat and Renault vehicles. The system meets the American FMVSS 138 and the European ECE R-64 regulations on tire pressure monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niradynamics.se/products/tpi NIRA Dynamics' TPI]&lt;/ref&gt; TPI is a software component that uses both relative rolling radius information as well as wheel oscillation measurement. It estimates tire pressure mainly from the signals of the wheel speed sensors that are part of the [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) and [[electronic stability control]] system (ESC). It gets active shortly after a reset which triggers a self-learning process. A reset needs to be initiated by the driver when the tires have been changed or the pressure adjusted. TPI does not require any in-wheel pressure sensors and RF ([[radio frequency]]) components. The Audi TT series was the first to be equipped with TPI, in 2006. The Audi A4 and A5 models followed the next year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autofieldguide.com/articles/040805.html Automotive Design and Production: Audi Rolls With Indirect TPMS]&lt;/ref&gt; TPI can be fit into different electronic stability control hardware hosts, including those of [[Continental AG]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], and [[TRW Automotive]].

NIRA Dynamics is developing [[sensor fusion]] based systems for different vehicle applications. Sensor fusion or sensor data fusion is the use of information from several different physical sensors to compute new virtual sensor signals. The virtual sensors can be of two different types: improved versions of physical sensor signals, or soft sensors that have no direct physical counterpart among the sensors used.

'''TPI ABS''' is a '''TPI''' version for vehicles with built-in [[anti-lock braking system]] (which is standard in most cars) but no [[electronic stability control]] system (which is not standard, particularly in emerging markets).

'''Loose Wheel Indicator''' ('''LWI''') detects when the wheel bolts/nuts have come loose on at least one wheel position and the wheel starts to separate from the hub. It warns the driver who then can bring the vehicle to a safe halt before the wheel falls off. As '''TPI''' and all other NIRA products, this software-based function does not require any additional sensors.

'''Tire Grip Indicator''' ('''TGI''') constantly estimates the available friction between the road and the tires. Unlike comparable functions, it does not need any additional sensors like tire-mounted sensors or cameras. This makes '''TGI''' very cost effective.

'''Road Surface Information''' ('''RSI''') includes the friction estimation function of '''TGI''', but goes one step further by completing this with road roughness information and detecting irregular events like potholes, speedbumps etc. This information can either be used directly in the car, for example to adapt the chassis, or be distributed via cloud services to other vehicles, road authorities etc.
In the winter 2015/2016, NIRA has started a field study in Sweden where a fleet of taxi vehicles has been equipped with RSI delivering for example an online, real-time friction map of the roads of Gothenburg, Sweden.

'''Map Aided Positioning''' ('''MAP''') is a product which enables [[indoor positioning system|indoor navigation]] where GPS signals are not available, for example in multi-storey garages or tunnel systems. As its product siblings, it is purely software-based, but needs high-precision maps of the respective building.

'''Ohm's acoustic law''', sometimes called the '''acoustic phase law''' or simply '''Ohm's law''', states that a [[music]]al [[sound]] is perceived by the [[ear]] as a set of a number of constituent pure [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] tones.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm's law, ''n''.2, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Text-book of Physics | author = A. Wilmer Duff, editor | year = 1912 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U_EzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA530&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA529,M1 | publisher =  P. Blakiston's Son &amp; Co | location=Philadelphia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was proposed by physicist [[Georg Ohm]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm, G., ''Annalen der Physik'' (1843) 59 513&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] elaborated the law into what is often today known as Ohm's acoustic law, by adding that the quality of a tone depends solely on the number and relative strength of its partial simple tones, and not on their relative phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Science of Musical Sounds | author = Dayton Clarence Miller | publisher = The Macmillan Company | year = 1916 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7f8KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lessons in Elementary Practical Physics, Vol. III, Part 1: Practical Acoustics | author = Charles Lightfoot Barnes | publisher = London: Macmillan and Co. Ltd | year = 1897 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6TQIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA161,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Helmholtz championed the law in opposition to contrary evidence expounded by [[August Seebeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Combination Tones and Other Related Auditory Phenomena | publisher = University of Chicago | year = 1908 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BUEIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA128,M1 | author = Joseph Peterson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law has also been interpreted as "a pitch corresponding to a certain frequency can only be heard if the acoustical wave contains power at that frequency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Acoustics and psychoacoustics | author = David M. Howard, Jamie A. S. Angus | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-240-51995-1 | page = 123 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yyk5nAIJcBcC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=intitle:Acoustics+intitle:and+intitle:Psychoacoustics+ohm+law&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=5bxlSby6B5CQkQSJlpznAQ#PPA123,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws are true to the extent that the ear is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the acoustic waves, and further, is able to resolve the differences in their frequency. In modern times, the sensitivity of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] to the phase of tone components has been extensively investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Loudspeaker and Headphone Handbook | author = John Borwick | publisher = Focal Press | isbn = 0-240-51578-1 | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pAOFt1znYr8C&amp;pg=PA655&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+acoustic+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=NAiHR_CaNp6ktgP_i4zQBQ&amp;sig=1OIFUWDCMTIUILOZrnaa5j3ef9M#PPA655,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversy has led to this characterization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  Foundations of Modern Auditory Theory | editor = Jerry V. Tobias | publisher = Academic Press | volume = 1 | author = W. Dixon Ward | chapter = Musical Perception |year = 1970 | page = 438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For years musicians have been told that the ear is able to separate any complex signal into a series of sinusoidal signals – that it acts as a [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analyzer]].  This quarter-truth, known as Ohm's Other Law, has served to increase the distrust with which perceptive musicians regard scientists, since it is readily apparent to them that the ear acts in this way only under very restricted conditions.|W. Dixon Ward (1970)}}

'''Oral History of American Music''' ('''OHAM'''), founded in 1969, is an [[oral history]] project and archive of audio and video recordings consisting mainly of interviews with American classical and [[jazz]] musicians.&lt;ref name="OHAM More About"&gt;{{cite web|title=More About OHAM|url=http://web.library.yale.edu/oham/moreaboutoham|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a special collection of the Irving S. Gilmore Music Library at [[Yale University]] and housed within the [[Sterling Memorial Library]] building in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="OHAM Access"&gt;{{cite web|title=OHAM: Access|url=http://web.library.yale.edu/oham/access|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently holds over 2,000 interviews with more than 900 subjects&lt;ref name="NYT Tommasini"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tommasini|first1=Anthony|title=It's History: Audio, Video and Live Performance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/10/arts/music/10voices.html|accessdate=August 31, 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered the definitive collection of its kind.&lt;ref name = "NYT Wise"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wise|first1=Brian|title=The Flip Side of American Music|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/the-flip-side-of-american-music.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Redding Pilot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Susan|first1=Wolf|title=Pioneers in Oral History of American Music Will Speak at Mark Twain Library May 31|publisher=Redding Pilot|date=May 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The creation of Oral History of American Music was a result of [[musicology|musicologist]] Vivian Perlis's research on the life of American composer [[Charles Ives]], for which she interviewed sixty individuals who had known him personally. During the course of the interviews, Perlis recognized the need for a larger project that would collect and preserve the oral history of American composers, and began the OHAM project in 1969 with that intent.&lt;ref name="Musicworks"&gt;{{cite journal|title=In the Voice of the Artist: An Interview with Vivian Perlis|journal=Musicworks|date=Autumn 1991|issue=51|pages=22–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perlis's interviews with friends, family and colleagues of Ives became OHAM's initial collection, and were later used in her 1974 book, ''Charles Ives Remembered: An Oral History'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Dale|title=Saving a Spoken Soundscape|publisher=New Haven Register|date=February 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she received the [[American Musicological Society]]'s Otto Kinkeldey Award—the first time it had been awarded either to a woman or for work on American music.&lt;ref name="Kinkeldey Winners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Otto Kinkeldey Award Winners|url=http://www.ams-net.org/awards/kinkeldeywinners.php|website=American Musicological Society|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Perlis's biography of Ives, the project's collection played an instrumental role in a number of other historical works: ''A Good Dissonance Like a Man'', a documentary film about Ives;&lt;ref name=Newsletter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John J.|title=Oral History, American Music Celebrates 10th Birthday|journal=New England Association for Oral History Newsletter|date=Fall 1981|volume=6|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Copland]]'s two-volume autobiography ''Copland: 1900 through 1942'' and ''Copland: Since 1943'', co-written with Perlis;&lt;ref name=Alumni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elder|first1=Sharon|title=Let's Talk Music|journal=Yale Alumni Magazine|date=May 1991|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book ''Composers' Voices from Ives to Ellington'', co-written by Perlis and [[Libby Van Cleve]].&lt;ref name="NYT Wise"/&gt; Perlis served as the project's director until she retired in 2010 and was succeeded by its current director, Van Cleve.&lt;ref name="YSM Retirement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivian Perlis announces retirement from Oral History of American Music project|url=http://music.yale.edu/2010/07/27/vivian-perlis-announces-retirement-from-oral-history-of-american-music-project/|website=Yale School of Music Website|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OHAM expanded through interviews conducted by Perlis, Van Cleve and others, as well as by acquisitions of recordings from scholars, radio producers, and concert presenters. Its largest component today is the Major Figures in American Music series, which primarily documents classical composers at varying stages in their careers. OHAM also holds five series of extensive interviews centered around specific persons and topics.&lt;ref name="OHAM More About"/&gt;

Grants to preserve and digitize OHAM's recordings have come from the [[Grammy Foundation]],&lt;ref name="GRAMMY"&gt;{{cite web|title=GRAMMY Foundation Grant Recipients|url=https://www.grammy.org/grammy-foundation/grants/past-recipients|website=GRAMMY.org|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation,&lt;ref name="Delmas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Library Program Grants, 1993–2015|url=http://delmas.org/grants/past-grants/research-library-grants/|website=The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]],&lt;ref name="NEH1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RO-*1335-80|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEH2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RC-20497-83|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEH3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RC-21182-87|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Save America's Treasures]] initiative.&lt;ref name="Save America's Treasures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Save America's Treasure Awards 1999–2010 by State|url=http://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/SAT%20Awards%201999-2010%20Table_2.pdf|publisher=Save America's Treasures|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Aaron Copland]] Fund for Music donated $500,000 to establish an endowment fund for the organization.&lt;ref name="YaleNews Copland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale's Oral History of American Music Project Receives Endowment Support from the Aaron Copland Fund for Music|url=http://news.yale.edu/2009/12/03/yale-s-oral-history-american-music-project-receives-endowment-support-aaron-copland-fund-|website=YaleNews|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political [[forecasting]]''' aims at predicting the outcome of elections.

== History ==
People have long been interested in predicting election outcomes. Quotes of betting odds on [[Pope|papal succession]] appear as early as 1503, when such wagering was already considered “an old practice.”&lt;ref&gt;Frederic J. Baumgartner. ''Behind Locked Doors: A History of Papal Elections''. New York, Palgrave, 2003 (pages 88 and 250).&lt;/ref&gt; Political betting also has a long history in Great Britain. As one prominent example, Charles James Fox, the late-eighteenth-century Whig statesman, was known as an inveterate gambler. His biographer, George Otto Trevelyan, noted that“(f)or ten years, from 1771 onwards, Charles Fox betted frequently, largely, and judiciously, on the social and political occurrences of the time.”&lt;ref&gt;George Otto Trevelyan. ''The Early History of Charles James Fox''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1880 (page 416).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of scientific polling in 1936, betting odds in the [[United States]] correlated strongly to vote results.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien. ''Markets vs. polls as election predictors: An historical assessment''. Electoral Studies 31 (2012) 532–539. Elsevier, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1936, [[opinion poll]]s have been a basic part of political forecasting. More recently, [[prediction market]]s have been formed, starting in 1988 with [[Iowa Electronic Markets]].

With the advent of statistical techniques, electoral data have become increasingly easy to handle. It is no surprise, then, that election forecasting has become a big business, for polling firms, news organizations, and betting markets as well as academic students of politics.&lt;ref name ="ef"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0023.xml|title= Election forecasting|last1= Stegmaier|first1= Mary|last2= Norpoth|first2= Helmut|date= 2013-09-30|access-date=2016-09-26|doi =10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic scholars have constructed models of voting behavior to forecast the outcomes of elections. These forecasts are derived from theories and empirical evidence about what matters to voters when they make electoral choices. The forecast models typically rely on a few predictors in highly aggregated form, with an emphasis on phenomena that change in the short-run, such as the state of the economy, so as to offer maximum leverage for predicting the result of a specific election.&lt;ref name = "ef"/&gt;

An early successful model which is still being used is [[The Keys to the White House]] by [[Allan Lichtman]]. Election forecasting in the United States was first brought to the attention of the wider public by [[Nate Silver]] and his [[FiveThirtyEight]] website in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]]. Currently, there are many competing models trying to predict the outcome of elections in the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], and elsewhere.

== Methods ==
===Averaging polls===

Combining poll data lowers the forecasting mistakes of a poll.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred G. Cuzan, J. Scott Armstrong, and Randall Jones, [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html "Combining Methods to Forecast the 2004 Presidential Election: The PollyVote"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130123102051/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html |date=2013-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political forecasting models include averaged poll results, such as the [[RealClearPolitics]] poll average.

===Poll damping===

Poll damping is when incorrect indicators of public opinion are not used in a forecast model. For instance, early in the campaign, polls are poor measures of the future choices of voters. The poll results closer to an election are a more accurate prediction.  Campbell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=James E.|title=Polls and Votes|journal=American Politics Quarterly|date=October 1996|volume=24|issue=4|pages=408–433|doi=10.1177/1532673X9602400402|url=http://apr.sagepub.com/content/24/4/408.abstract|accessdate=11 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the power of poll damping in political forecasting.

===Nomenclature===

When discussing the likelihood of a particular electoral outcome, political forecasters tend to use one of a small range of shorthand phrases.&lt;ref name="rollcall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.cq.com/electionguide/|title=Election Guide 2018|publisher=Roll Call Politics|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings|title=2018 Senate Race Ratings|date=24 August 2018|publisher=[[Cook Political Report]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/17/here-are-the-house-seats-most-likely-to-flip-according-to-election-rating-systems/|title=Here are the House seats most likely to flip, according to election rating systems|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=17 August 2018|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

*'''Solid''' (e.g., "Solid Republican"), also '''Safe'''.  Very unlikely that the party which currently holds the seat will change in the upcoming election.
*'''Likely''' (e.g., "Likely Democrat"), also '''Favored'''.  It is not thought at the moment that the seat will be particularly competitive, and hence the party is likely to remain unchanged, but there is a possibility this may alter. 
*'''Lean''' (e.g., "Leans Independent"). One candidate / party has a slight advantage in polling and forecasting, but other outcomes are possible.
*'''Tilt'''.  Used less widely than the other terms, but indicates a very small advantage to one or another party.&lt;ref name="rollcall"/&gt;
*'''Toss-Up'''. These are the seats that are considered to be the most competitive, with more than one party having a good chance of winning.

== Markets ==
[[Prediction market]]s show very accurate forecasts of an election outcome. One example is the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]]. In a study, 964 election polls were compared with the five US presidential elections from 1988 to 2004. [http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf Berg et al. (2008)] showed that the Iowa Electronic Markets topped the polls 74% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, damped polls have been shown to top prediction markets. Comparing damped polls to forecasts of the Iowa Electronic Markets, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725101900/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/Political/PDFs/EriksonWlezien_Markets_AAPOR_for_POLLY.pdf Erikson and Wlezien (2008)] showed that the damped polls outperform all markets or models.

== Regression models ==
Political scientists and economists oftentimes use [[regression analysis|regression models]] of past elections. This is done to help forecast the votes of the political parties – for example, Democrats and Republicans in the US. The information helps their party’s next presidential candidate forecast the future. Most models include at least one public opinion variable, a trial heat poll, or a presidential approval rating.
Bayesian statistics can also be used to estimate the posterior distributions of the true proportion of voters that will vote for each candidate in each state, given both the polling data available and the previous election results for each state.  Each poll can be weighted based on its age and its size, providing a highly dynamic forecasting mechanism as Election day approaches.   http://electionanalytics.cs.illinois.edu/ is an example of a site that employs such methods.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Rigdon, S., Jacobson, S.H., Cho, W.T., Sewell, E.C., Rigdon, C.J., 2009, “A Bayesian Prediction Model for the United States Presidential Election,” American Politics Research, 37(4), 700-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19783">One of the most common ways that people cope with trauma is through the comfort found in religious or spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists of religion have performed multiple studies to measure the positive and negative effects of this coping style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trevino | first1 = K. M. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | year = 2007 | title = Religious coping with terrorism and natural disaster | url = | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 100 | issue = 9| pages = 946–947 | doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3181454660| pmid = 17902314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading researchers have split religious coping into two categories: positive religious coping and negative religious coping. Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of religious coping==
[[Kenneth Pargament]] is the author of the book ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping]]'' and a leading researcher in religious coping. Along with developing the "RCOPE" questionnaire to measure religious coping strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = Kenneth I. | last2 = Koenig | first2 = Harold G. | last3 = Perez | first3 = Lisa M. | year = 2000 | title = The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 519–543 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 | pmid = 10775045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pargament and his colleagues designated three basic styles of coping with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament, Joseph Kennell, William Hathaway, Nancy Grevengoed, Jon Newman &amp; Wendy Jones (1988). Religion and the problem-solving process: Three styles of coping. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, v27 n1, pp90-104. ISSN 0021-8294&lt;/ref&gt; In Pargament's article "Religion and the Problem-Solving Process: Three Styles of Coping", he identifies the collaborative, self-directed, and deferring coping styles. The collaborative style of religious coping involves an active and internalized personal exchange with God. The deferring coping style is when individuals rely heavily on God and delegate their stress without taking personal responsibility for the situation. The self-directed style of religious coping emphasizes the free will given by God that allows for the individual to solve the problem on their own. The collaborative style of coping has been found to produce the most advantages in clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = III | last2 = Lynn | first2 = Q. K. | last3 = Crossley | first3 = C. D. | last4 = Pargament | first4 = K. I. | year = 2004 | title = Self-Directing Religious Coping: A Deistic God, Abandoning God, or No God at All? | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 409–418 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00243.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meta-analysis of 49 studies reviewing religion as a coping method, several mechanisms of positive coping were identified. Several are listed below.
* religious purification/forgiveness
* religious direction/conversion
* seeking support from clergy members
* spiritual connection
In the same study, negative coping strategies were also pinpointed. Some of them are listed below.
* spiritual discontent
* punishing God reappraisal
* reappraisal of God's powers
* pleading for direct intercession
The study then identified forms of positive psychological adjustment, like those listed below.
* acceptance
* happiness
* optimism
* purpose in life
A similar list of negative psychological adjustments was compiled.
* anxiety
* burden
* negative mood
* callousness
Positive religious coping methods correlated more strongly with positive psychological adjustment than negative psychological adjustment. Similarly, negative religious coping methods correlated with negative psychological adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–80|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific traumatic events==

===September 11 attacks===
The [[September 11 attacks]] have been widely studied among psychologists. Research has shown that 90% of Americans coped with the stress of September 11 (2001) by "turning to religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Harold G|title=Research on Religion, Spirituality, and Mental Health: A Review|journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=54|issue=5|pages=283–291|doi=10.1177/070674370905400502|pmid=19497160|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-two percent of a sample of undergraduate and graduate students reported praying to cope with the stress that followed the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = BD | last2 = Elliott | first2 = MN | last3 = Jaycox | first3 = LH | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = A national longitudinal study of the psychological consequences of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks: reactions, impairment, and help-seeking | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 105–117 | doi=10.1521/psyc.67.2.105.35964| pmid = 15262576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis showed that searching for spiritual meaning was associated with less anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Cascio | first2 = T | last3 = Santangelo | first3 = LK | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Hope, meaning, and growth following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks | url = | journal = J Interpers Violence | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 523–548 | doi=10.1177/0886260504272896| pmid = 15788553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists also examined the types of coping used and how they affected mental health outcomes. Research shows that people who used positive religious coping displayed greater optimism, less anxiety, and higher levels of positive emotion three months after the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Tice | first2 = TN | last3 = Peterson | first3 = C | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Prayers, spiritual support, and positive attitudes in coping with the September 11 national crisis | url = | journal = J Pers | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 763–791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00328.x| pmid = 15854013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who used positive religious coping were found to have significantly more positive outcomes (closeness with God, relationships with family and friends) than those who used negative religious coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = KI | last2 = Ishler | first2 = K | last3 = Dubow | first3 = EF | display-authors = etal | year = 1994 | title = Methods of religious coping with the Gulf War: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses | url = | journal = J Sci Study Relig | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 347–361 | doi=10.2307/1386494| jstor = 1386494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Muslims were another highly studied group after the attacks. Results in this area align with previous research, showing that positive religious coping is associated with posttraumatic growth, while negative religious coping predicted higher levels of depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abu-Raiya | first1 = H. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | last3 = Mahoney | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks | url = | journal = Psychology of Religion and Spirituality | volume = 3| issue = | pages = 1–14| doi = 10.1037/a0020034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of a loved one===

Individuals deal with the death of significant people in their lives in a variety of ways. One of the most common ways that Americans deal with the death of a loved one is by turning to religion. Although most psychologists would argue that religious coping leads to positive outcomes, some research identifies that coping using religious can lead to greater amounts of distress, especially in dealing with the loss of a family member due to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Vardaman | first2 = P. J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of religion in coping with the loss of a family member to homicide | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 44–51 | doi = 10.2307/1387881 | jstor = 1387881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research recognized that the role of attachment to God is very important in determining how successful religious coping will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ungureanu | first1 = I. | last2 = Sandberg | first2 = J. G. | year = 2010 | title = Broken together": Spirituality and religion as coping strategies for couples dealing with the death of a child: A literature review with clinical implications | url = | journal = Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 302–319 | doi = 10.1007/s10591-010-9120-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that secure attachment to God and a positive religious coping style is positively correlated with stress related growth, positive religious outcomes, and a developed sense of meaning. Anxious and avoidant attachments to God and negative religious coping styles were positively correlated with depression, traumatic distress, and separation distress. Furthermore, attachment to God was strongly more correlated to positive outcomes than attachment to others.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, M. M. (2003, April). Bereavement and grief related to a significant death: A psychological and theological study of attachment styles and religious coping. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A, 63,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-death experiences===

[[Near-death experiences]] (NDEs) provide a unique opportunity for psychologists to study the way in which people cope with their own death. NDEs generally trigger an out-of-body experience into a realm populated with spiritual beings and have the potential to shape American attitudes toward death in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwilecki | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Religion and Coping: A Contribution from Religious Studies | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 477–489 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00250.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys show that five percent of Americans have a NDE, which presents a limited field to study.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L. W. and J. Yates. (1996.) Introduction. In the near-death experience: A reader, edited by L. W. Bailey and J. Yates, pp. 1–23. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, people who have NDEs report positive outcomes including reduced anxiety, increased capacity to love, and a higher sense of meaning and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Atwater, P. M. H. (1994). Beyond the light: The mysteries and revelations of near-death experiences. New York: Avon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have NDEs often fall into Pargament's category of transformative coping. In these cases, the person is transformed into a whole new way of life and way of thinking by one supernatural experience.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using religious coping in school and work ==

=== MindUP Initiative ===
Twelve years ago Goldie Hawn founded MindUP: a mindfulness based initiative to help students in schools deal with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, E. (2015, Feb 17). Can 'mindfulness' help students do better in school? advocates say the meditation technique raises focus and lowers stress. critics see religion in disguise. Wall Street Journal (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; The program has since been implemented in schools in 28 states, and has locations in Canada, China, Serbia, Australia, and Venezuela. The program invites students to participate in 15 lessons based on neuroscience. Kimberly Schonert-Reichl an employee of MindsUP and of the University of British Columbia evaluated the effectiveness of MindUP on students grades 4 through 5. Her findings are shown below:

* 82% of children reported having a more positive outlook
* 81% of children learned to make themselves happy
* 58% of children tried to help others more often

Even though MindUP has had very positive effects skeptics call it religion in disguise. They claim that the mindfulness exercises such as "belly breaths" are [[Buddhist]] practices as a different name. In some states MindUP has been removed from schools because schools are supposed to be secular and non-religious.

===Religion as buffer in the workplace===
A study was conducted by Dr Roxane Gervais, a senior psychologist at the Health and Safety Laboratory in Stockport.&lt;ref&gt;Religion forms buffer against work stress. (2014, Jan 09). Telegraph.Co.Uk&lt;/ref&gt; She found that people who were more actively religious were more likely to report low levels of anxiety, depression and fatigue and also felt a higher presence of meaning in life. These people also took less sick days. She concluded that employers should accommodate time for employees to engage in religious beliefs while at work in order to improve performance.

==Religious coping in clinical settings==
Despite the problems encountered when studying religion as a coping mechanism, much research suggests that using it in intervention settings when applicable may be beneficial. For example, according to a study be Wachholtz and Pargament, when identified religious people suffering from splitting migraines were exposed to meditations with religious or non-religious content, they reported less pain after the religious meditations. Such "psychospiritual" methods have been utilized for a while, although their applications are limited and specific from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion vs. spirituality==
Research in the psychology of religion often reveals different outcomes between [[religion]] and [[spirituality]]. A person's religion is a collection of belief systems and moral values, often established by a governing institution. Religion is generally more traditional, organized, and sociological. Religion is considered to be more formal and upheld than spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality, on the other hand, is a measure of one's intrinsic relationship with their God. Spirituality is viewed and studied as being more free-formed and psychological. Also, spirituality is considered to be a private experience that promotes a process of growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the psychology of coping with trauma, religion and spirituality can play very different roles. Some research shows that religion, but not spirituality can help with coping,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Tomas. (2012). Religion, but not spirituality, helps protect against post-earthquake trauma. Epiphenom.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other shows that intrinsic spirituality can be a very effective style of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vespa | first1 = A. | last2 = Jacobsen | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Spazzafumo | first3 = L. | last4 = Balducci | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Evaluation of intrapsychic factors, coping styles, and spirituality of patients affected by tumors | url = | journal = Psycho-Oncology | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 5–11 | doi = 10.1002/pon.1719 | pmid = 20336646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences found between religious and spiritual coping may be further evidence of the role of attachment styles and types of coping used. Through religious and spiritual coping, individuals can derive support from a divine being, from other members of a religious congregation, and from making meaning of distressing events, which can lead to the promotion of resilience, healing, and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with studying religious coping==
Studying religion as a coping mechanism has proved a difficult task for psychologists. Religion seems to be an integral part of some people's lives but not of others, so specialists cannot be certain whether religion is the variable to study or if there is something about religious people that makes them religious that is worth studying. Many studies only measure the frequency of certain "religious" activities including prayer or religious service attendance; however, just because a person exhibits religious behavior does not mean that he or she uses his or her religion to cope or even adheres to the set of beliefs that constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–480|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research done on religion and coping has been isolated to Christianity. Studies are being conducted to accommodate for the diversity of religions and their differences among cultures.

Many studies on the subject show contrary results. For example, some psychologists conclude that religiosity has no positive or negative outcomes at all and others cite that any form of religious coping has ultimately negative effects. These results may be a product of the inconsistencies in the ways that religion is studied as a coping mechanism or could reflect biases of researchers toward a certain religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SAE Institute''' ('''SAE''', formerly also known as the '''School of Audio Engineering''' and the '''SAE Technology College''') is a private college founded in 1976 by [[sound engineer]], record producer and businessman Tom Misner. The first school was opened 1977 in Sydney.

SAE Institute offers courses in [[audio engineering]], 3D animation, [[multimedia]], [[graphic design]], [[game design]], digital filmmaking, and music production. It currently has campuses and facilities, including licensed [[franchising|franchise]] operations, in 54 cities in 30 countries.

==History==
SAE was established by Tom Misner in 1976 in Sydney, converting a small advertising studio into a classroom. Over the next six years, campuses in [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] were established. In the mid-1980s, SAE began opening colleges outside of Australia, including locations in London, [[Munich]], Frankfurt, [[Vienna]], Berlin, [[Auckland]], and [[Glasgow]]. In the 1990s, SAE opened a European head office in [[Amsterdam]], and locations were opened in Paris, Hamburg, [[Zürich]], [[Hobart]], [[Cologne]], Stockholm, and [[Milan]]. SAE also began expanding into Asia in the 1990s, opening locations in Singapore and [[Kuala Lumpur]]. In the late 1990s, SAE formed the SAE Entertainment Company and launched full university degree programs with the co-operation of [[Southern Cross University]] and [[Middlesex University]]. In 1999, SAE began opening facilities in the United States, and over the following decade opened locations in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Miami, San Francisco, [[Atlanta]], Los Angeles, and Chicago. In 2000, SAE began licensing [[Franchising|franchise]] schools in [[India]], opening four that year. In 2000s, locations were opened in [[Liverpool]], Madrid, [[Brussels]], [[Bangkok]], Leipzig, [[Barcelona]], [[Dubai]], [[Amman]], [[Cape Town]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Serbia]]. Licence agreements were signed for new schools in Qatar, Bogotá Colombia , Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In the 2000s SAE also acquired QANTM, an Australian production, media and training company, and relocated its head office to [[Littlemore]] Park, [[Oxford]] and its headquarters to [[Byron Bay]], Australia.

In 2010, the SAE Institute was sold to Navitas, a publicly traded educational services company. Over the next few years, new locations were opened in [[Romania]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Moskhato]]. Navitas began taking over the licensed branches in the US in 2011, and laid off over 40 US employees in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;SAE Employee Discussion Thread, TheLayoff.com [http://www.thelayoff.com/SAE-institute "SAE Institute Layoffs"], TheLayoff.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6438">'''Space environment''' is a branch of [[astronautics]], [[aerospace engineering]] and [[space physics]] that seeks to understand and address conditions existing in space that affect the design and operation of spacecraft. A related subject, [[space weather]], deals with dynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft, but that can also affect the atmosphere, [[ionosphere]] and [[geomagnetic field]], giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies.

Effects on spacecraft can arise from [[radiation]], [[space debris]] and [[meteoroid]] impact, upper [[atmospheric drag]] and [[spacecraft charging|spacecraft electrostatic charging]].

Radiation in space usually comes from three main sources: (i) the [[Van Allen radiation belts]]; (ii) [[solar proton event]]s and [[solar energetic particle]]s; and (iii) galactic [[cosmic rays]]. For long duration missions, the high doses of radiation can damage electronic components and solar cells. A major concern is also radiation-induced "single-event effects" such as [[single event upset]]. Manned missions usually avoid the radiation belts and the [[international space station]] is at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts. During solar energetic events ([[solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejections]]) particles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the Earth in times as short as 30 minutes (but usually take some hours). These particles are mainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage, disruption to logic circuits and even hazards to astronauts. Manned missions to return to the Moon or to travel to Mars will have to deal with the major problems presented by solar particle events to radiation safety, in addition to the important contribution to doses from the low-level background [[cosmic rays]]. In near-Earth orbits, the Earth's [[geomagnetic field]] screens spacecraft from a large part of these hazards - a process called [[geomagnetic shielding]].
Space debris and meteoroids can impact spacecraft at high speeds, causing mechanical or electrical damage.  The average speed of space debris is 10&amp;nbsp;km/s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awhir.com/design/nasa/Meteoroids%2520and%2520Orbital%2520Debris--%2520Effects%2520on%2520Spacecraft%2520rp1408.pdf Meteoroids and Orbital Debris: Effects on Spacecraft (NASA Reference Publication 1408)]&lt;/ref&gt; while the average speed of meteoroids is much greater.  For example, the meteoroids associated with the [[Perseids|Perseid meteor shower]] travel at an average speed of 58&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast09aug99_1/ Here Come the Perseids!]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mechanical damage from debris impacts have been studied through space missions including [[LDEF]], which had over 20,000 documented impacts through its 5.7 year mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/protect/impacts.html Orbital Debris Impacts on Spacecraft]&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical anomalies associated with impact events include [[ESA]]'s Olympus spacecraft, which lost attitude control during the 1993 Perseid meteor shower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympus.html The sad story of Olympus 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011943/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympus.html |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar event occurred with the [[Landsat 5]] spacecraft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=2281 Landsat 5 Experiences Malfunction]&lt;/ref&gt; during the 2009 Perseid meteor shower.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/31jul_perseids2009/ The 2009 Perseid Meteor Shower]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] environment around the Earth. The plasma encountered in the region of the [[geostationary]] orbit becomes heated during geomagnetic [[substorm]]s caused by disturbances in the solar wind. "Hot" electrons (with energies in the kilo-[[electron volt]] range) collect on surfaces of spacecraft and can establish electrostatic potentials of the order of kilovolts. As a result, discharges can occur and are known to be the source of many spacecraft anomalies.

Solutions devised by scientists and engineers include, but are not limited to, spacecraft shielding, special "hardening" of electronic systems, various collision detection systems. Evaluation of effects during spacecraft design includes application of various models of the environment, including radiation belt models, spacecraft-plasma interaction models and atmospheric models to predict drag effects encountered in lower orbits and during reentery.

The field often overlaps with the disciplines of [[astrophysics]], [[atmospheric science]], [[space physics]], and [[geophysics]], albeit usually with an emphasis on application.

The United States government maintains a [[Space Weather Prediction Center]] at [[Boulder, Colorado]].  The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] ([[NOAA]]).  SWPC is one of the [[National Weather Service]]'s (NWS) [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]] (NCEP).

[[Space weather]] effects on Earth can include [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] storms, temporary decreases in [[ozone]] densities, disruption to radio communication, to [[GPS]] signals and submarine positioning. Some scientists also theorize links between [[sunspot]] activity and [[ice age]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16146">In [[computability theory]], '''super-recursive algorithms''' are a generalization of ordinary [[algorithm]]s that are more powerful, that is, compute more than [[Turing machines]]. The term was introduced by Mark Burgin, whose book "Super-recursive algorithms" develops their theory and presents several mathematical models. Turing machines and other mathematical models of conventional algorithms allow researchers to find properties of recursive algorithms and their computations. In a similar way, mathematical models of super-recursive algorithms, such as [[#Inductive Turing machines|inductive Turing machines]], allow researchers to find properties of super-recursive algorithms and their computations.

Burgin, as well as other researchers (including [[Selim Akl]], Eugene Eberbach, Peter Kugel, [[Jan van Leeuwen]], [[Hava Siegelmann]], Peter Wegner, and Jiří Wiedermann) who studied different kinds of super-recursive algorithms and contributed to the theory of super-recursive algorithms, have argued that super-recursive algorithms can be used to disprove the [[Church-Turing thesis]], but this point of view has been criticized within the mathematical community and is not widely accepted.

== Definition ==

Burgin (2005: 13) uses the term '''recursive algorithms''' for [[algorithm]]s that can be implemented on Turing machines, and uses the word ''algorithm'' in a more general sense. Then a '''super-recursive class of algorithms''' is "a class of algorithms in which it is possible to compute functions not computable by any [[Turing machine]]" (Burgin 2005: 107).

Super-recursive algorithms are closely related to [[hypercomputation]] 
in a way similar to the relationship between ordinary computation and ordinary algorithms. Computation is a process, while an algorithm is a finite constructive description of such a process. Thus a super-recursive algorithm defines a "computational process (including processes of input and output) that cannot be realized by recursive algorithms." (Burgin 2005: 108). A more restricted definition demands that  [[hypercomputation]] solves a [[supertask]] (see Copeland 2002; Hagar and Korolev 2007).

Super-recursive algorithms are also related to '''algorithmic schemes''', which are more general than super-recursive algorithms. Burgin argues (2005: 115) that it is necessary to make a clear distinction between super-recursive algorithms and those algorithmic schemes that are not algorithms. Under this distinction, some types of hypercomputation are obtained by super-recursive algorithms, e.g., inductive Turing machines, while other types of hypercomputation are directed by algorithmic schemas, e.g., infinite time Turing machines. This explains how works on super-recursive algorithms are related to hypercomputation and vice versa. According to this argument, super-recursive algorithms are just one way of defining a hypercomputational process.

== Examples ==

Examples of super-recursive algorithms include (Burgin 2005: 132):
* '''limiting recursive functions''' and '''limiting partial recursive functions''' (E.M. Gold 1965)
* '''trial and error predicates''' (Hilary Putnam 1965) 
* '''inductive inference machines''' (Carl Smith)
* '''inductive Turing machines''', which perform computations similar to computations of [[Turing machines]] and produce their results after a finite number of steps (Mark Burgin)
* '''limit Turing machines''', which perform computations similar to computations of Turing machines but their final results are limits of their intermediate results (Mark Burgin)
*  '''trial-and-error machines''' (Ja. Hintikka and A. Mutanen 1998)
* '''[[#Schmidhuber's generalized Turing machines|general Turing machines]]''' (J. Schmidhuber)
* '''Internet machines''' ([[Jan van Leeuwen|van Leeuwen, J.]] and Wiedermann, J.)
* '''evolutionary computers''', which use DNA to produce the value of a function (Darko Roglic)
* '''fuzzy computation''' (Jirí Wiedermann 2004)
* '''evolutionary Turing machines''' (Eugene Eberbach 2005)

Examples of algorithmic schemes include:

* '''Turing machines with arbitrary oracles''' (Alan Turing)
* '''Transrecursive operators''' (Borodyanskii and Burgin)
* '''machines that compute with real numbers''' (L. Blum, F. Cucker, M. Shub, and S. Smale 1998)
* '''neural networks based on real numbers''' (Hava Siegelmann 1999)

For examples of practical '''super-recursive algorithms''', see the book of Burgin.

== Inductive Turing machines ==

'''Inductive Turing machines''' implement an important class of super-recursive algorithms. An inductive Turing machine is a definite list of well-defined instructions for completing a task which, when given an initial state, will proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually giving the final result. The difference between an inductive Turing machine and an ordinary [[Turing machine]] is that an ordinary Turing machine must stop when it has obtained its result, while in some cases an inductive Turing machine can continue to compute after obtaining the result, without stopping. Kleene called procedures that could run forever without stopping by the name ''calculation procedure or algorithm'' (Kleene 1952:137). Kleene also demanded that such an algorithm must eventually exhibit "some object" (Kleene 1952:137). Burgin argues that this condition is satisfied by inductive Turing machines, as their results are exhibited after a finite number of steps. The reason that inductive Turing machines cannot be instructed to halt when their final output is produced is that in some cases inductive Turing machines may not be able to tell at which step the result has been obtained.

Simple inductive Turing machines are equivalent to other models of computation such as general Turing machines of Schmidhuber, trial and error predicates of Hilary Putnam, limiting partial recursive functions of Gold, and trial-and-error machines of Hintikka and Mutanen (1998). More advanced inductive Turing machines are much more powerful. There are hierarchies of inductive Turing machines that can decide membership in arbitrary sets of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] (Burgin 2005). In comparison with other equivalent models of computation, simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines give direct constructions of computing automata that are thoroughly grounded in physical machines. In contrast, trial-and-error predicates, limiting recursive functions, and limiting partial recursive functions present only syntactic systems of symbols with formal rules for their manipulation. Simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines are related to limiting partial recursive functions and trial-and-error predicates as Turing machines are related to partial recursive functions and lambda calculus.

The non-halting computations of inductive Turing machines should not be confused with infinite-time computations (see, for example, Potgieter 2006). First, some computations of inductive Turing machines do halt. As in the case of conventional Turing machines, some halting computations give the result, while others do not. Even if it does not halt, an inductive Turing machine produces output from time to time. If this output stops changing, it is then considered the result of the computation.

There are two main distinctions between ordinary Turing machines and simple inductive Turing machines. The first distinction is that even simple inductive Turing machines can do much more than conventional Turing machines. The second distinction is that a conventional Turing machine will always determine (by coming to a final state) when the result is obtained, while a simple inductive Turing machine, in some cases (such as when "computing" something that cannot be computed by an ordinary Turing machine), will not be able to make this determination.

== Schmidhuber's generalized Turing machines ==
A symbol sequence is '''computable in the limit''' if there is a finite, possibly non-halting program on a [[universal Turing machine]] that incrementally outputs every symbol of the sequence. This includes the dyadic expansion of &amp;pi; but still excludes most of the real numbers, because most cannot be described by a finite program. Traditional [[Turing machine]]s with a write-only output tape cannot edit their previous outputs; generalized [[Turing machines]], according to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], can edit their output tape as well as their work tape. He defines the constructively describable symbol sequences as those that have a finite, non-halting program running on a generalized Turing machine, such that any output symbol eventually converges, that is, it does not change any more after some finite initial time interval.  Schmidhuber (2000, 2002) uses this approach to define the set of formally describable or constructively computable universes or constructive [[theory of everything|theories of everything]]. Generalized Turing machines and simple inductive Turing machines are two classes of super-recursive algorithms that are the closest to recursive algorithms (Schmidhuber 2000).

== Relation to the Church–Turing thesis ==

The Church–Turing thesis in recursion theory relies on a particular definition of the term ''algorithm''. Based on definitions that are more general than the one commonly used in recursion theory, Burgin argues that super-recursive algorithms, such as '''inductive Turing machines''' disprove the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. He proves furthermore that super-recursive algorithms could theoretically provide even greater efficiency gains than using [[quantum algorithms]].

Burgin's interpretation of super-recursive algorithms has encountered opposition in the mathematical community. One critic is logician [[Martin Davis]], who argues that Burgin's claims have been well understood "for decades". Davis states, 
:"The present criticism is not about the mathematical discussion of these matters but only about the misleading claims regarding physical systems of the present and future."(Davis 2006: 128)
Davis disputes Burgin's claims that sets at level &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_2&lt;/math&gt; of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] can be called computable, saying
:"It is generally understood that for a computational result to be useful one must be able to at least recognize that it is indeed the result sought." (Davis 2006: 128)

'''Synthetic phonics''' (UK) or '''blended phonics''' (US), also known as '''inductive phonics''',&lt;ref name="sedl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Reading Terms - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of teaching reading which first teaches the letter sounds and then builds up to blending these sounds together to achieve full pronunciation of whole words. This article relates to the [[English language]] only.
{{toc limit|3}}

==Overview==

Synthetic phonics refers to a family of programs which aim to teach literacy through the following methods:&lt;ref name="phonicsplay Glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phonicsplay.co.uk/SubjectKnowledge.htm |title=Subject Knowledge: Glossary |work= |accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teaching students the correspondence between graphemes and phonemes.
* Teaching students to read words by '''blending''': identifying the graphemes in the word, recalling the corresponding phonemes, and saying the phonemes together to form the sound of the whole word.
* Teaching students to write words by '''segmenting''': identifying the phonemes of the word, recalling the corresponding graphemes, then writing the graphemes together to form the written word.

Synthetic phonics programs have some or all of the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="vanderbilt Phonics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://my.vanderbilt.edu/specialeducationinduction/files/2011/09/1-Literacy-teaching-guide-phonics.pdf |title=Literacy teaching guide: Phonics |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teaching grapheme-phoneme correspondence out of alphabetic order, following an order determined by perceived complexity (going from easiest to hardest to learn).
* Teaching the reading and writing of words in order of increasing irregularity, teaching words which follow typical grapheme-phoneme correspondence first, and teaching words with idiosyncratic or unusual grapheme-phoneme correspondence later.

Synthetic phonics programs do not have the following characteristics:
* Encouraging students to guess the meaning of words from contextual clues (see [[whole language]] method). 
* Encouraging students to memorise the shape of words, to recall them by sight (see [[Look say]] method). 
* Teaching grapheme-phoneme correspondence on an ad-hoc basis and as applied to particular groups of words, when these words arise in other forms of reading instruction (see embedded phonics).

==Methodology==

Synthetic [[phonics]] teaches the [[phoneme]]s (sounds) associated with the [[grapheme]]s (letters) at the rate of about six sounds per week. The sounds are taught in isolation then blended together (i.e. synthesised), all-through-the-word. For example, learners might be taught a short [[vowel sound]] (e.g. /a/) in addition to some [[consonant]] sounds (e.g. /s/, /t/, /p/). Then the learners are taught words with these sounds (e.g. sat, pat, tap, at). They are taught to pronounce each phoneme in a word, then to blend the phonemes together to form the word (e.g. /s/ - /a/ - /t/; "sat"). Sounds are taught in all positions of the words, but the emphasis is on all-through-the-word segmenting and blending from week one. It does not teach whole words as shapes ([[Sight words|initial sight vocabulary]]) prior to learning the alphabetic code.

Synthetic phonics develops [[phonemic awareness]] along with the corresponding letter shapes. It involves the learners rehearsing the writing of letter shapes alongside learning the letter/s-sound correspondences preferably with the tripod pencil grip. [[Dictation (exercise)|Dictation]] is a frequent teaching technique from letter level to word spelling, including [[pseudoword|nonsense word]]s (e.g. choy and feep)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/spr/pdf/spr373fien.pdf |title=Using Nonsense Word Fluency to Predict Reading Proficiency in Kindergarten Through Second Grade for English Children and Native English Speakers |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrneFielding-Barnsley1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Brian|last2=Fielding-Barnsley|first2=Ruth|title=Evaluation of a program to teach phonemic awareness to young children.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=83|issue=4|year=1991|pages=451–455|issn=1939-2176|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.451}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually extending to [[Written language|text]] level. It does not teach letter names until the learners know their letter/s-sound correspondences thoroughly and how to blend for reading and [[segment (linguistics)|segment]] for spelling. Often when letter names are introduced it is through singing an alphabet song.

Synthetic phonics teaches phonics at the level of the individual phoneme from the outset; not [[syllable]]s and not [[Syllable onset#Onset|onset]] and [[Syllable rhyme|rime]]. Synthetic phonics does not teach anything about reading as a meaning-focused process. It highlights decoding and pronunciation of words only. Teachers are to put accuracy before speed, because [[fluency]] (i.e. speed, accuracy,expression, and comprehension) will come with time.&lt;ref name="nichd findings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/reading/reading.pdf |title=Ontario Early Reading Strategy 2003 |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic phonics involves the teaching of the transparent alphabet (e.g. /k/ as in "cat") before progressing onto the opaque alphabet (e.g. /k/ as in "school"). In other words, learners are taught steps which are straightforward and 'work' before being taught the complications and variations of [[pronunciation]] and [[spelling]] of the full alphabetic code. It introduces irregular words and more tricky words (defined as words which cannot be pronounced phonically – English has a surprisingly large number of these, usually the commonest words of all such as 'to', 'of', etc.) slowly and systematically after a thorough introduction of the transparent alphabet code (learning the 44 letter/s-sound correspondences to [[automaticity]] and how to blend for reading and segment for spelling). Phonics application still works at least in part in such words.

Synthetic phonics involves a heavy emphasis on hearing the sounds all-through-the-word for spelling and not an emphasis on "look, cover, write, check".  This latter, visual form of spelling plays a larger part with unusual spellings and spelling variations although a phonemic procedure is always emphasised in spelling generally.  Teachers read a full range of literature with the learners and ensure that all learners have a full range of experience of activities associated with literacy such as [[role play]], [[drama]], [[poetry]], but the learners are not expected to 'read' text which is beyond them, and the method does not involve guessing at words from context, picture and initial letter clues.

*learning letter sounds (as distinct from the letter names);
:For example, mmm not em, sss not es, fff not ef. The letter names can be taught later but should not be taught in the early stages.
*learning the 40+ sounds and their corresponding letters/letter groups;

==Systematic phonics==
'''Systematic phonics''' is not one specific method of teaching phonics; rather, it is a family of phonics instruction that includes the methods of both synthetic phonics and analytical phonics. They are "systematic" because the letters, and the sounds they relate to, are taught in a specific sequence; as opposed to incidentally or on a 'when-needed' basis. However, it should be noted that, in most instances, the term systematic phonics appears to refer to synthetic phonics because of the specific instruction methods it uses. (In the United Kingdom, the term "systematic phonics" is "generally understood as synthetic phonics" according to the reading review which was conducted in 2006.&lt;ref name="UK Gov PDF-EN-01"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006PDF-EN-01.pdf |title=Independent review of the teaching of early reading |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Systematic phonics does ''not'' include methods such as ''embedded phonics'' and ''phonics mini lessons'' which are found in [[Whole language|the ''Whole Language'' approach]] and the [[Balanced Literacy|''Balanced Literacy'' approach]].

===Analytical phonics===
'''[[Analytical phonics]]''' practitioners do not teach learners to pronounce sounds "in isolation" as is the practice with Synthetic Phonics. Furthermore, consonant blends (separate, adjacent consonant phonemes) are taught as units (e.g., in the word 'shrouds' the shr would be taught as a unit). Some analytical phonics programs (referred to as analogy phonics) teach learners to break-down words into their common components which are referred to as the "onset" and the "rime". In the word "ship", "sh" is the "onset"  and "ip" is the "rime" (the part starting with the vowel). In other words, analytical phonics teaches the learner to say /sh/ - /ip/ (ship) and /sh/ - /op/ (shop), whereas synthetic phonics, teaches the learner to say /sh/ - /i/ - /p/ (ship) and /sh/ - /o/ - /p/ (shop). In analytical phonics, learners are also taught to find the similarities among words (e.g. man, can, tan, fan, and ran), whereas synthetic phonics devotes most of its time to learning the letter/sound relationships (i.e. grapheme/phoneme).

===Synthetic phonics===
Synthetic Phonics uses the concept of 'synthesising', which means 'putting together' or 'blending'. Simply put, the sounds prompted by the letters are synthesised (put together or blended) to pronounce the word.&lt;ref name="sedl"/&gt;

==Common terminology==
Some common terminology used within this article includes:
*'''alphabetic code''' (in synthetic phonics): The relationship between sounds (phonemes) and the letter/s (graphemes) that represent them are referred to as a "code". For example, the sound /ay/ can be represented in many ways (e.g. cake, may, they, eight, aid, break, etc.).&lt;ref name="NELP 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lincs.ed.gov/publications/pdf/NELPReport09.pdf |title=Developing Early Literacy |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Alphabetic principle]]
*'''decoding skills''' (in phonics): Without the use of context, to pronounce and '''read''' words accurately by using the relationship between the letter(s) and the sounds they represent. (i.e. "cat" is /k/-/a/-/t/, "plough" is /p/-/l/-/ow/, and "school" is /s/-/k/-/oo/-/l/. "Encoding skills" (i.e. '''spelling''') is the same process in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/springsummer1998/moats.pdf |title=Teaching Decoding 1998|format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Direct instruction]]''' (also known as Explicit Instruction ): A teaching style that is characterized by "carefully designed instruction" that usually includes a fast pace, small steps, demonstrations, active participation, coaching, immediate correction, and positive feedback.&lt;ref name="dest AU Gov"/&gt; (Pg. 85)
*'''intensive instruction''': teaching or tutoring that include some of the following: more time; peer-assisted strategies; and instruction in small groups or one-on-one.&lt;ref name="bestevidence 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestevidence.org/word/strug_read_Jun_02_2010.pdf |title=Effective Programs for Struggling Readers 2010|format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pg. 209)
*'''[[Supplemental Instruction|peer-assisted literacy strategies]]''': learners work in pairs (taking turns as teacher and learner) to learn a "structured sequence" of literacy skills, such as phonemic awareness, phonics, sound blending, passage reading, and story retelling.&lt;ref name="bestevidence 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestevidence.org/word/begin_read_Jun_23_2009.pdf |title=Effective Programs for Struggling Readers 2009 |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pg. 33)
*'''supportive instruction''': teaching or tutoring that supports the student both emotionally and cognitively. This includes encouragement, immediate feedback, positive reinforcement, and [[instructional scaffolding]] (i.e. clear structure, small steps, guiding with questions).&lt;ref name="bestevidence 2010"/&gt; (Pg. 209)

==History==
The teaching of reading and writing has varied over the years from [[spelling]] and [[phonetic]] methods to the fashions for [[look-say]] and [[whole language]] methods. In America in the eighteenth century, [[Noah Webster]] introduced spelling approaches with syllabaries and in England the use of [[James Pitman]]'s [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]] was popular in the 1960s. Recently phonic methods have been revived.

===Australia===
In December 2005 the Department of Education, Science and Training of the Australian Government published a report entitled a National Inquiry into the Teaching of Reading.&lt;ref name="dest AU Gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf |title=Teaching Reading |format=PDF |work=Australian Government Department of Education, Science and Training. |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024503/http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommends direct and systematic instruction in phonics as the foundation of early reading instruction. Some of the findings (not always supported by reliable evidence){{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} are:

* Among the successful schools visited, there were a number of key similarities. Three of those similarities are:
:# a belief that each child can learn to read and write regardless of background;
:# an early, systematic, and "explicit" (i.e. specific and clear) teaching of phonics;
:#the phonics instruction was followed by "direct teaching".
* Students learn best from an approach that includes phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary knowledge and comprehension. (Executive Summary)
* A whole-language approach, "on its own, is not in the best interests of children, particularly those experiencing reading difficulties". (Pg. 12)
* Where there is unsystematic or no phonics instruction, children do not perform as well in such areas as reading accuracy, fluency, writing, spelling and comprehension. (Pg. 12)
* A recommendation that teachers provide "systematic, direct and explicit phonics instruction".(Pg. 14)

===Canada===

In Canada, public education is the responsibility of the Provincial and Territorial governments.  There is no evidence that ''systematic phonics (including synthetic phonics)'' has been specifically adopted by any of these jurisdictions. However, the curriculum of all of the Canadian provinces include most or all of the following: phonics, phonological awareness, segmenting and blending, decoding, phonemic awareness, graphophonic cues, and letter-sound relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/teach/curriculum	|title=British Columbia Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.alberta.ca/k-12-education.aspx	|title=Alberta Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edonline.sk.ca/webapps/moe-curriculum-BBLEARN/CurriculumHome?id=28	|title=Saskachewan Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/cur/ela/docs/outcomes/index.html	|title=Manitoba Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/language.html|title=Ontario Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/site_web/documents/PFEQ/educprg2001-051.pdf|title=Quebec Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/education/k12/content/anglophone_sector/curriculum_anglophone.html|title=New Brunswick Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/education-early-learning-and-culture/language-arts-curriculum|title=Prince Edward Island Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ednet.ns.ca/files/curriculum/AYRP-3-RAR.pdf|title=Nova Scotia Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov.nl.ca/edu/k12/curriculum/guides/index.html|title=Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, systematic phonics and synthetic phonics received attention in the following publications:

* In 2005 the Ministry of Education for the government of [[Ontario]] published a report entitled ''Early Reading Strategy: The Report of the Expert Panel on Early Reading in Ontario and Early Math Strategy:''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oafccd.com/documents/educationforall.pdf  |title=Early Reading Strategy - The Report of the Expert Panel on early Reading in Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states "This Expert Panel supports the position of the National Reading Panel (2000) that phonics instruction should be integrated into a comprehensive and balanced reading program. Instruction in phonics and decoding should not be conceived of as a total reading program, but neither should it be neglected." Pg 104
* In 2009, the Ministry of Education for the province of [[British Columbia]] posted a discussion paper on their Read Now website entitled ''Reading: Breaking Through the Barriers.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readnowbc.ca/assets/pdfs/k12/reading_breaking_through_the_barriers.pdf |title=Reading: Breaking Through the Barriers A Discussion Guide |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper states that explicit and synthetic phonics needs to be taught directly in the classroom because it works "for all students but are particularly helpful for students at risk for reading difficulty".  (Pg. 8) There appears to be no evidence, however, that systematic phonics (or synthetic phonics) is a part of the teaching pedagogy.
* Dr. Robert Savage, formerly of [[McGill University]] and now at [[UCL Institute of Education]], [[University College London]], concludes that, with respect to remedial programs, we should not wait for children to fail before using phonics programs. He also recommends the teaching of such skills as segmenting and blending alongside the [[Direct instruction|"explicit teaching"]] of letter sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literacyencyclopedia.ca/index.php?fa=items.show&amp;topicId=247 |title=Word Reading Instruction Methods: The Evidence Concerning Phonics |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also says there is a need for more [[Randomized controlled trial]]s in order to produce more definitive conclusions.

===United Kingdom===
A review of the teaching of early reading was undertaken by Sir Jim Rose at the request of the [[Department for Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006pdf-EN-01.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006pdf-EN-01.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-01 |title=Independent review of the teaching of early reading |format=PDF |year=2006|accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the report often uses the term "''Systematic'' Phonic work", it appears to support "''Synthetic'' Phonics" as evidenced in the Rose Review.  In fact, the Department of Education, England uses the term "systematic synthetic phonics". The following is a summary of the report's observations and recommendations concerning phonics:
#The skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing are used by (and are supported by) what it refers to as "high quality, systematic phonics".
#Young children should receive sufficient pre-reading instruction so they are able to start systematic phonics work "by the age of five".
#High quality phonics work should be taught as "the prime approach" to teaching reading, writing, and spelling.
#Phonics instruction should form a part of "a broad and rich language curriculum". Note: critics of this report point out that the report does not explain what they mean by this, nor does it offer any details on how to achieve this within the framework of synthetic phonics' instruction.

====Critics of the report====
* In a report dated April 2007,&lt;ref name="Wyse, Styles, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyse|first1=Dominic|last2=Styles|first2=Morag|title=Synthetic phonics and the teaching of reading: the debate surrounding England's ?Rose Report? |journal=Literacy |volume=41|issue=1 |year=2007|pages=35–42|issn=1741-4350|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9345.2007.00455.x |url=http://www.edalive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/RoseEnquiryPhonicsPaperUKLA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; professors Dominic Wyse&lt;ref name="Wyse, Goswami, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyse|first1=Dominic |last2=Goswami |first2=Usha |title=Synthetic phonics and the teaching of reading|journal=British Educational Research Journal|volume=34|issue=6 |year=2008 |pages=691–710|issn=0141-1926|doi=10.1080/01411920802268912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioe.ac.uk/staff/EYPE/59721.html |title=Professor Dominic Wyse |work=Institute of Education University of London |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Morag Styles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/styles/ |title= Morag Styles |format= |work=Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that the evidence "supports" systematic phonics; however, the Rose Report's assertion that synthetic phonics should be the "preferred method" is "not supported by research evidence".  This criticism is based on the way the research was conducted and how the results were interpreted.&lt;ref name="Wyse, Styles, 2007"/&gt;
* In October 2011, The ''National Campaign for Real Nursery Education'' web site (U.K.) comments on the U.K. government's intent to impose a specific type of phonics teaching (i.e. systematic, synthetic phonics) in the nursery and reception years, and suggests that this decision was not supported by the "research evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncne.co.uk/|title=National Campaign for Nursery Education and Childrens Rights and Needs|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919060517/http://www.ncne.co.uk/|archivedate=2011-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developments following the Rose Review====

* Following the adoption of the phonics approach in its schools, the Department of Education, England provided a great deal of online support for teachers wishing to learn more.
* In March 2011 the Department of Education, England released its White paper entitled "The Importance of Teaching". In the Executive Summary, item 12 of the curriculum section states their commitment to support "systematic synthetic phonics, as the best method for teaching reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/schoolswhitepaper/b0068570/the-importance-of-teaching/executive-summary/curriculum |title=Curriculum, assessment and qualifications (2012) |format= |work=Department of Education, England |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS 2016) report was released in December 2017. It reports on the reading abilities of students aged 9 and 10 in 50 countries, and shows that England has risen to Joint 8th place in 2016; its best since 2001. This confirms "that our approach is working", according to Minister Nick Gibb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/12/04/phonics-revolution-reading-standards-england-best-generation/ | title= Telegraph 2017/12/04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PIRLS 2016 has a summary of England's Language/Reading Curriculum in the Fourth Grade that shows the increased emphasis on "phonic knowledge and skills as the route to decode words until automatic decoding has become embedded and reading is fluent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/encyclopedia/countries/england/languagereading-curriculum-in-the-fourth-grade/ |title=England's language reading curriculum in the fourth grade}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016 the London School of Economics published a paper that supports the teaching of synthetic phonics to disadvantaged children because it helps to close the literacy gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/25/phonics-method-helps-close-attainment-gap-study-finds|title=Phonics helps to close the attainment gap:The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1425.pdf|title=Teaching to teach literacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
[[Education Scotland]] found that explicit, systematic phonics programs, usually embedded in a rich literacy environment, give an additional four months progress over other programs such as whole language, and are particularly beneficial for young learners (aged 4–7). There is evidence, though less secure, that synthetic phonics programs may be more beneficial than [[analytical phonics]] programs; however it is more important to systematically teach to the children's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://education.gov.scot/improvement/pages/EEF-Toolkit-Results.aspx?911459f09ef0012d8e7c32f03e32d003d881d45febd1eba332753219e922d8f5|title=National Improvement Hub:Phonics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic phonics in Scotland has its roots in the Clackmannanshire Report, a seven-year study that was published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2005/02/20682/52383|title=Insight: A Seven Year Study of the Effects of Synthetic Phonics Teaching on Reading and Spelling Attainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the report claim that the results were exaggerated and due to more than just synthetic phonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://reclaimingschools.org/2016/06/04/the-scottish-phonics-miracle-myths-and-evidence/|title=The Scottish phonics miracle, myths and evidence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States has a long history of debate concerning the various methods used to teach reading, including [[Phonics]]. In 1999, The [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|''National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'']] (NICHD) appears to conclude that systematic phonics programs are "significantly more effective" than non-phonics programs. It also concludes that they found no significant difference between the different phonics approaches, while suggesting that more evidence may be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/upload/ch2-II.pdf |title=Phonics Instruction |format=pdf |work=National Reading Panel |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NICHD has come out in support of phonics instruction. The institute conducts and supports research on all stages of human development. The institute conducted a [[meta-analysis]] and, in 2000 it published a report entitled ''Report of the [[National Reading Panel]]: Teaching Children to Read''.&lt;ref name="nichd findings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/nrp|title=NICHD Archive January 2018, National Reading Panel Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''findings and determinations'' of this report are:

*Teaching [[phonemic awareness| phonemic awareness(PA)]] to children was "highly effective" with a variety of children under a variety of conditions. (Note: Phonemic Awareness/PA is the ability to manipulate [[phoneme]]s in spoken [[syllable]]s and words. Phonemes are the smallest units composing spoken language. For example, the words "go" and "she" each consist of two sounds or phonemes, /g/-/oe/ and /sh/-/ee/.)
*Reading instruction that taught PA improved the children's reading ability significantly more than those that lacked this instruction.
*PA helped normally achieving children to spell, but was not effective in helping disabled readers to spell better.
*"Systematic synthetic phonics" instruction had a positive and significant effect on helping disabled readers, low achieving students, and students with low socioeconomic status to read words more effectively than instruction methods that lacked this approach.
*Systematic Phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell. Poor readers experienced a small improvement in spelling.

Other findings of this report are:

* Guided Oral Reading (reading out loud and receiving systematic and explicit feedback from a teacher) "had a significant and positive impact on word recognition, fluency, and comprehension".
* The value of Independent Silent Reading is unclear; however it is clear that it should not be the only type of reading instruction to develop fluency and other reading skills.
* Vocabulary, both oral and print, should be taught directly and indirectly because it leads to gains in comprehension.
* Teaching a combination of reading comprehension techniques is the most effective, however more research is needed to determine which techniques are the most effective.

In 2014 the California Department of Education stated "Ensuring that children know how to decode regularly spelled one-syllable words by mid-first grade is crucial". It goes on to say that "Children need to be phonemically aware (especially able to segment and blend phonemes)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter3.pdf|title= English–Language Arts, Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 1, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills of segmenting and blending phonemes are a central aspect of synthetic phonics. In grades two and three children receive explicit instruction in advanced phonic-analysis and reading multi-syllabic and more complex words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter4.pdf|title= English–Language Arts, Pedagogy Grades Two and Three, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the New York State Public School system began a process to revise its English Language Arts Learning Standards. The new standards call for teaching involving "reading or literacy experiences" as well as [[phonemic awareness]] from prekindergarten to grade 1 and phonics and word recognition from grade 1 to grade 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.engageny.org/resource/new-york-state-next-generation-english-language-arts-learning-standards|title=2015 New York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Ohio Legislature set minimum standards requiring the use of phonics as a technique in teaching reading. It includes guidelines for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Operating-Standards/Table-of-Contents/Instruction/Phonics|title=Rules for Phonics, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Early-Learning/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee-District-Resources/Approved-List-of-Research-Based-Reading-Instructio/Reading_Competencies.pdf.aspx|title=Reading Competencies, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Literacy/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee-Teacher-Resources|title=Third grade reading guarantee, Ohio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the military and in [[shooting]], '''target practice''' are exercises in which weapons are shot at a target. The purpose of such exercises is to improve the aim or the weapons handling expertise of the person firing the weapon.

Targets being shot at for practice include:
* with [[hand guns]]: [[shooting target]]s,
* by [[air force]]s or [[air defense]] forces: [[target drone]]s and [[target tug]]s,
* by [[navy|navies]]: [[seaborne target]]s.

In [[scientific visualization]] a '''tensor glyph''' is an object that can visualize all or most of the nine degrees of freedom, such as [[acceleration]], twist, or [[shear matrix|shear]] – of a &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix. It is used for [[tensor field]] visualization, where a data-matrix is available at every point in the grid. "Glyphs, or icons, depict multiple data values by mapping them onto the shape, size, orientation, and surface appearance of a base geometric primitive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/papers/vissym04/vissym04kindlmann.pdf | title=Superquadric Tensor Glyphs | work=Joint EUROGRAPHICS – IEEE TCVG Symposium on Visualization (2004) | year=2004 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Kindlmann, Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensor glyphs are a particular case of multivariate data [[Glyph (data visualization)|glyphs]].

There are certain types of glyphs that are commonly used:
* Ellipsoid
* Cuboid
* Cylindrical
* [[Superquadrics]]

According to Thomas Schultz and [[Gordon Kindlmann]], specific types of tensor fields "play a central role in scientific and biomedical studies as well as in image analysis

The '''U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals''' are seven controversial military training manuals which were declassified by the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1996. In 1997, two additional CIA manuals were declassified in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request filed by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. The manuals in question have been referred to by various media sources as the "torture manuals".&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Arthur | last =Jones |author2=Dorothy Vidulich | date =October 4, 1996 | title =Pentagon admits use of torture manuals: training books used for Latin Americans at Ft.

==Army manuals==
These manuals were prepared by the U.S. military and used between 1987 and 1991 for intelligence training courses at the U.S. Army [[School of the Americas]] (SOA). Some of the material was similar to the older CIA manuals described below.  The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training Teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="bouvier"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Globalization of U.S.-Latin American Relations: Democracy, Intervention, and Human Rights| author = Virginia Marie Bouvier | year = 2002 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | page = 132 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xFtVfpcFYuMC&amp;pg=PA132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "abu"&gt;{{cite journal | first =James | last =Hodge | authorlink = |author2=Linda  Cooper | date =November 5, 2004 | title =Roots of Abu Ghraib in CIA techniques | journal =[[National Catholic Reporter]] | url =http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/110504/110504a.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113141641/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/110504/110504a.php | archivedate = 2008-01-13 }} &lt;sup&gt;See https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-124862830/roots-of-abu-ghraib-in-cia-techniques-50-years-of Also google the whale.to site.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Gill | first =Lesley | authorlink = | year =2004 | title =The School of the Americas: Military Training and Political Violence in the Americas | publisher =Duke University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sJmPU-9zEPwC&amp;pg=PA49 | isbn =0-8223-3392-9}} p. 49 &lt;br&gt;*{{cite journal | first =Dana | last =Priest| date =September 21, 1996 | title =U.S. Instructed Latins On Executions, Torture; Manuals Used 1982-91, Pentagon Reveals | journal =[[The Washington Post]] | pages =Section: A Pg.

The Pentagon press release accompanying the release stated that a 1991-92 investigation into the manuals concluded that "two dozen short passages in six of the manuals, which total 1169 pages, contained material that either was not or could be interpreted not to be consistent with U.S. policy."

The Latin America Working Group criticized this: "The unstated aim of the manuals is to train Latin American militaries to identify and suppress anti-government movements. Throughout the eleven hundred pages of the manuals, there are few mentions of democracy, human rights, or the rule of law. Instead, the manuals provide detailed techniques for infiltrating social movements, interrogating suspects, surveillance, maintaining military secrecy, recruiting and retaining spies, and controlling the population. While the excerpts released by the Pentagon are a useful and not misleading selection of the most egregious passages, the ones most clearly advocating torture, execution and blackmail, they do not provide adequate insight into the manuals' highly objectionable framework. In the name of defending democracy, the manuals advocate profoundly undemocratic methods."

After this 1992 investigation, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] discontinued the use of the manuals, directed their recovery to the extent practicable, and destroyed the copies in the field.

Soon after, the U.S. Army issued the [[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]] manual, which was used until September 2006, when it was superseded by [[FM 2-22.3, Human Intelligence Collector Operations]].

The first manual, "KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation", dated July 1963, is the source of much of the material in the second manual. KUBARK was a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[cryptonym]] for the CIA itself.&lt;ref name="NSA" /&gt; The [[cryptonym]] KUBARK appears in the title of a 1963 CIA document ''KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation'' which describes [[interrogation]] techniques, including, among other things, "coercive counterintelligence interrogation of resistant sources". &lt;!--cryptonym sentence not sourced--&gt;This is the oldest manual, and describes the use of abusive techniques, as exemplified by two references to the use of electric shock, in addition to use of threats and fear, sensory deprivation, and isolation.&lt;ref name = "NSA"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second manual, "Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983", was used in at least seven U.S. training courses conducted in Latin American countries, including Honduras, between 1982 and 1987. According to a [[Classified information|declassified]] 1989 report prepared for the Senate intelligence committee, the 1983 manual was developed from notes of a CIA interrogation course in Honduras.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

Both manuals deal exclusively with interrogation.&lt;ref name = "inter"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both manuals have an entire chapter devoted to "coercive techniques". These manuals recommend arresting suspects early in the morning by surprise, blindfolding them, and stripping them naked. Suspects should be held incommunicado and should be deprived of any kind of normal routine in eating and sleeping. Interrogation rooms should be windowless, soundproof, dark and without toilets.

The manuals advise that torture techniques can backfire and that the threat of pain is often more effective than pain itself. The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used "to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist." These techniques include prolonged constraint, prolonged exertion, extremes of heat, cold, or moisture, deprivation of food or sleep, disrupting routines, solitary confinement, threats of pain, deprivation of sensory stimuli, hypnosis, and use of drugs or placebos.&lt;ref name = "para"&gt;{{cite web

Between 1984 and 1985, after congressional committees began questioning training techniques being used by the CIA in Latin America, the 1983 manual went through substantial revision. In 1985 a page advising against using coercive techniques was inserted at the front of ''Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual''.  Handwritten changes were also introduced haphazardly into the text. For example, "While we do not stress the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them and the proper way to use them", has been altered to, "While we deplore the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them so that you may avoid them." (p. A-2) But the entire chapter on coercive techniques is still provided with some items crossed out.&lt;ref name = "balt" /&gt;

The same manual states the importance of knowing local laws regarding detention but then notes, "Illegal detention always requires prior HQS [headquarters] approval." (p. B-2)

The two manuals were completely declassified and released to the public in May 2004, and are now available online.&lt;ref name = "NSA" /&gt;

===The 1983 manual and Battalion 3-16===
In 1983, the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983 methods were used by the U.S.-trained Honduran [[Battalion 3-16 (Honduras)|Battalion 3-16]].&lt;ref name="abu"/&gt;

On January 24, 1997, ''KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation'' and ''Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983'' were declassified in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request filed by the [[Baltimore Sun]] in 1994. The Baltimore Sun was investigating "kidnapping, torture and murder" committed by the Honduran Battalion 3-16 death squad. The documents were released only after the Baltimore Sun had threatened to sue the CIA.&lt;ref name = "balt"&gt;{{cite journal

In the June 11 to 18, 1995 four-part series, ''The Baltimore Sun'' printed excerpts of an interview with Florencio Caballero, a former member of Battalion 3-16. Caballero said CIA instructors taught him to discover what his prisoners loved and what they hated, "If a person did not like cockroaches, then that person might be more cooperative if there were cockroaches running around the room"&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt; The methods taught in the 1983 manual and those used by Battalion 3-16 in the early 1980s show unmistakable similarities. In 1983, Caballero attended a CIA "human resources exploitation or interrogation course," according to declassified testimony by [[Richard Stolz]], who was the deputy director for operations at the time, before the June 1988 [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]. The manual advises an interrogator to "manipulate the subject's environment, to create unpleasant or intolerable situations."{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The manual gives the suggestion that prisoners be [[deprived of sleep]] and food, and made to maintain rigid positions, such as standing at attention for long periods. Ines Consuelo Murillo, who spent 78 days in Battalion 3-16's secret jails in 1983, said she was given no food or water for days, and one of her captors entered her room every 10 minutes and poured water over her head to keep her from sleeping.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

The "Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual -- 1983" gives the suggestion that interrogators show the prisoner letters from home to give the prisoner the impression that the prisoner's relatives are in danger or suffering.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

''The Baltimore Sun'' reported that former Battalion 3-16 member Jose Barrera said he was taught interrogation methods by U.S. instructors in 1983: "The first thing we would say is that we know your mother, your younger brother. And better you cooperate, because if you don't, we're going to bring them in and rape them and torture them and kill them." &lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

'''Vaginal flora''' or '''vaginal microbiota''' are the [[microorganisms]] that colonize the [[vagina]].

== Lactobacilli ==
{{update|date=December 2016}}
The primary colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual are of the genus ''[[Lactobacillus]]''.&lt;ref name="doi10.1128/JCM.40.8.2746-2749.2002"/&gt; Since the first description of lactobacilli by Döderlein, lactobacilli have been generally considered the gatekeepers of the vaginal ecosystem. Lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of pathogenic microorganisms, e.g. ''Bacteroides fragilis'',
''Escherichia coli'', ''[[Gardnerella vaginalis]]'', ''Mobiluncus'' spp., ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'', ''Peptostreptococcus anaerobius'', ''P. bivia'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. It is generally accepted that this is achieved mainly through the action of lactic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graver M., Wade J. | year = 2011 | title = The role of acidification in the inhibition of ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' by vaginal lactobacilli during anaerobic growth | url = | journal = Ann.

Malinowska, and P. B. Heczko. 2002. In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis. J. Reprod. Med. 47:41–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, lactobacilli normally help to prevent long-term colonization of the vagina by adhering to vaginal epithelial cells. This usually reduces pathogens from infecting  to the [[vaginal epithelium]].&lt;ref name="Boris"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Boris S., Barbes C. | year = 2000 | title = Role played by lactobacilli in controlling the population of vaginal pathogens | url = | journal = Microb.

Next to lactic acid production and competition for adherence, other antagonistic mechanisms include [[hydrogen peroxide]] (a broad-spectrum antimicrobial) and [[bacteriocin]]s (target-specific antimicrobials) production.&lt;ref name=" Martin1 "&gt;{{cite journal | author = Martin R., Suarez J.

=== The production of lactic acid ===
[[File:Glycogen structure.svg |thumb|100px|Glycogen is the complex form of sugar present in the [[vaginal epithelium]] that is metabolized into lactic acid]]
Low pH is generally accepted to be the main mechanism controlling the composition of the vaginal microflora. Although the lactic acid produced by lactobacilli contributes to the vaginal acidity, it is still not proven to be the primary source of low vaginal pH, but the fact remains that most lactobacilli thrive best at a pH &lt; 4.5 .&lt;ref name=" Aroutcheva "&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aroutcheva A. |author2=Gariti D. |author3=Simon M. |author4=Shott S. |author5=Faro J. |author6=Simoes J.

A concentration of 100 mM H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; is approximately 50-fold higher than lactobacilli are capable of producing even under optimal aerobic, low-antioxidant conditions, and approximately 5,000-fold higher than the estimated H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; concentration in vivo.

=== Bacteriocins ===
Vaginal lactobacilli produce antimicrobial peptides, 
i.e. bacteriocins such as lactocin 160 and crispasin.&lt;ref name=" Aroutcheva " /&gt; with inhibitory activity
ranging from narrow (closely related ''Lactobacillus'' species) to broad (diverse groups of
bacteria, including ''G. vaginalis'' and ''P. bivia''),&lt;ref name="Skarin" /&gt; and bacteriocin-like substances, with a broader spectrum of activity than bacteriocins (e.g. a heat-resistant peptide produced by ''Lactobacillus salivarius'' subsp. ''salivarius'' CRL 1328). Several studies
have indicated that the activity of bacteriocins is favored by low pH.

The inhibitory substances produced by vaginal ''Lactobacillus'' is a primary factor in protecting the vaginal microbiota, with organic acids, bacteriocins, and hydrogen peroxide. These act synergistically against infection by pathogens. Not all ''Lactobacillus'' spp. and not all strains within one ''Lactobacillus'' species exhibit all 3 mechanisms.&lt;ref name=" Aroutcheva " /&gt;  ''Lactobacillus'' species differ in premenopausal women, i.e. ''L. crispatus'', ''L. jensenii'', ''L. iners'', ''L. gasseri'' (and possibly ''L. vaginalis''), as assessed through cultivation-dependent and
cultivation-independent techniques.&lt;ref name=" Verhelst1 " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" De Backer1 " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Antonio1 " /&gt;&lt;ref name="pnas.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravel|first1=Jacques|last2=Gajer|first2=Pawel|last3=Abdo|first3=Zaid|last4=Schneider|first4=G.

== Pregnancy==

The effect of [[tampon]] use on vaginal flora is debated, but application of tampons appears not to significantly modify the balance of bacterial presence.{{Medical citation needed|date=April 2015}} Pregnancy alters the microbiota with a reduction in species/genus diversity.&lt;ref name="ClarkTal2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Natalie|last2=Tal|first2=Reshef|last3=Sharma|first3=Harsha|last4=Segars|first4=James|title=Microbiota and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease|journal=Seminars in Reproductive Medicine|volume=32|issue=01|year=2014|pages=043–049|issn=1526-8004|doi=10.1055/s-0033-1361822|pmid=24390920|pmc=4148456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease prevention ==
A healthy vaginal microbiome aids in the prevention of bacterial vaginosis, [[yeast infections]] and other possible problems by maintaining an acidic pH (&lt; 4.5) that is unfavourable for the growth of common pathogens, such as ''Gardnerella vaginalis''. The lactobacilli present in a healthy vaginal microbiome also occupy the [[ecological niche]] that would otherwise be available for exploitation by pathogenic organisms. However, harmful bacteria or an imbalance in bacteria can lead to infection.{{Medical citation needed|date=April 2015}}
