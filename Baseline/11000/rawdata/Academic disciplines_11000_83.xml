{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}
'''Accelerated aging''' is testing that uses aggravated conditions of heat, humidity, oxygen, sunlight, vibration, etc. to speed up the normal aging processes of items. It is used to help determine the long-term effects of expected levels of stress within a shorter time, usually in a laboratory by controlled [[Technical standard|standard]] [[test method]]s.   It is used to estimate the useful lifespan of a product or its [[shelf life]] when actual lifespan data is unavailable.  This occurs with products that have not existed long enough to have gone through their useful lifespan: for example, a new type of car engine or a new polymer for replacement joints.

[[Physical test]]ing or [[chemical test]]ing is carried out by subjecting the product to 
* representative levels of stress for long time periods, 
* unusually high levels of stress used to accelerate the effects of natural aging, or 
* levels of stress that intentionally force failures (for further analysis).  
Mechanical parts are run at very high speed, far in excess of what they would receive in normal usage.  Polymers are often kept at elevated temperatures, in order to accelerate chemical breakdown. [[Environmental chamber]]s are often used.

Also, the device or material under test can be exposed to rapid (but controlled) changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, strain, etc. For example, cycles of heat and cold can simulate the effect of day and night for a few hours or minutes.

==Library and archival preservation science==
Accelerated aging is also used in library and archival preservation science. In this context, a material, usually paper, is subjected to extreme conditions in an effort to speed up the natural aging process. Usually, the extreme conditions consist of elevated temperature, but tests making use of concentrated pollutants or intense light also exist.&lt;ref name="Porck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ica.org/download.php?id%3D604 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129054703/http://www.ica.org/download.php?id=604 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy }}, Porck, H. J. (2000). ''Rate of paper degradation: The predictive value of artificial aging tests.'' Amsterdam: European Commission on Preservation and Access.&lt;/ref&gt; These tests may be used for several purposes.

* ''To predict the long-term effects of particular conservation treatments. '' In such a test, treated and untreated papers are both subjected to a single set of fixed, standardized conditions. The two are then compared in an effort to determine whether the treatment has a positive or negative effect on the lifespan of the paper.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;
* ''To study the basic processes of paper decay. '' In such a test, the purpose is not to predict a particular outcome for a specific type of paper, but rather to gain a greater understanding of the chemical mechanisms of decay.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;
* ''To predict the lifespan of a particular type of paper. '' In such a test, paper samples are generally subjected to several elevated temperatures and a constant level of relative humidity equivalent to the relative humidity in which they would be stored. The researcher then measures a relevant quality of the samples, such as folding endurance, at each temperature. This allows the researcher to determine how many days at each temperature it takes for a particular level of degradation to be reached. From the data collected, the researcher extrapolates the rate at which the samples might decay at lower temperatures, such as those at which the paper would be stored under normal conditions. In theory, this allows the researcher to predict the lifespan of the paper. This test is based on the [[Arrhenius equation]]. This type of test is, however, a subject of frequent criticism.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;

There is no single recommended set of conditions at which these tests should be performed. In fact, temperatures from 22 to 160 degrees Celsius, relative humidities from 1% to 100%, and test durations from one hour to 180 days have all been used.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt; ISO 5630-3 recommends accelerated aging at 80 degrees Celsius and 65% relative humidity&lt;ref name="Bansa 1992"&gt;Bansa, H. (1992). Accelerated aging tests in conservation research: Some ideas for a future method. ''Restaurator 13.3'', 114-137.&lt;/ref&gt; when using a fixed set of conditions.

Besides variations in the conditions to which the papers are subjected, there are also multiple ways in which the test can be set up. For instance, rather than simply placing single sheets in a climate controlled chamber, the Library of Congress recommends sealing samples in an air-tight glass tube and aging the papers in stacks, which more closely resembles the way in which they are likely to age under normal circumstances, rather than in single sheets.&lt;ref name="LOC 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preserv/acceltest.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727062407/http://www.loc.gov/preserv/acceltest.html |archivedate=27 July 2009 |df=dmy }}, Library of Congress (2006). Accelerated aging of paper: A new test. ''The Library of Congress: Preservation''. Retrieved 8 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The technique of artificially accelerating the deterioration of paper through heat was known by 1899, when it was described by W. Herzberg.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt; Accelerated aging was further refined during the 1920s, with tests using sunlight and elevated temperatures being used to rank the permanence of various papers in the United States and Sweden. In 1929, a frequently used method in which 72 hours at 100 degrees Celsius is considered equivalent to 18–25 years of natural aging was established by R. H. Rasch.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;

In the 1950s, researchers began to question the validity of accelerated aging tests which relied on dry heat and a single temperature, pointing out that relative humidity affects the chemical processes which produce paper degradation and that the reactions which cause degradation have different [[Activation energy|activation energies]]. This led researchers like Baer and Lindström to advocate accelerated aging techniques using the Arrhenius equation and a realistic relative humidity.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;

===Criticism===
Accelerated aging techniques, particularly those using the Arrhenius equation, have frequently been criticized in recent decades. While some researchers claim that the Arrhenius equation can be used to quantitatively predict the lifespan of tested papers,&lt;ref name="Zou"&gt;Zou, X.; Uesaka, T; &amp; Gurnagul, G. (1996). Predication of paper permanence by accelerated aging I. Kinetic analysis of the aging process. ''Cellulose 3'', 243-267.&lt;/ref&gt; other researchers disagree. Many argue that this method cannot predict an exact lifespan for the tested papers, but that it can be used to rank papers by permanence.&lt;ref name="Strofer"&gt;Strofer-Hua, E. (1990). Experimental measurement: Interpreting extrapolation and prediction by accelerated aging. ''Restaurator 11'', 254-266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Begin"&gt;Bégin, P. L. &amp; Kaminska, E. (2002). Thermal accelerated ageing test method development. ''Restaurator 23'', 89-105.&lt;/ref&gt; A few researchers claim that even such rankings can be deceptive, and that these types of accelerated aging tests can only be used to determine whether a particular treatment or paper quality has a positive or negative effect on the paper’s permanence.&lt;ref name="Bansa 2002"&gt;Bansa, H. (2002). Accelerated aging of paper: Some ideas on its practical benefit. ''Restaurator 23'', 106-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several reasons for this skepticism. One argument is that entirely different chemical processes take place at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures, which means the accelerated aging process and natural aging process are not parallel.&lt;ref name="Porck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bansa 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bansa 1989"&gt;Bansa, H. (1989). Artificial aging as a predictor of paper’s future useful life. ''The Abbey Newsletter Monograph Supplement 1''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that paper is a “complex system”&lt;ref name="Strofer"/&gt; and the Arrhenius equation only applicable to elementary reactions. Other researchers criticize the ways in which deterioration is measured during these experiments. Some point out that there is no standard point at which a paper is considered unusable for library and archival purposes.&lt;ref name="Bansa 1989"/&gt; Others claim that the degree of correlation between macroscopic, mechanical properties of paper and molecular, chemical deterioration has not been convincingly proven.&lt;ref name="Strofer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvini"&gt;Calvini, P. &amp; Gorassini, A. (2006). On the rate of paper degradation: Lessons from the past. ''Restaurator 27'', 275-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to improve the quality of accelerated aging tests, some researchers have begun comparing materials which have undergone accelerated aging to materials which have undergone natural aging.&lt;ref name=" Batterham "&gt;[http://www.naa.gov.au/images/batterham-rai_tcm2-13043.pdf ] Batterham, I &amp; Rai, R. (2008). A comparison of artificial ageing with 27 years of natural ageing. ''2008 AICCM Book, Paper and Photographic Materials Symposium'', 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress, for instance, began a [[long-term experiment]] in 2000 to compare artificially aged materials to materials allowed to undergo natural aging for a hundred years.&lt;ref name="LOC 2008"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/rt/projects/100-yr_nat_aging.html], Library of Congress (2008). 100-year paper natural aging project.

}}'''AFROMET''' (Association For the Return of the Magdala Ethiopian Treasures) is an organization seeking the return of looted treasures to Ethiopia.

==History==
After the [[Battle of Magdala]] in 1868, the victorious British expedition looted a great many books and artifacts not only from the city of Maqdala but also from the Ethiopian Christian church of [[Medhane Alem]].&lt;ref name=pankhurst&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.afromet.org/history/
|title=Maqdala and its loot  
|author=Pankhurst, Richard
|accessdate=July 8, 2008|publisher=[[Institute of Ethiopian Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Henry M. Stanley]], the loot included "an infinite variety of gold, and silver and brass crosses", as well as "heaps of parchment royally illuminated". Fifteen elephants and almost two hundred mules were required to bear the loot to the nearby Dalanta Plain for auction. Richard Holmes, then Assistant in the British Museum's Department of Manuscripts, purchased 350 manuscripts and various solid goods, such as the crown of the [[Abun]] (Head of the Ethiopian Church).

Most of the loot is still missing; some of it is known to be held in public collections such as the [[British Museum]]. For example, a manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] bears a pencil note: ''"taken from a church at Maqdala in 1868"''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the mid-20th century, world law and opinion gradually came to ban [[looting]], most notably codified in the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]. A problem remained as to the status of goods looted previously. A number of efforts to return cultural items grew up around the world, of which AFROMET is one.

==Progress==
The Ethiopian government started requesting the return of the looted goods within three years of the battle, with some small success.&lt;ref name=pankhurst_2&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2004/06/04-06-04/An.htm
|title=Ethiopian Cultural Restitution
|author=Pankhurst, Richard
|year=2006
|accessdate=February 4, 2007
|publisher=Addis Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, progress in general was slow.

Lady [[Valerie Meux]] bequeathed her collection of Ethiopian manuscripts to Emperor [[Menilek II]], but her will was overturned shortly after her death in 1910, on the grounds that Menilek was dead when Lady Meux died (which, in fact, was untrue; he died in 1913 and in any case he had heirs).

The British Government occasionally returned some of the looted items. In 1965, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] returned to Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] the royal cap and seal of [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]].

AFROMET was formed to lobby systematically for the repatriation of the objects, using legal means and public pressure. So far 10 items have been returned by private donors including a hand-written [[Book of Psalms]], two [[Tabot]]s and a shield. More than 460 items are still being claimed.

The '''Australian Services Contingent''' was the [[Australian Army]] contribution to the [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG) [[peacekeeping]] mission to [[Namibia]] in 1989 and 1990. Australia sent two contingents of over 300 engineers each to assist the [[Special Representative of the Secretary General]], [[Martti Ahtisaari]], in overseeing free and fair elections in Namibia for a [[Constituent Assembly of Namibia|Constituent Assembly]] in what was the largest deployment of Australian troops since the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=53}}

The Australian mission was widely reported as successful. [[Colonel]] John Crocker, commander of the second Australian contingent (2ASC), wrote that the November 1989 election was UNTAG's ''raison d'être'' and observed that "the Australian contingent's complete and wide-ranging support was critical to the success of that election and hence the mission – a fact that has been acknowledged at the highest level in UNTAG".{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=7}} [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], wrote to [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] (Australia's [[Foreign Minister]]) about the "remarkable contribution made by the Australian military and electoral personnel", saying that their "dedication and professionalism had been widely and deservedly praised".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=142}} Although a total of 19 UN personnel lost their lives in Namibia, the two Australian contingents achieved their mission without sustaining any fatalities – one of the few military units in UNTAG to do so.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=137}}

Overall, the UNTAG mission assisted Namibia in transitioning to a democratic government after the racial segregation of the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] system. The military forces did not fire a shot during the operation,{{sfn|Sitkowski|2006|p=84}} and Mays called it "possibly the most successful UN peacekeeping operation ever fielded";{{sfn|Mays|2011|p=29}} Hearn called it "one of the major successes of the United Nations".{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=1}} Almost 20 years later, in a message to the annual session of the [[United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization]] on 28 February 2008, [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] noted  that "facilitating this process" constituted "one of the proudest chapters of our Organization's history".{{sfn|Tsokodayi|2011|p=23}}

Southwest Africa has a [[History of Namibia|rich history]] encompassing colonisation, war and genocide. The first European to set foot on Namibian soil was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Diogo Cão]] in 1485.{{citationneeded|date=January 2018}} Over the next 500 years, the country was [[colony|colonised]] by the Dutch, English and Germans. Namibia was a [[Germany|German]] colony ([[German South-West Africa]]) from 1884 until its annexation by [[South Africa]] during [[World War I]]. After the war, it was [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] to South Africa by the [[League of Nations]]. After [[World War II]] the [[United Nations]] (UN) asked South Africa to place Namibia under [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|UN trusteeship]], but South Africa refused. Legal arguments continued until 1966 when the [[UN General Assembly]] resolved to end the mandate, declaring that henceforth South-West Africa was the direct responsibility of the UN.{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=9}}

At the height of the [[Cold War]] in 1965, conflict escalated across the border with the [[Cuban intervention in Angola]]. Cuba formed an alliance with the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA) ({{lang-pt|Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola – Partido do Trabalho}}), which led to the deployment of more than 25,000 Cuban soldiers to the region in the [[Angolan War of Independence]].{{sfn|George|2005|p=i}}

The next year the [[Namibian War of Independence]] began when the South-West Africa People's Organisation's ([[SWAPO]]) military wing – the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN) – began guerrilla attacks on South African forces, infiltrating from bases in [[Zambia]]. The first attack was the battle at [[Omugulugwombashe]] on 26 August, and the war was a classic insurgent-counterinsurgent operation. PLAN initially established bases in northern Namibia; they were later forced out of the country by the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF), subsequently operating from bases in southern Angola and Zambia. The intensity of cross-border conflict escalated, becoming known as the [[South African Border War]] and the Angolan Bush War.{{sfn|Sibeene|2009|p=}}

The principal protagonists were the SADF and the PLAN. Other groups involved included the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) and [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA) (both aligned with the SADF) and the [[People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) and [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] (both aligned with SWAPO).{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=26}} The South African-aligned forces consisted of regular army (SADF), [[South West African Police]] forces and the South West Africa Police Counter-Insurgency Unit (SWAPOL-COIN), including the paramilitary-trained SWAPOL police [[counter-insurgency]] unit known as [[Koevoet]].{{sfn|Hooper|1988|p=232}}

From a Namibian perspective, the nature of the closely intertwined Angolan War of Independence, Namibian War of Independence and South African Border War was typically cross-border conflict. This was overshadowed by two large-scale Cuban military interventions in the Angolan War of Independence. The first was in November 1975 (on the eve of Angola's independence),{{sfn|George|2005|pp=i–ix}} which further intensified with the escalation of the [[Angolan Civil War]] in 1985. In that conflict, South Africa provided support across the northern border to UNITA. In opposition, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]] financially backed an estimated two motorised infantry divisions of Cuban troops in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-led the [[People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) offensive against UNITA in what became known as the second Cuban intervention in Angola. In September 1987, Cuban forces came to the defence of the besieged Angolan Army (FAPLA) and stopped the advance of the SADF at the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] (the largest battle in Africa since World War II). General [[Magnus Malan]] wrote in his memoirs that this campaign marked a great victory for the SADF. [[Nelson Mandela]] disagreed; Cuito Cuanavale, he asserted, "was the turning point for the liberation of our continent—and of my people—from the scourge of apartheid".{{sfn|Joseph|2007|p=128}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|2007|p=}} This battle led to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 602|UN Security Council Resolution 602]] of 25 November 1987, demanding the SADF's unconditional withdrawal from Angola by 10 December.{{sfn|Chicago Sun-Times|1987}} When the UN force deployed to Namibia in April 1989, there were 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989d}}

During the 20-year war the SADF mounted many cross-border operations against PLAN bases, some of which extended {{convert|250|km}} into Angola. SADF units frequently remained in southern Angola to intercept PLAN combatants on their way south, forcing PLAN to move to bases far from the Namibian border. Most PLAN insurgency operations took the form of small [[Raid (military)|raids]] on political activists, armed propaganda activity, [[Military recruitment|recruitment]], raids on white settlements and disruption of essential services.{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=344}}

===United Nations Transition Assistance Group===
{{main article|United Nations Transition Assistance Group}}
The process leading to Namibia's independence began with UN General Assembly Resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966.{{sfn|UN Resolution 2145|1966}} This was followed by the passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 264|UN Security Council Resolution 264]], adopted on 20 March 1969. In that resolution the UN assumed direct responsibility for the territory and declared the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia illegal, calling upon the [[Government of South Africa]] to withdraw immediately. International negotiations for a peaceful solution to the Namibian problem increased.{{sfn|UN Resolution 264|1969}} In December 1978, in what was known as the [[Brazzaville]] Protocol, South Africa, Cuba and Angola formally accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|UN Security Council Resolution 435]] outlining a blueprint for Namibian independence. The protocol envisioned a phased withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola over a two-year period, set 1 April 1989 as the date for the resolution's implementation and planned to reduce South African forces in Namibia to 1,500 by June 1989. The resolution established UNTAG, approving a report by the Secretary-General and outlining its objective: "the withdrawal of South Africa's illegal administration from Namibia and the transfer of power to the people of Namibia with the assistance of the United Nations". Resolution 435 authorised a total of 7,500 military personnel as UNTAG's upper limit.{{sfn|UN Resolution 435|1978}}

It was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to implement the resolution, signing the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] (an agreement between Angola, Cuba and South Africa) at [[UN headquarters]] in New York City. The accord recommended that 1 April 1989 be set as the date for implementation of Resolution 435,{{sfn|Wellens|1990|pp=200}} and was affirmed by the Security Council on 16 January 1989. As Hearn noted, "The first characteristic of peacekeeping is that the consent of the disputants must be secured before a force is deployed".{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=10}} With the accord in place (principally with South Africa), UNTAG was then formally established in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 632|Resolution 632]] on 16 February 1989.{{sfn|UN Resolution 632|1978}}

The key participants in the UN process were the South African government (represented in Namibia by the Administrator General) and the UN. Hearn wrote that South Africa had a "desire for a smooth transition"; this resulted in negotiations occurring locally (between the Special Representative and the Administrator General), directly with the South African government in Pretoria and at the UN (via the Secretary General and Security Council). The outcome of these negotiations with South Africa included draft electoral laws (enabling free and fair elections) and the disbanding of the Koevoet force.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=222}} The elections were carried out by the South African Administrator General, under UN supervision.{{sfn|Sitkowski|2006|p=79}} The UNTAG operation ultimately involved over 100 countries, the highest ever for a UN operation. The UN had a high level of credibility, and were recognised as the legitimate body to bring independence to Namibia.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=224}}

==Australian political context==
In the ''[[Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations]]'', author [[David Horner]] stated that the Australian government led by [[Robert Menzies]] was loath to criticise South Africa during the 1950s. At that time Australia generally opposed anti-colonial movements (which were often supported by the Soviets or China), believing them part of a worldwide communist offensive.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=55}} Indeed, as late as 1961 Australia (and Britain) abstained from a vote to condemn South Africa in the UN.{{sfn|Hansard – Chaney|1961}}

It was not until 1962 that Australia voted for a UN resolution condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister [[Garfield Barwick]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=55}} Initially in opposition, until he was [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] was a vocal advocate of independence for Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting Namibian independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and [[Malcolm Fraser]], were active internationally in their support of independence for Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia was involved in the UN process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, and two years later it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=56}} Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978,{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=58}} and made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}}

Behind the scenes, the composition of the force Australia would contribute was not agreed in principle until late 1978; options discussed at the time were a logistic force and an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] group.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=59}} By October 1978 Prime Minister Fraser had publicly stated that he wanted to send a [[peacekeeping]] force to Namibia;{{sfn|Killen|1985|p=13}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=62}} however, this was not broadly supported. A November 1978 article in ''[[The Bulletin]]'' claimed that the Defence Department was "dead against" a commitment, and in January 1979 ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' reported that Fraser, [[Andrew Peacock]] (Foreign Affairs) and [[Jim Killen]] (Defence) were "involved in a row" over the plan.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=63}} The following month, a Cabinet submission stated that the UN proposal had a "reasonable prospect" of success, and Cabinet approved the commitment of an engineer force of 250 officers and men and a national headquarters and support element of 50 on 19 February.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=64}} Horner noted that there was very little criticism of this decision in the press at the time, and the decision was accepted without question.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=64}}

After leaving government, Fraser continued to play an important role in international relations with respect to independence for Namibia. In 1985, he chaired UN hearings in New York on the role of multinationals in South Africa and Namibia. Fraser also co-chaired the [[Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group]] from 1985 to 1986, campaigning for an end to apartheid in South Africa.{{sfn|CEDA|2011|}}{{sfn|Uni. of Melbourne|2007|p=2}}

[[Bob Hawke]]'s government continued the policy of the Fraser and Whitlam governments to support independence for Namibia. In the ''Official History'', Horner stated that Australian peacekeeping "blossomed" after Gareth Evans was appointed Foreign Minister in September 1988; Evans reconfirmed Australia's willingness to participate in UNTAG in October 1988, a month after his appointment.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=45}} Horner also said that the commitment was "unusual" because it occurred a decade after the government's initial decision to participate in February 1979.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=54}} After more than 10 years of consideration, the government reconfirmed its commitment of a force of 300 engineers to Namibia on 2 March 1989.{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}}

{{Quote box|width=30%|align=left|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Our contribution to UNTAG and our involvement in the Namibian settlement makes Australia party to what may be one of the United Nations' most substantial achievements for many years. We have been involved in this process from the start. Australia has been a member of the UN Council for Namibia since 1974. We pledged our support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia in 1978. Australia also made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia during our recent term on the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.

I pay particular tribute to the achievements of my predecessor Malcolm Fraser in this regard.|source=Bob Hawke, Prime Minister of Australia{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}}}}

There were many concerns about the size of the commitment and its risks. Before the deployment, Prime Minister Hawke said in Parliament that Namibia was a "very large and important commitment" comprising "almost half of the Army's construction engineering capability". He went on to say, "our effort in Namibia will be the largest peacekeeping commitment in which this country has ever participated. It may also be the most difficult".{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}} Unlike the commitment of soldiers to [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam]] over 20 years earlier, the deployment to Namibia had [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] support.{{sfn|Hansard – T. Fisher|March 1989}}

Prior to the deployment, South African authorities threatened to veto the involvement of Australian peacekeeping troops because of doubts about their impartiality. This followed the establishment by the Australian Government of a Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN) in 1986 to assist South Africans and Namibians disadvantaged by apartheid. The focus of SAPSAN was on education and training for the people of South Africa and Namibia, and some humanitarian assistance had also been provided. A total of $11.9&amp;nbsp;million was spent under SAPSAN from 1986 to 1990.{{sfn|Hansard – G. Evans|1991}}{{sfn|Hansard – N. Blewett|1991}}

In the ''Official History'', Horner described the Australian deployment to Namibia as a "vital mission": the first major deployment of troops to a war zone since the Vietnam War. In 1988 Australia had only 13 military personnel deployed on multinational peacekeeping operations, and with few exceptions the number of Australians committed to such activities had  changed little in over 40 years (since the [[Military history of Australia during the Korean War|Korean War]]). The successful deployment of over 600 engineers to Namibia in 1989 and 1990 was pivotal in changing Australia's approach to peacekeeping, paving the way for much-larger contingents sent to [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|Cambodia]], [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[Operation Solace|Somalia]] and [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|East Timor]]. The deployment of a significant force to Namibia profoundly affected Australia's defence and foreign policies.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=53}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=143}}

===Command===
UNTAG was a large operation, with nearly 8,000 men and women deployed to Namibia from more than 120 countries to assist the process. The military force numbered approximately 4,500,{{sfn|United Nations|2012}} and was commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Dewan Prem Chand]] of [[India]]; the main military UNTAG Headquarters was in [[Windhoek]], Namibia's capital and largest city.{{sfn|Condell|2003|}} The commanders of the Australian contingents were Colonels Richard D. Warren (1ASC){{sfn|Sampson|1989|p=}}{{sfn|RUSI|1989|p=}} and John A. Crocker (2ASC).{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}}{{sfn|Forbes|1989|p=1}}{{sfn|Crocker &amp; Warren|1995}} Other senior appointments included the contingent seconds-in-command, [[Lieutenant colonels]] Kevin Pippard (1ASC) and [[Ken Gillespie]] (2ASC), and the officers commanding the [[17th Construction Squadron (Australia)|17th Construction Squadron]], [[Major]]s David Crago (1ASC){{sfn|Hansard – R. Kelly|1989}} and Brendan Sowry (2ASC).{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}}{{sfn|Getz|3 April 1989}}

===Mission and role of UNTAG===
UNTAG's mission was to monitor the ceasefire and troop withdrawals, to preserve law and order in Namibia and to supervise elections for the new government.{{sfn|Hawke|1989b|p=1}} In the ''Official History'', Horner described it as "an extremely complex mission".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=102}}

The role of UNTAG was to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG), Martti Ahtisaari, in overseeing free and fair elections in Namibia for a [[Constituent Assembly]]. The elections were to be carried out by the South African Administrator General, under UN supervision and control,{{#tag:ref|Sitkowski noted that this was a political compromise, because the South African administration was considered illegal.{{sfn|Sitkowski|2006|p=79}}|group=Note}} and this Assembly would then draw up a constitution for an independent Namibia. UNTAG was tasked with assisting the SRSG in ensuring that all hostile acts ceased; South African troops were confined to base, and ultimately withdrawn; discriminatory laws were repealed, and political prisoners released; Namibian refugees were permitted to return (when they were known as returnees); intimidation was prevented, and law and order maintained.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=1}}{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=172}}{{sfn|United Nations|1989}}

UNTAG was the first instance of a large-scale, multidimensional operation where the military element supported the work of other components concerned with border surveillance: monitoring the reduction and removal of the South African military presence; organising the return of Namibian exiles; supervising voter registration and preparing, observing, and certifying the results of national elections.{{sfn|Fomerand|2007|p=xxiii}}{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=162}}

==={{anchor|Role of the Australian contingent to UNTAG}}Role of Australian contingent===
The role of the Australian force was broad for an Army engineering unit, requiring the unit to "provide combat and logistic engineer support to UNTAG"; this included the UN civilian and military components. Its role included construction, field engineering and (initially) deployment as infantry.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=10}}

Prime Minister Hawke said in Parliament at the time that "the settlement of the long and complex issue of Namibian independence is an important international event. It is an event in which Australia has played, and will continue to play, a substantial part&amp;nbsp;... Namibia is a large, arid, sparsely populated and underdeveloped country which has been a war zone for many years. Our engineers will build roads, bridges, airstrips and camps for UNTAG. They will have the very serious task of clearing mines which have been laid by the various contending forces along the border between Angola and Namibia".{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}}

==={{anchor|Organisation and composition of the contingents}}Organisation and composition of contingents===
The Australian force was structured as follows:{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=18}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|pp=77–78}}
*A Headquarters (Chief Engineer ASC UNTAG) with operations, works, accommodations, communications, finance, logistics and personnel cells
*A Construction Squadron group based on the [[17th Construction Squadron (Australia)|17th Construction Squadron]] ([[Royal Australian Engineers]]) with two construction troops (the 8th and 9th Troops), the 14th Field Troop, a Resources Troop, a [[Heavy equipment|Plant]] Troop and the attached [[Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] Workshop

There were two contingents, each of which contained over three hundred soldiers and deployed for about six months:
*1ASC consisted of 304 members, and was principally drawn from the 17th Construction Squadron, the Workshop and the 14th Field Troop from the 7th Field Squadron in Brisbane. The contingents also included soldiers from the [[Royal Australian Corps of Signals]], [[Royal Australian Army Pay Corps]], [[Australian Army Legal Corps]], [[Royal Australian Corps of Military Police]], [[Royal Australian Corps of Transport]], [[Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps]], [[Australian Army Catering Corps]] and the [[Royal Australian Army Medical Corps]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=120}}
*2ASC consisted of 309 personnel, with members of 78 different units. The second contingent included the 15th Field Troop from the 18th Field Squadron in [[Townsville]], fourteen members of the [[Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers]] (RNZE), five [[Australian Army Reserve]] (ARES) members and one [[Royal Australian Air Force]] officer ([[Flight Lieutenant]] Craig Forster). The New Zealand engineers (under [[Lieutenant]] Jed Shirley) were spread throughout the squadron. The second contingent also included a detachment from the [[Royal Australian Corps of Military Police]], led by Sergeant Tim Dewar.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=120}}

In addition to the military force, a number of other Australians served with UNTAG (including 25 observers from the [[Australian Electoral Commission]]).{{sfn|Sawer|2001|p=176}} For the duration of the deployment, the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] and Defence had agreed to jointly fund a temporary Australian Liaison Office in Windhoek manned by two DFAT personnel and headed by [[Nick Warner]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=80}}

The parade was reviewed by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989b}}]]
[[Australian Army]] involvement in UNTAG was formalised in February 1979 by Cabinet, which approved the plan to commit the 17th Construction Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers and Workshop as the main force for deployment.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=64}} The squadron was to be supplemented by a Field Troop and by members posted from other units throughout the Army, bringing the squadron to a deployment strength of 275. A headquarters was to be formed, supporting the Chief Engineer at the UNTAG Military Headquarters. The total strength of the force was to be over 300 of all ranks, in what was known as Plan Witan.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=66}} The unit had been placed on eight weeks' notice in July 1978, which was reduced to a week's notice to move in February 1979.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=66}}

There was no agreement (or settlement) between South Africa and SWAPO, so an order to move was never issued. The ''Official History'' noted, "as the weeks passed the unit found it difficult to continue training because all its vehicles, equipment and plant were either in boxes or in a state ready for transhipment".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=67}} The notice to move reverted to 30 days in June and pushed out to 42 days in September 1979, when the unit was formally released from standby.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=68}} The notice to move was increased to 60 days in March 1982, and 75 days in November 1986. In July 1987, all remaining specific readiness requirements were removed.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=69}}

===Activation===
Horner wrote that the government had been following the course of negotiations, "but in view of the history of false alarms they were not inclined to react until Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed the protocol in Geneva" in August 1988.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=75}} Two weeks later the UN wrote, asking Australia to reconfirm its previous commitment; within a month, Cabinet reaffirmed the commitment of a decade earlier. [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (CDF) [[Peter Gration|General Peter Gration]] then placed the unit on 28 days' notice to move.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=76}}

After the notice was reactivated, detailed planning recommenced (essentially from scratch). Changes made to the organisation of the force approved ten years earlier were only minor.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=77}} After many years of notice, there was still skepticism that the deployment would ever occur. The government and army were cautious about the timing of the commitment of funds; significant funding was only released in late 1988, a few months before deployment.

The 1ASC advance party, comprising 36 officers and men, were deployed by USAF [[C-5 Galaxy]] via [[RAAF Learmonth]] and [[Diego Garcia]] to Windhoek. They arrived at 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 11 March 1989 and were met by Australian Ambassador to South Africa Colin MacDonald, Warren and Hutchings. The 17th Construction Squadron advance party of ten deployed by road to [[Grootfontein]] on 13 March 1989.

By 31 March, 14th Field Troop had completed its mine-awareness training; only [[Lieutenant]] Stephen Alexander and five others remained at [[Oshakati]], the main SADF base in the north of the country. During the early hours of 1 April an SADF aircraft began dropping flares, and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds landed near the base. This signalled the start of an intense period of conflict, and Alexander's team was quickly withdrawn to Grootfontein. What had occurred was the infiltration of a large number of PLAN combatants (about 1,600), re-entering Namibia from Angola.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=89}}{{#tag:ref|The Associated Press reported that 1,900 SWAPO guerillas crossed the border.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989f}}|group=Note}} Accounts differed, but Hearn stated that all of those interviewed at the time made it clear that "they did not enter Namibia for war, but to seek out the UN".{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=101}} Reuters reported that SWAPO demanded the right to establish bases in Namibia.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989e|p=}} The large size of the PLAN forces and the very small number of deployed UN forces (less than 1,000 at the time) meant that the UN had very little intelligence, and was unable to respond in force. Sitkowski wrote that the UN should have been informed about the high probability of SWAPO infiltration, but this did not occur.{{sfn|Getz|6 April 1989|p=10}}{{sfn|Sitkowski|2006|p=82}} The Australians were the first to know about the incursion, but they only found out informally via church sources at the Pastoral Centre (the accommodations for headquarters staff).{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=88}}

The UN had only two police observers in the north of the country at the time, and the South African government pressured the UN to allow its forces to leave their bases and respond. On 1 April the SRSG authorised the SADF to leave their bases, and they responded in force. By 5 April the UN reported that it only had 300 troops in the north of the country, including 97 Australians.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989b}}{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989c|p=9}} On 7 April Reuters reported that [[Louis Pienaar]] had assured safe passage out of the war-torn north of the country if fighting ceased, and had called on SWAPO to surrender to the police; he also warned that if they did not respond, "the police will have no other option than to pursue you with all means at their disposal".{{sfn|Steele|1989|p=}} Reuters reported that 73 SWAPO guerillas were killed on 8 April, 34 in a single action.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989e|p=}} It was later estimated that over the three-week period following the incursion 251 PLAN combatants were killed, with the loss of 21 members of the SADF and other security forces.{{#tag:ref|The South Africans claimed that the Koevoet killed 294 insurgents and captured 14, while the SADF and SWATF killed another 18 and captured 26. The police lost 20 killed and the SADF five.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=91}}|group=Note}}

The SWAPO incursion became a complex political issue, and led to a week of tense negotiations. The UN considered emergency airlifts to bring more peacekeepers into the territory, and the United States offered aid.{{sfn|Steele|1989|p=}} On 9 April 1989 an agreement was reached at Mount Etjo{{#tag:ref|A game park outside [[Otjiwarongo]] in central-north Namibia.|group=Note}} (the Mount Etjo Declaration), calling for the rapid deployment of UNTAG forces and outlining a withdrawal procedure for PLAN soldiers (Operation Safe Passage) under which they would leave the country. Operation Piddock was the name for the Australian part of the operation. Horner wrote that if UNTAG were to play any role in ending the fighting, it was obvious that the Australians would be the key component. This was complex, and required authorisation from Gration and [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Defence Minister]] [[Kim Beazley]] for Australian troops to supervise the withdrawal of insurgent forces. It required the Australian Army engineers and British signallers to work as infantry, manning border and internal-assembly points. At the time, these were the only units which could be redeployed quickly to northern Namibia.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Getz|10 April 1989|p=1}}{{sfn|Getz|11 April 1989|p=9}}

The aim of the operation was to facilitate the withdrawal of PLAN combatants. South African Foreign Minister [[Pik Botha]] confined all South African troops to their base for 60 hours, allowing SWAPO guerillas to leave the country unhindered.{{sfn|Dowden|1989|p=}}{{#tag:ref|The Independent reported that [[Hidipo Hamutenya]], SWAPO's Head of Information in London stated that eighteen SWAPO guerillas had been "shot in the back as they tried to cross the border".{{sfn|Dowden|1989|p=}}|group=Note}} Nine assembly points were established by the UN, with up to twelve soldiers and five military observers at each. Six of the assembly points (APs) were led by Australians: Captain Richard Bradshaw (contingent signals officer) at AP Charlie ([[Ruacana]]), Sergeant Kerry Ponting (Squadron workshop) at AP Foxtrot ([[Oshikango]]), Captain Mark Hender (Squadron Operations Officer) at AP Juliet (Okankolo), Lieutenant Stephen Alexander (Field troop commander) at AP Delta (Beacon 7, west of Oshikango), Lieutenant Mark Broome (Plant Troop Officer) AP Bravo (Ruacana) and Lieutenant Pat Sowry (Liaison Officer) AP Kilo ([[Oshikuku]]).{{sfn|Horner|2011|pp=91–96}} Most of the assembly points had intense media scrutiny. The intention of the operation was for PLAN combatants to assemble at these points. They would then be escorted across the border north to the 16th parallel to their bases of confinement, but the operation was unsuccessful. Very few PLAN combatants passed through these points; for the most part, they withdrew across the border by walking independently. It was estimated that 200 to 400 PLAN members remained in Namibia, absorbed into the local community. Agreement was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to their bases from 26 April; in effect, hostilities ended after that date.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|pp=101–102}}{{sfn|Wren|1989|p=}}{{sfn|The Age|1989|p=}}

This was a stressful time for Australian soldiers deployed to these checkpoints.{{sfn|Getz|14 April 1989|p=8}} The South Africans were determined to intimidate the UN forces, and SWAPO casualties occurred in the immediate vicinity of several checkpoints. The South Africans set up in force immediately adjacent to many checkpoints, pointed machine guns at the Australians and demanded that they hand over SWAPO soldiers who had surrendered. The Australian and British soldiers were outnumbered and out-gunned.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=94}} Despite the fact that only nine SWAPO appeared at the points, the operation was a political success. Lieutenant Colonel Neil Donaldson, commander of the British contingent, said that "the world press showed Australian and British soldiers standing up to a bunch of South African bullies".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=96}} Crocker said that the fact that the Australian soldiers completed this operation without any casualties was a tribute to the "training standards of the Australian Army and perhaps, a bit of good luck".{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}} The conclusion of Operation Piddock meant that the Australians were able to begin their engineering tasks.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=99}}

===Return of refugees===
[[File:1989 Entrance to the Australian base at Ondangwa.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=Photograph of the front entrance to the Australian base at Ondangwa from inside the wire|Front entrance to the Australian base at Ondangwa occupied by 9th Construction Troop on 24 June 1989]]
The UN plan required that all exiled Namibians be given the opportunity to return to their country in time to participate in the electoral process. This was implemented by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), supported by a number of other UN agencies and programmes. In Namibia, the [[Council of Churches in Namibia]] (CCN) was UNHCR's implementing partner. Most returning Namibians returned from Angola; many came from Zambia, and a small number came from 46 other countries after the proclamation of a general amnesty. The logistics of managing the returnees was largely delegated to the Australian contingent.{{sfn|United Nations|2012|p=}}

Three air and three land entry points were established, as well as five reception centres. Four centres were designed by Namibia Consult Incorporated under the directorship of [[Klaus Dierks]], and constructed by the Australian contingent. The centres were located at Dobra, Mariabronn (near Grootfontein) and at [[Ongwediva]] and Engela in [[Ovamboland]]. They were administered under the auspices of the Repatriation, Resettlement and Reconstruction Committee of the CCN.{{sfn|Dierks|1989|p=}}

The 8th Construction Troop (under Lieutenant Geoff Burchell) constructed a camp and managed the reception centre at Engela, less than {{convert|5|km}} from the Angolan border; the 9th Construction Troop (under Lieutenant Andrew Stanner) constructed a similar camp and managed the reception centre at Ongwediva. The SADF continued attempts to intimidate the Australians and disrupt operations, but their actions had little effect. In late April an SADF aircraft dropped flares at night over the 9th Construction Troop base at Ongwediva, and explosions (possibly mortar rounds) were heard nearby.{{sfn|United Nations|2012|p=}}{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989}}

Security, services and logistics at the reception centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, and a number of secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.{{sfn|United Nations|2012|p=}}

===Accommodation and other works===
[[File:1989 Opuwo airstrip.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=Photograph of the airstrip at Opuwo|Opuwo airstrip during upgrade by the [[17th Construction Squadron (Australia)|17th Construction Squadron]] during its deployment. This project was undertaken in support of the local community as a nation-building exercise.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}}]]
For the remainder of its deployment, the first contingent focused most of its efforts on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations. These were typically manned by only two or three police (or civilian) electoral staff and were almost always in small, remote villages. Buildings were leased, a large number of [[Travel trailer|caravans]] purchased and deployed and prefabricated buildings constructed in about 50 locations. Much of this was done by the Resources Troop (under Lieutenant Stuart Graham), centrally controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=107}}

The largest plant task undertaken during the deployment was the construction of an airstrip at [[Opuwo]]. The squadron commander, Major David Crago, described how the road network in Namibia was better than expected; in retrospect, the squadron brought too much heavy road-making equipment. The squadron deployed 20 members of the Plant Troop (under Captain Nigel Catchlove) to Opuwo. Over a period of four months, Sergeant Ken Roma constructed an all-weather airstrip in one of the most remote parts of Namibia.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=109}}

===Force rotation===
The first contingent returned to Australia in September and October 1989, Warren reporting that he was "amazed that none of his men was killed or seriously hurt during the tour of duty".{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989h|p=3}} Planning for the second contingent had begun as soon as the first contingent had deployed. Colonel John Crocker was appointed as the contingent commander, and was given the task of raising the force.{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}} Unlike the first contingent, which had been built around the 17th Construction Squadron and had maintained that unit's structure, the second contingent had to be built from scratch.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=120}} It deployed to Namibia between September and early October 1989.{{sfn|Hansard – T. Fischer|October 1989}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=119}}

===Election preparation and Operation Poll Gallop===
The security environment in Namibia changed in the lead-up to the election, including violence in Namibia and an increase in fighting between FAPLA and UNITA troops across the border in Angola. Horner wrote that the Australian contingent was not directly involved in "dealing with the violence", but the increased violence changed the nature of the mission.{{sfn|Horner|2011|pp=122–123}} It was initially envisioned that the military component of UNTAG would only provide communications and logistic support to the election. In September the role was broadened to include hundreds of electoral monitors, and in October (after detailed planning and reconnaissance of all polling stations) the Australian contingent deployed a ready-reaction force. At the same time the 15th Field Troop (under Lieutenant Brent Maddock) was deployed, making the first entry into a live minefield by Australian troops since the Vietnam War.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=123}}

Operation Poll Gallop was the name given to the largely logistic operation to support the Namibian elections. Activities began with 1ASC from May 1989 onward, but became the primary task for 2ASC:{{sfn|Forbes|1989|p=1}}{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=36}}
* '''Service support:''' Support was provided to approximately 500 electoral centres and police stations through the siting and erection of permanent (or portable) accommodations and the provision of essential services. UNTAG deployed over 350 polling stations; the Australian contingent constructed and provided support (including sanitary facilities) at 120 stations in the northern areas of [[Kaokoland]], [[Ovamboland]] and West [[Hereroland]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=124}}
* '''Construction engineering:''' This included the construction, modification or upgrade of UNTAG working and living accommodations, provision of essential services (power, water and air-traffic-control facilities) and the maintenance and upgrade of roads.
* '''Ready Reaction Force:''' The squadron formed a reinforced Field Troop (50 soldiers) in [[Buffel]] mine-proof vehicles as a ready-reaction force at Ondangwa, deploying to the 15 most-sensitive locations in Ovamboland and practising actions to stabilise a hostile (but not violent) situation in which Australians might be involved. On two occasions during the November 1989 election, the ASC Ready-Reaction Force was used to disperse rioters.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=125}}
* '''Australian military electoral monitors:''' The Australian contingent provided a team of thirty monitors headed by Lieutenant Colonel Peter Boyd, legal officer for the second contingent.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=125}}

Colonel John Crocker, commander of 2ASC, wrote: "For much of the mission, but particularly during the lead-up to the election, all members of the ASC worked, often well away from their bases, in a security environment which at best could be termed uneasy and on many occasions was definitely hazardous. The deeply divided political factions, which included thousands of de-mobilised soldiers from both sides, had easy access to weapons including machine guns and grenades. This situation resulted in a series of violent incidents including assassinations and reprisal killings which culminated in the deaths of 11 civilians and the wounding of 50 others in street battles in the northern town of Oshakati just before the election".{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}} Land mines and unexploded ammunition continued to cause injury and death; even during the week of the election, there were incidents.{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=322}}

===Post-election and return to Australia===
[[File:Australian Army land rover used in UNTAG.JPG|thumb|350px|alt=Photograph of a Land Rover used in Namibia on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra|Land Rover used in Namibia on display at the [[Australian War Memorial]], 2012]]

After the election, the contingent was able to focus almost exclusively on construction tasks. In addition to ongoing maintenance, these included taking over barracks and accommodations from the SADF and twelve non-UNTAG tasks in support of the local community as nation-building exercises.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}} These included:
*'''Opuwo airfield:''' The major task was the completion of the airfield upgrade at Opuwo begun by the first contingent. A detachment from Captain Kurt Heidecker's Plant Troop, supported by a section from 9th Construction Troop, worked over Christmas to complete these works (which included resurfacing and shaping the runway, drainage and installing culverts).{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}}
*'''Andara Catholic Mission hydroelectric plant:''' A team under Lieutenant Nick Rowntree upgraded a 900-metre supply channel for the [[Andara]] hydroelectric plant.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}}
*'''Classrooms in Tsumeb:''' [[Sapper]]s from the rear of the squadron constructed a number of classrooms for an Anglican school in a black neighbourhood in [[Tsumeb]] with funds provided by the Australian Liaison Office.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}}

Other tasks carried out by the squadron included Operation Make Safe, which took place in February and March 1990. The Field Troop conducted a reconnaissance of 10 known minefields, repaired perimeter fences and installed signs.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=134}}

The contingent began preparations for its return to Australia in December 1989. In January 1990 new works stopped,  manning of forward bases was reduced and stores and equipment were packed and prepared for sea. The Australian forces returned in four sorties on chartered commercial aircraft, the first departing Namibia on 6 February. The contingent's equipment loaded aboard the MV ''Kwang Tung'', which left Walvis Bay on 22 February.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=140}} The withdrawal included support from Australian logistics experts, a psychologist to conduct end-of-tour debriefings and a finance officer. The last demolition task was undertaken at Ondangwa on 25 March, and the last elements of the rear party left Namibia on 9 April 1990.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=141}} During the deployment there were no fatalities; although at least 10 soldiers were treated for malaria, there were few serious injuries.{{sfn|Sampson|1989|p=}}{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989g|p=}}

Despite being deployed to provide engineering support,
when the ceasefire broke down at the start of the mission, members of the squadron helped establish Assembly Points, which enabled the mission to continue. This activity was conducted in the face of hostility from elements of the former colonial power and personal danger arising from the breakdown of the cease fire. Later, 17 Construction Squadron became involved in the election process itself, providing security, transport and logistic support to election officials, monitors, other UN personnel, voters and polling stations. Members of 17 Construction Squadron ensured that, as much as possible, the election was able to proceed without interruption or interference and ensured that all parties were free from intimidation or duress. With the selfless support of individuals from other units of the Australian Defence Force, 17 Construction Squadron played a key role in the smooth and effective transition of Namibia from colonial rule to independence. The Squadron performed a role well beyond what was expected and brought great credit on itself, the Australian Army and Australia.

The appointment of Colonel Richard Warren as Chief Engineer was opposed by both [[Marrack Goulding]] (UN Undersecretary General for Special Political Affairs) and [[Cedric Thornberry]] (Director of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General). The UN had planned on a civilian filling this role and working primarily with civilian contractors; in all subsequent UN missions, the senior engineer was a civilian. The UN resisted appointing Warren until the "last minute", with final approval only given on 1 March. Warren recalled that this gave him "an abnormal amount of authority and a remarkable degree of responsibility".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=75}}

===Weapons and rules of engagement===
The contingents were faced with a number of issues concerning weapons and rules of engagement:
* '''Rules of Engagement:''' A major issue for the contingents concerned [[Rules of Engagement]] (ROE) and Orders for Opening Fire (OFOF). In 1989 the UN had no [[doctrine]] in this area, and was unable to develop any during the mission. The Australian contingent used standard ROE prepared before the deployment.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=94}}
*'''Machine guns:''' The UN required the Australians to deploy without the belt-fed [[M60 machine gun]], the standard section-level automatic weapon at the time. Instead, the contingent was required to deploy with World War II-vintage [[Bren light machine gun]]s, since these used only a 30-round magazine (the weapons had been rebuilt to accept 7.62mm ammunition).{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=100}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=94}}
*'''Deployment without weapons:''' On a number of occasions, soldiers were asked to deploy without weapons by UNTAG civilian officials. Early in the deployment Lieutenants Burchell and Stanner were asked by UNHCR to conduct an unarmed reconnaissance, but permission was refused. Near the election, Australian military electoral monitors were asked to deploy in civilian clothes without weapons.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=125}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=129}}

===Land mines and UXO===
[[File:1989 Field section on patrol in Casspir.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=Photograph of field engineers from 14th Field Troop on patrol in Owamboland in a Buffel mine-protected vehicle|Field engineers from the 14th Field Troop on patrol in [[Owamboland]] (near [[Ongwediva]]) in a [[Buffel]] mine-protected vehicle]]
[[Land mine]]s were used by the SADF and SWAPO and became a major feature of the war, triggering the development of mine-protected vehicles (MPV). The SADF typically laid marked, fenced, [[anti-personnel mine]]fields as perimeter protection for bases and vital assets. It laid a reported 45,000 mines during the conflict, of which 3,000 were unaccounted-for when UNTAG arrived.{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}} SWAPO used mines for ambushing or intimidation. Mines were laid individually or in clusters; [[anti-tank mine]]s were often stacked. The mines were obtained from South Africa, the USSR, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. After initial training by the SADF's 25th Field Squadron, an early task of the Field Troop was to conduct mine-awareness training for the other contingents. For the remainder of the deployment, much of the work of the 75 field engineers was clearing exposed mines, marking minefields and clearing routes.{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=86}} Crocker wrote, "for the first time since the Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area".{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}}

To support the deployment, the UN leased a number of mine-protected vehicles from the SADF. Most were Buffels, but smaller numbers of [[Casspir]] and [[Wolf Armoured Vehicle|Wolf]] vehicles were also leased. These vehicles had excellent mobility, and were well-suited to operations in the harsh Namibian terrain.{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=32}}{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=118}}{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=151}} The contingent also trialled [[Thermal imaging camera|thermal-intensifier]] technologies, in what is thought to be the first operational use of this technology.{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=106}}

===Radio communications===
One of the major difficulties early in the deployment to Namibia was poor [[radio communications]]. The Australian contingent was equipped with PRC-F1 [[High frequency|HF radios]] (manufactured by [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA)]], first issued to the Australian army in 1969. Output power was limited to one or ten watts [[Peak envelope power|PEP]]. HF radio communications were frequently impossible in the early month or two of the deployment. The primary factor was the [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm]], exacerbated by [[skip zone]], and [[ground plane]] effects resulting from the sandy environment and the high water table.  Detachments were often out of radio contact for extended periods, with no satisfactory alternate means of communication except couriers. Because the Australian force operated over large distances, with troop deployments often up to {{convert|700|km}} from squadron or force headquarters, courier communications often took days. Later in the deployment, the UN provided the contingent with higher-powered (100W) Motorola Micom X state-of-the-art HF equipment.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|pp=50–51}}

===Controversy and intimidation===
A number of observers noted that the UNTAG soldiers were not particularly popular with Namibia's 80,000 white residents. Shortly after the Australian advance party arrived in Namibia a pro-Pretoria newspaper accused Australian officers of breaching UN impartiality by attending a cocktail party at which leading members of SWAPO were present, and the incident was widely reported in the international press.{{sfn|Getz|3 April 1989}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=85}}{{sfn|Younghusband|1989|p=}} Soon afterwards, four Australian and four British soldiers were beaten by a large crowd in [[Tsumeb]], about {{convert|70|km}} from squadron headquarters in Grootfontein.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=87}} During the first few weeks of the deployment, on a number of occasions SADF soldiers discharged firearms in the direction of the Australian contingent or pointed firearms at Australians as a means of intimidation.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=112}} Corporal Paul Shepherd reported that during Operation Piddock, an SADF soldier threw a grenade (which did not explode) at his assembly point near Ruacana; during the night the South Africans fired in their direction, putting bullet holes in their Unimog truck.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=93}}

===Other concerns===
Before the deployment there was controversy about the government's non-resolution of repatriation entitlements and peacekeeper coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, and it had not decided if the deployment would be considered operational service. The pay and allowance issues were resolved; many other conditions-of-service issues were identified, but not resolved.{{sfn|Hansard – T. Fisher|March 1989}}{{sfn|Fischer|9 April 1989}}{{sfn|Hansard – J. Newman|1989b}} During the deployment few issues were brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised.{{sfn|Hansard – R. Tickner|1989}} During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' families had a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=46}}

After the deployment, the issues of appropriate service conditions, awards and recognition took many years to resolve. After serving the required 90-day period, contingent members were entitled to the [[Australian Service Medal]] (ASM) for non-warlike service. About 12 years after their return to Australia, the government changed the status of the operation; contingent members were eligible for the [[Australian Active Service Medal#Returned from Active Service Badge|Returned from Active Service Badge]], and their ASMs were upgraded to the [[Australian Active Service Medal]] (AASM).{{sfn|Commonwealth Gazette|2001|p=}}{{sfn|Defence Honours|2012|p=}} After the 2002 decision Major Nigel Catchlove wrote to the ''[[Army (newspaper)|Army]]'' newspaper, calling it a "pointless upgrade" and saying it "detracts from the award of the AASM to those who truly deserve it". In his letter, Catchlove compared the UNTAG operation to two subsequent operations: the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] deployment to Somalia during [[Operation Solace]] and the deployment of service personnel as part of the [[International Force for East Timor]]: "both of those operations involved robust rules of engagement appropriate to the intervention of forces in UN-sanctioned, US or Australian-led multi-national coalitions. UNTAG by way of contrast was a classic peacekeeping operation led by the UN in a relatively benign environment where rules of engagement were focused only on force protection". Catchlove questioned the "half-hearted approach to implementing this appalling decision" in which eligible people must apply for the upgrade, saying this "failed the test of commonsense".{{sfn|Catchlove|2002|p=}}

{{Renewable energy sources}}
{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''biofuel''' is a [[fuel]] that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and [[anaerobic digestion]], rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of [[fossil fuel]]s, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter.

Biofuels can be derived directly from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of [[biomass]]  (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to [[plants]] or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]] form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.

Biofuels are in theory [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because the carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants is equal to the carbon dioxide that is released when the fuel is burned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/print.php?page=biomass_environment Biomass and the Environment – Basics]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, whether or not a biofuel is carbon-neutral also depends greatly on whether the land which is used to grow the biofuel (with 1st and 2nd generation biofuel) [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|needed to be cleared of carbon-holding vegetation]] or not.

[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010, worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009,&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport. Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for about 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; {{as of|2011}}, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905003859/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-05 |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 |access-date=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency]] has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/biofuels_roadmap.pdf |year= 2011 |title=Technology Roadmap, Biofuels for Transport }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of biofuels also led into a flourishing automotive industry, where by 2010, 79% of all cars produced in Brazil were made with a hybrid fuel system of bioethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = Jeremy | last2 = Matos | first2 = Stelvia | last3 = Silvestre | first3 = Bruno | last4 = Martin | first4 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = Managing Technological and Social Uncertainties of Innovation: The Evolution of Brazilian Energy and Agriculture | url = | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 78 | issue = 7| pages = 1147–1157 | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2011.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various social, economic, environmental and technical [[issues relating to biofuels]] production and use, which have been debated in the popular media and scientific journals.

==Generations==
===First-generation biofuels===
"First-generation" or conventional biofuels are biofuels made from food crops grown on arable land. With this biofuel production generation, food crops are thus [[Food vs fuel|explicitly grown for fuel production]], and not anything else. The sugar, starch, or vegetable oil obtained from the crops is converted into biodiesel or ethanol, using [[transesterification]], or yeast fermentation.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100521143237/http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/05/18/3g-4g-a-taxonomy-for-far-out-%E2%80%94-but-not-far-away-%E2%80%94-biofuels/ First, second, third and fourth generation biofuels explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Second-generation biofuels}}
Second generation biofuels are fuels manufactured from various types of [[biomass]].  Biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the [[carbon cycle]]. Biomass is derived from plant materials, but can also include animal materials.

Whereas first generation biofuels are made from the [[sugar]]s and [[vegetable oil]]s found in arable crops, second generation biofuels are made from [[lignocellulosic biomass]] or woody crops, agricultural residues or waste plant material (from food crops that have already fulfilled their food purpose).&lt;ref&gt;An example here is [[rapeseed]], of which the oil is used as waste fuel, and of which the actual produce (for which the crop is grown) is [[fodder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coconut oil]] is another example, if it is extracted in such a way that the meat and milk can still be used for human and/or animal consumption.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/12/24/barley-grain-can-be-used-to-produce-ethanol-says-scientists-with-usda/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.315.5818.1488 |pmid=17363642 |title=CELLULOSIC ETHANOL: Biofuel Researchers Prepare to Reap a New Harvest |journal=Science |volume=315 |issue=5818 |pages=1488–1491 |year=2007 |last1=Service |first1=R. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jksus.2017.07.005 |title=Bioconversion of corn straw to ethanol by cellulolytic yeasts immobilized in Mucuna urens matrix |journal=Journal of King Saud University - Science |year=2017 |last1=Adelabu |first1=Blessing Adebola |last2=Kareem |first2=Sarafadeen Olateju |last3=Oluwafemi |first3=Flora |last4=Abideen Adeogun |first4=Idowu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feedstock used to generate second-generation biofuels thus either grows on [[arable land]]s, but are just byproducts of the actual harvest (main crop) or they are grown on lands which cannot be used to effectively grow food crops&lt;ref&gt;i.e. arid lands in case of jatropha, or hilly terrain not accessible by tractor, ... in case of grasses, woody crops ...&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases neither extra water or fertilizer is applied to them. Non-human food second generation feedstock sources include grasses, jatropha and other seed crops, waste vegetable oil, municipal solid waste and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biofuel.org.uk/second-generation-biofuels.html|title=Biofuels - Second Generation Biofuels|website=biofuel.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that, unlike with regular food crops, no arable land is used solely for the production of fuel. The disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops, it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel. For instance, a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/en8076765 |title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels |journal=Energies |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=6765–6794 |year=2015 |last1=Ramirez |first1=Jerome |last2=Brown |first2=Richard |last3=Rainey |first3=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The potential and challenges of drop-in fuels (members only) {{!}} IEA Bioenergy Task 39 – Commercializing Liquid Biofuels|url = http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/?p=932|website = task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Algaculture|Algae fuel}}
From 1978 to 1996, the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|US NREL]] experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "[[Aquatic Species Program]]".&lt;ref name = "NREL biofuels algae"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheehan|first=John|title=A Look Back at the U. S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program: Biofuels from Algae|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=July 1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the [[University of New Hampshire|UNH]] Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all [[motor vehicle|vehicular]] fuel with biofuels by using algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants.&lt;ref name="Briggs2004"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html| title = Widescale Biodiesel Production from Algae| first = Michael |last=Briggs|date=August 2004| accessdate = 2007-01-02

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture&amp;nbsp;– unlike [[agriculture|crop-based]] biofuels&amp;nbsp;– does not entail a decrease in [[food production]], since it requires neither [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] nor [[fresh water]]. Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |title=Valcent Products Inc.

Teixeira]] from the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] demonstrated the extraction of biofuels lipids from wet algae using a simple and economical reaction in [[ionic liquids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Energy-efficient extraction of fuel and chemical feedstocks from algae |journal = [[Green Chemistry (journal)|Green Chemistry]] | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 419–427 | author = R. E. Teixeira | doi = 10.1039/C2GC16225C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth-generation biofuels===
Similarly to third-generation biofuels, fourth-generation biofuels are made using non-arable land. However, unlike third-generation biofuels, they do not require the destruction of biomass. This class of biofuels includes [[electrofuel]]s&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and [[Solar fuel|photobiological solar fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4678123 | pmid=26667057 | doi=10.1007/s13280-015-0730-0 | volume=45 Suppl 1 | title=From first generation biofuels to advanced solar biofuels | journal=Ambio | pages=S24–31 | last1 = Aro | first1 = EM| year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fuels are [[Carbon-neutral fuel#Production|carbon-neutral]].

==Types==
The following fuels can be produced using first, second, third or fourth-generation biofuel production procedures. Most of these can even be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Ethanol for instance can be produced using 1G, 2G and 3G procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogas===

[[File:Biogas pipes.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Pipes carrying biogas]]
{{Main|Biogas}}
Biogas is [[methane]] produced by the process of [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[organic material]] by [[anaerobe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Redman, G., The Andersons Centre. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081004232058/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/metadot/index.pl?id=7198%3Bisa%3DDBRow%3Bop%3Dshow%3Bdbview_id%3D2457 "Assessment of on-farm AD in the UK"], ''[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]'', 2008-06-09. Retrieved on 2009-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be produced either from [[biodegradable waste]] materials or by the use of [[energy crop]]s fed into [[anaerobic digester]]s to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, [[digestate]], can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer.

Biogas can be recovered from [[mechanical biological treatment]] waste processing systems. [[Landfill gas]], a less clean form of biogas, is produced in [[landfill]]s through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential [[greenhouse gas]].

Farmers can produce biogas from [[manure]] from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters.&lt;ref&gt;"BIOGAS: No bull, manure can power your farm." Farmers Guardian (25 September 2009): 12. General OneFile. Gale.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syngas===

{{Main|Gasification}}
[[Syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and other hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of [[oxygen]] that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes [[pyrolysis|pyrolysed]]. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.

Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.

Syngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&amp;nbsp;°C.

Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].

===Ethanol===

{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left&amp;nbsp;(A), [[gasoline]] on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in [[Brazil]]]]
Biologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.

[[File:Bushlulacana09032007.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] looks at sugar cane, a source of biofuel, with Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during a tour on biofuel technology at [[Petrobras]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, 9 March 2007.]]
[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | Lär dig mer om energi - E.ON&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.

Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.

Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are "flueless", bioethanol fires&lt;ref&gt;Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.
The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;see "Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol"&lt;/ref&gt; the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkman, N. et al., "Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ.

Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol (in a long-term test of more than 2.1 million km, the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be 1–26% more energy efficient than petrol cars, but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30%, so more fuel stops are required).

With current subsidies, ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Other bioalcohols===

[[Methanol]] is currently produced from [[natural gas]], a [[non-renewable]] fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as [[biomethanol]]. This is technically feasible, but the production is currently being postponed for concerns of [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] that the economic viability is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;Börjesson.P. et al. 2013, REPORT f3 2013:13, p 170&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[methanol economy]] is an alternative to the [[hydrogen economy]], compared to today's [[hydrogen]] production from natural gas.

[[Butanol fuel|Butanol]] ({{chem|C|4|H|9|OH}}) is formed by [[Clostridium acetobutylicum|ABE fermentation]] (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high [[net energy gain]]s with butanol as the only liquid product.

=== Biodiesel ===

{{Main|Biodiesel}}
{{Further|Biodiesel around the world}}
[[Biodiesel]] is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]]. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as "neat" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ Perstop Press release: Verdis Polaris Aura – second generation B100 – The advanced green one]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]Biodiesel can be used in any [[diesel engine]] when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100&lt;!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) --&gt;. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.

Electronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.
Since biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the [[combustion]] of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/technology/2012/T46.pdf Nylund.N-O &amp; Koponen.K. 2013. Fuel and Technology Alternatives for Buses. Overall Energy Efficiency and Emission Performance. IEA Bioenergy Task 46]. Possibly the new emission standards Euro VI/EPA 10 will lead to reduced NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-levels also when using B100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and [[biodegradable]], and has a high [[flash point]] of about 300&amp;nbsp;°F (148&amp;nbsp;°C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125&amp;nbsp;°F (52&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |title=Biofuels Facts |publisher=Hempcar.org |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520231032/http://hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005. "By the end of 2006 biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold [from 2004] to more than" {{convert|1|e9USgal|m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070606084122/http://www.wfs.org/futcontja07.htm THE FUTURIST], [http://www.prleap.com/pr/80099/ Will Thurmond]. July–August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles.&lt;ref name=RA29&gt;{{Harvsp|Avril Group : Activity Report|2014|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avril Group]] produces under the brand [[Diester]], a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="EurObserv’ER"&gt;{{Harvsp|EurObserv’ER|2014|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the leading European producer of biodiesel.&lt;ref name=RA29/&gt;

===Straight vegetable oil===

[[File:Used vegetable cooking oil.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Filtered waste vegetable oil]]
[[File:Walmart’s Grease Fuel Truck (2).jpg|thumb|right|This truck is one of 15 based at Walmart's [[Buckeye, Arizona]] distribution center that was converted to run on a biofuel made from reclaimed cooking grease produced during food preparation at Walmart stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wal-Mart To Test Hybrid Trucks | publisher = Sustainable Business | date = February 3, 2009 | url = https://www.sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/17599}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Vegetable oil fuel}}
Straight unmodified [[Eating|edible]] vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.

As with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&amp;W Diesel]], [[Wärtsilä]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.

Vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-"Pumpe Duse" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.

Oils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, G.

===Bioethers===

Bioethers (also referred to as fuel [[ethers]] or [[oxygenated fuel]]s) are cost-effective [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that act as [[octane rating]] enhancers."Bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso-olefins, such as iso-butylene, with bioethanol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rock|first=Kerry|title=Bioethers Impact on the Gasoline Pool|url=http://www.digitalrefining.com/article/1000210,Bioethers_impact_on_the_gasoline_pool.html|publisher=Digital Refining|accessdate=15 February 2014|author2=Maurice Korpelshoek|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioethers are created by wheat or sugar beet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biofuel.org.uk/bioethers.html Biofuels - Types of Biofuels - Bioethers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  They also enhance [[engine]] performance, while significantly reducing engine wear and [[toxic]] [[exhaust gas|exhaust emissions]].

When it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives: [[dimethyl ether]] (DME), [[diethyl ether]] (DEE), methyl teritiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl ''ter''-butyl ether (ETBE), t''er''-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and ''ter''-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sukla |first=Mirtunjay Kumar |title=Bio-Ethers as Transportation Fuel: A Review |url=http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/DMEoverview.pdf |publisher=Indian Institute of Petroleum Dehradun |accessdate=15 February 2014 |author2=Thallada Bhaskar |author3=A.K.

The European Fuel Oxygenates Association (EFOA) credits methyl Ttertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl ter-butyl ether (ETBE) as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead.

===Solid biomass fuels ===

Examples include [[wood]], [[sawdust]], [[grass]] trimmings, [[domestic waste|domestic refuse]], [[charcoal]], [[agricultural waste]], nonfood [[energy crop]]s, and [[Dry animal dung fuel|dried manure]].

When solid biomass is already in a suitable form (such as [[firewood]]), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from {{convert|1|to|3|cm|1|abbr=on}}, which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce [[wood pellet]]s, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with a broad range of input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.

Sawdust, bark and chips are already used for decades for fuel in industrial processes; examples include the pulp and paper industry and the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000&amp;nbsp;lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, spreader stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel. Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low-cost fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. McGowan, Michael L. Brown, William S. Bulpitt, James L. Walsh, Jr. (Editors) 2009. Biomass and Alternate Fuel Systems: An Engineering and Economic Guide. {{ISBN|978-0-470-41028-8}} Wiley, 280 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of solid biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal husbandry and forestry.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=20 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

A problem with the combustion of solid biomass fuels is that it emits considerable amounts of [[pollutant]]s, such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]. Even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers. Pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets, producing much larger emissions of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[chlorophenol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briens | first1 = Cedric | last2 = Piskorz | first2 = Jan | last3 = Berruti | first3 = Franco | year = 2008 | title = Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review | url = | journal = International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering | volume = 6 | issue = | page = R2 | doi=10.2202/1542-6580.1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A derived fuel is [[biochar]], which is produced by biomass [[pyrolysis]]. Biochar made from agricultural waste can substitute for wood charcoal. As wood stock becomes scarce, this alternative is gaining ground. In eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], for example, [[biomass briquettes]] are being marketed as an alternative to charcoal to protect [[Virunga National Park]] from [[deforestation]] associated with [[charcoal]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |title=Threat to Great Apes Highlighted at Virunga Meeting |publisher=America.gov |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828133830/http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |archivedate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air pollution==
{{main|Biomass#Environmental damage|Ethanol_fuel#Air_pollution}}

Biofuels are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces [[carbon dioxide]], airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ WHO | Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas [[chromatograph]] studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240399720_Atmospheric_alcohols_and_aldehydes_concentrations_measured_in_Osaka_Japan_and_in_Sao_Paulo_Brazil Atmospheric alcohols and aldehydes concentrations measured in Osaka, Japan and in São Paulo, Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged in April 2007 that the increased use of bio-ethanol will lead to worse air quality. The total emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides will rise due the growing use of bio-ethanol. There is an increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels to produce the biofuels as well as nitrous oxide from the soil, which has most likely been treated with nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrous oxide is known to have a greater impact on the atmosphere in relation to global warming, as it is also an ozone destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haerens|first1=Margaret|title=Biofuels|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7377-5553-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates regarding the production and use of biofuel==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}
There are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[food prices]], [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[energy ratio]], [[energy requirements]],  [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], loss of [[biodiversity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher Jr.|first=Robert J.|author2=Bruce A Robertson |author3=Jason Evans |author4=Patrick J Doran |author5=Janaki RR Alavalapati |author6=Douglas W Schemske |title=Biodiversity conservation in the era of biofuels: risks and opportunities|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|year=2011|volume=9|issue=3|pages=161–168|url=http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/24366|accessdate=10 December 2013 |doi=10.1890/090091|hdl=10919/24366}}&lt;/ref&gt; impact on [[water resources]], the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel, as well as [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cotton |first=Charles A.

It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.

Another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) set by congress for 2010 was pushed back to at best 2012 to produce 100 million gallons of pure ethanol (not blended with a fossil fuel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bracmort|first=Kelsi|title=Meeting the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Mandate for Cellulosic Biofuels:Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41106.pdf|publisher=Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning of first-generation biofuels===
In the EU, the revised renewable energy directive calls for a complete ban on first-generation biofuels by 2030. Particularly fuels made from such oils such as palm oil and soy oil are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/04/palm-oil-biofuels-meps-eu-transport-deforestation-zsl-greenpeace-golden-agri-resources-oxfam MEPs vote to ban the use of palm oil in biofuels ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/eu-heading-for-zero-palm-oil-in-transport-by-2021/ EU heading for ‘zero palm oil’ in transport by 2021]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-climatechange-palmoil/eu-to-phase-out-palm-oil-from-transport-fuel-by-2030-idUSKBN1JA21F EU to phase out palm oil from transport fuel by 2030]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable biofuels===
{{main|Sustainable biofuels}}
Many of the biofuels that were being supplied in 2008 (using the first-generation biofuel production procedure) have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; In 2008, the Nobel-prize winning chemist [[Paul J. Crutzen]] published findings that the release of [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions in the production of biofuels means that overall they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2008, the challenge was to support biofuel development, including the development of new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is [[sustainable]]. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represented an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008).

Now, biofuels in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials are entering the market, driven by the perception that they reduce climate gas emissions, and also by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]].

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
Some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1238 |title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change |last = Searchinger |first = Timothy |author2=Ralph Heimlich |author3=R.A.

However, no-till practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal |title =Biofuels, Land Use Change, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Some Unexplored Variables|last = Kim |first = Hyungtae|author2=Seungdo Kim|author3=Bruce E.

A study conducted in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 53-105 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 48-90 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be sequestered from forest depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alves Finco | first1 = Marcus V. | last2 = Doppler | first2 = Werner | year = 2010 | title = Bioenergy and Sustainable Development: The Dilemma of Food Security and Climate Change in the Brazilian Savannah | url = | journal = Energy for Sustainable Development | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 194–199 | doi = 10.1016/j.esd.2010.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Runge | first1 = Ford | last2 = Senauer | first2 = Benjamin | year = 2007 | title = How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 41–53 | jstor=20032348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt.&lt;ref name="Science2"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1235.short |title =Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt|last = fargione| first = Joseph|author2=Jason Hill |author3=David Tilman |author4=Stephen Polasky |author5=Peter Hawthorne |doi = 10.1126/science.1152747 |pmid =18258862|year=2008|accessdate = 12 November 2011 |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1235–1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Use===
In addition to crop growth requiring water, biofuel facilities require significant process water.&lt;ref name="WaterI"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&amp;page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 18 June 2015 |journal=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests and Carbon Sequestration===
Scientific research (20th century) shows that carbon dioxide emissions from all forms of surface transport are converted in a few weeks by forests, farms and oceans into biomass. This implies that a greater emphasis on sustainable forestry is very relevant for climate protection and sustainable, energy-efficient transport.

==Current research==
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would require twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean production, or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production, to meet current US heating and transportation needs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

[[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies, such as [[Iogen Corp.|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], are building refineries that can process [[biomass]] and turn it into [[bioethanol]]. Companies, such as [[Diversa]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Dyadic International|Dyadic]], are producing enzymes that could enable a [[cellulosic ethanol]] future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the first commercial-scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating. Multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used. In the next few years, the cost data of these technologies operating at commercial scale, and their relative performance, will become available. Lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE_Reports/HLPE-Report-5_Biofuels_and_food_security.pdf |title=Biofuels and food security |author=HLPE |year=2013 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Asia and Africa where drylands prevail, [[sweet sorghum]] is being investigated as a potential source of food, feed and fuel combined. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions, as it only extracts one seventh of the water used by sugarcane. In [[India]], and other places, sweet sorghum stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |title=Sweet Sorghum : A New "Smart Biofuel Crop" |date=30 June 2008 |publisher=Agriculture Business Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004827/http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |archivedate=27 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers at the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014010/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf ''Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel''] New Agriculturalist, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
A group at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]], in a 2008 paper, stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species, ''[[Cunninghamella]]'' ''[[Cunninghamella japonica|japonica]]'', and others, is likely to appear in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Sergeeva | first1 = Y.

The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus ''[[Gliocladium roseum]]'' (later renamed Ascocoryne sarcoides) points toward the production of so-called [[myco-diesel]] from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern [[Patagonia]], and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium-length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Strobel | first1 = G.| last2 = Knighton | first2 = B.| last3 = Kluck | first3 = K.| last4 = Ren | first4 = Y.| last5 = Livinghouse | first5 = T.| last6 = Griffin | first6 = M.| last7 = Spakowicz | first7 = D.| last8 = Sears | first8 = J.| title = The production of myco-diesel hydrocarbons and their derivatives by the endophytic fungus Gliocladium roseum (NRRL 50072)| journal = Microbiology| volume = 154| issue = Pt 11| pages = 3319–3328| year = 2008| pmid = 18957585| doi = 10.1099/mic.0.2008/022186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms, suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bio-production of fuels in the future (reviewed in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 99| issue = 12| pages = 4943–4951| last1 = Spakowicz| first1 = Daniel J.| last2 = Strobel| first2 = Scott A.| title = Biosynthesis of hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds by fungi: bioengineering potential| journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology| date = 2015| doi=10.1007/s00253-015-6641-y| pmid = 25957494| pmc = 4677055}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Animal gut bacteria===
Microbial [[Gut flora|gastrointestinal flora]] in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels. Recent research has shown that TU-103, a strain of ''[[Clostridium]]'' bacteria found in Zebra feces, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_082511.cfm |title=Cars Could Run on Recycled Newspaper, Tulane Scientists Say |author=Kathryn Hobgood Ray |date=August 25, 2011 |work=Tulane University news webpage |publisher=Tulane University |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating [[biofuels]] from bamboo and other plant materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/09/130910-panda-poop-might-help-turn-plants-into-fuel |title=Panda Poop Might Help Turn Plants Into Fuel |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiomes of wood-feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulotic material into biofuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun|first1=Jian-Zhong|last2=Scharf|first2=Michael E.|title=Exploring and integrating cellulolytic systems of insects to advance biofuel technology|journal=Insect Science|date=2010|volume=17|issue=3|pages=163–165|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bioswale.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Two bioswales for a [[housing development]]. The foreground one is under construction while the background one is established.]]

'''Bioswales''' are [[Landscape architecture|landscape]] elements designed to concentrate or remove [[debris]] and [[pollution]] out of [[surface runoff]] water.  They consist of a [[wikt:swale|swaled]] drainage course with gently sloped sides (less than 6%) and filled with [[vegetation]], [[compost]] and/or [[riprap]].&lt;ref name="Loechl"&gt;{{cite book |title=Design Schematics for a Sustainable Parking Lot |last=Loechl |first=Paul M. |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers, Research and Development Center |location=Champaign, IL |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.cecer.army.mil/techreports/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot__TR.pdf |accessdate= |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602011451/http://www.cecer.army.mil/techreports/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot__TR.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }} Construction Engineering Research Laboratory. Document no. ERDC/CERL TR-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} The water's flow path, along with the wide and shallow ditch, is designed to maximize the time water spends in the [[Swale (geographical feature)|swale]], which aids the collection and removal of pollutants, silt and debris. Bioswales are also beneficial in groundwater recharge and are great stormwater mitigation tools. Depending upon the topography of the land, a bioswale may have a meandering or almost straight channel alignment. A bioswale's make-up can be influenced by many different variables that include: climate, rainfall patterns, size of the site, budget, and available vegetation that can be planted. 

It is important to maintain bioswales to ensure best possible efficiency and effectiveness in removal of pollutants in the stormwater runoff. Planning for these things is an important step, which can include the introduction of filters or large rocks to prevent clogging. Annual maintenance through soil testing, visual inspection, and mechanical testing are also crucial to the health of a bioswale. 

A common application is around [[parking lot]]s, where substantial [[automotive]] pollution is settled on the paving and then flushed by the first instance of rain, known as the [[first flush]]. The bioswales, or other type of [[biofilter]], can be created around the edges of parking lots to capture and treat the [[stormwater]] runoff before releasing it to the [[drainage basin|watershed]] or [[storm sewer]].

==Contaminants addressed==
Bioswales work to remove pollutants through vegetation and the soil. As the storm water runoff flows through the bioswale, the pollutants are captured and settled by the leaves and stems of the plants. The pollutants then enter the soil where they decompose or can be broken down by bacteria in healthy soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crd.bc.ca/education/green-stormwater-infrastructure/bioswales|title=Bioswales|date=2013-11-10|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several classes of [[water pollutant]]s that may be collected or arrested with bioswales.  These fall into the categories of silt, inorganic contaminants, organic chemicals and [[pathogen]]s.
* Silt – How bioswales and plants are constructed slow the conveyance of silt and reduce the [[turbidity]] of receiving waters. Filters can be established to capture debris and silt during the process. 
* Organics – Many organic contaminants including [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] will volatilize or degrade over time and Bioswales slow the conveyance of these materials into waterways, and before they can affect aquatic life.  Although not all organic material will be captured, the concentration of organic material is greatly reduced by bioswales.
* Pathogens –  are deprived of a host or from a nutrient supply long enough for them to become the target of a [[heterotroph]].
* Common inorganic compounds are [[macronutrient]]s such as [[phosphate]]s and [[nitrate]]s.  Principal sources of these nutrients comes from agricultural runoff attributed to excess fertilization. Excess [[phosphate]]s and [[nitrate]]s can cause [[eutrophication]] in disposal zones and receiving waters. Specific bioswale plants absorb these excess nutrients.
* Metallic compounds such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[chromium]], [[cadmium]] and other heavy metals are concentrated in the structures.  Unfortunately, these metals slowly poison the surrounding soil.   Regular soil removal is required in order to prevent metals from dissolving and releasing back into the environment.   Some bioswales are designed to include [[hyperaccumulator]] plant species.  These plants absorb but do not transform the metals.  Cuttings from these plants often decompose back into the pond or are pruned by gardening services that do not know the compost they are collecting is poisonous.

== Best locations ==
Bioswales can be implemented in areas that require stormwater management to regulate the runoff velocity  and decontaminate the runoff. Bioswales are created to handle the [[first flush]] of pollutants during the event of rain, therefore, locations that have high areas of impervious surface such as roads, parking lots, or rooftops can benefit from additions of bioswales.  They can also be integrated into road medians, curb cutouts, sidewalks, or any public space.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/stormwater-management/bioswales/|title=Bioswales – National Association of City Transportation Officials|work=National Association of City Transportation Officials|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Bioswales are useful [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|low-impact development]] work to decrease the velocity of stormwater runoff while removing pollutants from the discharge. They are extremely beneficial in protecting surface water and local waterways from excessive pollution from stormwater runoff. The longer the runoff stays within the bioswale, the better the pollutant removal outcome. It is also beneficial in removing standing ponds that could potentially attract mosquitos. Bioswales can also be designed to be aesthetically pleasing and attract animals and create habitats. Bioswales can also be beneficial for [[groundwater recharge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/bioswales_can_improve_water_quality_resources|title=Bioswales can improve water quality resources|work=MSU Extension|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maintenance ==
Improper maintenance can lead to high restoration costs to address inefficient bioswales. An accumulation of large sediments, trash, and improper growth of vegetation can all affect the quality and performance of bioswales. It is beneficial at the planning stages to set apart easements to allow for easier maintenance of biowales, whether it be adequate space to locate machinery or safety to those working. Different types of filters can be used to catch sediments. Grass filter strips or rock inlets can be used to filter sediments and particulates; however, without proper maintenance, runoff could flow away from the bioswales due to blockage. Structural inlets have become more common due to the ease of maintenance, use, and its effectiveness. Avoiding the use of floating mulch and selecting the best fit low-maintenance plants ensure better efficiency in the bioswales.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-11/documents/final_gi_maintenance_508.pdf|title=Operation and Maintenance of Green Infrastructure Receiving Runoff from Roads and Parking Lots|last=epa|first=|date=September 2016|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on a community's needs for a bioswale, a four step assessment program can be developed. Visual inspection, capacity testing, synthetic runoff, and monitoring are the four steps that can be used to evaluate performance and maintenance of bioswales.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Routine inspection is required to ensure that the performance and aesthetics of bioswales are not compromised. Time and frequency of inspections vary based on different local governments, but should occur at least once a year. Various aspects of inspection can take place, either visually or mechanically. Visual observation of the vegetation, water, and inlets are all crucial to ensure performance. Some organizations utilize checklists to streamline the visual inspection process.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830293149|title=Optimizing stormwater treatment practices a handbook of assessment and maintenance|last=J.|first=Erickson, Andrew|date=2013|publisher=Springer|others=Weiss, Peter T., Gulliver, John S.|isbn=9781461446248|location=New York|oclc=830293149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different methods to determine if a bioswale needs maintenance. Bioswales are benchmarked to meet a specific level of infiltration to determine if maintenance is required. A staff gauge is used to measure the infiltration rate. Soil chemistry testing is also required to determine if the soil has a certain off-level of any pollutant. [[Phosphorus]] and high levels of [[salinity]] in the soil are two common pollutants that should be attended to. Analysis of inflow and outflow pollutant concentration is also another way to determine the performance level of bioswales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Maintenance can span to three different levels of care. Aesthetic maintenance is required to remove weeds that affect the performance of the other plants and the bioswale itself, clean and remove trash, and maintaining the looks of the vegetation. Partial restoration is needed when the inlet is blocked by sediments or when vegetation needs to be replaced. Full restoration is required when the bioswales no longer filter pollutants adequately and overall performance is severely lacking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Design ==
Bioswales experience short, potentially intense, periods of rain, flooding and pollutant loading followed by dry seasons. It is important to take into account how the vegetation selected for the bioswales will grow and understanding what types of plants are considered the best fit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

There are four types of bioswales that can be constructed based on the needs of the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/water/resources_stormwater/bioswales.html|title=An Introduction to Bioswales|last=Caflisch|first=Mary|last2=Giacalone|first2=Katie|date=May 2015|website=Clemson University|publisher=|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low grass bioswales utilizes low growing grass that can be landscape, similar to lawns. These types of bioswales tend to be less effective than vegetated bioswales in treating stormwater runoff and sustaining an adequate collection time. 
* Vegetated bioswales are created with taller growing plants, ornamental vegetations, shrubs, and even trees. These types can also be lined with rocks to slow down the velocity of stormwater runoff that is flowing through bioswales to increase collection time for decontamination. Vegetated bioswales can also include vegetation that is highly useful in removing certain chemicals in runoffs very efficiently.  
* Low water use bioswales are helpful in areas that tend to be drier with hotter climate. [[Xeriscape]] bioswales are populated with runoff generally only after rain and storms and stay dry otherwise. 
* Wet bioswales are similar to wetlands in which they retain water for a much longer period of time that allows for infiltration of stormwater instead of simply emptying the water at the end of the bioswale into storm drain inlets. 
Bioswales require a certain soil composition that does not contain more than 5% clay. The soil itself before implementation should not be contaminated. Bioswales should be constructed with a longitudinal slope to allow sediments to settle. Maximum slope of bioswales is 3:1. A minimum clearance is required to ensure that other infrastructure would not be damaged. The overfill drain should be located at least 6 inches above the ground plain to allow for maximum concentration time of stormwater runoff in the bioswales. Rocks can also be used to slow down the runoff velocity. The use of filters is important to prevent inlets from becoming blocked by sediments or trash.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Examples==
Two early examples of scientifically designed bioswales for large scale applications are found in the western US.  In 1996 for Willamette River Park in [[Portland, Oregon]]  a total of 2330 lineal feet of bioswale was designed and installed to capture and prevent pollutant runoff from entering the [[Willamette River]].  Intermittent [[check dam]]s were installed to further abet silt capture, which reduced by 50% suspended solids entering the river system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Water Sensitive Planning and Design |last=France |first=Robert L. |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |isbn=1-56670-562-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second example of a large scale designed bioswale is at the Carneros Business Park, [[Sonoma County, California]].  Starting in 1997 the project design team worked with the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] and County of Sonoma to produce a detailed design to channel surface runoff at the perimeter of a large parking area.  [[Surface runoff]] consists of building roof runoff, parking lot runoff and overland flow from properties to the north of the project site.  A total of two lineal miles of bioswale was designed into the project.  The purpose of the bioswale was to minimize runoff contaminants from entering [[Sonoma Creek]].  The bioswale channel is grass-lined, and nearly linear in form. Downslope gradient is approximately 4% and cross-slope gradient is approximately 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Lumina Technologies (1998). ''Hydrology and biology studies for Carneros Business Park'', prepared for the William A. Saks Company pursuant to requirements of the County of Sonoma. Approximately 2000 bioswales are projected to be installed in New York City to protect the city's combined sewer system.&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively recent project established was the [[Seattle, Washington]] [[Street Edge Alternatives]] project, completed in 2001. Rather than using traditional piping, SEA's goal was to create a natural landscape that represented what the area was like before development. The street was 11% more pervious than a standard street and was characterized with evergreen trees and bioswales. The bioswales were planted on graded slopes with wetland and upland plants. Other landscaping also focused on native and salmon-friendly plants. SEA provided a strong benefit for stormwater runoff mitigation that helped continue to protect Seattle's creek ecology. The project street also created a more inviting and aesthetically pleasing site as opposed to hard landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/util/EnvironmentConservation/Projects/GreenStormwaterInfrastructure/CompletedGSIProjects/StreetEdgeAlternatives/index.htm|title=Street Edge Alternatives — Seattle Public Utilities|website=www.seattle.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7608">'''Canadian Reference Materials''' ('''CRM''') are [[certified reference materials]] of high-quality and reliability produced by the National Metrology Institute of Canada – the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council Canada]]. The NRC Certified Reference Materials program is operated by the Measurement Science and Standards portfolio and provides CRMs for environmental, biotoxin, food, nutritional supplement, and stable isotope analysis. The program was established in 1976 to produce CRMs for inorganic and organic marine environmental analysis and remains internationally recognized producer of CRMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Scott N. Willie |journal= Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry |year=2001| title= What's new with the NRC certified reference material program| volume=370|issue= 2–3 |pages= 131–133|doi= 10.1007/s002160100747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inorganic CRMs==

==Biotoxin CRMs==
[[File:Domoinic Acid Structural Formulae.png|thumbnail|NRC's domoic acid standard was the first biotoxin reference material in the world]]
In 1987 Canada witnessed a crisis in the seafood industry. Shellfish toxins present in PEI mussels caused [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]] taking several lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Jeffrey L.C. |editor-first=Cynthia |editor-last= Lamson |title= The Sea Has Many Voices: Oceans Policy for a Complex World|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1994 |pages=247–262 |chapter=Chapter 13: Toxic-Shellfish Crisis: 1987 and Beyond |isbn=0-7735-1112-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, shellfish toxin research was initiated at NRC Canada. Today, NRC remains the premier producer of biotoxin CRMs in the world and is recognized for its expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanalyticalscientist.com/the-power-list-2013/michael-quilliam/|title=The Analytical Scientist Power List 2013: Michael Quilliam|year=2013|access-date=2014-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115051035/http://theanalyticalscientist.com/the-power-list-2013/michael-quilliam/#|archive-date=2014-01-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carolingian architecture''' is the style of north European [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque architecture]] belonging to the period of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the late 8th and 9th centuries, when the [[Carolingian]] dynasty dominated west European politics. It was a conscious attempt to emulate [[Roman architecture]] and to that end it borrowed heavily from [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], though there are nonetheless innovations of its own, resulting in a unique character.

The gatehouse of the [[Lorsch Abbey|monastery at Lorsch]], built around 800, exemplifies [[Classical architecture|classical]] inspiration for Carolingian architecture, built as a triple-arched hall dominating the gateway, with the arched facade interspersed with attached [[Classical architecture|classical]] columns and [[pilasters]] above.

The [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] constructed between 792–805 was inspired by the octagonal [[Emperor Justinian|Justinian]] church of [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] in Ravenna, built in the 6th century, but at Aachen there is a tall monumental western entrance complex, as a whole called a ''[[westwork]]''—a Carolingian innovation.

Carolingian churches generally are [[basilica]]n, like the [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] churches of Rome, and commonly incorporated [[westwork]]s, which is arguably the precedent for the western facades of later medieval cathedrals. An original [[westwork]] survives today at the [[Abbey of Corvey]], built in 885.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56806">In [[academia]], '''computational immunology''' is a [[field of science]] that encompasses high-throughput [[genomic]] and [[bioinformatics]] approaches to [[immunology]]. The field's main aim is to convert immunological data into computational problems, solve these problems using [[mathematical]] and computational approaches and then convert these results into immunologically meaningful interpretations.

== Introduction ==

The [[immune system]] is a complex system of the human body and understanding it is one of the most challenging topics in biology. Immunology research is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the defense of human body and to develop drugs for immunological diseases and maintain health. Recent findings in genomic and proteomic technologies have transformed the immunology research drastically. Sequencing of the [[Human genome|human]] and other [[model organism]] [[genome]]s has produced increasingly large volumes of data relevant to immunology research and at the same time huge amounts of functional and clinical data are being reported in the scientific literature and stored in clinical records. Recent advances in [[bioinformatic]]s or [[computational biology]] were helpful to understand and organize these large scale data and gave rise to new area that is called '''''Computational immunology''''' or '''''immunoinformatics'''''.

Computational immunology is a branch of bioinformatics and it is based on similar concepts and tools, such as [[sequence alignment]] and [[protein structure]] prediction tools. [[Immunomics]] is a discipline like [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]]. It is a science, which specifically combines [[Immunology]] with [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]] for large-scale analysis of immune system functions. It aims to study the complex [[protein–protein interaction]]s and networks and allows a better understanding of [[immune response]]s and their role during normal, diseased and reconstitution states. Computational immunology is a part of immunomics, which is focused on analyzing large scale experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tong JC, Ren EC |title=Immunoinformatics: current trends and future directions |journal=Drug Discov. Today |volume=14 |issue=13–14 |pages=684–9 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19379830 |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2009.04.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1359-6446(09)00118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Korber B, LaBute M, Yusim K |title=Immunoinformatics comes of age |journal=PLoS Comput.

== History ==

Computational immunology began over 90 years ago with the theoretic modeling of malaria epidemiology. At that time, the emphasis was on the use of mathematics to guide the study of disease transmission. Since then, the field has expanded to cover all other aspects of immune system processes and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ross, R. |authorlink=Ronald Ross |title=An application of the theory of probabilities to the study of a priori pathometry. Part I |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=92 |issue=638 |pages=204–230 |date=1 February 1916 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1916.0007 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/92/638/204.full.pdf+html |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immunological database ==

After the recent advances in sequencing and proteomics technology, there have been many fold increase in generation of molecular and immunological data. The data are so diverse that they can be categorized in different databases according to their use in the research. Until now there are total 31 different immunological databases noted in the [http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) Database Collection], which are given in the following table, together with some more immune related databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 Oxford Journals | Life Sciences | Nucleic Acids Research | Database Summary Paper Categories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The information given in the table is taken from the database descriptions in [http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 NAR Database Collection].

Class 3 contains sequences which have been found in different V(D)J rearrangements but lack a genomic reference. All VBASE2 sequences are compared with the datasets from the VBASE-, IMGT- and KABAT-databases (latest published versions), and the respective references are provided in each VBASE2 sequence entry. The VBASE2 database can be accessed by either a text based query form or by a sequence alignment with the DNAPLOT program. A DAS-server shows the VBASE2 dataset within the Ensembl Genome Browser and links to the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Retter I, Althaus HH, Münch R, Müller W |title=VBASE2, an integrative V gene database |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=33 |issue=Database issue |pages=D671–4 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15608286 |pmc=540042 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki088 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15608286}}&lt;/ref&gt; ||

Online resources for allergy information are also available on http://www.allergen.org. Such data is valuable for investigation of cross-reactivity between known allergens and analysis of potential allergenicity in proteins. The ''Structural Database of Allergen Proteins'' (SDAP) stores information of allergenic proteins. The ''Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP) Protein Allergen''-Online Database contains sequences of known and putative allergens derived from scientific literature and public databases. ''Allergome'' emphasizes the annotation of allergens that result in an IgE-mediated disease.

Attempts are being made for the extraction of interesting and complex patterns from non-structured text documents in the immunological domain. Such as categorization of allergen cross-reactivity information,&lt;ref name=Miotto05/&gt; identification of cancer-associated gene variants and the classification of immune epitopes.

Immunoinformatics is using the basic bioinformatics tools such as ClustalW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson JD, Higgins DG, Gibson TJ |title=CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=22 |issue=22 |pages=4673–80 |date=November 1994 |pmid=7984417 |pmc=308517 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7984417 |doi=10.1093/nar/22.22.4673}}&lt;/ref&gt; BLAST,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altschul SF, Madden TL, Schäffer AA |title=Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=25 |issue=17 |pages=3389–402 |date=September 1997 |pmid=9254694 |pmc=146917 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9254694 |doi=10.1093/nar/25.17.3389|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TreeView, as well as specialized immunoinformatics tools, such as EpiMatrix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elfaki|first=ME|title=Immunogenicity and immune modulatory effects of in silico predicted L. donovani candidate peptide vaccines|journal=Human Vaccines and Immunotheraputics|date=24 Aug 2012|pmid=22922767|doi=10.4161/hv.21881|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1769–74|pmc=3656064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Groot|first=AS|title=HIV vaccine development by computer assisted design: the GAIA vaccine|journal=Vaccine|date=March 2005|pmid=15755584|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.01.097|volume=23|issue=17–18|pages=2136–48|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMGT/V-QUEST for IG and TR sequence analysis, IMGT/ Collier-de-Perles and IMGT/StructuralQuery&lt;ref&gt;Kaas, Q. &amp; Lefranc, M.

There are also some computational models which focus on protein–protein interactions and networks. There are also tools which are used for T and B cell epitope mapping, proteasomal cleavage site prediction, and TAP– peptide prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montañez R, Navas-Delgado I, Medina MA, Aldana-Montes JF, Sánchez-Jiménez F |title=Information integration of protein-protein interactions as essential tools for immunomics |journal=Cell.

Computational immunology tools is the game between experimental data and mathematically designed computational tools.

== Applications ==

=== Allergies ===
[[Allergy|Allergies]], while a critical subject of immunology, also vary considerably among individuals and sometimes even among genetically similar individuals. The assessment of protein allergenic potential focuses on three main aspects: (i) immunogenicity; (ii) cross-reactivity; and (iii) clinical symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oehlschlager S, Reece P, Brown A |title=Food allergy—towards predictive testing for novel foods |journal=Food Addit Contam |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=1099–107 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11761121 |doi=10.1080/02652030110050131 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immunogenicity is due to responses of an [[IgE]] [[antibody]]-producing B cell and/or of a [[T cell]] to a particular [[allergen]]. Therefore, immunogenicity studies focus mainly on identifying recognition sites of [[B-cells]] and T-cells for allergens. The three-dimensional structural properties of allergens control their allergenicity.

The use of immunoinformatics tools can be useful to predict protein allergenicity and will become increasingly important in the screening of novel foods before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the [[Codex alimentarius]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.org/ CODEX Alimentarius: Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li KB, Issac P, Krishnan A |title=Predicting allergenic proteins using wavelet transform |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=20 |issue=16 |pages=2572–8 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15117757 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bth286 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15117757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious diseases and host responses ===

In the study of infectious diseases and host responses, the mathematical and computer models are a great help. These models were very useful in characterizing the behavior and spread of infectious disease, by understanding the dynamics of the pathogen in the host and the mechanisms of host factors which aid pathogen persistence. Examples include ''Plasmodium falciparum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Noort SP, Nunes MC, Weedall GD, Hviid L, Gomes MG |title=Immune selection and within-host competition can structure the repertoire of variant surface antigens in ''Plasmodium falciparum''—a mathematical model |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=e9778 |year=2010 |pmid=20339540 |pmc=2842302 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nematode infection in ruminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan MS, Isham VS |title=A stochastic model of schistosomiasis immuno-epidemiology |journal=Math Biosci |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=179–98 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9711049 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025556498100147 |doi=10.1016/S0025-5564(98)10014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much has been done in understanding immune responses to various pathogens by integrating genomics
and proteomics with bioinformatics strategies. Many exciting developments in large-scale screening of pathogens are currently taking place. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140801103537/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)] has initiated an endeavor for systematic mapping of B and T cell epitopes of category A-C pathogens. These pathogens include ''Bacillus anthracis'' (anthrax), ''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin (botulism), ''Variola major'' (smallpox), ''Francisella tularensis'' (tularemia), viral hemorrhagic fevers, ''Burkholderia pseudomallei'', ''Staphylococcus enterotoxin'' B, yellow fever, influenza, rabies, Chikungunya virus etc. Rule-based systems have been reported for the automated extraction and curation of influenza A records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miotto O, Tan TW, Brusic V |title=Rule-based knowledge aggregation for large-scale protein sequence analysis of influenza A viruses |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=9 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S7 |year=2008 |pmid=18315860 |pmc=2259408 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-9-S1-S7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This development would lead to the development of an algorithm which would help to identify the conserved regions of pathogen sequences and in turn would be useful for vaccine development. This would be helpful in limiting the spread of infectious disease. Examples include a method for identification of vaccine targets from protein regions of conserved HLA binding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsen LR, Simon C, Kudahl UJ, Bagger FO, Winther O, Reinherz EL, Zhang GL, Brusic V |title=A computational method for identification of vaccine targets from protein regions of conserved human leukocyte antigen binding |journal=BMC Medical Genomics |volume=8(Suppl 4) |issue=S1 |pages= S1|year=2015 |pmid= 26679766|pmc=4682376 |doi=10.1186/1755-8794-8-S4-S1 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682376/pdf/1755-8794-8-S4-S1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and computational assessment of cross-reactivity of broadly neutralizing antibodies against viral pathogens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sun J, Kudahl UJ, Simon C, Cao Z, Reinherz EL, Brusic V |title=Large-Scale Analysis of B-Cell Epitopes on Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin – Implications for Cross-Reactivity of Neutralizing Antibodies |journal=Frontiers in Immunology |volume=5 |issue=38 |pages= 38|year=2014 |pmid= 24570677|pmc=3916768 |doi=10.3389/fimmu.2014.00038 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3916768/pdf/fimmu-05-00038.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These examples illustrate the power of immunoinformatics applications to help solve complex problems in public health. Immunoinformatics could accelerate the discovery process dramatically and potentially shorten the time required for vaccine development. Immunoinformatics tools have been used to design the vaccine against Dengue virus &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali M, Pandey RK, Khatoon N, Narula A, Mishra A, Prajapati VK |title=Exploring dengue genome to construct a multi-epitope based subunit vaccine by utilizing immunoinformatics approach to battle against dengue infection |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=9232 |year=2017 |pmid=28835708 |pmc=5569093 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09199-w |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09199-w}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leishmania &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khatoon N, Pandey RK, Prajapati VK |title=Exploring Leishmania secretory proteins to design B and T cell multi-epitope subunit vaccine using immunoinformatics approach |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=8285 |year=2017 |pmid=28811600 |pmc=5557753 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-08842-w |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08842-w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several models which are helpful in understanding the nature of specificity in immune network and immunogenicity.

For example, it was useful to examine the functional relationship between TAP peptide transport and HLA class I antigen presentation.&lt;ref name="model"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brusic V, van Endert P, Zeleznikow J, Daniel S, Hammer J, Petrovsky N |title=A neural network model approach to the study of human TAP transporter |journal=In Silico Biol. (Gedrukt) |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=109–21 |year=1999 |pmid=11471244 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220500791
}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAP is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, where MHC them class I molecules can bind them and presented to T cells. As TAP does not bind all peptides equally, TAP-binding affinity could influence the ability of a particular peptide to gain access to the MHC class I pathway. Artificial neural network (ANN), a computer model was used to study peptide binding to human TAP and its relationship with MHC class I binding. The affinity of HLA-binding peptides for TAP was found to differ according to the HLA supertype concerned using this method. This research could have important implications for the design of peptide based immuno-therapeutic drugs and vaccines. It shows the power of the modeling approach to understand complex immune interactions.&lt;ref name="model"/&gt;

There exist also methods which integrate peptide prediction tools with computer simulations that can provide detailed information on the immune response dynamics specific to the given pathogen's peptides 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rapin N, Lund O, Bernaschi M, Castiglione F. |title=Computational immunology meets bioinformatics: the use of prediction tools for molecular binding in the simulation of the immune system. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e9862|date=2010  |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009862|pmid=20419125 |pmc=2855701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.


  
=== Cancer Informatics ===

Cancer is the result of somatic mutations which provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage. Recently it has been very important to determine the novel mutations. Genomics and proteomics techniques are used worldwide to identify mutations related to each specific cancer and their treatments. Computational tools are used to predict growth and surface antigens on cancerous cells. There are publications explaining a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk. Algorithm CanPredict was used to indicate how closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaminker JS, Zhang Y, Watanabe C, Zhang Z |title=CanPredict: a computational tool for predicting cancer-associated missense mutations |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=35 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W595–8 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17537827 |pmc=1933186 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm405 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17537827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer immunology has been given so much importance that the data related to it is growing rapidly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor murals''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[mural]]s, and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

== History ==

[[Mural]]s are most commonly defined as wall paintings, works of art integrated into a specific architectural space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''mural'' is derived from the Latin word ''murus'', meaning wall. Walls have long provided a direct support for aesthetic, political, and social ideas expressed with paint. Cave paintings could be considered the earliest murals, followed over time by wall paintings in tombs, temples, churches, civic buildings, and a variety of outdoor spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern murals grow out of this long tradition. From the beginning of the 20th century, murals have had a significant presence in the architecture of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years murals have changed just as everyday life has changed. Murals were painted on church walls and carved into stone or wood on the outside, to educate those who cannot read.  The tradition has carried on to today’s churches. Visual images and language are one of the most powerful forms of communication, both then and more so now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspective Realia - History of Murals|url = http://www.art.utah.edu/murals/What_We_Do/History_of_Murals.html|website = www.art.utah.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals today share much of the history from past murals, though today’s murals can depict anything. The major job of murals today is to band communities together. In an age where everything is materialistic, and most of us don’t know our neighbors let alone anyone else in our community, finding a way to bring people together can be difficult. Murals have a very positive effect on communities, bring people together and bring pride to the community, and that pride tends to stay and spread to other parts of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspective Realia - History of Murals|url = http://www.art.utah.edu/murals/What_We_Do/History_of_Murals.html|website = www.art.utah.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterioration  ==

Outdoor contemporary murals are generally seen as temporary installation, varying from 10 to 20 years due to weathering and vandalism. Outdoor murals are susceptible to, depending on their physical location, extreme weather conditions. A few of the biggest problems facing murals are graffiti, physical destruction, and desaturation as the paint layers weather and are exposed to UV. UV radiation causes cracking, color change and fading. Oxidation chain reactions are the culprit on a chemical level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.conservators-converse.org/2012/05/40th-annual-meeting-architecture-session-may-10-preservation-of-outdoor-public-murals-research-and-public-outreach-by-amanda-norbutus/|title = AIC's Annual Meeting » AIC’s 40th Annual Meeting – Architecture Session, May 10, "Preservation of Outdoor Public Murals: Research and Public Outreach" by Amanda Norbutus|date = May 21, 2012|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|publisher = |last = Norbutus|first = Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental conditions are a major factor in mural deterioration. Freeze-thaw cycles and capillary rise affect the architectural support of the mural and lead to salt efflorescence, cracking, and lifting of the paint layers if incompatible paints or coatings are used and the mural extends to ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals that face South in direct UV rays are susceptible to fade and also binder deterioration.

== Conservation ==
Murals are traditionally commissioned on private buildings and structures, leaving ownership of the mural in the hands of the owner of the building. Gaining permission to conduct conservation is a key first step in the process. Annual inspections of mural will contribute to it lifetime. Inspections are encouraged to take place during the spring season. This will allow for any damage done during the winter months to not be overseen, and will also allow for conservation to being and take place during the summer.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Preventive conservation can take place before a mural begins. Such as preparing the wall properly and using high-quality, lightfast, and compatible materials—is fundamental. Other preventive actions (e.g., regular maintenance, graffiti removal, and community awareness) can help preserve murals. Much of the damage seen on murals is due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance. Sadly, regular maintenance is not always a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building maintenance is also important to the life of the mural. Communities are aware of well-respected buildings, community engagement is important to continue to spread the word about preserving the sight of the mural. Continue to maintain the grounds that the building reside on. A well maintained building will deter vandalism and also [[litter]]ing around the property. These are all preventive steps that can me undertaken by the community at large, contributing to the murals dialog of bringing a community together.

=== Graffiti ===
[[Graffiti]] plagues the presence of many murals, especially those found within city limits. Graffiti is often seen as a form of territory, and once it premiers on a location it invites others to participate in the act of vandalism. Involving the youth of the community with mural project directly is seen as a way to prevent future graffiti, giving them a profound connection and education with and about the project.

If graffiti is present on a mural, it must be removed in a safe and effective manner that does not directly harm the image beneath it. For this reason, removal should be undertaken by a conservator or an artist/technician familiar with the piece after consultation with or under the supervision of a conservator. Removal without adequate testing, or by an individual without adequate experience or supervision, can irreparably harm the mural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caring for an Existing Mural|url = https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/art/murals-murales/caring-eng.aspx|website = www.cci-icc.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-12-11|last = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===
As murals deteriorate, owners and agencies have several treatment options. They may ask the artist to repaint or restore the work, or they may call a conservator who could either treat the mural according to strict conservation guidelines or work with the artist to conserve and possibly restore the work. With contemporary murals, there are many instances of restoration or even re-creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this takes place it is advised to look back for an existing plan set out before the mural project began planning the steps of its conservation, if and when needed. This document should articulate who will be the lead of the project; conservator, artist, committee etc. and will also state who will approve the conservation work need to be performed. 

A conservator should ideally perform the analysis of the state of the mural and outline procedures and materials need to be performed. This should all then be taken into consideration with the expectations of the community and also the owner of the mural (owner of the building).

'''Cultural Competency Training''' is an instruction to achieve cultural competence and the ability to appreciate and interpret accurately other [[culture]]s.

==Cultural competence==
[[Cultural competence]] refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different cultures. Cultural competence comprises four components: (a) awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) attitude towards cultural differences, (c) knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Cultural Candor Inc. Cultural Competency Training| accessdate=12 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Competency has a fundamental importance in every aspect of a work field and that includes school and government setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasponline.org/research-and-policy/advocacy-tools-and-resources/communications-strategies-and-resources/school-climate%E2%80%94connectthedots/the-importance-of-cultural-competence|title=The Importance of Cultural Competence|website=www.nasponline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the amalgamation of different cultures in American society, it has become imperative for teachers and government employees to have some form of cultural competency training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/39783.htm|title=Why Cultural Competence?|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
To cater to an increasingly globalized society, many hospitals, organizations, and employers may choose to implement forms of cultural competency training methods to enhance transparency between language, values, beliefs, and cultural differences.  Training in cultural competence often includes careful consideration of how best to approach people's various forms of diversity.  This new found awareness oftentimes allows military members, educators, medical practitioners, workers, and common citizens to establish equity in their environments and enhances interrelationships between one another for increased productivity levels.  There have been numerous developed theories as to how best to conduct cultural competency training, which oftentimes is dependent on the specific environment and type of work.

== Cultural Competence Training &amp; Identity ==

When defining the ideas that surround cultural competence training, defining what culture is can help to understand the ideas that shape the concept. [[Culture]] is defined as the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of CULTURE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at culture in terms of cultural competence training, certain groups of individuals should be focused on because of their relevance to society. There are many groups that are marginalized and underrepresented; however, four specific areas to look at are:

=== LGBTQIAP ===
[[LGBT|LGBTQIAP]] community, race, and religion. These areas, along with others, represent concepts that make up one’s identity. The approach to identity helps to shape the ideas and themes that go into cultural competence training.
The acronym LGBTQIAP stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, and Pansexual. This particular group of individuals has faced numerous obstacles and has historical events to highlight the inequalities they face such as the Stonewall riots. The [[Stonewall riots]] became a symbol for the gay liberation movement when police attempted a raid at the Stonewall Inn bar to arrest the gay and lesbian patrons and the gay community fought back. Numerous systemic oppressions historically and currently target LGBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyva|first1=Valerie L.|last2=Breshears|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Ringstad|first3=Robin|title=Assessing the Efficacy of LGBT Cultural Competency Training for Aging Services Providers in California’s Central Valley|journal=Journal of Gerontological Social Work|volume=57|issue=2-4|pages=335–348|doi=10.1080/01634372.2013.872215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence training helps professionals develop knowledge and skills on how to address issues and be more aware on the type of language that is politically correct.

=== Race ===
Race is a sensitive aspect of cultural competency training that requires professionals to be able to identify, acknowledge and value cultural differences. Training on this aspect of cultural competence teaches professionals that to ignore racial differences, is a form of microaggression that can help exacerbate racial inequalities.  In order to begin to understand intercultural communications one must understand the historical and social context under which different cultural groups operate.  For example, the history related to the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples in North America, understanding the said group’s value system, their ways of learning, and logic is essential in being able to understand how certain aspects of their culture may be similar or different from our own. Such distinction must be approached with respect and without ascribing superiority or inferiority to the difference.

=== Religion ===
Religious differences can play a role in how professionals interact and communicate with others. [[Religiosity]] refers to the nature and extent of public and private religious activity, including belief in God, prayer, and place of worship attendance. Religiosity is usually linked to formal religious traditions (such as [[Christianity]]), institutions (such as mosques), sacred texts (such as [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]]), and a definitive moral code (such as the Decalogue). Spirituality can be an important part of religion but can also exist independent of extant faith traditions, involving a variety of more individual subjective beliefs and activities related to the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect of cultural competence training professionals should learn how to have religious competence. Religious competence refers to skills, practices, and orientations that recognize, explore, and harness patient religiosity to facilitate diagnosis, recovery, and healing. Religious competence involves the learning and deployment of generic competencies, including active listening and a nonjudgmental stance. It is also an overarching orientation, providing a safe place for discussion of religious issues and identities received in a humble, respectful, and empathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationality ===
in terms of nationality, particularly for people who are immigrants, the recent increase in global migration make them an increasingly common demographic everywhere. Though they will have varying cultures as well. In this aspect, it is important for those who are trained to understand both similarities and differences between them, and the individual they are helping. With this knowledge, it makes the process of aiding the individual more efficient, and successful. &lt;ref&gt;Schouler-Ocak, Graef-Calliess, Tarricone, Qureshi, Kastrup, &amp; Bhugra. (2015). EPA guidance on cultural competence training. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''30''(3), 431-440.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the past Nation the individual has come from, and their journey of immigration as an experience, can shape their mentality. To have specialists with specific nationalities help explain some differences is a helpful strategy. &lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, D. (2017). Cultural competence training and mental health care in refugees and asylum seekers. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''41''(SS), S35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in School ==
School is considered to be the second learning home for kids. Every year a large number of people come to the United States. These groups of people are often families, including small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics|title=Immigration Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today’s world, cultural competency plays a very vital role in shaping the kids future. In the United States, there is an underlying difference among parents as to how a kid should be raised, but it is clear that cultural competency should be taught at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/cultural-competence-and-your-child/|title=Cultural Competence and Your Child {{!}} Wendy McElroy|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|date=2007-09-01|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is not the front runner in cultural competency training amongst children, as Canada and Australia are seemingly far more progressive in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wehearyou.acecqa.gov.au/2014/07/10/what-does-it-mean-to-be-culturally-competent/|title=What does it mean to be culturally competent?|last=ACECQA|first=Author|date=2014-07-10|website=We Hear You|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competency training can be a huge help for the families who are thinking of adopting a foster child, specifically, if that child was born outside of United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/pressroom/features/issue/diversity.asp|title=Diversity &amp; Cultural Competence|website=www.socialworkers.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school is a mixture of different races and cultures and as an educator, one must be sensitive to everyone’s needs. Different cultures act uniquely to the different situations, and as an educator, one has to not only value diversity, but also have a strategy for everyone to feel welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/30402.htm|title=Diversity Toolkit: Cultural Competence for Educators|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in the Workforce ==
Over the years, there have been new developed ways of practicing cultural competency in the workforce. There are many different methods that would allow assistance in cultural competency such as: Global leadership programs, international team building exercises and specific cross-cultural skills training for special executive positions. Having a good grasp on the many different cultures that exist is increasingly becoming a major principle in the workforce. The techniques for cultural competency training must be practiced more than just in class room lecture. Trainers must be extremely educated in this matter to be able to sufficiently train people.  They must take notice of their own biases perspective and about the different types cultures that receive discrimination.

== Cultural Competence Training for Medical Students and Physicians ==
{{see also|Cultural competence in health care}}
In the medical setting, effective communication between clinicians, patients, families and other health care providers is fundamental.

[[Health disparities]] refer to gaps in the quality of health and health care across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Studies have demonstrated the multiple factors that contribute to health disparities.

Cultural Competence Online for Medical Practice (CCOMP) is an attempt in the United States to address one of the factors - the patient-doctor interaction.  The CCOMP project is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  CCOMP offers a clinician's guide to reduce cardiovascular disparities, intended to create effective cross-cultural approaches to care for African-American patients with [[cardiovascular disease]], especially [[hypertension]]. Videos with real patient scenarios and case-based modules are aimed at developing this increased awareness.

'''Dielectric loss''' quantifies a [[dielectric material]]'s inherent dissipation of electromagnetic energy (e.g. heat).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be parameterized in terms of either the '''loss angle''' ''δ'' or the corresponding '''loss tangent''' tan&amp;nbsp;''δ''.  Both refer to the [[phasor]] in the [[complex plane]] whose real and imaginary parts are the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] (lossy) component of an electromagnetic field and its [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] (lossless) counterpart.

==Electromagnetic field perspective==

For time varying electromagnetic fields, the electromagnetic energy is typically viewed as waves propagating either through free space, in a [[transmission line]], in a [[microstrip]] line, or through a [[waveguide]].  Dielectrics are often used in all of these environments to mechanically support electrical conductors and keep them at a fixed separation, or to provide a barrier between different gas pressures yet still transmit electromagnetic power.  [[Maxwell’s equations]] are solved for the electric and magnetic field components of the propagating waves that satisfy the boundary conditions of the specific environment's geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=S. |last1=Ramo |first2=J.R. |last2=Whinnery |first3=T. |last3=Van Duzer |title=Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |date=1994 |ISBN=0-471-58551-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such electromagnetic analyses, the parameters [[permittivity]] ''ε'', [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] ''μ'', and [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] ''σ'' represent the properties of the media through which the waves propagate.  The permittivity can have real and imaginary components (the latter excluding ''σ'' effects, see below) such that

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \varepsilon' - j \varepsilon'' &lt;/math&gt; .

If we assume that we have a wave function such that

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E = \mathbf E_{o}e^{j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;,

then Maxwell's curl equation for the magnetic field can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \mathbf H = j \omega \varepsilon' \mathbf E + ( \omega \varepsilon'' + \sigma )\mathbf E &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε′′'' is the imaginary component of permittivity attributed to ''bound'' charge and dipole relaxation phenomena, which gives rise to energy loss that is indistinguishable from the loss due to the ''free'' charge conduction that is quantified by ''σ''.  The component ''ε′'' represents the familiar lossless permittivity given by the product of the ''free space'' permittivity and the ''relative'' real/absolute permittivity, or ''ε′''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''ε′''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.  The '''loss tangent''' is then defined as the ratio (or angle in a complex plane) of the lossy reaction to the electric field '''E''' in the curl equation to the lossless reaction:

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \frac{\omega \varepsilon'' + \sigma} {\omega \varepsilon'} &lt;/math&gt; .

For dielectrics with small loss, this angle is ≪&amp;nbsp;1 and tan&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''δ''.  After some further calculations to obtain the solution for the fields of the electromagnetic wave, it turns out that the power decays with propagation distance ''z'' as
:&lt;math&gt;P = P_o e^{-\delta k z}&lt;/math&gt;, where:
:*''P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the initial power,
:*&lt;math&gt;k = \omega \sqrt{\mu \varepsilon'} = \tfrac {2 \pi} {\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;,
:*''ω'' is the angular frequency of the wave, and
:*''λ'' is the wavelength in the dielectric material.

There are often other contributions to power loss for electromagnetic waves that are not included in this expression, such as due to the wall currents of the conductors of a transmission line or waveguide. Also, a similar analysis could be applied to the magnetic permeability where

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \mu' - j \mu'' &lt;/math&gt; ,

with the subsequent definition of a '''magnetic loss tangent'''

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta_m = \frac{\mu''} {\mu'} &lt;/math&gt; .

The electric loss tangent can be similarly defined:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vmUdUXlBNIC&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;f=false|first1= L. F. |last1=Chen |first2=C. K. |last2=Ong |first3=C. P. |last3=Neo |first4=V.

upon introduction of an effective dielectric conductivity (see [[relative permittivity#Lossy medium]]).

==Discrete circuit perspective==

For every discrete electrical circuit components, a [[capacitor]] is typically made of a dielectric placed between conductors.  The [[lumped element model]] of a capacitor includes a lossless ideal capacitor in series with a resistor termed the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR), as shown in the figure below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliablecapacitors.com/consider.htm |title=Considerations for a High Performance Capacitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ESR represents losses in the capacitor.  In a low-loss capacitor the ESR is very small (the conduction is low leading to a high resistivity), and in a lossy capacitor the ESR can be large.  Note that the ESR is ''not'' simply the resistance that would be measured across a capacitor by an [[ohmmeter]].  The ESR is a derived quantity representing the loss due to both the dielectric's conduction electrons and the bound dipole relaxation phenomena mentioned above.  In a dielectric, one of the conduction electrons or the [[Dielectric spectroscopy#Dipole relaxation|dipole relaxation]] typically dominates loss in a particular dielectric and manufacturing method.  For the case of the conduction electrons being the dominant loss, then

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ESR} = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon' \omega^2 C} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the lossless capacitance.

[[Image:Loss tangent phasors 1.svg|frame|A real capacitor has a lumped element model of a lossless ideal capacitor in series with an equivalent series resistance (ESR). The loss tangent is defined by the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis.]]

When representing the electrical circuit parameters as vectors in a [[Complex number|complex]] plane, known as [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasors]], a capacitor's '''loss tangent''' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis, as shown in the adjacent diagram.  The loss tangent is then

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \frac {\mathrm{ESR}} {|X_{c}|} = \omega C \cdot \mathrm{ESR} = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon' \omega} &lt;/math&gt; .

Since the same [[alternating current|AC]] current flows through both ''ESR'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', the loss tangent is also the ratio of the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] power loss in the ESR to the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] power oscillating in the capacitor.  For this reason, a capacitor's loss tangent is sometimes stated as its ''[[dissipation factor]]'', or the reciprocal of its ''[[quality factor]] Q'', as follows

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \mathrm{DF} = \frac {1} {Q} &lt;/math&gt;  .

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}

'''Dither''' is an intentionally applied form of [[image noise|noise]] used to randomize [[quantization error]], preventing large-scale patterns such as [[color banding]] in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both [[digital audio]] and [[digital video|video]] data, and is often one of the last stages of [[Audio mastering|mastering]] audio to a [[compact disc|CD]].

A common use of dither is converting a [[greyscale]] image to black and white, such that the density of black dots in the new image approximates the average grey level in the original.

== Etymology ==

{{quote
|…[O]ne of the earliest [applications] of dither came in World War II. Airplane bombers used [[mechanical computers]] to perform navigation and bomb trajectory calculations. Curiously, these computers (boxes filled with hundreds of gears and cogs) performed more accurately when flying on board the aircraft, and less well on ground. Engineers realized that the vibration from the aircraft reduced the error from sticky moving parts. Instead of moving in short jerks, they moved more continuously. Small vibrating motors were built into the computers, and their vibration was called dither from the Middle English verb "didderen," meaning "to tremble." Today, when you tap a mechanical meter to increase its accuracy, you are applying dither, and modern dictionaries define dither as a highly nervous, confused, or agitated state. In minute quantities, dither successfully makes a digitization system a little more analog in the good sense of the word.

==In digital processing and waveform analysis==
Dither is utilized in many different fields where digital processing and analysis are used. These uses include systems using [[digital signal processing]], such as [[digital audio]], [[digital video]], [[digital photography]], [[seismology]], [[radar]] and [[weather forecasting]] systems.

[[Quantization (signal processing)|Quantization]] yields error. If that error is ''[[correlation|correlated]]'' to the signal, the result is potentially cyclical or predictable. In some fields, especially where the receptor is sensitive to such artifacts, cyclical errors yield undesirable artifacts. In these fields introducing dither converts the error to random noise. The field of audio is a primary example of this. The human [[ear]] functions much like a [[Fourier transform]], wherein it hears individual frequencies.&lt;ref name="Deutsch1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Diana|title=The psychology of music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3jkobk4yMMC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=24 May 2011|year=1999|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=978-0-12-213565-1|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hauser|first=Marc D.|title=The evolution of communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QbunyscCJBoC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=24 May 2011|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-58155-4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ear is therefore very sensitive to [[distortion]], or additional frequency content, but far less sensitive to additional random noise at all frequencies such as found in a dithered signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montgomery|first=Christopher (Monty)|title=Digital Show and Tell|url=https://wiki.xiph.org/Videos/Digital_Show_and_Tell#Dither|publisher=[[Xiph.Org]] / [[Red Hat]], Inc.|accessdate=27 February 2013|year=2012–2013|quote=Dither is specially-constructed noise that substitutes for the noise produced by simple quantization.

== Digital audio ==

In audio, dither can be useful to break up periodic [[limit cycle]]s, which are a common problem in digital filters. Random noise is typically less objectionable than the harmonic tones produced by limit cycles.

In a seminal paper published in the [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Journal, Lipshitz and Vanderkooy pointed out that different noise types, with different [[probability density function]]s (PDFs) behave differently when used as dither signals, and suggested optimal levels of dither signal for audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaussian noise]] requires a higher level of added noise for full elimination of distortion than noise with [[rectangular distribution|rectangular]] or [[triangular distribution]]. Triangular distributed noise also minimizes ''noise modulation''{{snd}}audible changes in the volume level of residual noise behind quiet music that draw attention to the noise.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In an analog system, the signal is ''continuous'', but in a [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] digital system, the amplitude of the signal out of the digital system is limited to one of a set of fixed values or numbers. This process is called [[Quantization (sound processing)|quantization]]. Each coded value is a discrete step... if a signal is quantized without using dither, there will be quantization distortion related to the original input signal... In order to prevent this, the signal is "dithered", a process that mathematically removes the harmonics or other highly undesirable distortions entirely, and that replaces it with a constant, fixed noise level.&lt;ref&gt;Mastering Audio: The Art and the Science by [[Bob Katz]], pages 49–50, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final version of audio that goes onto a [[compact disc]] contains only 16 [[bit]]s per sample, but throughout the production process a greater number of bits are typically used to represent the sample. In the end, the digital data must be reduced to 16 bits for pressing onto a CD and distributing.

There are multiple ways to do this. One can, for example, simply discard the excess bits – called ''truncation.'' One can also ''round'' the excess bits to the nearest value. Each of these methods, however, results in predictable and determinable errors in the result. Take, for example, a [[waveform]] that consists of the following values:

  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

If the waveform is reduced by 20%, then the following are the new values:

  0.8 1.6 2.4 3.2 4.0 4.8 5.6 6.4

If these values are truncated it results in the following data:

  0 1 2 3 4 4 5 6

If these values are rounded instead it results in the following data:

  1 2 2 3 4 5 6 6

For any original waveform, the process of reducing the waveform amplitude by 20% results in regular errors. Take for example a sine wave that, for some portion, matches the values above. Every time the sine wave's value hit 3.2, the truncated result would be off by 0.2, as in the sample data above. Every time the sine wave's value hit 4.0, there would be no error since the truncated result would be off by 0.0, also shown above. The magnitude of this error changes regularly and repeatedly throughout the sine wave's cycle. It is precisely this error which manifests itself as [[distortion]]. What the ear hears as distortion is the additional content at discrete frequencies created by the regular and repeated quantization error.

A plausible solution would be to take the 2 digit number (say, 4.8) and round it one direction or the other. For example, it could be rounded to 5 one time and then 4 the next time. This would make the long-term average 4.5 instead of 4, so that over the long-term the value is closer to its actual value. This, on the other hand, still results in determinable (though more complicated) error. Every other time the value 4.8 comes up the result is an error of 0.2, and the other times it is −0.8. This still results in a repeating, quantifiable error.

Another plausible solution would be to take 4.8 and round it so that the first four times out of five it is rounded up to 5, and the fifth time it is rounded to 4. This would average out to exactly 4.8 over the long term. Unfortunately, however, it still results in repeatable and determinable errors, and those errors still manifest themselves as distortion to the ear (though [[oversampling]] can reduce this).

This leads to the ''dither'' solution. Rather than predictably rounding up or down in a repeating pattern, it is possible to round up or down in a random pattern. Dithering is a way to randomly toggle the results between 4 and 5 so that 80% of the time it ended up on 5 then it would average 4.8 over the long run but would have random, non-repeating error in the result.

If a series of random numbers between 0.0 and 0.9 (ex: 0.6, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, etc.) are calculated and added to the results of the equation, two times out of ten the result will truncate back to 4 (if 0.0 or 0.1 are added to 4.8) and the rest of the times it will truncate to 5, but each given situation has a random 20% chance of rounding to 4 or 80% chance of rounding to 5. Over the long haul this will result in results that average to 4.8 and a quantization error that is random — or noise. This "noise" result is less offensive to the ear than the determinable distortion that would result otherwise.

=== Usage ===
Dither should be added to any low-amplitude or highly periodic signal before any quantization or re-quantization process, in order to de-correlate the quantization noise from the input signal and to prevent non-linear behavior (distortion); the lesser the bit depth, the greater the dither must be. The result of the process still yields distortion, but the distortion is of a random nature so the resulting noise is, effectively, de-correlated from the intended signal. Any bit-reduction process should add dither to the waveform before the reduction is performed.

=== Different types ===
'''RPDF''' stands for "Rectangular Probability Density Function," equivalent to a roll of a [[dice|die]]. Any number has the same random [[probability]] of surfacing.

'''TPDF''' stands for "[[Triangular distribution|Triangular Probability Density Function]]," equivalent to a roll of two dice (the sum of two independent samples of RPDF).

'''Gaussian PDF''' is equivalent to a roll of a large number of dice. The relationship of probabilities of results follows a bell-shaped, or [[Gaussian curve]], typical of dither generated by analog sources such as microphone preamplifiers. If the bit depth of a recording is sufficiently great, that [[preamplifier]] noise will be sufficient to dither the recording.

'''Colored dither''' is sometimes mentioned as dither that has been filtered to be different from [[white noise]]. Some dither algorithms use noise that has more energy in the higher frequencies so as to lower the energy in the critical audio band.

'''[[Noise shaping]]''' is a filtering process that shapes the spectral energy of quantisation error, typically to either de-emphasise frequencies to which the ear is most sensitive or separate the signal and noise bands completely. If dither is used, its final spectrum depends on whether it is added inside or outside the feedback loop of the noise shaper: if inside, the dither is treated as part of the error signal and shaped along with actual quantisation error; if outside, the dither is treated as part of the original signal and linearises quantisation without being shaped itself. In this case, the final noise floor is the sum of the flat dither spectrum and the shaped quantisation noise. While real-world noise shaping usually includes in-loop dithering, it is also possible to use it without adding dither at all, in which case the usual harmonic-distortion effects still appear at low signal levels.

==== Which types to use ====
If the signal being dithered is to undergo further processing, then it should be processed with a triangular-type dither that has an amplitude of two quantisation steps; for example, so that the dither values computed range from, say, −1 to +1, or 0 to 2.&lt;ref name=vanderkooy87/&gt; This is the "lowest power ideal" dither, in that it does not introduce noise modulation (which would manifest as a constant noise floor), and completely eliminates the harmonic distortion from quantisation. If a ''colored'' dither is used instead at these intermediate processing stages, then frequency content may "bleed" into other frequency ranges that are more noticeable, which could become distractingly audible.

If the signal being dithered is to undergo no further processing — if it is being dithered to its final result for distribution — then a "colored" dither or noise shaping is appropriate. This can effectively lower the audible noise level, by putting most of that noise in a frequency range where it is less critical.

[[Image:256colortestthing.png|thumb|right|256 color dithering with [[IrfanView]]]]
'''Dithering''' is used in [[computer graphics]] to create the illusion of "[[color]] depth" in images with a limited [[palette (computing)|color palette]] - a technique also known as [[color quantization]]. In a dithered image, colors that are not available in the palette are approximated by a diffusion of colored [[pixel]]s from within the available palette. The human eye perceives the diffusion as a mixture of the colors within it (see [[color vision]]).  Dithered images, particularly those with relatively few colors, can often be distinguished by a characteristic graininess or speckled appearance.

By its nature, dithering introduces pattern into an image - the theory being that the image will be viewed from such a distance that the pattern is not discernible to the human eye.  Unfortunately this is often not the case, and often the patterning is visible - for example, often with images found on the web.  In these circumstances it has been shown that a [[Blue noise#Blue noise|blue noise]] dither pattern is the least unsightly and distracting.&lt;ref name=dithernoise&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The error diffusion techniques were some of the first methods to generate blue noise dithering patterns. However, other techniques such as [[ordered dithering]] can also generate blue noise dithering without the tendency to degenerate into areas with artifacts.

=== Examples ===
[[Image:Color dithering on a towel.jpg|thumb|Color dithering on a towel]]
Reducing the color depth of an image can often have significant visual side-effects. If the original image is a photograph, it is likely to have thousands, or even millions of distinct colors. The process of constraining the available colors to a specific ''color palette'' effectively throws away a certain amount of color information.

A number of factors can affect the resulting quality of a color-reduced image. Perhaps most significant is the color palette that will be used in the reduced image. For example, an original image (''Figure 1'') may be reduced to the 216-color "[[web-safe]]" color palette. If the original pixel colors are simply translated into the closest available color from the palette, no dithering will occur (''Figure 2''). However, typically this approach will result in flat areas (contours) and a loss of detail, and may produce patches of color that are significantly different from the original. Shaded or gradient areas may appear as ''color bands'', which may be distracting. The application of dithering can help to minimize such visual artifacts, and usually results in a better representation of the original (''Figure 3''). Dithering helps to reduce [[color banding]] and flatness.

One of the problems associated with using a fixed color palette is that many of the needed colors may not be available in the palette, and many of the available colors may not be needed; a fixed palette containing mostly shades of green would not be well-suited for images that do not contain many shades of green, for instance. The use of an optimized color palette can be of benefit in such cases. An optimized color palette is one in which the available colors are chosen based on how frequently they are used in the original source image. If the image is reduced based on an optimized palette the result is often much closer to the original (''Figure 4'').

The number of colors available in the palette is also a contributing factor. If, for example, the palette is limited to only 16 colors then the resulting image could suffer from additional loss of detail, resulting in even more pronounced problems with flatness and color banding (''Figure 5''). Once again, dithering can help to minimize such artifacts (''Figure 6'').

=== Applications ===
Many different kinds of display hardware, including early computer [[graphics card|video adapters]] as well as many modern [[liquid crystal display|LCDs]] used in [[mobile phone]]s and inexpensive [[digital camera]]s, show a much smaller color range than more advanced displays. One common application of dithering is to more accurately display graphics containing a greater range of colors than the hardware is capable of showing. For example, dithering might be used in order to display a photographic image containing [[True Color|millions of colors]] on video hardware that is only capable of showing 256 colors at a time. The 256 available colors would be used to generate a dithered approximation of the original image. Without dithering, the colors in the original image might simply be "rounded off" to the closest available color, resulting in a new image that is a poor representation of the original. Dithering takes advantage of the human eye's tendency to "mix" two colors in close proximity to one another.

Some LCDs may use [[temporal dithering]] to achieve a similar effect. By alternating each pixel's color value rapidly between two approximate colors in the panel's color space (also known as [[Frame Rate Control]]), a display panel which natively supports only 18-bit color (6 bits per channel) can represent a 24-bit "true" color image (8 bits per channel).&lt;ref&gt;6-Bit vs. 8-Bit... PVA/MVA vs. TN+Film
Are Things Changing? [http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/6bit_8bit.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dithering such as this, in which the computer's display hardware is the primary limitation on [[color depth]], is commonly employed in software such as [[web browser]]s. Since a web browser may be retrieving graphical elements from an external source, it may be necessary for the browser to perform dithering on images with too many colors for the available display. It was due to problems with dithering that a color palette known as the "[[Web-safe color|web-safe color palette]]" was identified, for use in choosing colors that would not be dithered on displays with only 256 colors available.

But even when the total number of available colors in the display hardware is high enough to "properly" render full color digital photographs (such as those using 15- and 16-bit RGB [[Highcolor|Hicolor]] 32,768/65,536 color modes), banding may still be evident to the eye, especially in large areas of smooth shade transitions (although the original image file has no banding at all). Dithering the 32 or 64 RGB levels will result in a pretty good "pseudo [[True Color|truecolor]]" display approximation, which the eye will not resolve as ''grainy''. Furthermore, images displayed on 24-bit RGB hardware (8 bits per RGB primary) can be dithered to simulate somewhat higher bit depth, and/or to minimize the loss of hues available after a [[gamma correction]]. High-end still image processing software commonly uses these techniques for improved display.

Another useful application of dithering is for situations in which the [[graphics file format|graphic file format]] is the limiting factor. In particular, the commonly used [[GIF]] format is restricted to the use of 256 or fewer colors in many graphics editing programs. Images in other file formats, such as [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], may also have such a restriction imposed on them for the sake of a reduction in file size. Images such as these have a fixed color palette defining all the colors that the image may use. For such situations, [[bitmap graphics editor|graphical editing software]] may be responsible for dithering images prior to saving them in such restrictive formats.

Dithering is analogous to the [[halftone]] technique used in [[printing]].  The recent widespread adoption of [[inkjet printer]]s and their ability to print isolated dots has increased the use of dithering in printing.  For this reason the term ''dithering'' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ''halftoning'', particularly in association with [[digital printing]].

A typical desktop inkjet printer can print just 16 colors (the combination of dot or no dot from cyan, magenta, yellow and black print heads). Some of these ink combinations are not useful though, because when the black ink is used it typically obscures any of the other colors.  To reproduce a large range of colors, dithering is used.  In densely printed areas, where the color is dark the dithering is often not visible because the dots of ink merge producing a more uniform print.  However, a close inspection of the light areas of a print where the dithering has placed dots much further apart reveals the tell-tale dots of dithering.

=== Algorithms ===
There are several [[algorithm]]s designed to perform dithering. One of the earliest, and still one of the most popular, is the [[Floyd–Steinberg dithering]] algorithm, which was developed in 1975. One of the strengths of this algorithm is that it minimizes visual artifacts through an [[Error diffusion|error-diffusion]] process; error-diffusion algorithms typically produce images that more closely represent the original than simpler dithering algorithms.&lt;ref name=dhalf&gt;{{cite web

Dithering methods include:
* ''Thresholding'' (also average dithering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;): each pixel value is compared against a fixed threshold. This may be the simplest dithering algorithm there is, but it results in immense loss of detail and contouring.&lt;ref name=dhalf /&gt;
* ''Random dithering'' was the first attempt (at least as early as 1951) to remedy the drawbacks of thresholding. Each pixel value is compared against a random threshold, resulting in a staticky image. Although this method doesn't generate patterned artifacts, the noise tends to swamp the detail of the image. It is analogous to the practice of [[mezzotint]]ing.&lt;ref name=dhalf /&gt;
* ''Patterning'' dithers using a fixed pattern.  For each of the input values a fixed pattern is placed in the output image.  The biggest disadvantage of this technique is that the output image is larger (by a factor of the fixed pattern size) than the input pattern.&lt;ref name=dhalf /&gt;
* ''[[Ordered dithering]]'' dithers using a "dither matrix".  For every pixel in the image the value of the pattern at the corresponding location is used as a threshold. Neighboring pixels do not affect each other, making this form of dithering suitable for use in animations. Different patterns can generate completely different dithering effects.  Though simple to implement, this dithering algorithm is not easily changed to work with free-form, arbitrary palettes.
** A ''[[halftone]] dithering'' matrix produces a look similar to that of halftone screening in newspapers. This is a form of clustered dithering, in that dots tend to cluster together. This can help hide the adverse effects of blurry pixels found on some older output devices.  The primary use for this method is in [[offset printing]] and [[laser printer]]s. In both these devices the ink or toner prefers to clump together and will not form the isolated dots generated by the other dithering methods. 
** A ''Bayer matrix''&lt;ref name=dhalf /&gt; produces a very distinctive cross-hatch pattern.
** A matrix tuned for ''[[blue noise]]'', such as those generated by the "void-and-cluster" method,&lt;ref name=voidcluster&gt;{{cite web

* ''[[Error diffusion|Error-diffusion]] dithering'' is a feedback process that diffuses the quantization error to neighboring pixels.
**[[Floyd–Steinberg dithering|Floyd–Steinberg (FS) dithering]] only diffuses the error to neighboring pixels. This results in very fine-grained dithering.
**[[Minimized average error dithering]] by Jarvis, Judice, and Ninke diffuses the error also to pixels one step further away. The dithering is coarser, but has fewer visual artifacts. However, it is slower than Floyd–Steinberg dithering, because it distributes errors among 12 nearby pixels instead of 4 nearby pixels for Floyd–Steinberg.
**[[Stucki dithering]] is based on the above, but is slightly faster. Its output tends to be clean and sharp.
**[[Burkes dithering]] is a simplified form of Stucki dithering that is faster, but is less clean than Stucki dithering.

**[[Atkinson dithering]] was developed by Apple programmer [[Bill Atkinson]], and resembles Jarvis dithering and Sierra dithering, but it's faster. Another difference is that it doesn't diffuse the entire quantization error, but only three quarters. It tends to preserve detail well, but very light and dark areas may appear blown out.

Stimulated [[Brillouin scattering|Brillouin Scattering]] (SBS) is a [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical effect]] that limits the launched optical power in [[fiber optic]] systems. This power limit can be increased by dithering the transmit optical center frequency, typically implemented by modulating the laser's bias input. See also [[polarization scrambling]].

An artificial jitter (dither) can be used in electronics for reducing quantization errors in A/D-Elements.&lt;ref&gt;Analog Devices: A Technical Tutorial on Digital Signal Synthesis. 1999. http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/450968421DDS_Tutorial_rev12-2-99.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another common application is to get through EMC tests by smearing out single frequency peaks.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder, D., Moritz, M.,: Investigation into possible effects resulting from dithered clock oscillators on EMC measurements and interference to radio transmission systems, University of Hertfordshire, 2000. http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/ra/topics/research/topics/emc/ay3377/invest.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of temporal dithering has recently been introduced in [[financial market]]s, in order to reduce the incentive to engage in [[high-frequency trading]].  ParFX, a London [[foreign exchange market]] that began trading in 2013, imposes brief random delays on all incoming orders; other currency exchanges are reportedly experimenting with the technique.  The use of such temporal buffering or dithering has been advocated more broadly in financial trading of equities, commodities, and derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://regulatorystudies.columbian.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs1866/f/downloads/Mannix%20Races%20Rushes%20and%20Runs.pdf "Races, Rushes, and Runs:  Taming the Turbulence in Financial Trading"], Brian F.

'''Eukaryotic transcription''' is the elaborate process that [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells use to copy genetic information stored in [[DNA]] into units of [[RNA]] replica. Gene transcription occurs in both eukaryotic and [[prokaryotic]] cells.  Unlike prokaryotic RNA polymerase that initiates the transcription of all different types of RNA, RNA polymerase in eukaryotes (including humans) comes in three variations, each encoding a different type of gene. A eukaryotic cell has a nucleus that separates the processes of transcription and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. Eukaryotic transcription occurs within the nucleus where DNA is packaged into [[nucleosomes]] and higher order [[chromatin]] structures. The complexity of the eukaryotic genome necessitates a great variety and complexity of gene expression control.

==Overview==
Transcription is the process of copying genetic information stored in a DNA strand into a transportable [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strand of RNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Eukaryotic transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell and proceeds in three sequential stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=James|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-321-76243-6|edition=7th|author2=Tania A. Baker |author3=Stephen P. Bell |author4=Alexander Gann |author5=Michael Levine |author6=Richard Losik |author7=Stephen C. Harrison }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transcriptional machinery that catalyzes this complex reaction has at its core three multi-subunit RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcribing RNA that codes for genes that become structural components of the ribosome.
&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

Protein coding genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that carry the information from DNA to the site of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Although mRNAs possess great diversity, they are not the most abundant RNA species made in the cell. The so-called non-coding RNAs account for the large majority of the transcriptional output of a cell.&lt;ref name=Mattick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattick|first=J. S.|title=Non-coding RNAs: the architects of eukaryotic complexity|journal=EMBO Reports|date=1 November 2001|volume=2|issue=11|pages=986–991|doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kve230|pmid=11713189|pmc=1084129}}&lt;/ref&gt; These non-coding RNAs perform a variety of important cellular functions.&lt;ref name=Mattick /&gt;

RNA polymerase I (Pol I) catalyses the transcription of all rRNA genes except 5S.&lt;ref name="Lodish 7th" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cramer /&gt; These rRNA genes are organised into a single transcriptional unit and are transcribed into a continuous transcript. This precursor is then processed into three rRNAs: 18S, 5.8S, and 28S. The transcription of rRNA genes takes place in a specialised structure of the nucleus called the nucleolus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sirri|first=Valentina|author2=Silvio Urcuqui-Inchima |author3=Pascal Roussel |author4=Danièle Hernandez-Verdun |title=Nucleolus: the fascinating nuclear body|journal=Histochem Cell Biol.|year=2008|volume=129|issue=1|pages=13–31|doi=10.1007/s00418-007-0359-6|pmc=2137947|pmid=18046571}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the transcribed rRNAs are combined with proteins to form [[ribosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fromont-Racine|first=Micheline|author2=Senger, Bruno |author3=Saveanu, Cosmin |author4= Fasiolo, Franco |title=Ribosome assembly in eukaryotes|journal=Gene|date=August 2003|volume=313|pages=17–42|doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(03)00629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These modifications and their regulation constitute the operational code for the CTD to control transcription initiation, elongation and termination and to couple transcription and RNA processing.&lt;ref name=corden /&gt;

==Initiation==

The initiation of gene transcription in eukaryotes occurs in specific steps.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  First, an RNA polymerase along with general [[transcription factor]]s binds to the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of the gene to form a closed complex called the [[Transcription preinitiation complex|preinitiation complex]]. The subsequent transition of the complex from the closed state to the open state results in the melting or separation of the two DNA strands and the positioning of the template strand to the active site of the RNA polymerase. Without the need of a primer, RNA polymerase can initiate the synthesis of a new RNA chain using the template DNA strand to guide ribonucleotide selection and polymerization chemistry.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; However, many of the initiated syntheses are aborted before the transcripts reach a significant length (~10 nucleotides). During these abortive cycles, the polymerase keeps making and releasing short transcripts until it is able to produce a transcript that surpasses ten nucleotides in length. Once this threshold is attained, RNA polymerase passes the promoter and transcription proceeds to the elongation phase.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===Eukaryotic promoters and general transcription factors===
Pol II-transcribed genes contain a region in the immediate vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS) that binds and positions the preinitiation complex. This region is called the core promoter because of its essential role in transcription initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Jennifer|author2=James T. Kadonaga|title=The RNA polymerase II core promoter: a key component in the regulation of gene expression|journal=Genes Dev.|year=2002|volume=16|issue=20|pages=2583–2592|doi=10.1101/gad.1026202|pmid=12381658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenhard|first=Boris|author2=Sandelin, Albin |author3=Carninci, Piero |title=Metazoan promoters: emerging characteristics and insights into transcriptional regulation|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=6 March 2012|doi=10.1038/nrg3163|pmid=22392219|volume=13|pages=233–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different classes of sequence elements are found in the promoters. For example, the [[TATA box]] is the highly conserved DNA recognition sequence for the TATA box binding protein, [[TATA Binding Protein|TBP]], whose binding initiates transcription complex assembly at many genes.

Eukaryotic genes also contain regulatory sequences beyond the core promoter. These [[Cis-regulatory element|cis-acting control elements]] bind transcriptional activators or repressors to increase or decrease transcription from the core promoter. Well-characterized regulatory elements include [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], [[Silencer (DNA)|silencers]], and [[Insulator (genetics)|insulators]]. These regulatory sequences can be spread over a large genomic distance, sometimes located hundreds of kilobases from the core promoters.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

General transcription factors are a group of proteins involved in transcription initiation and regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; These factors typically have DNA-binding domains that bind specific sequence elements of the core promoter and help recruit RNA polymerase to the transcriptional start site.
General transcription factors for RNA polymerase II include [[Transcription factor II D|TFIID]], [[Transcription factor II A|TFIIA]], [[Transcription factor II B|TFIIB]], [[Transcription factor II F|TFIIF]], [[Transcription factor II E|TFIIE]], and [[Transcription factor II H|TFIIH]].&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orphanides|first=G|author2=Lagrange, T |author3=Reinberg, D |title=The general transcription factors of RNA polymerase II.|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 November 1996|volume=10|issue=21|pages=2657–2683|doi=10.1101/gad.10.21.2657|pmid=8946909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROEDER|first=R|title=The role of general initiation factors in transcription by RNA polymerase II|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1996|volume=21|issue=9|pages=327–335|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(96)10050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly of preinitiation complex===
To prepare for transcription, a complete set of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase need to be assembled at the core promoter to form the ~2 million dalton preinitiation complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Yuan|author2=Jie Fang |author3=Dylan J. Taatjes |author4=Eva Nogales |title=Structural visualization of key steps in human transcription initiation|journal=Nature|date=28 March 2013|volume=495|pages=481–486|doi=10.1038/nature11991 |pmid=23446344 |pmc=3612373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, for promoters that contain a TATA box near the TSS, the recognition of TATA box by the TBP subunit of TFIID initiates the assembly of a transcription complex. The next proteins to enter are TFIIA and TFIIB, which stabilize the DNA-TFIID complex and recruit Pol II in association with TFIIF and additional transcription factors. TFIIF serves as the bridge between the TATA-bound TBP and polymerase. One of the last transcription factors to be recruited to the preinitiation complex is TFIIH, which plays an important role in promoter melting and escape.&lt;ref name=holstege /&gt;

===Promoter melting and open complex formation===
For pol II-transcribed genes, and unlike bacterial RNA polymerase, promoter melting requires hydrolysis of ATP and is mediated by TFIIH.&lt;ref name=holstege&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holstege|first=F. C.P.|title=Three transitions in the RNA polymerase II transcription complex during initiation|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=15 December 1997|volume=16|issue=24|pages=7468–7480|doi=10.1093/emboj/16.24.7468|pmid=9405375|pmc=1170346}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TFIIH is a ten-subunit protein, including both [[ATPase]] and [[protein kinase]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=SVEJSTRUP|first=J|author2=VICHI, P |author3=EGLY, J |title=The multiple roles of transcription/repair factor TFIIH|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1996|volume=21|issue=9|pages=346–350|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(96)10046-3|pmid=8870499}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the upstream promoter DNA is held in a fixed position by TFIID, TFIIH pulls downstream double-stranded DNA into the cleft of the polymerase, driving the separation of DNA strands and the transition of the preinitiation complex from the closed to open state. TFIIB aids in open complex formation by binding the melted DNA and stabilizing the [[transcription bubble
]].

===Abortive initiation===
{{Main|Abortive initiation}}
Once the initiation complex is open, the first ribonucleotide is brought into the active site to initiate the polymerization reaction in the absence of a primer.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; This generates a nascent RNA chain that forms a hetero-duplex with the template DNA strand. However, before entering the elongation phase, polymerase may terminate prematurely and release a short, truncated transcript. This process is called abortive initiation.&lt;ref name=revyakin /&gt; Many cycles of abortive initiation may occur before the transcript grows to sufficient length to promote polymerase escape from the promoter. Throughout abortive initiation cycles, RNA polymerase remains bound to the promoter and pulls downstream DNA into its catalytic cleft in a scrunching-kind of motion.&lt;ref name=revyakin&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Revyakin A, Liu C, Ebright RH, Strick TR |title=Abortive Initiation and Productive Initiation by RNA Polymerase Involve DNA Scrunching|journal=Science|date=17 November 2006|volume=314|issue=5802|pages=1139–1143|doi=10.1126/science.1131398|pmid=17110577|pmc=2754787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoter escape===
When a transcript attains the threshold length of ten nucleotides, it enters the RNA exit channel.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The polymerase breaks its interactions with the promoter elements and any regulatory proteins associated with the initiation complex that it no longer needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dvir|first=Arik|title=Promoter escape by RNA polymerase II|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression|date=September 2002|volume=1577|issue=2|pages=208–223|doi=10.1016/S0167-4781(02)00453-0|pmid=12213653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter escape in eukaryotes requires ATP hydrolysis and, in the case of Pol II-phosphorylation of the CTD. Meanwhile, the transcription bubble collapses down to 12-14 nucleotides, providing kinetic energy required for the escape.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

==Elongation==
After escaping the promoter and shedding most of the transcription factors for initiation, the polymerase acquires new factors for the next phase of transcription: elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pokholok|first=Dmitry K|author2=Hannett, Nancy M |author3=Young, Richard A |title=Exchange of RNA Polymerase II Initiation and Elongation Factors during Gene Expression In Vivo|journal=Molecular Cell|date=April 2002|volume=9|issue=4|pages=799–809|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(02)00502-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wade|first=Joseph T|author2=Struhl, Kevin|title=The transition from transcriptional initiation to elongation|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|date=April 2008|volume=18|issue=2|pages=130–136|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.12.008|pmc=2563432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcription elongation is a [[Processivity|processive]] process. Double stranded DNA that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for RNA synthesis. For every DNA [[base pair]] separated by the advancing polymerase, one hybrid RNA:DNA base pair is immediately formed. DNA strands and nascent RNA chain exit from separate channels; the two DNA strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand RNA emerges alone.

===Elongation factors===
Among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors, thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Abbie|author2=Core, Leighton J. |author3=Lis, John T. |title=Breaking barriers to transcription elongation|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=August 2006|volume=7|issue=8|pages=557–567|doi=10.1038/nrm1981|pmid=16936696}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different classes of elongation factors. Some factors can increase the overall rate of transcribing, some can help the polymerase through transient pausing sites, and some can assist the polymerase to transcribe through chromatin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arndt|first=Karen|author2=Caroline Kane|title=Running with RNA polymerase: eukaryotic transcript elongation|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=1 October 2003|volume=19|issue=10|pages=543–550|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2003.08.008|pmid=14550628}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the elongation factors, [[P-TEFb]], is particularly important.&lt;ref name=bres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brès|first=Vanessa|author2=Yoh, Sunnie M |author3=Jones, Katherine A |title=The multi-tasking P-TEFb complex|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=June 2008|volume=20|issue=3|pages=334–340|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2008.04.008|pmc=2628440}}&lt;/ref&gt; P-TEFb phosphorylates the second residue (Ser-2) of the CTD repeats (YSPTSPS) of the bound Pol II. P-TEFb also phosphorylates and activates SPT5 and TAT-SF1. SPT5 is a universal transcription factor that helps recruit [[Five prime cap|5'-capping]] enzyme to Pol II with a CTD phosphorylated at Ser-5. TAF-SF1 recruits components of the RNA splicing machinery to the Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD. P-TEFb also helps suppress transient pausing of polymerase when it encounters certain sequences immediately following initiation.&lt;ref name=bres /&gt;

===Transcription fidelity===
Transcription fidelity is achieved through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct [[nucleoside triphosphate]] (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding base in the DNA is admitted to the active center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westover|first=Kenneth D.|author2=Bushnell, David A. |author3=Kornberg, Roger D. |title=Structural Basis of Transcription|journal=Cell|date=November 2004|volume=119|issue=4|pages=481–489|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Dong|author2=Bushnell, David A. |author3=Westover, Kenneth D. |author4=Kaplan, Craig D. |author5= Kornberg, Roger D. |title=Structural Basis of Transcription: Role of the Trigger Loop in Substrate Specificity and Catalysis|journal=Cell|date=December 2006|volume=127|issue=5|pages=941–954|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.11.023 |pmid=17129781 |pmc=1876690}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA polymerase performs two known proof reading functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The former removes the incorrectly inserted ribonucleotide by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. Elongation factor TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=D.|author2=Bushnell, D.

===Pausing, poising, and backtracking===
Transcription elongation is not a smooth ride along the DNA railway. For proofreading, the polymerase is made to back-up, erase some of the RNA it has already made and have another go at transcription.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; In general, RNA polymerase does not transcribe through a gene at a constant pace. Rather it pauses periodically at certain sequences, sometimes for long periods of time before resuming transcription.&lt;ref name=Adelman /&gt; In extreme cases, for example, when the polymerase encounters a damaged nucleotide, it comes to a complete halt. More often, an elongating polymerase is stalled near the promoter.&lt;ref name=Adelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelman|first=Karen|author2=Lis, John T.|title=Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=18 September 2012|volume=13|issue=10|pages=720–731|doi=10.1038/nrg3293|pmc=3552498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter-proximal pausing during early elongation is a commonly used mechanism for regulating genes poised to be expressed rapidly or in a coordinated fashion. Pausing is mediated by a complex called NELF (negative elongation factor) in collaboration with DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor containing SPT4/SPT5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Missra|first=A.|author2=Gilmour, D. S.|title=Interactions between DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor), NELF (negative elongation factor), and the Drosophila RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complex|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=4 June 2010|volume=107|issue=25|pages=11301–11306|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000681107|pmid=20534440|pmc=2895096}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blockage is released once the polymerase receives an activation signal, such as the phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD tail by P-TEFb. Other elongation factors such as ELL and TFIIS stimulate the rate of elongation by limiting the length of time that polymerase pauses.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===RNA processing===
Elongating polymerase is associated with a set of protein factors required for various types of RNA processing.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; mRNA is capped as soon as it emerges from the RNA-exit channel of the polymerase. After capping, dephosphorylation of Ser-5 within the CTD repeats may be responsible for dissociation of the capping machinery. Further phosphorylation of Ser-2 causes recruitment of the RNA splicing machinery that catalyzes the removal of non-coding introns to generate mature mRNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Alternative splicing expands the protein complements in eukaryotes. Just as with 5’-capping and splicing, the CTD tail is involved in recruiting enzymes responsible for [[Polyadenylation|3’-polyadenylation]], the final RNA processing event that is coupled with the termination of transcription.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

==Termination==
The last stage of transcription is termination, which leads to the dissociation of the complete transcript and the release of RNA polymerase from the template DNA.The process differs for each of the three RNA polymerases.&lt;ref name="Richard_rnap"/&gt; 
The mechanism of termination is the least understood of the three transcription stages.

===Factor-dependent===
The termination of transcription of pre-rRNA genes by polymerase Pol I is performed by a system that needs a specific transcription termination factor.&lt;ref name="Lodish 7th" /&gt; The mechanism used bears some resemblance to the rho-dependent termination in prokaryotes.&lt;ref name=Suz-nature&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancey|first=Suzanne|title=DNA transcription|journal=Nature Education|year=2008|volume=1|issue=41|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-transcription-426|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of ribosomal DNA repeats, sometimes distributed over multiple chromosomes. Termination of transcription occurs in the ribosomal intergenic spacer region that contains several transcription termination sites upstream of a Pol I pausing site. Through a yet unknown mechanism, the 3’-end of the transcript is cleaved, generating a large primary rRNA molecule that is further processed into the mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs.

As Pol II reaches the end of a gene, two protein complexes carried by the CTD, CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) and CSTF (cleavage stimulation factor), recognize the poly-A signal in the transcribed RNA.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; Poly-A-bound CPSF and CSTF recruit other proteins to carry out RNA cleavage and then polyadenylation. Poly-A polymerase adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; The long poly-A tail is unique to transcripts made by Pol II.&lt;br /&gt;
 
In the process of terminating transcription by Pol I and Pol II, the elongation complex does not dissolve immediately after the RNA is cleaved. The polymerase continues to move along the template, generating a second RNA molecule associated with the elongation complex.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Two models have been proposed to explain how termination is achieved at last.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richard|first=P.|author2=Manley, J. L.|title=Transcription termination by nuclear RNA polymerases|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 June 2009|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1247–1269|doi=10.1101/gad.1792809|pmc=2763537}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The allosteric model states that when transcription proceeds through the termination sequence, it causes disassembly of elongation factors and/or an assembly of termination factors that cause conformational changes of the elongation complex.&lt;ref name=Suz-nature /&gt;&lt;ref name=RNAPII&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosonina|first=E.|title=Terminating the transcript: breaking up is hard to do|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 May 2006|volume=20|issue=9|pages=1050–1056|doi=10.1101/gad.1431606|pmid=16651651}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The torpedo model suggests that a 5' to 3' [[exonuclease]] degrades the second RNA as it emerges from the elongation complex. Polymerase is released as the highly processive exonuclease overtakes it. It is proposed that an emerging view will express a merge of these two models.&lt;ref name=RNAPII /&gt;

===Factor-independent===
RNA polymerase III can terminate transcription efficiently without the involvement of additional factors. The Pol III termination signal consists of a stretch of [[thymine]]s (on the nontemplate strand) located within 40bp downstream from the 3' end of mature RNAs.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; The poly-T termination signal pauses Pol III and causes it to backtrack to the nearest [[Hairpin loop|RNA hairpin]] to become a “dead-end” complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=S.|author2=Yuzenkova, Y. |author3=Zenkin, N. |title=Mechanism of Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase III Transcription Termination|journal=Science|date=27 June 2013|volume=340|issue=6140|pages=1577–1580|doi=10.1126/science.1237934|pmc=3760304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the allosteric mechanism of termination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epshtein|first=Vitaly|author2=Cardinale, Christopher J. |author3=Ruckenstein, Andrei E. |author4=Borukhov, Sergei |author5= Nudler, Evgeny |title=An Allosteric Path to Transcription Termination|journal=Molecular Cell|date=December 2007|volume=28|issue=6|pages=991–1001|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2007.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RNA hairpin allosterically opens Pol III and causes the elongation complex to disintegrate. The extensive structure embedded in the Pol III-transcript thus is responsible for the factor-independent release of Pol III at the end of a gene. RNA-duplex-dependent termination is an ancient mechanism that dates back to the last universal common ancestor.

==Eukaryotic transcriptional control==
The [[regulation of gene expression]] in eukaryotes is achieved through the interaction of several levels of control that acts both locally to turn on or off individual genes in response to a specific cellular need and globally to maintain a chromatin-wide gene expression pattern that shapes cell identity.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shandilya|first=J|author2=Robert SG|title=The transcription cycle in eukaryotes: from productive initiation to RNA polymerase II recycling|journal=Biochim Biophys Acta|year=2012|volume=1819|issue=5|pages=391–400|doi=10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.01.010|pmid=22306664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because eukaryotic genome is wrapped around [[histone]]s to form nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin structures, the substrates for transcriptional machinery are in general partially concealed.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Without regulatory proteins, many genes are expressed at low level or not expressed at all. Transcription requires displacement of the positioned nucleosomes to enable the transcriptional machinery to gain access of the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulaeva|first=Olga|author2=Daria Gaykalova |author3=Vasily M. Studitsky |title=Transcription Through Chromatin by RNA polymerase II: Histone Displacement and Exchange|journal=Mutat. Res.|year=2007|volume=618|issue=1–2|pages=116–129|doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2006.05.040|pmc=1924643|pmid=17313961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All steps in the transcription are subject to some degree of regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Transcription initiation in particular is the primary level at which gene expression is regulated. Targeting the rate-limiting initial step is the most efficient in terms of energy costs for the cell. Transcription initiation is regulated by cis-acting elements (enhancers, silencers, isolators) within the regulatory regions of the DNA, and sequence-specific [[trans-acting factor]]s that act as activators or repressors.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Gene transcription can also be regulated post-initiation by targeting the movement of the elongating polymerase.&lt;ref name=Peterlin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peterlin|first=BM|author2=DH Price|title=Controlling the elongation phase of transcription with P-TEFb|journal=Molecular Cell|year=2006|volume=23|issue=3|pages=297–305|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2006.06.014|pmid=16885020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global control and epigenetic regulation===
{{main|Epigenetic regulation}}

The eukaryotic genome is organized into a compact chromatin structure that allows only regulated access to DNA. The chromatin structure can be globally "open" and more transcriptionally permissive, or globally "condensed" and transcriptionally inactive. The former ([[euchromatin]]) is lightly packed and rich in genes under active transcription. The latter ([[heterochromatin]]) includes gene-poor regions such as [[telomere]]s and [[centromere]]s but also regions  with normal gene density but transcriptionally silenced. Transcription can be silenced by [[histone modification]] ([[Histone deacetylase|deaceltylation]] and [[Histone methylation|methylation]]), [[RNA interference]], and/or [[DNA methylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bannister|first=Andrew J. |author2=Kouzarides, Tony |title=Regulation of chromatin by histone modifications |journal=Cell Research |date=15 February 2011 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=381–395 |doi=10.1038/cr.2011.22 |pmid=21321607 |pmc=3193420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gene expression patterns that define cell identity are inherited through cell division.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; This process is called [[epigenetic regulation]]. DNA methylation is reliably inherited through the action of maintenance methylases that modify the nascent DNA strand generated by replication.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is the primary marker of transcriptionally silenced regions. Specialized proteins can recognize the marker and recruit [[histone deacetylases]] and methylases to re-establish the silencing. Nucleosome histone modifications could also be inherited during cell division, however, it is not clear whether it can work independently without the direction by DNA methylation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===Gene-specific activation===
The two main tasks of transcription initiation are to provide RNA polymerase with an access to the promoter and to assemble general transcription factors with polymerase into a transcription initiation complex. Diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the gene promoter have been identified.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Eukaryotic genes have acquired extensive regulatory sequences that encompass a large number of regulator-binding sites and spread overall kilobases (sometimes hundreds of kilobases) from the promoter–-both upstream and downstream.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The regulator binding sites are often clustered together into units called enhancers. Enhancers can facilitate highly cooperative action of several transcription factors (which constitute [[enhanceosome]]s). Remote enhancers allow transcription regulation at a distance. Insulators situated between enhancers and promoters help define the genes that an enhancer can or cannot influence.

Eukaryotic transcriptional activators have separate DNA-binding and activating functions.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Upon binding to its cis-element, an activator can recruit polymerase directly or recruit other factors needed by the transcriptional machinery. An activator can also recruit nucleosome modifiers that alter chromatin in the vicinity of the promoter and thereby help initiation. Multiple activators can work together, either by recruiting a common or two mutually dependent components of the transcriptional machinery, or by helping each other bind to their DNA sites.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; These interactions can synergize multiple signaling inputs and produce intricate transcriptional responses to address cellular needs.

===Gene-specific repression ===
Eukaryotic transcription repressors share some of the mechanisms used by their prokaryotic counterparts. For example, by binding to a site on DNA that overlaps with the binding site of an activator, a repressor can inhibit binding of the activator. But more frequently, eukaryotic repressors inhibit the function of an activator by masking its activating domain, preventing its nuclear localization, promoting its degradation, or inactivating it through chemical modifications.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Repressors can directly inhibit transcription initiation by binding to a site upstream of a promoter and interacting with the transcriptional machinery. Repressors can indirectly repress transcription by recruiting histone modifiers (deacetylases and methylases) or nucleosome remodeling enzymes that affect the accessibility of the DNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Repressing histone and DNA modifications are also the basis of transcriptional silencing that can spread along the chromatin and switch off multiple genes.&lt;ref name=Brownbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Terrance A.|title=Genomes|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Liss.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-25046-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elongation and termination control===
The elongation phase starts once assembly of the elongation complex has been completed, and progresses until a termination sequence is encountered.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The post-initiation movement of RNA polymerase is the target of another class of important regulatory mechanisms. For example, the transcriptional activator [[Tat (HIV)|Tat]] affects elongation rather than initiation during its regulation of [[HIV]] transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kao|first=Shaw-Yi|author2=Andrew Calman |author3=Paul Luciw |author4=Matija Peterlin |title=Anti-termination of transcription within the long terminal repeat of HIV-1 by tat gene product|journal=Nature|date=3 December 1987|volume=330|pages=489–493|doi=10.1038/330489a0|issue=6147 |pmid=2825027}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many eukaryotic genes are regulated by releasing a block to transcription elongation called promoter-proximal pausing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lis|first=J|title=Promoter-associated Pausing in Promoter Architecture and Postinitiation Transcriptional Regulation|journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol|year=1998|volume=63|pages=347–56|doi=10.1101/sqb.1998.63.347|pmid=10384299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pausing can influence chromatin structure at promoters to facilitate gene activity and lead to rapid or synchronous transcriptional responses when cells are exposed to an activation signal.&lt;ref name=Adelman /&gt; Pausing is associated with the binding of two negative elongation factors, DSIF (SPT4/SPT5) and NELF, to the elongation complex. Other factors can also influence the stability and duration of the paused polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cheng B, Li T, Rahl PB, Adamson TE, Loudas NB, Guo J, Varzavand K, Cooper JJ, Hu X, Gnatt A, Young RA, Price DH |title=Functional Association of Gdown1 with RNA Polymerase II Poised on Human Genes|journal=Molecular Cell|date=January 2012|volume=45|issue=1|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2011.10.022|pmid=22244331|pmc=3259526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pause release is triggered by the recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase.&lt;ref name=Peterlin /&gt;

Transcription termination has also emerged as an important area of transcriptional regulation. Termination is coupled with the efficient recycling of polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feige|first=MJ|author2=LM Hendershot|title=Disulfide bonds in ER protein folding and homeostasis|journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol|date=April 2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=167–75|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2010.10.012|pmid=21144725|pmc=3078216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factors associated with transcription termination can also mediate gene looping and thereby determine the efficiency of re-initiation.

==Transcription-coupled DNA repair==
When transcription is arrested by the presence of a [[Molecular lesion|lesion]] in the transcribed strand of a gene, [[DNA repair]] proteins are recruited to the stalled RNA polymerase to initiate a process called transcription-coupled repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MELLON|first=I|title=Selective removal of transcription-blocking DNA damage from the transcribed strand of the mammalian DHFR gene|journal=Cell|date=October 1987|volume=51|issue=2|pages=241–249|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90151-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this process is the general transcription factor TFIIH that has ATPase activity. TFIIH causes a conformational change in the polymerase, to expose the transcription bubble trapped inside, in order for the DNA repair enzymes to gain access to the lesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarker|first=Altaf H.|author2=Tsutakawa, Susan E. |author3=Kostek, Seth |author4=Ng, Cliff |author5=Shin, David S. |author6=Peris, Marian |author7=Campeau, Eric |author8=Tainer, John A. |author9=Nogales, Eva |author10= Cooper, Priscilla K. |title=Recognition of RNA Polymerase II and Transcription Bubbles by XPG, CSB, and TFIIH: Insights for Transcription-Coupled Repair and Cockayne Syndrome|journal=Molecular Cell|date=October 2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages=187–198|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2005.09.022|pmid=16246722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, RNA polymerase serves as damage-sensing protein in the cell to target repair enzymes to genes that are being actively transcribed.

==Comparisons between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription==
Eukaryotic transcription is more complex than [[Bacterial transcription|prokaryotic transcription]]. For instance, in eukaryotes the genetic material (DNA), and therefore transcription, is primarily localized to the nucleus, where it is separated from the cytoplasm (in which translation occurs) by the nuclear membrane. This allows for the temporal regulation of gene expression through the sequestration of the RNA in the nucleus, and allows for selective transport of mature RNAs to the cytoplasm. Bacteria do not have a distinct nucleus that separates DNA from ribosome and mRNA is translated into protein as soon as it is transcribed. The coupling between the two processes provides an important mechanism for prokaryotic gene regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

At the level of initiation, RNA polymerase in prokaryotes (bacteria in particular) binds strongly to the promoter region and initiates a high basal rate of transcription. No ATP hydrolysis is needed for the close-to-open transition, promoter melting is driven by binding reactions that favor the melted conformation. Chromatin greatly impedes transcription in eukaryotes. Assembly of large multi-protein preinitiation complex is required for promoter-specific initiation. Promoter melting in eukaryotes requires hydrolysis of ATP. As a result, eukaryotic RNA polymerases exhibit a low basal rate of transcription initiation.&lt;ref name=Brownbook /&gt;

==Regulation of transcription in cancer==

In vertebrates, the majority of gene [[Promoter (genetics)#CpG islands in promoters|promoters]] contain a [[CpG site#CpG islands|CpG island]] with numerous [[CpG site]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid16432200"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saxonov S, Berg P, Brutlag DL |title=A genome-wide analysis of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome distinguishes two distinct classes of promoters |journal=Proc.

For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation (see [[regulation of transcription in cancer]]).  Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other [[Cancer epigenetics|epigenetic]] mechanisms, such as altered expression of [[MicroRNA#DNA repair and cancer|microRNAs]].&lt;ref name="pmid24616890"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tessitore A, Cicciarelli G, Del Vecchio F, Gaggiano A, Verzella D, Fischietti M, Vecchiotti D, Capece D, Zazzeroni F, Alesse E |title=MicroRNAs in the DNA Damage/Repair Network and Cancer |journal=Int J Genom |volume=2014 |issue= |pages=820248 |year=2014 |pmid=24616890 |pmc=3926391 |doi=10.1155/2014/820248 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of [[BRCA1]] may occur more frequently by over-expressed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see [[BRCA1#Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers|Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8901">A '''flood opening''' or '''flood vent''' (also styled '''floodvent''') is an orifice in an enclosed structure intended to allow the free passage of water between the interior and exterior.

==Flood openings in the United States==
In the [[United States]], flood openings are used to provide for the automatic equalization of [[hydrostatic pressure]] on either side of a wall. [[Building codes]] usually require the installation of flood openings in the walls of structures located in [[100-year flood|A-type flood zone]]s recognized by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. Various agencies in the United States define necessary characteristics for flood openings. The NFIP Regulations and Building Codes require that any residential building constructed in Flood Zone Type A have the lowest floor, including basements, elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE). Enclosed areas are permitted under elevated buildings provided that they meet certain use restrictions and construction requirements such as the installation of flood vents to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. This wet floodproofing technique is required for residential buildings.

===Engineered vs. non-engineered openings===
Most regulatory authorities in the United States that offer requirements for flood openings define two major classes of opening:&lt;ref name="codes"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/rebuild/buildingscience/coderesources.shtm FEMA: Building Code Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; engineered, and non-engineered. The requirements for non-engineered openings are typically stricter, defining necessary characteristics for aspects ranging from overall size of each opening, to allowable screening or other coverage options, to number and placement of openings. Engineered openings ignore many of these requirements, depending on the particular regulatory authority. To qualify as an engineered opening, testing and/or certification by a qualified agency (varying from regulator to regulator, and indicated below where appropriate) is required.

Non-Engineered Opening WARNING: "Any louvers, blades, screens, and faceplates or other covers and devices should be selected or specified so as to minimize the likelihood of blockage by small debris and sediment. Where experience has shown that a particular device or type of device has been blocked or clogged by flood debris or sediment, use of such devices should be avoided." -ASCE 24-14 Pg. 45 (commentary)

===American Society of Civil Engineers definition===
The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) requirements apply to any structure that is not [[flood barrier#Local Flood Barriers|dry flood-proofed]] and which is in the [[flood insurance rate map|mapped]] flood zone. It calls for openings in [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] [[foundation wall]]s located below the mapped [[flood elevation]]. Where non-engineered openings are used, each opening must be at least three inches in diameter, and have no screen or other cover that interferes with the transition of water between interior and exterior. The total net open area of all flood openings in the structure must be equal to or greater than one square inch, per square foot of footprint of the enclosed area—though no fewer than two openings, total, which must be located on different walls. Openings must be placed such that the bottom of each opening is no more than one [[foot (unit)|foot]] above the adjacent ground level.&lt;ref name="ascesum"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=3515 Highlights of ASCE 24-05 Flood Resistant Design and Construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of these requirements, engineered openings must conform to a performance standard: during a flood with a rate of rise/fall of five feet  per hour, the difference between interior and exterior flood water levels in an enclosure using the engineered openings must not be greater than one foot.&lt;ref name="codes" /&gt;

===International Building Code (IBC)===
The [[International Building Code]] refers to the American Society of Civil Engineer requirements for both non-engineered and engineered flood openings.

===International Residential Code (IRC)===
The [[International Residential Code]] requirements vary mildly from revision to revision, but require that entry and exit of floodwater be provided for in accordance with the requirements of the ASCE.&lt;ref name="icode03"&gt;2003 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icode06"&gt;2006 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icode09"&gt;2009 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements apply for both non-engineered and engineered flood openings.

===FEMA===
While the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] does not have [[de jure]] authority over the building code, it maintains crucial influence over flood opening standards through its administration of the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP). By controlling the standards for nearly all [[flood insurance]] in the United States, the NFIP exerts exceptional [[de facto]] authority over many aspects of floodplain construction. The FEMA (and, thus, NFIP) requirements for non-engineered openings are similar to requirements from the American Society of Civil Engineers. Unlike the ASCE, FEMA requires the placement of openings such that the bottom of each opening is no more than one foot above the higher of the adjacent ground level, or the interior foundation slab height.&lt;ref name="tb1"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1579 FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-08: Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures]&lt;/ref&gt;

For engineered openings, FEMA offers two subclassifications: individual certification openings, and openings with [[International Code Council Evaluation Service]] (ICC-ES) Evaluation Reports. Individual certification openings are offered for use when, "[f]or architectural or other reasons, building designers or owners may prefer to use unique or individually designed openings or devices".&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; In such cases, an [[architect]] or [[engineer]] may provide certification including the professional's signature and applied [[seal (emblem)|seal]]. The certification must include a "statement certifying that the openings are designed to automatically equalize [[hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic flood loads]] on exterior walls by allowing the automatic entry and exit of [[floodwater]]s in accordance with the...design requirements"; "[d]escription of the range of flood characteristics tested or computed for which the certification is valid, such as rates of rise and fall of floodwaters"; and "[d]escription of the installation requirements and limitations that, if not followed, will void the certification".&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; The nature of the "live seal" requirement means that each structure containing an individual certification opening must have a separate certification, even if the opening is identical to that used in another structure.

The alternative subclassification is an opening that carries certification through the ICC-ES. According to FEMA, "Evaluation Reports are issued only after the ICC-ES performs technical evaluations of documentation submitted by a manufacturer, including technical design reports, certifications, and testing that demonstrate code compliance and performance."&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; The report must include a statement concerning the purpose of the opening tested; a description of the characteristics tested; and a description of installation requirements. FEMA allows a copy of the report to be used as a blanket certification of any project including an ICC-ES certified opening, in contrast to the requirements of an individual certification opening.&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt;

====AC364-1006-R1====
AC364-1006-R1 documents the ICC-ES's testing standards for flood openings, including specifications for a dual-chambered testing tank. While the requirements for the opening itself are based on ASCE 24, the substance of the test adds new layers of performance expectation. Under these requirements, the opening must activate before water level is one foot above the bottom of the opening, under conditions of 50 and 300 gallons per minute flooding, at a minimum of five foot per hour rate of rise. Additionally, water levels on the testing tank's "interior" and "exterior" portions must at no point differ more than one foot. To gauge performance against waterborne [[debris]], leaves and grass clippings are added to both chambers of the tank.&lt;ref name="ac364"&gt;[http://www.icc-es.org/Committee/0610-post/ac364.pdf AC364-1006-R1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forensic astronomy''' is the use of [[astronomy]], the scientific study of celestial objects, to determine the appearance of the sky at specific times in the past. This has been used, if relatively rarely, in [[forensic science]] (that is, for solving problems of relevance to the legal system) and for resolving [[history|historical]] problems more generally, notably issues in [[art history]].

==Forensic science==
As a forensic science in the strict sense of the term, astronomical knowledge can help resolve certain legal questions. In one reported instance, an astronomer testified in court as an [[expert witness]] as to whether a newly built house would cast a shadow on another house. More generally, questions about the sun's or moon's placement in the sky at certain times of day or night may be legally relevant, such as for determining the date on which a  photograph was made.&lt;ref name="Marché"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marché|first=Jordan D.|title=Theaters of time and space: American planetaria, 1930-1970|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3576-0|pages=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olT1ipj-EboC&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has for instance been reported that [[Abraham Lincoln]] once successfully defended a legal case by describing the location of the Moon on the night of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pistalu|first=Mary Ellen|title=Astronomy Takes the Stand: Using the Heavens to Solve Crimes|journal=[[Mercury Magazine]]|issue=January/February 2006|publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frederic Church Meteor of 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church]], ''[[The Meteor of 1860]]'']]

By extension, the adjective "forensic" has come to be used for any detailed analysis of past events, whether related to legal questions or not, and so the determination of past celestial constellations more generally is now increasingly referred to as "forensic astronomy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunn|first=Alan|title=Essential Forensic Biology|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|isbn=978-0-470-75803-8|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eesJuyXhKHoC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For research in [[art history]], in particular, methods of astronomy are sometimes useful for determining the place and time of creation of a particular work of art, or of the event that inspired it. Such methods have for instance been used to date [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s painting ''[[Evening Landscape with Rising Moon]]'' (to 9:08 pm, 13 July 1889), and to identify the [[meteor]]s described in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poem ''[[Year of Meteors (1859-60)]]'' – in conjunction with [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s painting of the same event (at right) – as the [[meteor procession]] of [[1860 Great Meteor|1860]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falk|first=Dan|title=Forensic astronomer solves Walt Whitman mystery|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/06/the-forensic-astronomer-donald-olson.php|accessdate=2 June 2010|newspaper=[[New Scientist]] CultureLab|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The Frobenius Institute is famous for its collections. Apart from 6000 ethnographic objects, the collection mainly consists of around 100,000 pictures (photographs and watercolour paintings). Most of these pictures are available online on the website of the institute. Leo Frobenius started this collection, and after his death in 1938 his successors enlarged it. The Library of the Frobenius Institute consists of around 115,000 books.

'''Geodetic astronomy''' or '''astro-geodesy''' is the application of [[astronomy|astronomical]] methods into [[Wiktionary:Network|network]]s and technical projects of [[geodesy]].

The most important topics are:
* Establishment of [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] systems (e.g. [[ED50]]) or at expeditions
* [[apparent places]] of stars, and their [[proper motion]]s 
* precise astronomical [[astro navigation|navigation]]
* astro-geodetic [[geoid]] determination
* modelling the rock [[density|densities]] of the topography and of [[geological]] layers in the [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]]
* [[Satellite geodesy]] using the background of [[star]]s
* Monitoring of the [[Earth rotation]] and polar wandering
* Contribution to the [[time system]] of physics and [[geosciences]]

Important '''measuring techniques''' are:
* [[Latitude]] and [[longitude]] determination by [[theodolite]]s, tacheometers, [[astrolabe]]s or [[zenith camera]]s
* [[time]] and [[star position]]s by observation of [[star transit]]s, e.g. by [[meridian circle]]s (visual, photographic or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]])
* [[Azimuth]] measurements 
** for the exact orientation of [[geodetic network]]s
** for mutual [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]]s between terrestrial and space methods
** for improved accuracy by means of "[[Laplace point]]s" at special fixed points
* [[Vertical deflection]] measurements and their use
** in geoid determination
** in mathematical [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]] of very precise networks
** for geophysical and [[geological]] purposes (see above)
* Modern [[space|spatial]] methods
** [[VLBI]] with radio sources ([[quasar]]s)
** [[Astrometry]] of stars by scanning satellites like [[Hipparcos]] or the future [[Gaia probe|Gaia]].

The [[accuracy]] of these methods depends on the [[measuring instrument|instrument]] and its spectral wavelength, the measuring or scanning method, the time amount (versus economy), the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] situation, the stability of the surface resp. the satellite, on mechanical and [[temperature]] effects to the instrument, on the experience and skill of the [[observation|observer]], and on the accuracy of the physical-mathematical [[mathematical model|models]].

Therefore, the accuracy reaches from 60" (navigation, ~1 mile) to 0,001" and better (a few cm; satellites, VLBI), e.g.:
* [[angle]]s ([[vertical direction|vertical]] deflections and [[azimuth]]s) ±1" up to 0,1"
* geoid determination &amp; height systems ca. 5&amp;nbsp;cm up to 0,2&amp;nbsp;cm
* [[astrometry|astronomical]] lat/long and star positions ±1" up to 0,01"
* [[HIPPARCOS]] star positions ±0,001"
* [[VLBI]] quasar positions and [[Earth's rotation]] poles 0,001 to 0,0001" (cm...mm)

A '''herbarium''' (plural: '''herbaria''') is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens and associated data used for scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/herbarium/what-is-a-herbarium|title=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh - What is a herbarium|last=Edinburgh|first=Royal Botanic Garden|website=www.rbge.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts; these will usually be in dried form mounted on a sheet of paper (called "''exsiccatae''") but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Preparing and Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=Conserve O Gram|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specimens in a herbarium are often used as reference material in describing plant [[taxon|taxa]]; some specimens may be [[Type (botany)|types]].

The same term is often used in [[mycology]] to describe an equivalent collection of preserved [[fungi]], otherwise known as a '''fungarium'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fungarium|url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/collections/fungarium|website=www.kew.org|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''[[xylarium]]''' is a herbarium specialising in specimens of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wood collection (xylarium)|url=http://www.kew.org/kew-science/collections/economic-botany/explore-collection/wood-collection-xylarium|website=www.kew.org|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''hortorium''' (as in the [[Liberty Hyde Bailey|Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium]]) has occasionally been applied to a herbarium specialising in preserving material of [[horticulture|horticultural]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium|url=https://plantbio.cals.cornell.edu/hortorium|website=plantbio.cals.cornell.edu|publisher=Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The oldest traditions of making herbarium collection or ''Hortus sicci'' have been traced to Italy. Luca Ghini and his students created herbaria of which the oldest extant one is that of [[Gherardo Cibo]] from around 1532.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1931.tb00596.x|title=The Herbal of Leonhart Fuchs|journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Botany|volume=48|issue=325|pages=545|year=1931|last1=Sprague|first1=T. A.|last2=Nelmes|first2=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the early herbaria were prepared with sheets bound into books, [[Carl_Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] came up with the idea of maintaining them on free sheets that allowed their easy re-ordering within cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller-Wille|first=Staffan|date=2006-06-01|title=Linnaeus' herbarium cabinet: a piece of furniture and its function|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932706000330|journal=Endeavour|volume=30|issue=2|pages=60–64|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2006.03.001|pmid=16600379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specimen preservation ==
[[File:HerbPrepLG.jpg|thumb|right|Preparing a plant for mounting]]
Commensurate with the need of wildlife conservation, it is often desirable to include in a herbarium sheet as much of the plant as possible (e.g., flowers, stems, leaves, seed, and fruit), or at least representative parts of them in the case of large specimens.&lt;ref name=Chater/&gt; To preserve their form and colour, plants collected in the field are carefully arranged and spread flat between thin sheets, known as 'flimsies', (equivalent to sheets of newsprint) and dried, usually in a [[plant press]], between blotters or absorbent paper.&lt;ref name=Chater/&gt; During the drying process the specimens are retained within their flimsies at all times to minimise damage, and only the thicker, absorbent drying sheets are replaced. For some plants it may prove helpful to allow the fresh specimen to wilt slightly before being arranged for the press. An opportunity to check, rearrange and further lay out the specimen to best reveal the required features of the plant occurs when the damp absorbent sheets are changed during the drying/pressing process.  

The specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labelled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned, and the case disinfected.

Certain groups of plants are soft, bulky, or otherwise not amenable to drying and mounting on sheets. For these plants, other methods of preparation and storage may be used. For example, [[conifer cone]]s and [[Arecaceae|palm]] fronds may be stored in labelled boxes. Representative flowers or fruits may be pickled in [[formaldehyde]] to preserve their three-dimensional structure.  Small specimens, such as [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, are often air-dried and packaged in small paper envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

No matter the method of preservation, detailed information on where and when the plant was collected, habitat, color (since it may fade over time), and the name of the collector is usually included.

The value of a herbarium is much enhanced by the possession of “types”, that is, the original specimens on which the study of a species was founded. Thus the herbarium at the [[British Museum]], which is especially rich in the earlier collections made in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, contains the types of many species founded by the earlier workers in [[botany]]. It is also rich in types of Australian plants from the collections of [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and Robert Brown, and contains in addition many valuable modern collections. &lt;ref&gt; "Herbarium", Parkstone Press International 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections management ==
[[Image:Field fg15.jpg|thumb|A large herbarium may have hundreds of cases filled with specimens.]]
Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases.  Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the [[species]] to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight [[File folder|folder]] that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by [[genus]]. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic [[family (biology)|family]] according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.kew.org/herbcat/gotoWhatIsHerbarium.do|title=HerbWeb - What is a Herbarium|website=apps.kew.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locating a specimen filed in the herbarium requires knowing the [[botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]] and [[scientific classification|classification]] used by the herbarium.  It also requires familiarity with possible name changes that have occurred since the specimen was collected, since the specimen may be filed under an older name.

Modern herbaria often maintain electronic databases of their collections. Many herbaria have initiatives to [[Digitizing|digitize]] specimens to produce a [[virtual herbarium]]. These records and images are made publicly accessible via the [[Internet]] when possible.

== Uses ==
Herbarium collections can have great significance and value to science, and have a large number of uses.&lt;ref name="Funk2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funk|first1=Vicki|title=The Importance of Herbaria|journal=Plant Science Bulletin|date=January 2003|volume=49|issue=3|pages=94|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245183622|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Funk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Vicki|title=100 Uses for an Herbarium (Well at Least 72)|url=http://peabody.yale.edu/sites/default/files/documents/botany/100_uses.pdf|website=peabody.yale.edu|publisher=The Yale University Herbarium|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Herbaria are essential for the study of [[plant taxonomy]], the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. 
[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]'s herbarium now belongs to the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] in England.

Specimens housed in herbaria may be used to catalogue or identify the [[flora]] of an area.  A large collection from a single area is used in writing a field guide or manual to aid in the identification of plants that grow there.  With more specimens available, the author of the guide will better understand the variability of form in the plants and the natural distribution over which the plants grow.

Herbaria also preserve a historical record of change in [[vegetation]] over time.  In some cases, plants become [[Extinction|extinct]] in one area or may become extinct altogether.  In such cases, specimens preserved in a herbarium can represent the only record of the plant's original distribution.  Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in [[climate]] and human impact.

Herbaria have also proven very useful as sources of plant [[DNA]] for use in taxonomy and [[molecular systematics]]

Many kinds of scientists and naturalists use herbaria to preserve voucher specimens; representative samples of plants used in a particular study to demonstrate precisely the source of their data, or to enable confirmation of identification at a future date.&lt;ref name="Chater"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chater|first1=Arthur O.|title=Collecting and Pressing Specimens|url=http://bsbi.org.uk/Collecting.pdf|website=www.bsbi.org.uk|publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also be a repository of viable seeds for rare species.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119311319/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Wiley online library]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the electrical industry exploited [[direct current]] (DC) and low [[frequency]] [[alternating current]] (AC), but not much was known about frequencies above 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, what are now called [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]]. In 1887, four years previously, [[Heinrich Hertz]] had discovered [[Hertzian wave]]s ([[radio wave]]s), electromagnetic waves which oscillated at very high frequencies.&lt;ref name="Aitken"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This attracted much attention, and a number of researchers began experimenting with high frequency currents.

Tesla's background was in the new field of [[alternating current]] power systems, so he understood transformers and resonance.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarkar1" /&gt; In 1888 he decided that high frequencies were the most promising field for research, and set up a laboratory at 33 South Fifth Avenue, New York for researching them, initially repeating Hertz's experiments.

He first developed [[alternator]]s as sources of high frequency current, but by 1890 found they were limited to frequencies of about 20&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Sarkar1" /&gt; In search of higher frequencies he turned to spark-excited resonant circuits.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt; Tesla's innovation was in applying resonance to transformers.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;"''Tesla is entitled to either distinct priority or independent discovery of''" three concepts in wireless theory: "''(1) the idea of inductive coupling between the driving and the working circuits (2) the importance of tuning both circuits, i.e. the idea of an 'oscillation transformer' (3) the idea of a capacitance loaded open secondary circuit''" {{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; independently developed a new type of transformer without an iron core, the "[[oscillation transformer]]", and the Tesla coil circuit to drive it to produce high voltages.

Tesla invented the Tesla coil during efforts to develop a "wireless" lighting system, with [[gas discharge lamp|gas discharge light bulb]]s that would glow in an oscillating electric field from a high voltage, high frequency power source.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarkar1" /&gt;  For a high frequency source Tesla powered a [[Ruhmkorff coil]] ([[induction coil]]) with his high frequency [[alternator]].  He found that the [[core loss]]es due to the high frequency current overheated the iron core in the Ruhmkorff coil and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings.  To fix this problem Tesla changed the design so that there was an air gap instead of insulating material between the windings, and made the iron core adjustable so it could be moved in or out of the coil&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually found the highest voltages could be produced when the iron core was omitted.   Tesla also found he needed to put the [[capacitor]] normally used in the Ruhmkorff circuit between his alternator and the coil's primary winding to avoid burning out the coil. By adjusting the coil and capacitor Tesla found he could take advantage of the [[resonance]] set up between the two to achieve even higher frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 124&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the highest voltages were generated when the "closed" primary circuit with the capacitor was in [[resonance]] with the "open" secondary winding.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarkar1" /&gt;

Tesla's wireless research required increasingly high voltages, and he had reached the limit of the voltages he could generate within the space of his New York lab. Between 1899 and 1900 he built a laboratory in [[Colorado Springs]] and performed experiments on wireless transmission there.&lt;ref name="Sarkar2" /&gt; He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power&lt;/u&gt;, Leland I.

One of the largest applications of the Tesla coil circuit was in early [[radio transmitter]]s called [[spark gap transmitter]]s.

As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating in the same area their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.&lt;ref name="Aitken2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarkar3" /&gt;

By using resonant circuits, different transmitters could be "tuned" to transmit on different frequencies. With narrower bandwidth, separate transmitter frequencies would no longer overlap, so a receiver could receive a particular transmission by "tuning" its resonant circuit to the same frequency as the transmitter.&lt;ref name="Sarkar3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockman"&gt;{{cite book

Practical [[radiotelegraphy]] communication systems were developed by Marconi beginning in 1895.

Although their damping had been reduced as much as possible, spark transmitters still produced [[damped wave]]s which had a wide bandwidth, creating interference with other transmitters. Around 1920 they became obsolete, superseded by [[vacuum tube]] transmitters which generated [[continuous wave]]s at a single frequency, which could also be [[modulation|modulated]] to carry sound. Tesla's [[resonant transformer]] continued to be used in vacuum tube transmitters and receivers, and is a key component in radio to this day.&lt;ref name="Belohlavek"&gt;"''Unfortunately, the common misunderstanding by most people today is that the Tesla coil is merely a device that produces a spectacular exhibit of sparks which tittilates audiences.

In electrotherapy, a pointed electrode attached to the high voltage terminal of the coil was held near the patient, and the luminous [[brush discharge]]s from it (called "''effluves''") were applied to parts of the body to treat a wide variety of medical conditions. In order to apply the electrode directly to the skin, or tissues inside the mouth, anus or vagina, a "vacuum electrode" was used, consisting of a metal electrode sealed inside a partially evacuated glass tube, which produced a dramatic violet glow. The glass wall of the tube and the skin surface formed a [[capacitor]] which limited the current to the patient, preventing discomfort. These vacuum electrodes were later manufactured with handheld Tesla coils to make "[[violet ray]]" wands, sold to the public as a quack home medical device.&lt;ref name="Behary"&gt;{{cite web

The popularity of electrotherapy peaked after [[World War 1]],&lt;ref name="Kovács" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peña" /&gt; but by the 1920s authorities began to crack down on fraudulent medical treatments, and electrotherapy largely became obsolete. A part of the field that survived was ''[[diathermy]]'', the application of high frequency current to heat body tissue, pioneered by German physician Karl Nagelschmidt in 1907.&lt;ref name="Kovács" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho" /&gt;  During the 1920s "long wave" (0.5~2&amp;nbsp;MHz) Tesla coil spark diathermy machines were used, in which the current was applied to the body by electrodes.  By the 1930s these were being replaced by "short wave" (10~100&amp;nbsp;MHz) vacuum tube diathermy machines,&lt;ref name="Kovács" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho" /&gt; which had less danger of causing burns, but Tesla coils continued to be used in both diathermy&lt;ref name="Kovács" /&gt; and quack medical devices like [[violet ray]]&lt;ref name="Behary" /&gt; until World War 2. In 1926 [[William T. Bovie]] discovered that RF currents applied to a scalpel could cut and cauterize tissue in medical operations, and spark oscillators were used as [[electrosurgery]] generators or "Bovies" as late as the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;{{cite journal

Ever since Tesla's 1890s lectures, Tesla coils have been used as attractions in educational exhibits and [[science fair]]s. They have become a way to counter the stereotype that science is boring.&lt;ref name="Goldman2" /&gt; In the early 20th century, experts like [[Henry Transtrom]] and [[Earle Ovington]] gave high voltage demonstrations at "electric fairs".&lt;ref name="Transtrom" /&gt; High school classes built Tesla coils.

From 1933 into the 1980s, between movie jobs Hollywood special effects expert [[Kenneth Strickfaden|Ken Strickfaden]] would take his high voltage apparatus on the road in an exhibition called "Science on Parade" and later "The Kenstric Space Age Science Show" to high schools, colleges, World Fairs and expositions.&lt;ref name="Goldman2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_xkZIjk3lXAC&amp;pg=PA66 Goldman (2005) ''Kenneth Strickfaden, Dr. Frankenstein's Electrician'', p. 62-68]&lt;/ref&gt; These spectacular shows, which reached 48 states, had a seminal influence on the birth of the modern "coiling" movement.&lt;ref name="Tibbetts" /&gt; A number of present-day Tesla hobbyists such as William Wysock say they were inspired to build Tesla coils by seeing Strickfaden's show.&lt;ref name="Goldman2" /&gt;

One of the oldest and best-known coils still in operation is the "GPO-1" at [[Griffith Park Observatory]] in Los Angeles. It was originally one of a pair of coils built in 1910 by [[Earle L. Ovington]], a friend of Tesla and manufacturer of high voltage electrotherapy apparatus.&lt;ref name="Gurstelle"&gt;{{cite book

Every hour the lights were dimmed and the public was treated to a display of 10 foot arcs.&lt;ref name="Triposo" /&gt;  Ovington gave the coils to his friend Dr. [[Frederick Finch Strong]], a leading figure in the alternative health field of [[electrotherapy]]. In 1937 Strong donated the coils to the Griffith Observatory. The museum didn't have room to display both, but one coil was restored by Kenneth Strickfaden and has been in daily operation ever since.&lt;ref name="Goldman"/&gt; It consists of a 48 in. (1.2 m) high conical secondary coil topped by a 12 in. (30&amp;nbsp;cm) diameter copper ball electrode, with a 9-turn spiral primary of 2 in. copper strip, a glass plate capacitor (replacing the original Leyden jars), and rotary spark gap.&lt;ref name="Gurstelle" /&gt; Its output has been estimated at 1.3 million volts.&lt;ref name="Triposo" /&gt;

In addition to its use in [[spark-gap transmitter|spark-gap radio transmitters]] and [[electrotherapy]] described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in [[x-ray machine]]s, [[ozone generator]]s for water purification, and [[induction heating]] equipment. However, in the 1920s [[vacuum tube]] [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] replaced it in all these applications.&lt;ref name="Tilbury1" /&gt; The [[triode]] vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than the noisy, hot, [[ozone]]-producing spark, and could produce [[continuous wave]]s. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing.

In 1926, pioneering accelerator physicists [[Merle Tuve]] and [[Gregory Breit]] built a 5 million volt Tesla coil as a linear [[particle accelerator]].&lt;ref name="Breit"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bipolar coil consisted of a pyrex tube a meter long wound with 8000 turns of fine wire, with round corona caps on each end, and a 5 turn spiral primary coil surrounding it at the center. It was operated in a tank of insulating oil pressurized to 500 psi which allowed it to reach a potential of 5.2 megavolts. Although it was used for a short period in 1929-30 it was not a success because the particles' acceleration had to be completed within the brief period of a half cycle of the RF voltage.

[[File:Identifying a Pug Moth at Gunnersbury Triangle.jpg|thumb|Identifying moths]]
'''Identification''' in [[biology]] is the process of assigning a pre-existing [[taxon]] name to an individual [[organism]]. Identification of organisms to individual scientific names (or codes) may be based on individualistic natural body features,&lt;ref&gt;D.Burns, P.Harrison and P. Baverstock. [http://www.environment.gov.au/archive/coasts/publications/ballina-workshop-2004/pubs/burns.pdf Photographic identification of individual humpback whales (''Megaptera novaeangliae'') on their southern migration past Ballina, NSW, with comparisons to other humpback whale databases from eastern Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; experimentally created individual markers (e.g., color dot patterns), or natural individualistic molecular markers (similar to those used in [[DNA paternity testing|maternity or paternity identification tests]]). Individual identification is used in [[ecology]], [[wildlife management]] and [[conservation biology]]. The more common form of identification is the identification of organisms to [[common name]]s (e. g., "lion") or [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] (e. g., "''Panthera leo''"). By necessity this is based on inherited features ("characters") of the sexual organisms, the inheritance forming the basis of defining a class. The features may, e. g., be morphological, anatomical, physiological, behavioral, or molecular.

The term "determination" may occasionally be used as a synonym for identification (e. g.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osborne|first=Donald V.|title=Some aspects of the theory of dichotomous keys|journal=New Phytologist|year=1963|volume=62|issue=2|pages=144–160|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1963.tb06322.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1963.tb06322.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as in "determination slips".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chah.gov.au/avh/help/specimen/about_determination.html The herbarium specimen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification methods may be manual or [[Automated species identification|computerized]] and may involve using [[identification key]]s, browsing through fields guide that contain (often illustrated) species accounts, comparing the organism with specimens from natural history collections, or taking images to be analyzed and compared against a [[Training|pre-trained]] [[knowledge base]] with species information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wäldchen|first=Jana|last2=Mäder|first2=Patrick|date=2017-01-07|title=Plant Species Identification Using Computer Vision Techniques: A Systematic Literature Review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|language=en|pages=1–37|doi=10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|issn=1134-3060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''Interdisciplinary Telecommunications Program''' (its acronym is '''ITP''') is a part of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and offers graduate degrees in [[telecommunications]]: a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and [[Master of Science]] in Telecommunications and a [[Master of Engineering]] in Telecommunications.  It is the oldest telecommunications program in the United States and was founded in 1971 by Frank S. Barnes (Engineering) and George Codding (deceased, International Relations).  Since its inception, ITP has taken an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to telecommunications, involving the study of [[engineering]], [[law]], [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[business]].  Over the course of the past 35 years, ITP has graduated approximately 2,000 [[alumni]] who are in various positions around the world as [[CEO]]s, government officials, and management.

In 2004, ITP founder Frank S. Barnes was awarded the prestigious [[Gordon Prize]] for having founded ITP due to its innovative character and the influence that it has had within academia and industry.  As the first program of its kind in the United States, it broke ground for the many academic programs that followed. When [[Peterson's]] first started listing telecommunications programs in 1996, the director of ITP was asked to write the introduction on the topic for Peterson's publisher.  There is no question that many other prominent university programs have been directly influenced by ITP.  For further information, there is now a consortium of universities that teach the telecommunications discipline, known as [[ITERA]].

Students may participate in the program through either full-time academic study on campus or by participating in a distance-education platform.

The '''Max Headroom broadcast signal intrusion''' was a television signal hijacking occurring in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, on the evening of November 22, 1987, involving at least two unknown individuals. It is an example of what is known in the television business as [[broadcast signal intrusion]]. Two [[Chicago]] television stations had their broadcast signals hijacked by an unknown person wearing a [[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]] mask and sunglasses. A homemade Max Headroom background rocked back and forth in the background.

The intruder was successful in interrupting two broadcast [[television station]]s within the course of three hours. The first incident took place for 25 seconds during the sportscast on the 9:00 PM news on [[WGN-TV]] Channel 9, and the second, two hours later, after 11:00 PM on [[PBS]] affiliate [[WTTW]] Channel 11 for about 90 seconds during a broadcast of an episode of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]''.

The second pirate broadcast, which lasted 90 seconds and pre-recorded on videotape, featured the individual parodying WGN and television in general. The hacker rambled on making reference to Headroom's endorsement of Coke, the series ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', and WGN anchor [[Chuck Swirsky]], then pretended to defecate as a "masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds", a reference to WGN's call letters ("[[WGN-TV#History|World's Greatest Newspaper]]"). The video ended with the hacker’s exposed buttocks being spanked with a flyswatter by an accomplice before normal programming resumed.

The incident made national headlines&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.philly.com/1987-11-24/news/26174863_1_max-headroom-video-pirate-broadcasts | title = Bogus 'Max Headroom' Interrupts Broadcasts On 2 Chicago Stations | newspaper = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | publisher = Inquirer Wire Services | via = philly-archives | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160626221203/http://articles.philly.com/1987-11-24/news/26174863_1_max-headroom-video-pirate-broadcasts | archivedate = June 26, 2016 | dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the people responsible have never been identified.

==Signal intrusion==
===WGN-TV===
The first occurrence of the signal intrusion took place during [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9)'s live telecast of its primetime newscast, ''The Nine O'Clock News'' (now known as ''WGN News at Nine''). During highlights from the [[Chicago Bears]]' 30–10 home victory over the [[Detroit Lions]] that afternoon in the sports report, the screen went black for 15 seconds, then returned with a person wearing a [[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]] mask and sunglasses,&lt;ref name="interruptedtothemax"&gt;{{cite news | first = Don | last = Hayner | title = 2 channels interrupted to the Max | newspaper = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | id = CHI265386 | page = 3 | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3857222.html | subscription = yes | via = HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving around and acting in a similar manner to Max Headroom. His head was in front of a sheet of moving corrugated metal, which imitated the electronic background effect used in the Max Headroom TV and movie appearances. There was no audio other than a buzzing noise and an oscillating sound. The hijack was stopped after engineers at WGN switched the [[frequency]] of their [[Studio/transmitter link|studio link]] to the [[John Hancock Center]] transmitter.&lt;ref name=jailroom&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Camper | first1 = John | last2 = Daley | first2 = Steve | url = http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/203310798/ | url-access = subscription | title = A powerful video prankster could become Max Jailroom | department = Chicagoland | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = November 24, 1987 | page = 21 | quote = Strutzel said an engineer quickly changed the frequency of the signal that was transmitting the news show to the Hancock building, thus breaking the lock established by the video pirate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident left sports anchor Dan Roan bemused, saying, "Well, if you're wondering what's happened, so am I", and that the computer running the news "took off and went wild", then repeating his report on the Bears' victory earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKnwhokvgxE|title=WGN Channel 9 – The Nine O'Clock News – "The 1st 'Max Headroom' Incident" (1987)|date=23 November 2017|publisher=[[The Museum of Classic Chicago Television]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|via=YouTube|type=Videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WTTW===
[[File:Max Headroom broadcast intrusion.webm|thumb|video of the WTTW signal intrusion]]
Later that night, around 11:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]], during a broadcast of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]'', [[PBS]] member station [[WTTW]]'s signal was hijacked by the same person, apparently, who had broadcast the [[WGN-TV]] hijack, this time with distorted and crackling audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycVTXtm0U0|title=WTTW Chicago – The Max Headroom Pirating Incident (1987) – Original Upload
|date=30 October 2007|publisher=[[The Museum of Classic Chicago Television]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|via=YouTube|type=Videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was interrupted by television static, after which the unidentified man wearing the Max Headroom mask and sunglasses appeared, saying "That does it. He's a fricking nerd." He mentioned WGN sports pundit [[Chuck Swirsky]], whom he said he was "better than", going on to call Swirsky a "fricking [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]". The man started to moan, scream and laugh. He continued to laugh and utter various random phrases, including [[New Coke]]'s advertising slogan "Catch the Wave" while holding a [[Pepsi]] can (Max Headroom was a [[Coca-Cola]] spokesperson at the time), then tossed it out of sight, leaned towards the camera and presented [[the finger]] wearing a [[sex toy|rubber extension]] over his [[middle finger]], though the gesture was partially off-screen. The man then retrieved the Pepsi can, and sang "[[Lou Pride|Your love is fading]]", removed the rubber extension, and then began humming the theme song to ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', pausing to say "I still see the X" (often misheard as "I stole [[CBS]]"), which referred to the final episode of the series, before resuming humming again. He then began to moan painfully, exclaiming about his [[Hemorrhoid|piles]] (again, the muffled audio, or perhaps as a deliberate computer pun, makes it sound as if he is saying "files"), after which a flatulence sound was heard and he gyrated. He then stated that he had "made a giant masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds" (the WGN [[call letters]] used by the Chicago television station as well as its [[WGN (AM)|sister radio station]] are an acronym for "World's Greatest Newspaper", in reference to the flagship newspaper of their corporate parent, the [[Tribune Company]]'s ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''). He then held up a gardening [[glove]] and said, "My brother is wearing the other one." After putting the glove on, he continued, "But it's dirty! It's like you got bloodstains on it!" He then removed the glove and threw it away in disgust.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The picture suddenly cuts over to a shot of the man's lower torso. His [[buttocks]] were partly exposed, and he was holding the now-removed mask up to the camera with the rubber extension now placed in the mouth of the mask, howling, "They're coming to get me!" An unidentified accomplice wearing a [[French maid]] costume then told him to "bend over, bitch." The accomplice then started to [[spanking|spank]] the man with a [[flyswatter]] as the man screamed loudly, shouting "Oh, do it!" part way. The transmission then blacked out for a few seconds before resuming the ''Doctor Who'' episode in progress; the hijack lasted for about 90 seconds.&lt;ref name="remember"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.damninteresting.com/remember-remember-the-22nd-of-november/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160515162926/http://www.damninteresting.com/remember-remember-the-22nd-of-november/ | dead-url = no | archive-date = May 15, 2016 | title = Remember, Remember the 22nd of November | first = Alan | last = Bellows | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | date = November 22, 2016 | publication-date = January 9, 2007 | publisher = Damn Interesting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WTTW, which maintained its transmitter atop the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]], found that its engineers were unable to stop the hijacker due to the fact that there were no engineers on duty at the Sears Tower at the time of the hijacking. According to station spokesman Anders Yocom, technicians monitoring the transmission from WTTW headquarters "attempted to take corrective measures, but couldn't".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/306943044.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+24%2C+1987&amp;author=Carmody%2C+John&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=d.01&amp;desc=NBC+Lands+Gorbachev+Interview | first = John | last = Carmody | title = NBC Lands Gorbachev Interview | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | id = 95520 | page = D1 | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | subscription = yes | via = [[ProQuest#Archived newspapers|ProQuest Archiver]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By the time our people began looking into what was going on, it was over," he told the ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;ref name=jailroom/&gt; WTTW was able to find copies of the hijacker's telecast with the help of ''Doctor Who'' fans who had been taping the show.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Max Headroom incident made national headlines and was reported on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' the next day. WTTW received numerous phone calls from viewers who wondered what had occurred for the duration of the intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = The Associated Press | title = Bogus Max Headroom pirates 2 TV stations, drops his pants | newspaper = [[The Palm Beach Post]] | date = November 24, 1987 | page = 3A | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigating [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] engineer quoted at the time said the perpetrators of the intrusion faced a maximum $10,000 fine, up to a year in prison, or both.&lt;ref name="jailroom" /&gt;

Not long after the incident, [[WMAQ-TV]] humorously inserted clips of the hijacking into a newscast during [[Mark Giangreco]]'s sports highlights. "A lot of people thought it was real – the pirate cutting into our broadcast. We got all kinds of calls about it," said Giangreco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ruane | first = John | title = Casting final look at '87 // Local sportscasters recall year's memorable events | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3863222.html | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = January 1, 1988 | page = 94 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | subscription = yes  | via = HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIASE''' is a registered project of the [[Minimum Information Standards|MIBBI]] (minimum information for biological and biomedical investigations).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mibbi.org/ Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The MIASE project was launched in 2007 by Dagmar Köhn and Nicolas Le Novère and first presented on the [http://sbml.org/Events/Workshops/The_12th_SBML_Forum_Meeting 12th SBML Forum Meeting] in October 2007. Since then, MIASE was discussed on various meetings, not only within the SBML community. MIASE has become a community effort involving people from various standardisation communities as well as developers of simulation tools.
In April 2009, MIASE was part of the "[[CellML]], [[SBGN]], [[Systems Biology Ontology|SBO]], [[BioPAX]], and MIASE [http://www.cellml.org/community/events/workshop/2009 Super-Workshop 2009]".

== The guidelines ==
The MIASE Guidelines are composed of the following parts: Information about the models to use, information about the simulation steps, and Information about the output:

=== Information about the models to use ===
All models used in the experiment must be identified, accessible, and fully described.
# The description of the simulation experiment must be provided together with the models necessary for the experiment, or with a precise and unambiguous way of accessing those models.
# The models required for the simulations must be provided with all governing equations, parameter values, and necessary conditions (initial state and/or boundary conditions).
# If a model is not encoded in a standard format, then the model code must be made available to the user. If a model is not encoded in an open format or code, its full description must be provided, sufficient to re-implement it.
# Any modification of a model (pre-processing) required before the execution of a step of the simulation experiment must be described.

=== Information about the simulation steps ===
A precise description of the simulation steps and other procedures used by the experiment must be provided.
# All simulation steps must be clearly described, including the simulation algorithms to be used, the models on which to apply each simulation, the order of the simulation steps, and the data processing to be done between the simulation steps.
# All information needed for the correct implementation of the necessary simulation steps must be included through precise descriptions or references to unambiguous information sources.
# If a simulation step is performed using a computer program for which source code is not available, all information needed to reproduce the simulation, and not just repeat it, must be provided, including the algorithms used by the original software and any information necessary to implement them, such as the discretization and integration methods.
# If it is known that a simulation step will produce different results when performed in a different simulation environment or on a different computational platform, an explanation must be given of how the model has to be run with the specified environment/platform in order to achieve the purpose of the experiment.

=== Information about the output ===
All information necessary to obtain the desired numerical results must be provided.
# All post-processing steps applied on the raw numerical results of simulation steps in order to generate the final results have to be described in detail. That includes the identification of data to process, the order in which changes were applied, and also the nature of changes.
# If the expected insights depend on the relation between different results, such as a plot of one against another, the results to be compared have to be specified.

'''National Coding Week''' was founded by former headteacher [[Richard Rolfe]] and tech entrepreneur Jordan Love, who was appointed EU Code Week Ambassador for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Love|first1=Jordan|title='DIGITAL JERSEY HUB RESIDENT APPOINTED AS EU CODE WEEK AMBASSADOR'|url=https://www.digital.je/news/eucodeweekambassador|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Digital Jersey|publisher=Digital Jersey|date=16 September 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place during the week commencing September 21, 2014 with the aim of helping adults to improve their digital literacy  in order to fill the growing skills gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bateman|first1=Kayleigh|title='Training firm Codex DLD launches National Coding Week for Adults'|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227952/Training-firm-Codex-DLD-launches-National-Coding-Week-for-Adults|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Computer Weekly|publisher=TechTarget|date=2 September 2014|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The week is run by volunteers in hubs, libraries, schools, businesses and NGOs with the intention of supporting adults to learn digital skills including coding. [[Richard Rolfe]] and Jordan Love were inspired to create the week when they trained a group of unemployed people in coding skills which eventually led to many of them getting jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Training course for coders launched'|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2014/Pages/CodingTrainingCourse.aspx|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Gov.je|publisher=Government of Jersey|date=28 March 2014|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU predicts a significant number of digital jobs being unfilled by 2020 due to a skills shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs'|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs-0|website=DIGITAL AGENDA FOR EUROPE|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 February 2016|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard and Jordan saw an opportunity to try to inspire adults to gain the skills necessary to fill the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Coding Week|url=http://www.bailiwickexpress.com/jsy/business/national-coding-week/#.VrcrA_mLTIU|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Bailiwick Express|publisher=Bailiwick Express|date=22 September 2014|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events occurred all over Wales in libraries and hubs and was supported by [[WEA YMCA Community College Cymru]] and the [[Welsh Government]]

Speaking at the launch event in [[Cardiff Central Library]] Hub’s new digital floor, the Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism, [[Ken Skates]], said “Learning new skills such as coding can open new doors to people. We are increasingly moving into an online world and it is important that people do not miss out on opportunities to develop these skills, which have the potential to create employment opportunities. I’m delighted to launch the National Coding Week in Wales and am pleased this is taking place in a library, which is the ideal place to get support to learn new skills. It’s particularly good to launch it in the new digital floor of Cardiff Central Library, which received a grant from the Welsh Government towards its modernisation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Developing Wales as a nation of Coders'|url=http://www.weacymru.org.uk/en/news/109/0/developing-wales-as-a-nation-of-coders|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=WEA YMCA CC Cymru|publisher=WEA YMCA CC Cymru|date=28 August 2015|ref=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''neutrino detector''' is a physics apparatus which is designed to study [[neutrino]]s. Because neutrinos only [[Weak interaction|weakly interact]] with other particles of matter, neutrino detectors must be very large to detect a significant number of neutrinos. Neutrino detectors are often built underground, to isolate the detector from [[cosmic ray]]s and other background radiation.&lt;ref name=twsP16/&gt; The field of  [[neutrino astronomy]] is still very much in its infancy &amp;ndash; the only confirmed extraterrestrial sources so far as of 2018 are the [[Sun]], the [[SN 1987A|supernova 1987A]] in the nearby [[Large Magellenic Cloud]], and the [[blazar]] [[TXS 0506+056]] about 3.7 billion light years away. Neutrino observatories will "give astronomers fresh eyes with which to study the universe."&lt;ref name=twsP14/&gt;

Various detection methods have been used. [[Super Kamiokande]] is a large volume of water surrounded by [[phototube]]s that watch for the [[Cherenkov radiation]] emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an [[electron]] or [[muon]] in the water. The [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] is similar, but uses [[heavy water]] as the detecting medium. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of [[chlorine]] or [[gallium]] which are periodically checked for excesses of [[argon]] or [[germanium]], respectively, which are created by neutrinos interacting with the original substance. [[MINOS]] uses a solid plastic [[scintillator]] watched by [[phototube]]s; [[Borexino]] uses a liquid [[pseudocumene]] [[scintillator]] also watched by [[phototube]]s; and the [[NOνA]] detector uses a liquid scintillator watched by [[avalanche photodiode]]s.

The proposed acoustic detection of neutrinos via the [[thermoacoustics|thermoacoustic]] effect is the subject of dedicated studies done by the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]], [[IceCube]], and [[KM3NeT]] collaborations.

Despite how common they are, neutrinos are extremely "difficult to detect" due to their low mass and lack of electric charge. Unlike other particles, neutrinos only interact via gravity and the [[neutral current]] (involving the exchange of a [[W and Z bosons|Z boson]]) or charged current (involving the exchange of a [[W and Z bosons|W boson]]) [[weak interaction]]s. As they have only a "smidgen of rest mass" according to the laws of physics, perhaps less than a "millionth as much as an electron,"&lt;ref name="twsP16" /&gt; the gravitational force caused by neutrinos has proven too weak to detect, leaving the weak interaction as the main method for detection: 

*In a neutral current interaction, the neutrino enters and then leaves the detector after having transferred some of its energy and momentum to a target particle. If the target particle is charged and sufficiently light (e.g. an electron), it may be accelerated to a relativistic speed and consequently emit [[Cherenkov radiation]], which can be observed directly. All three neutrino flavors can participate regardless of the neutrino energy. However, no neutrino flavor information is left behind.
*In a charged current interaction, a high-energy neutrino transforms into its partner lepton (electron, muon, or tau).&lt;ref name=twsP15/&gt; However, if the neutrino does not have sufficient energy to create its heavier partner's mass, the charged current interaction is unavailable to it. Neutrinos from the sun and from nuclear reactors have enough energy to create electrons. Most accelerator-based neutrino beams can also create muons, and a few can create taus. A detector which can distinguish among these leptons can reveal the flavor of the incident neutrino in a charged current interaction. Because the interaction involves the exchange of a charged boson, the target particle also changes character (e.g., neutron → proton).

==Detection techniques==

===Scintillators===
[[Antineutrino]]s were first detected near the [[Savannah River Site|Savannah River nuclear reactor]] by the [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment]] in 1956. [[Frederick Reines]] and [[Clyde Cowan]] used two targets containing a solution of cadmium chloride in water. Two [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] detectors were placed next to the cadmium targets. Antineutrinos with an energy above the [[threshold energy|threshold]] of 1.8 [[electronvolt|MeV]] caused charged current "inverse beta-decay" interactions with the protons in the water, producing positrons and neutrons. The resulting positron annihilations with electrons created pairs of coincident photons with an energy of about 0.5 MeV each, which could be detected by the two scintillation detectors above and below the target. The neutrons were captured by cadmium nuclei resulting in delayed gamma rays of about 8 MeV that were detected a few microseconds after the photons from a positron annihilation event.

This experiment was designed by Cowan and Reines to give a unique signature for antineutrinos, to prove the existence of these particles. It was not the experimental goal to measure the total antineutrino [[flux]]. The detected antineutrinos thus all carried an energy greater 1.8 MeV, which is the threshold for the reaction channel used (1.8 MeV is the energy needed to create a positron and a neutron from a proton). Only about 3% of the antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor carry enough energy for the reaction to occur.

A more recently built and much larger [[Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector|KamLAND]] detector used similar techniques to study [[neutrino oscillation|oscillations]] of antineutrinos from 53 Japanese nuclear power plants. A smaller, but more radiopure [[Borexino]] detector was able to measure the most important components of the neutrino spectrum from the Sun, as well as antineutrinos from Earth and nuclear reactors.

===Radiochemical methods===
Chlorine detectors, based on the method suggested by [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], consist of a tank filled with a chlorine containing fluid such as [[tetrachloroethylene]]. A neutrino converts a [[chlorine]]-37 atom into one of [[argon]]-37 via the charged current interaction. The threshold neutrino energy for this reaction is 0.814 MeV. The fluid is periodically purged with [[helium]] gas which would remove the argon. The helium is then cooled to separate out the argon, and the argon atoms are counted based on their [[electron capture]] radioactive decays. A chlorine detector in the former [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] near [[Lead, South Dakota]], containing 520 [[short ton]]s (470 [[metric ton]]s) of fluid, was the first to detect the solar neutrinos, and made the first measurement of the deficit of electron neutrinos from the sun (see [[Solar neutrino problem]]).

A similar detector design, with a much lower detection threshold of 0.233 MeV, uses a [[gallium]] → [[germanium]] transformation which is sensitive to lower-energy neutrinos. A neutrino is able to react with an atom of gallium-71, converting it into an atom of the unstable isotope [[germanium]]-71. The germanium was then chemically extracted and concentrated. Neutrinos were thus detected by measuring the radioactive decay of germanium. This latter method is nicknamed the "[[Alsace-Lorraine]]" technique because of the reaction sequence (gallium-germanium-gallium) involved. Gallium and germanium are named after France and Germany, respectively, and ownership of the Alsace-Lorraine territory has historically been a point of contention between France and Germany, thus the nickname of the technique. These radiochemical detection methods are useful only for counting neutrinos; no neutrino direction or energy information is available. The [[SAGE (Soviet–American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]] experiment in Russia used about 50 tons, and the [[GALLEX]]/[[Gallium Neutrino Observatory|GNO]] experiments in Italy about 30 tons, of [[gallium]] as reaction mass. This experiment is difficult to scale up due to the prohibitive cost of gallium. Larger experiments have therefore turned to a cheaper reaction mass.

===Cherenkov detectors===
"Ring-imaging" Cherenkov detectors take advantage of a phenomenon called [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]]. Cherenkov radiation is produced whenever charged particles such as electrons or muons are moving through a given detector medium somewhat faster than the [[speed of light#In a medium|speed of light in that medium]]. In a Cherenkov detector, a large volume of clear material such as water or ice is surrounded by light-sensitive [[photomultiplier]] tubes. A charged lepton produced with sufficient energy and moving through such a detector does travel somewhat faster than the speed of light in the detector medium (although somewhat slower than the speed of light in a [[vacuum]]). The charged lepton generates a visible "optical shockwave" of [[Cherenkov radiation]]. This radiation is detected by the photomultiplier tubes and shows up as a characteristic ring-like pattern of activity in the array of photomultiplier tubes. As neutrinos can interact with atomic nuclei to produce charged leptons which emit Cherenkov radiation, this pattern can be used to infer direction, energy, and (sometimes) flavor information about incident neutrinos.

Two water-filled detectors of this type (Kamiokande and [[Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (detector)|IMB]]) recorded a neutrino burst from supernova [[SN 1987A]].&lt;ref name=twsP11&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kamiokande detector was able to detect the burst of neutrinos associated with this supernova, and in 1988 it was used to directly confirm the production of solar neutrinos. The largest such detector is the water-filled [[Super-Kamiokande]]. This detector uses 50,000 tons of pure water surrounded by 11,000 photomultiplier tubes buried 1&amp;nbsp;km underground.

The [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) uses 1,000 tonnes of [[ultrapure water|ultrapure]] [[heavy water]] contained in a 12-metre-diameter vessel made of acrylic plastic surrounded by a cylinder of ultrapure ordinary water 22 metres in diameter and 34 metres high.&lt;ref name=twsP15&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the neutrino interactions visible in a regular water detector, a neutrino can break up the deuterium in heavy water. The resulting free neutron is subsequently captured, releasing a burst of gamma rays that can be detected. All three neutrino flavors participate equally in this dissociation reaction.

The [[MiniBooNE]] detector employs pure [[mineral oil]] as its detection medium. Mineral oil is a natural [[scintillator]], so charged particles without sufficient energy to produce Cherenkov light still produce scintillation light. Low-energy muons and protons, invisible in water, can be detected.
[[File:Antares Neutrinoteleskop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An illustration of the Antares neutrino detector deployed under water.]]
Located at a depth of about 2.5&amp;nbsp;km in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] ('''''A'''stronomy with a '''N'''eutrino '''T'''elescope and '''A'''byss environmental '''RES'''earch'') is fully operational since May 30, 2008. Consisting of an array of twelve separate 350-[[meter]]-long vertical detector strings 70 meters apart, each with 75 [[photomultiplier]] optical modules, this detector uses the surrounding sea water as the detector medium. The next generation deep sea neutrino telescope [[KM3NeT]] will have a total instrumented volume of about 5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The detector will be distributed over three installation sites in the Mediterranean. Implementation of the first phase of the telescope was started in 2013.

The [[Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array]] (AMANDA) operated from 1996 to 2004. This detector used photomultiplier tubes mounted in strings buried deep (1.5–2&amp;nbsp;km) inside [[Antarctic]] glacial ice near the [[South Pole]]. The ice itself is the detector medium. The direction of incident neutrinos is determined by recording the arrival time of individual [[photon]]s using a three-dimensional array of detector modules each containing one photomultiplier tube. This method allows detection of neutrinos above [[electronvolt|50 GeV]] with a spatial resolution of approximately 2 [[degree (angle)|degrees]]. AMANDA was used to generate neutrino maps of the northern sky to search for extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to search for [[dark matter]]. AMANDA has been upgraded to the [[IceCube]] observatory, eventually increasing the volume of the detector array to one cubic kilometer.&lt;ref name=twsP13&gt;{{cite news

===Radio detectors===
The [[Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment]] uses antennas to detect Cherenkov radiation from high-energy neutrinos in Antarctica. The [[Antarctic Impulse Transient Antenna]] (ANITA) is a balloon-borne device flying over Antarctica and detecting [[Askaryan effect|Askaryan radiation]] produced by ultra-high-energy neutrinos interacting with the ice below.

===Tracking calorimeters===
Tracking calorimeters such as the [[MINOS]] detectors use alternating planes of absorber material and detector material. The absorber planes provide detector mass while the detector planes provide the tracking information. Steel is a popular absorber choice, being relatively dense and inexpensive and having the advantage that it can be magnetised. The [[NOνA]] proposal suggests eliminating the absorber planes in favor of using a very large active detector volume. The active detector is often liquid or plastic scintillator, read out with photomultiplier tubes, although various kinds of ionisation chambers have also been used.

Tracking calorimeters are only useful for high-energy (GeV range) neutrinos. At these energies, neutral current interactions appear as a shower of hadronic debris and charged current interactions are identified by the presence of the charged lepton's track (possibly alongside some form of hadronic debris.) A muon produced in a charged current interaction leaves a long penetrating track and is easy to spot. The length of this muon track and its curvature in the magnetic field provide energy and charge ({{SubatomicParticle|Muon}} versus {{SubatomicParticle|Antimuon}}) information. An electron in the detector produces an electromagnetic shower which can be distinguished from hadronic showers if the granularity of the active detector is small compared to the physical extent of the shower. Tau leptons decay essentially immediately to either pions or another charged lepton and cannot be observed directly in this kind of detector. (To directly observe taus, one typically looks for a kink in tracks in photographic emulsion.)

===Coherent Recoil Detector===
At low energies, a neutrino can scatter from the entire nucleus of an atom, rather than the individual nucleons, in a process known as "Coherent Neutral Current Neutrino-Nucleus Elastic Scattering".&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Lindley (Oct. 18, 2012). [http://nucla.physics.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/NeutrinoCoherent_2012Oct18.pdf Coherent Neutrino Scattering], UCLA. Retrieved 29 Sept. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect has been used to make an extremely small neutrino detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.aao0990|pmid=28775215|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6356/1123|title=Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=357|issue=6356|pages=1123-1126|year=2017|last1=Akimov|first1=D|last2=Albert|first2=J.

Retrieved 29 Sept. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other detection methods, coherent scattering does not depend on the flavor of the neutrino.

==Background suppression==
Most neutrino experiments must address the flux of [[cosmic ray]]s that bombard the Earth's surface.

The higher-energy (&gt;50 MeV or so) neutrino experiments often cover or surround the primary detector with a "veto" detector which reveals when a cosmic ray passes into the primary detector, allowing the corresponding activity in the primary detector to be ignored ("vetoed").

For lower-energy experiments, the cosmic rays are not directly the problem. Instead, the [[spallation]] neutrons and radioisotopes produced by the cosmic rays may mimic the desired signals. For these experiments, the solution is to place the detector deep underground so that the earth above can reduce the cosmic ray rate to acceptable levels.

==Telescopes==
Neutrino detectors can be aimed at astrophysics observations, many astrophysics events being believed to emit neutrinos.

'''Non-verbal leakage''' is a form of [[body language]]. This happens when a person verbalizes one thing but their body language does another. The most common forms of non-verbal leakage are [[List of gestures|hand-to-face]] [[gestures]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P., Friesen, W., (1968). [http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Nonverbal-Leakage-And-Clues-To-Deception.pdf Nonverbal Leakage and Clues to Deception.] Journal for the Study of Interpersonal Processes,32, 88-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important concepts in the study of body language is that of non-verbal leakage. This occurs when we say one thing but our body language gestures give a different impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holler|first=Judith|last2=Shovelton|first2=Heather|last3=Beattie|first3=Geoffrey|date=2009-06-01|title=Do Iconic Hand Gestures Really Contribute to the Communication of Semantic Information in a Face-to-Face Context?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-008-0063-9|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=73–88|doi=10.1007/s10919-008-0063-9|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most obvious of these are hand-to-face gestures. The best way to understand these is to think how you behaved when you were a small child. What did you do then if you saw something frightening? You put your hands over your eyes, because in a toddler’s mind, if you can’t see it, it’s not there.  
  
If you aren’t aware of non-verbal leakage, your body language will scream out to your audience that something is wrong. They won’t necessarily know exactly what that is, but they will subconsciously pick up the incongruity between your verbal and non-verbal messages, and that you are uncomfortable in some way about what you are saying.
 
Therefore you need to know the telltale signs of leakage so you can avoid making them and rehearse your delivery showing open, confident body language instead.
So, what do people do when they see, hear or have to say something they are uncomfortable with?

==Hand To Eyes==
The same thing occurs, but the hand wipes the mouth, scratches the face or strokes the chin. This is especially common when politicians are listening to other people speak, as they are champing at the bit to reply but have to literally hold the words back.
This gesture can be mistaken for interest and deep thought, but when this occurs the hand tends to be lower and holds or strokes the chin without touching the mouth. It is the fingers covering the mouth that makes all the difference.

==Hand To Nose==
Touching of the nose during conversation can also imply lying.
This gesture is also common when someone has been asked a difficult question and they are thinking about how to reply. It may be accompanied by statements like, "That's a good question".
Of course, it could always be that the person has an itchy nose, but when someone scratches an itch it tends to be with a vigorous motion using the fingernail. The hand to nose gesture is slower and uses the knuckle or fingertip to scratch, or pinches the bridge of the nose.

In one study, liars gave more false smiles and embarrassed smiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biland|first=C.|last2=Py|first2=J.|last3=Allione|first3=J.|last4=Demarchi|first4=S.|last5=Abric|first5=J.-C.|title=The effect of lying on intentional versus unintentional facial expressions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1162908808000029|journal=Revue Européenne de Psychologie Appliquée/European Review of Applied Psychology|volume=58|issue=2|pages=65–73|doi=10.1016/j.erap.2008.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2685">In [[engineering]], a nutating motion is similar to that seen in a [[swashplate]] mechanism. In general, a nutating plate is carried on a skewed bearing on the main shaft and does not itself rotate, whereas a swashplate is fixed to the shaft and rotates with it.  The motion is similar to the motions of coin or a tire wobbling on the ground after being dropped with the flat side down. ''[[Precession]]'' is the physical term for this kind of motion.

Nutating mixers are used in gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological scientific procedures by repetitively moving the vessels holding the liquids.  &lt;ref&gt;Trivedi. [http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/7/9/942/htm Open Source 3-D Printed Nutating Mixer]. ''Applied Sciences'',  2017, 7(9), 942; doi:10.3390/app7090942 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The nutating motion is widely employed in [[flow measurement|flowmeters]] and [[pump]]s.  The displacement of volume for one revolution is first determined.  The speed of the device in revolutions per unit time is measured.  In the case of flowmeters, the product of the rotational speed and the displacement per revolution is then taken to find the flow rate.

A [[nutating disc engine]] was patented in 1993 and a prototype was reported in 2006. The engine consisted of an internal disk wobbling on a Z-shaped shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Peter L.

[[File:Moon and pillbox - geograph.org.uk - 325948 crop.jpg|thumb|350px|A [[World War II]] hexagonal pillbox – on the bank of the [[Mells River]] at [[Lullington, Somerset]], England.]]

A '''pillbox''' is a type of [[blockhouse]], or concrete dug-in guard post, normally equipped with [[embrasure|loopholes]] through which to fire weapons. It is in effect a trench firing step hardened to protect against small-arms fire and grenades and raised to improve the field of fire.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term is disputed. It has been widely assumed to be a jocular reference to the perceived similarity of the fortifications to the cylindrical and hexagonal boxes in which medical pills were once sold.&lt;ref&gt;Hellis, John. [http://www.pillbox-study-group.org.uk/index.php/the-pillbox-study-group/why-pillbox/ "Why the name Pillbox?"] Pillbox Study Group&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems more likely that it originally alluded to [[pillar box]]es, with a comparison being drawn between the loophole on the pillbox and the letter-slot on the pillar box.&lt;ref name="Oldham18"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldham|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is found in print in ''[[The Times]]'' on 2 August 1917, following the beginning of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]; and in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' on 17 September 1917, following the German withdrawal onto the [[Hindenburg Line]]. Other unpublished occurrences have been found in [[War diary|war diaries]] and similar documents of about the same date; and in one instance, as "Pillar Box", as early as March 1916.&lt;ref name="Oldham18"/&gt;

==Description==
The concrete nature of pillboxes means that they are a feature of prepared positions. Some pillboxes were designed to be prefabricated and transported to their location for assembly. During World War I, Sir [[Ernest William Moir]] produced a design for concrete machine-gun pillboxes&lt;ref name="NA-pillbox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers on:- Machine-gun pill-box designed by Mr. E. W. Moir, Munitions Council member|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1890565|website=National Archives|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed from a system of interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof. Around 1500 Moir pillboxes were eventually produced (with blocks cast at [[Richborough]] in Kent) and sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="Oldham"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldham|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEHB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moir pillbox|url=http://sussexhistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=1521.0|website=South East History Boards|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pillboxes are often [[Military camouflage|camouflaged]] in order to conceal their location and to maximize the element of surprise. They may be part of a trench system, form an interlocking line of defence with other pillboxes by providing covering fire to each other ([[defence in depth]]), or they may be placed to guard strategic structures such as bridges and jetties.

The French [[Maginot Line]] built between the world wars consisted of a massive [[bunker]] and tunnel complex, but as most of it was below ground little could be seen from the ground level. The exception were the concrete [[blockhouse]]s, [[gun turret]]s, pillboxes and [[cupola (military)|cupola]]s which were placed above ground to allow the garrison of the Maginot line to engage an attacking enemy.{{sfn|Schneider|Kitchen|2002|p=87}}

Between the [[Abyssinia Crisis|Abyssinian Crisis]] of 1936 and [[World War II]], the British built about 200 pillboxes on the island of [[Malta]] for defence in case of an Italian invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guided tour of WWII defences|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20051205/local/guided-tour-of-wwii-defences.69984|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 100 pillboxes still exist, and most are found on the northeastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed nowadays as the authorities do not consider them to have any architectural or historic value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wartime pillbox at Salina being pulled down|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-04-10/news/wartime-pillbox-at-salina-being-pulled-down-4577918976/|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite heritage NGOs calling to preserve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leone Ganado|first1=Philip|title=WWII pillbox is not worth preserving, cultural watchdog says|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160830/local/wwii-pillbox-is-not-worth-preserving-cultural-watchdog-says.623544|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=30 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830155858/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160830/local/wwii-pillbox-is-not-worth-preserving-cultural-watchdog-says.623544|archivedate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 28,000 [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications]] were constructed in England in 1940 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]. About 6,500 of these structures still survive.{{sfn|CBA staff}}

Pillboxes for the [[Czechoslovak border fortifications]] were built before World War II in [[Czechoslovakia]] in defence against a German attack. None of these were actually used against their intended enemy during the German invasion, but some were used against the advancing Soviet armies in 1945. The [[Japan]]ese also made use of pillboxes in their fortifications of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]].

Pillboxes were hard to defeat and required artillery, anti-tank weapons or grenades to overcome.

In [[sociology]], '''postmaterialism''' is the transformation of individual values from materialist, physical, and economic to new individual values of autonomy and self-expression.

The term was popularized by the political scientist [[Ronald Inglehart]] in his 1977 book ''The Silent Revolution'', in which he discovered that the formative affluence experienced by the post-war generations was leading some of them to take their material security for granted and instead place greater importance on non-material goals such as self-expression, autonomy, freedom of speech, gender equality and environmentalism. Inglehart argued that with increasing prosperity, such postmaterial values would gradually increase in the publics of advanced industrial societies through the process of intergenerational replacement.

Postmaterialism is a tool in developing an understanding of modern culture. It can be considered in reference of three distinct concepts of [[materialism]]. The first kind of materialism, and the one in reference to which the word postmaterialism is used most often, refers to [[economic materialism|materialism]] as a value-system relating to the desire for fulfillment of material needs (such as security, sustenance and shelter) and an emphasis on material luxuries in a [[consumerism|consumerist]] society. A second referent is the [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] held by many [[socialists]], most notably [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as their philosophic concept of [[dialectical materialism]]. The third definition of materialism concerns the philosophical argument that matter is the only existing reality. The first concept is sociological, the second is both philosophical and sociological, and the third is philosophical.

Depending on which of the three above notions of materialism are being discussed, postmaterialism can be an [[ontology|ontological]] postmaterialism, an existentialistic postmaterialism, an ethical postmaterialism, or a political-sociological postmaterialism, which is also the best known.

==History==
The sociological theory of postmaterialism was developed in the 1970s by [[Ronald Inglehart]]. After extensive survey research, Inglehart postulated that the Western societies under the scope of his survey were undergoing transformation of individual values, switching from materialist values, emphasizing economic and physical security, to a new set of postmaterialist values, which instead emphasized [[autonomy]] and [[Self-expression Values|self-expression]].{{sfn|Inglehart|2008}} Inglehart argued that rising prosperity was gradually liberating the publics of advanced industrial societies from the stress of basic acquisitive or materialistic needs.

Observing that the younger people were much more likely to embrace postmaterialist values, Inglehart speculated that this [[silent revolution]] was not merely a case of a life-cycle change, with people becoming more materialist as they aged, but a genuine example of [[generational replacement]] causing intergenerational value change.{{sfn|Inglehart|1971}}

The theory of intergenerational change is based on two key hypotheses:
* The scarcity hypothesis
* The socialization hypothesis

===The scarcity hypothesis===

Inglehart assumed that individuals pursue various goals in something akin to a hierarchical order. While people may universally aspire to freedom and autonomy, the most pressing material needs like hunger, thirst and physical security have to be satisfied first, since they are immediately linked with survival. According to Inglehart's interpretation of [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of human goals]], while [[scarcity]] prevails, these ''materialistic'' goals will have priority over postmaterialist goals like belonging, esteem, and aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction. However, once the satisfaction of the survival needs can be taken for granted, the focus will gradually shift to these "non-material" goods.{{sfn|Inglehart|1977}}

===The socialization hypothesis===

The relationship between material conditions and value priorities is not one of immediate adjustment. A large body of evidence indicates that people's basic values are largely fixed when they reach adulthood, and change relatively little thereafter.{{sfn|Rokeach|1968}} Therefore, [[cohort (statistics)|cohorts]] which often experienced economic scarcity would ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' (all things being equal) place a high value on meeting economic needs (such as valuing economic growth above protecting the environment) and on safety needs (will support more authoritarian styles of leadership, will exhibit strong feelings of national pride, will be strongly in favour of maintaining a large, strong army and will be more willing to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of [[law and order (politics)|law and order]]). On the other hand, cohorts who have experienced sustained high material affluence start to give high priority to values such as [[individual]] improvement, personal [[freedom (political)|freedom]], [[citizen]] input in government decisions, the ideal of a society based on [[humanism]], and maintaining a clean and healthy [[environmentalism|environment]].

Together, these two hypotheses carry the implication that, given long periods of material affluence, a growing part of society will embrace postmaterialist value systems, an implication which has been indeed borne out internationally in the past 30 years of survey data. The postmaterial orientations acquired by each cohort during [[socialization]] have been observed to remain remarkably steady over the time-frame of multiple decades, being a more stable [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]-system in contrast to the more volatile political and [[social attitude]]s.

===Measuring postmaterialism===
There are several ways of empirically measuring the spread of postmaterialism in a society. A common and relatively simple way is by creating an index from survey respondents' patterns of responses to a series of items which were designed to measure personal political priorities.

{{quote|"If you had to choose among the following things, which are the ''two'' that seem the most desirable to you?
* Maintaining order in the nation.
* Giving people more say in important political decisions.
* Fighting rising prices.
* Protecting [[freedom of speech]]."

... On the basis of the choices made among these four items, it is possible to classify our respondents into value priority groups, ranging from a "pure" acquisitive type to a "pure" post-[[bourgeois]] type, with several intermediate categories.{{sfn|Inglehart|1971|pp=994–995}}}}

The theoretical assumptions and the empirical research connected with the concept of postmaterialism have received considerable attention and critical discussion in the human sciences. Amongst others, the [[validity (statistics)|validity]], the stability, and the causation of postmaterialism has been doubted.

The so-called "Inglehart-index" has been included in several [[statistical survey|surveys]] (e.g., [[General Social Survey]], [[World Values Survey]], [[Eurobarometer]], [[ALLBUS]], [[Turning Points of the Life-Course]]). The [[time series]] in ALLBUS ([[German General Social Survey]]) is particularly comprehensive. From 1980 to 1990 the share of "pure post-materialists" increased from 13 to 31 per cent in West Germany. After the economic and social stress caused by [[German reunification]] in 1990 it dropped to 23 per cent in 1992 and stayed on that level afterwards.{{sfnm |1a1=Terwey |1y=2000 |1p=155 |2a1=ZA |2a2=ZUMA |2y=2005}} The ALLBUS [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] from the less affluent population in East Germany show much lower portions of postmaterialists (1991: 15 per cent, 1992: 10 per cent, 1998: 12 per cent). International [[data]] from the 2000 [[World Values Survey]] show the highest percentage of postmaterialists in [[Australia]] (35 per cent) followed by [[Austria]] (30 per cent), [[Canada]] (29 per cent), [[Italy]] (28 per cent), [[Argentina]] (25 per cent), [[United States]] (25 per cent), [[Sweden]] (22 per cent), [[Netherlands]] (22 per cent), [[Puerto Rico]] (22 per cent) etc.{{sfn|Inglehart|Basáñez|Díez-Medrano|Halmann|2004|p=384}} In spite of some questions raised by these and other data, measurements of postmaterialism have ''prima facie'' proven to be statistically important variables in many analyses.{{sfn|Kislev|2017}}

As increasing postmaterialism is based on the abundance of material possessions or resources, it should not be mixed indiscriminately with [[asceticism]] or general denial of consumption. In some way postmaterialism may be described as super-materialism. German data show that there is a tendency towards this orientation among young people, in the economically rather secure public service, and in the managerial middle class.{{sfn|Pappi|Terwey|1982}}

Recently, the issue of a "second generation of postmaterialism" appearing on the scene of worldwide civil society, to a large extent conceived as their "positive ideological embodiment", has been brought up by cultural scientist Roland Benedikter in his seven-volume book series ''Postmaterialismus'' (2001–2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26675">'''Reflectometry''' uses the [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] of [[wave]]s at [[interface (matter)|surfaces and interfaces]] to detect or characterize objects.

There are many different forms of reflectometry. They can be classified in several ways: by the used radiation (electromagnetic, ultrasound, particle beams), by the geometry of wave propagation (unguided versus wave guides or cables), by the involved length scales (wavelength and [[penetration depth]] versus size of the investigated object), by the method of measurement (continuous versus pulsed, polarization resolved, ...), and by the application domain.

== Used radiation ==

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] of widely varying wavelength is used in many different forms of reflectometry:
* [[Radar]] and [[Lidar]]: Reflections of electromagnetic pulses are used to detect the presence and to measure the location and speed of objects like aircraft, missiles, ships, cars.
* Characterization of Semiconductor and Dielectric Thin Films: Analysis of reflectance data utilizing the [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|Forouhi Bloomer dispersion equations]] can determine the thickness, [[refractive index]], and [[Complex index of refraction|extinction coefficient]] of thin films utilized in the [[semiconductor]] industry.
* [[X-ray reflectometry]]: is a surface-sensitive analytical technique used in chemistry, physics, and materials science to characterize surfaces, thin films and multilayers.
Propagation of electric pulses in [[electric cable|cable]]s is used to detect and localize defects in electric wiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1 =M.K. | last1=Smail |first2 =T. |last2=Hacib |first3=L. |last3=Pichon |first4=F. |last4=Loete |title =Detection and Location of Defects in Wiring Networks Using Time-Domain Reflectometry and Neural Networks  | journal =IEEE Transactions on magnetics|year = 2011 | volume = 47| issue = 5 | pages = 1502–1505 | doi = 10.1109/TMAG.2010.2089503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 =C.  |last1 =Furse |first2 = R. |last2 = Haupt |title = Down to the wire: The hidden hazard of aging aircraft wiring |journal = IEEE Spectrum | year = 2001 | volume = 38 | issue = 2 |pages = 35–39 |doi = 10.1109/6.898797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] reflectometry: A [[transducer]] generates [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] waves which propagates until it reaches the interface between the propagation medium and the sample. The wave is partially reflected at the interface and partially transmitted into the sample. The waves reflected at the interface travel back to the transducer, then the [[Acoustic impedance|impedance]] of a sample is determined by measuring the [[amplitude]] of the wave reflected from the propagation medium/sample interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = D.J. | last1 = McClements | first2 = P. | last2 =Fairley | title =Ultrasonic pulse echo reflectometer | journal = Ultrasonics | year = 1990| volume = 29 | issue = 1 |pages = 58–62 |doi = 10.1016/0041-624X(91)90174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the reflected wave, it is possible to determine some properties of the sample that is desired to characterize. Applications include [[medical ultrasonography]] and [[nondestructive testing]].

[[Neutron reflectometry]]: is a [[neutron diffraction]] technique for measuring the structure of [[thin film]]s, similar to the often complementary techniques of X-ray reflectivity and [[ellipsometry]]. The technique provides valuable information over a wide variety of scientific and technological applications including [[Particle aggregation|chemical aggregation]], [[polymer]] and [[surfactant]] [[adsorption]], structure of thin film [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] systems, biological membranes.

== Skin reflectance ==
In anthropology, reflectometry devices are often used to gauge [[human skin color]] through the measurement of skin reflectance. These devices are typically pointed at the upper arm or forehead, with the emitted waves then interpreted at various percentages. Lower frequencies represent lower skin reflectance and thus darker pigmentation, whereas higher frequencies represent greater skin reflectance and therefore lighter pigmentation.&lt;ref name="JablonskiChaplin2000"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Jablonski, N. G., and G. Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2000|volume=39|issue=1|page=57|url=http://anth.la.psu.edu/research/research-labs/jablonski-lab/research/JablonskiLabskin.pdf|accessdate=30 August 2017|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different reflectometry techniques ==
Many techniques are based on the principle of reflectometry and are distinguished by the type of waves used and the analysis of the reflected signal. Among all these techniques, we can classify the main but not limited to:
* In [[time-domain reflectometry]] (TDR), one emits a train of fast pulses, and analyzes the magnitude, duration and shape of the reflected pulses.
* Frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR):&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = B.J. | last1 = Soller | first2 = D.K. | last2 =Gifford |first3 = M.S. | last3 = Wolfe |first4 = M.E. |last4 = Froggatt  | title =High resolution optical frequency domain reflectometry for characterization of components and assemblies | journal = Optics Express | year = 2005| volume = 13 | issue = 2 |pages = 666–674 |doi = 10.1364/OPEX.13.000666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=C. |last1=Furse |first2=You |last2=C.C. |last3=Dangol |first3=R |last4=Nielsen |first4=M. |last5=Mabey |first5=G. |last6=Woodward \first6=R. |title=Frequency-Domain Reflectometery for on-Board Testing of Aging Aircraft Wiring |journal=IEEE Transactions on electromagnetic compatibility |volume=45 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=306–315 |doi=10.1109/TEMC.2003.811305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this technique is based on the transmission of a set of stepped-frequency sine waves from the sample. As for the TDR, these waves propagate until the sample and are reflected back to the source. Several types of FDR exist and are commonly used in radar applications or characterization of cables/wires. The signal analysis is focused rather on the changes in frequency between the incident signal and the reflected signal.
* [[Ellipsometry]] is the polarization-resolved measurement of light reflections from thin films.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4289">'''SERENDIP''' ('''Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations''') is a [[Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] (SETI) program originated by the [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="SERENDIP"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://seti.ssl.berkeley.edu/serendip/ | title = SERENDIP | publisher = [[UC Berkeley]] | accessdate = 2006-08-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130311222213/http://seti.ssl.berkeley.edu/serendip | archivedate = 2013-03-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SERENDIP takes advantage of ongoing "mainstream" [[radio telescope]] observations as a "[[wikt:piggybacking|piggy-back]]" or "[[commensal]]" program. Rather than having its own observation program, SERENDIP analyzes [[Deep Sky|deep space]] radio telescope data that it obtains while other [[astronomer]]s are using the telescope.

==Background==
The initial SERENDIP instrument was a 100-channel [[analog transmission|analog]] radio [[spectrometer]] covering 100&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Subsequent instruments have been significantly more capable, with the number of channels doubling roughly every year. These instruments have been deployed at a large number of telescopes including the NRAO 90m telescope at Green Bank and the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo 305m telescope]].

SERENDIP observations have been conducted at frequencies between 400 [[MHz]] and 5 [[GHz]], with most observations near the so-called Cosmic [[waterhole (radio)|Water Hole]] (1.42&amp;nbsp;GHz (21&amp;nbsp;cm) neutral [[hydrogen]] and 1.66&amp;nbsp;GHz [[hydroxyl]] transitions).

==Projects==
The most recently deployed SERENDIP spectrometer, SERENDIP V.v, was installed at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in June 2009 and is currently operational. The digital back-end instrument is an [[FPGA]]-based 128 million-channel digital spectrometer covering 200&amp;nbsp;MHz of bandwidth.  It takes data commensally with the seven-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naic.edu/alfa/&lt;/ref&gt; (ALFA).

The next generation of SERENDIP experiments, SERENDIP VI was deployed in 2014 at both [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] and the [[Green Bank Telescope]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lebofsky|first1=Matt|title=SETI@Home Mid June Update|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=77575|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SERENDIP VI will also look for fast radio bursts, in collaboration with scientists from [[University of Oxford]] and [[West Virginia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winter 2013 SETI@home Letter|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/donor_letter_nov13.php|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Findings==
The program has found around 400 suspicious signals, but there is not enough data to prove that they belong to [[extraterrestrial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lnfm1.sai.msu.ru/SETI/koi/articles/lmg%20seti%20poisk/1.9.htm Л.М.Гиндилис. Радиопоиск: век двадцатый]&lt;/ref&gt; The most interesting [[Wow! signal|signal «Wow!»]] was recorded in August 1977 but it was observed for only a very short time and disappeared before it had been identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intellect-video.com/1437/Gordon-Poisk-vnezemnykh-tsivilizatsiy-online/ В.Г.

The '''School of Politics and International Relations''' is an academic department at the [[University of Nottingham]], England housed in the Law and Social Sciences Building (LASS) together with Law and Sociology. 

The school runs nine undergraduate programmes, nine postgraduate programmes and have a 40-strong PhD community.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nottspolitics.org/about/|title=About – Ballots &amp; Bullets - School of Politics &amp; International Relations, University of Nottingham|website=Nottspolitics.org|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research activity in the school is ranked around 7 Institutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/research/index.aspx|title=Research - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}} the Head of School was Matthew Humphrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/about-the-school/index.aspx|title=About Us - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the department was chosen along with the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Manchester]] to host the 2015 British Election Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2013/march/consortium-plays-host-to-british-election-study.aspx|title=Consortium plays host to British Election Study - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise the Department's research was ranked in the top 10 departments of Politics in the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/about-the-school/history.aspx School History - The University of Nottingham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324050255/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Politics/About-the-School/History.aspx |date=2010-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 85% of the research was considered of international standard.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The department ranks 12th in The Guardian's 2013 league table of Politics departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2012/may/22/university-guide-politics|title=University guide 2013: league table for politics|date=22 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Complete University Guide ranked Nottingham 10th for Politics in 2013 and 13th for Politics in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Politics|title=Politics - Top UK University Subject Tables and Rankings 2019|website=Thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The School of Politics and International Relations at Nottingham was established in 1965 and was initially housed in the old Engineering Building. Richard Pear was the first Professor of Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/about-the-school/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324050255/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Politics/About-the-School/History.aspx |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Politics had previously been taught as early as 1959 as part of the Department of Social Science where Politics formed part of a joint degree in Politics and Economics.

In 1971 the Sir Francis Hill chair was established following an endowment from the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company and Frank Stacey, an expert in local government was appointed. In 1981 [[Dennis Kavanagh]] joined the school. Kavanagh is best known for his work on the [[Nuffield Election Studies]]. The School moved to the 'Orchards' Building during the 1980s. Several new degrees were introduced during the 1980s including an MA in Political Economy and Political Culture and a joint BA in Politics and History and an MA in International Relations.

In 1994 the head of department Dr David Regan committed suicide by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]  and cited his treatment by the University of Nottingham in a suicide note. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/pressure-for-nottingham-suicide-inquiry-continues/98080.article|title=Pressure for Nottingham suicide inquiry continues|date=3 February 1995|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999 moved to the Law and Social Sciences Building (LASS) and changed its name to the ‘School of Politics and International Relations' in 2005.
In 2011 the school gained national media attention following the arrest of two  student one of whom was completing a PhD related to terrorism.  Dr Rod Thornton published a paper critical of the department’s handling of the incident and was subsequently suspended. Thornton later left by “mutual consent”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.impactnottingham.com/2012/06/dr-rod-thornton-leaves-the-university-after-mutual-agreement/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307143141/http://www.impactnottingham.com/2012/06/dr-rod-thornton-leaves-the-university-after-mutual-agreement/# |archive-date=2014-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===David Regan===
In 1994 the then head of the department [[David Regan (academic)|David Regan]] killed himself in a protest against decisions made by management at the University of Nottingham which he disagreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/suicide-was-sacrificial-1448829.html|title=Suicide 'was sacrificial'|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University rejected calls for a public inquiry into the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/academics-call-for-inquiry-into-sacrificial-suicide-1571725.html|title=Academics call for inquiry into `sacrificial' suicide|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nottingham Two===
{{main|Nottingham Two}}
The School received international media attention in 2011 when an academic in the department [[Rod Thornton]] published an academic paper critical of the department and the [[University of Nottingham]]'s handling of the arrest of a student called [[Rizwaan Sabir]] who was completing a PhD thesis on terrorism. Mr Sabir downloaded a copy of an Al-Qaeda training manual from a US government website and was wrongly arrested on terrorism charges. The University of Nottingham described the paper as defamatory to a number of Thornton's colleagues in the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-13350702|title=Chomsky concern over 'suspension'|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=18 October 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton later apologized for inaccuracies in his paper and left his job by mutual consent.

===Miwa Hirono visa controversy===
In 2015 [[Times Higher Education]] reported that the Home Office had refused a visa for the academic [[Miwa Hirono]], an expert on Chinese foreign policy,  on the basis she had spent around 200 days in the past five years resident in China researching China's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Matthew Humphrey, head of Nottingham’s School of Politics and International Relations said that the policy was “vindictive and bone-headed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/visa-refusal-for-china-expert-miwa-hirono-is-pure-madness/2019182.article#.VQo4JuTMIac.twitter|title=Visa refusal for China expert Miwa Hirono is ‘pure madness’|date=19 March 2015|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Student Spaceflight Experiments Program''' ('''SSEP''') provides an opportunity for student groups from upper elementary school through university to design and fly [[microgravity]] experiments in [[low Earth orbit|low Earth orbit (LEO)]].&lt;ref name="ncesse_ssep"&gt;{{cite web | title = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | date = October 30, 2012 | url = http://ncesse.org/programs/student-spaceflight-experiments-program/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSEP is a program of the [[National Center for Earth and Space Science Education]] (NCESSE, a project of the [[Tides Center]]), the [[Arthur C. Clarke]] Institute for Space Education, and the private space hardware company [[NanoRacks]].&lt;ref name="gaskill"/&gt; SSEP operates under a [[Space Act Agreement]] between the sponsoring organizations and [[NASA]], allowing the  [[International Space Station]] (ISS) to be utilized as a [[Center for the Advancement of Science in Space|national laboratory]].&lt;ref name="spaceref"&gt;{{cite web | title = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program – Mission 6 to the International Space Station | work = spaceref.com | publisher = SpaceRef Interactive Inc. | date = October 30, 2013 | url = http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=44901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The program was launched in June 2010, by NCESSE in the U.S. and by the Clarke Institute internationally.&lt;ref name="gaskill"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gaskill | first = Melissa | title = Student Scientists Present Unexpected Results from Space Station Research | work = Space Station: Research &amp; Technology | publisher = [[NASA]] | date = August 6, 2014 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/2014_ssep_conference/#.VDsAivmwLYj }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}}, SSEP has sponsored fourteen missions to LEO – two on board the [[Space Shuttle]], and twelve to the ISS – with a thirteenth mission to the ISS announced in March 2018, and expected to fly in the spring/summer of 2019.&lt;ref name="ssep_in_the_news"&gt;{{cite web | title = SSEP in the News | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/in-the-news/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission7"&gt;{{cite web | last = Goldstein | first = Jeff | title = New Flight Opportunity for School Districts: Announcing Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP) Mission 7 to the International Space Station for 2014-15 Academic Year | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | date = April 21, 2014 | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/2014/04/new-flight-opportunity-for-school-districts-announcing-student-spaceflight-experiments-program-ssep-mission-7-to-the-international-space-station-for-2014-15-academic-year/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mission 13"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Flight Opportunity for School Districts: Announcing Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP) Mission 13 to the International Space Station, Starting September 2018|url=http://ssep.ncesse.org/2018/03/new-flight-opportunity-for-school-districts-announcing-student-spaceflight-experiments-program-ssep-mission-13-to-the-international-space-station-starting-september-2018/|publisher=Student Spaceflight Experiments Program|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first fourteen SSEP flight opportunities, 86,800 students in grades 5 through 16 ([[Senior (education)|senior undergraduate]] in the [[higher education in the United States|U.S. higher education system]]) participated in experiment design and proposal writing. Of 18,759 proposals received, a total of 240 experiments were selected for flight, with one from each community participating in each flight opportunity. {{As of|2017|8|14}}, 206 of these experiments have been successfully launched.&lt;ref name="experiments_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Experiments Selected for Flight | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18 experiments comprising Mission 6 to the ISS were lost when the [[Cygnus CRS Orb-3]] vehicle exploded shortly after launch on 28 October 2014.&lt;ref name=bever&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bever|first1=Lindsey|title=Students lost science experiments in Antares explosion|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/29/students-lost-science-experiments-in-antares-explosion/|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The competition to select student projects for flight is designed to resemble a standard [[research proposal]] process. Interested groups must submit proposals in response to [[request for proposal|announced criteria]]; these proposals are then [[peer-review]]ed against the criteria in a two-stage selection process, with the vast majority of proposals rejected.&lt;ref name="the_competition"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Flight Experiment Design Competition | work = ncesse.org | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education  | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/about-ssep/the-flight-experiment-design-competition/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each selected experiment is provided with one mini-laboratory, which is flown on the ISS and then returned to Earth for analysis.&lt;ref name="mission7"/&gt; Experiments selected for flight have included research into [[crystal growth]], [[composting]], [[cell division]], [[seed germination]], and [[calcium metabolism]].&lt;ref name="mission4_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 4 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-4-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission5_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 5 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-5-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mission6_selected"&gt;{{cite web | title = Selected Experiments on SSEP Mission 6 to ISS | work = Student Spaceflight Experiments Program Community Network Hubsite | publisher = National Center for Earth and Space Science Education | url = http://ssep.ncesse.org/communities/experiments-selected-for-flight/selected-experiments-on-ssep-mission-6-to-iss/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of each experiment is on the order of [[United States dollar|US$]]24,500, which must be raised by the community developing the experiment.&lt;ref name="bass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssep.ncesse.org/about-ssep/ssep-program-costs/|title=SSEP Program costs|last=|first=|date=|work=ncesse.org|publisher=National Center for Earth and Space Science Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students have an opportunity to share their research at a national conference sponsored by the Smithsonian [[National Air and Space Museum]], NCESSE, and the Clarke Institute.&lt;ref name="gaskill"/&gt; Students participating in the program have also been given the chance to participate in a [[videoconferencing|videoconference]] with space station astronauts.&lt;ref name="nasm"&gt;{{cite web | last = Grove | first = Tim | title = An Out-of-This-World Program | work = nasm.si.edu | publisher = Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum | date = April 26, 2013 | url = http://blog.nasm.si.edu/education/an-out-of-this-world-program/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Oxford History of Western Music''''' is a narrative history from the "earliest [[Musical notation|notation]]s" (taken to be around the eighth century) to the late twentieth century. It was written by the American musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]]. Published by [[Oxford University Press]], it is a multi-volume work, but is shorter than the same publisher's ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', which is written by multiple contributors. 

The ''Oxford History of Western Music'' appeared in 2005. A paperback edition in five volumes followed in 2009. It is available online, but is not part of [[Oxford Music Online]], the portal which gives electronic access to the ''New Grove Dictionary'' (Grove Music Online) and ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''.&lt;ref name="Guidedtour"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/page/guided-tour | title=Guided Tour (www.oxfordwesternmusic.com) | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Previous histories of music==
OUP had previously published narrative histories of music, although Taruskin was more influenced by [[Donald Jay Grout]]'s work ''A History of Western Music'' (New York, 1960).&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E0D81630F93AA25751C1A9629C8B63&amp;smid=tw-share "A History of Western Music? Well, It's a Long Story"] (brief interview with Taruskin by [[James Oestreich]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Oxford History of Music'' was first published in six volumes under the general editorship of Sir [[Henry Hadow]] between 1901 and 1905. The first two volumes, written by [[Harry Ellis Wooldridge|H. E. Woolridge]], were entitled ''The Polyphonic Period'', and began with the [[music of ancient Greece]]: these volumes dated quite quickly. Other volumes were reprinted as they stood, but Sir [[Percy Buck]] , who was also involved with the OUP's ''Tudor Church Music'', revised the first two volumes (1929 and 1932), and edited a new introductory volume (1929). The introductory volume included a contribution from [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Pimlott Baker, ‘Buck, Sir Percy Carter (1871–1947)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58744, accessed 16 Aug 2016] (subscription or membership of a UK public library required)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''New Oxford History of Music'', produced under the general editorship of Sir [[Jack Westrup]], began to appear in 1954.
Contributors included [[Paul Steinitz]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9910">A '''Thummer''' is a proposed commercial [[musical instrument]]  characterized by
#at least one [[isomorphic keyboard]], and
#thumb-operated and/or motion-sensing expressive controls.

The Thummer was to be a type of [[jammer keyboard]]. Research suggests that the jammer's combination of thumb-controls and internal motion sensors could give more [[expressive potential (electronic music)|expressive potential]] than other [[Polyphony (instrument)|polyphonic]] musical instruments such as the [[piano]], [[guitar]], and [[accordion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==

===Origin of jammer and Thummer===
The [[jammer keyboard]] was invented by [[Jim Plamondon]] in September 2003, whereupon he founded Thumtronics to design its "Thummer(tm)-brand jammer" and bring it to market, the trade name was to emphasize the unique thumb-control feature. Prototype Thummers were produced, but the effort to commercialize them failed, and Thumtronics was disbanded in mid-2009.

However the concepts developed and publicized by the company are still being developed by alternate-keyboard enthusiasts.

==="Jammer" versus the "Thummer" name===
Just as [[Kleenex]](tm) is a trademarked brand of [[facial tissue]], and the [[Stratocaster]](tm) is a [[trademark]]ed [[brand]] of [[electric guitar]], the ''Thummer'' was intended to be a trademarked brand of "a new kind of musical instrument." The term ''jammer'' was introduced to give that "new kind of musical instrument" a generic, non-trademarked name.

===Design Goals===
Thumtronics' design goals for the Thummer, which continue to influence the independent development of jammers, were the 7 "E"s:

# Easy: Facilitate the rapid acquisition of a self-sustaining level of musical competence in both composition and performance.
# Expressive: Offer more [[expressive potential (electronic music)|expressive potential]] than most musical instruments.
# Ergonomic: Place significantly less stress on its player's body than the average traditional musical instrument.
# Ergonomic: Place the keys and other controls within easy, fast reach.
# Expansive: Expand the frontiers of music-making, by (a) providing a single interface for the performance of the music of all known past and present human cultures, and (b) enabling the exploration and control of new tonalities (via effects such as Dynamic tonality).
# Everywhere: Be sufficiently portable to go everywhere, from concert hall to campfire.
# Everyone: Affordable (once in high-volume production) by people living at the First World's poverty level.

# At least one 2-dimensional keyboard in a hexagonal array; preferably, one for each hand.&lt;br&gt;The keys of the left-hand instrument are mirror-imaged to those on the right, to match the mirroring of one's hands.

# At least one thumb-operated expressive control (such as the thumb-operated joysticks found on [[Gamepad#Seventh Generation|seventh-generation video game controllers]]).
# Optionally, other expressive controls, such as internal motion-sensors (such as those found in the [[Wii Remote]] video game controller), foot-pedals, breath controllers, etc.

== Advantages over a standard keyboard ==
The Thummer was intended to have these advantages over a piano-style keyboard
{| class="wikitable"
! Advantage !! Reason
|- style="vertical-align:top"
|Simple to learn ||Music intervals are mapped to the same vector: a consistent angle and spacing
|-style="vertical-align:top"
|Easy to play ||only one fingering needs be learned, instead of the 24 (12 for each hand) needed for the standard keyboard
|-style="vertical-align:top"
|Fast to play||The average distance the fingers need to move is reduced by a factor of 10 or more:

== Limitations and disadvantages over a standard keyboard ==

* The distance between chromatic intervals is greater
* Not all chord inversions are easy to finger
* Some reviewers believe chromatic scales are harder to play
* Harder to learn than the piano in C major
* No teachers or body of pedagogy
* Fingering techniques are still being developed
* No formal theory of play has been developed, although one is under development, and related to standard jazz "jamming" techniques.
* High cost of hexagonal keyboards relative to the standard keyboard (given current sales volumes)

=== Design Rationale ===
Of the large number of [[Isomorphic keyboard|isomorphic]] note assignments possible, the Thummer's Wicki-Hayden format was chosen since all notes of the major and minor scales fall under the fingers and the relative simplicity of relating it to conventional music notation.
[[File:Jammer Basic fingering.png|thumb|Standard fingering position. Note the small travel distance to many notes.]]
All chords found in conventional chord progressions (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi and viii, as well as others), in most inversions, can be easily played in the jammer arrangement with minimal hand movement.

This layout also places the octaves ascending vertically, increasing the notes playable at once, easing chord inversions and greatly reducing the time needed to move to a new note.

==Ergonomic Factors==
No one became expert on a Thummer, however [[Fitts law]] {link} predicts that the jammer will be very significantly faster to play that a conventional keyboard.
The expected playing speed is (log base 2 (30% smaller key / ~1000% distance decrease), or about 75% less to time find and press an average key.

==Commercially available==
Some isomorphic keyboards are commercially available, including:

* The Stagi Hayden Duet Concertina uses the [http://www.concertina.com/gaskins/wicki Wicki-Hayden] note-layout (known as the 'Hayden' layout by concertina players), it may only be available second-hand.

==Software==
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090125094835/http://www.wicki.org.uk/ Wicki.org.uk], free UK site containing  Java, Flash, and PC applications to enable users to play their alpha-numeric keyboard to sound 12 equal tempered pitches using Wicki/Hayden or [[Jankó keyboard]] layout.

"Vital force theory" is a proposed mechanism for the ascent of sap through the [[xylem]] tissue of plants.

According to the vital force theory, the conduction of water up the [[xylem]] vessel is a result of vital action of the '''living [[cell (biology)|cells]]''' in the xylem tissue. These living cells are involved in ascent of sap. Relay pump theory and Pulsation theory support the active theory of ascent of sap.  

[[Emil Godlewski (senior)]] (1884) proposed Relay pump or Clamberinh force theory (through xylem parenchyma) and [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]](1923) proposed pulsation theory (due to pulsatory activities of innermost cortical cells just outside endodermis).  

[[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] suggested a mechanism for the [[ascent of sap]] in 1927. His theory can be explained with the help of galvanometer of electric probes. He found electrical ‘pulsations’ or oscillations in electric potentials, and came to believe these were coupled with rhythmic movements in the telegraph plant ''[[Codariocalyx motorius]]'' (then ''[[Desmodium]]''). On the basis of this Bose theorized that regular wave-like ‘pulsations’ in cell [[electric potential]] and [[turgor pressure]] were an [[endogenous]] form of [[cell (biology)|cell]] signaling. According to him the '''living cells''' in the inner lining of the xylem tissue pump water by contractive and expulsive movements similar to the animal [[heart]] circulating blood. 

This mechanism has not been well supported, and in spite of some ongoing debate, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the cohesion-tension theory for the ascent of sap.

In [[conservation biology]], '''susceptibility''' is the extent to which an organism or ecological community would suffer from a threatening process or factor if exposed, without regard to the likelihood of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srex/SREX-Chap2_FINAL.pdf|first1= J. |last1=Birkmann|display-authors=etal|publisher= Cambridge University Press|date=2012|pages= 65-108}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with '''vulnerability''', which takes into account both the effect of exposure ''and'' the likelihood of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vulnerability|url=https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~nabo/meetings/glthec/materials/simpson/GEC_sdarticle2.pdf|first1=W. Neil |last1=Adger|journal=Global Environmental Change |volume=16 |date=2006|pages=268–281|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a plant species may be highly susceptible to a particular plant disease, meaning that exposed populations invariably become extinct or decline heavily. However, that species may not be vulnerable if it occurs only in areas where exposure to the disease is unlikely, or if it occurs over such a wide distribution that exposure of all populations is unlikely. Conversely, a plant species may show low susceptibility to a disease, yet may be considered vulnerable if the disease is present in every population.

'''''Why Is It So?''''' is an educational science series produced in [[Australia]] by [[ABC Television]] from 1963 to 1986. The series was hosted by American scientist [[Julius Sumner Miller]], who demonstrated experiments in the world of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/science/features/whyisitso/&lt;/ref&gt; The series was also screened in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and in Europe. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/science/features/whyisitso/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This program was based on his 1959 series ''[[Julius Sumner Miller#Television|Why Is It So?]]'' in the United States on [[KCBS-TV|KNXT]] Channel 2 in [[Los Angeles]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.queensu.ca/CBC/W.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527160858/http://www.film.queensu.ca/CBC/W.html |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }} Why is it so?  4 Sep–23 Oct 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''work of art''', '''artwork''', '''art piece''', '''piece of art''' or '''art object''' is an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Physical body|physical item]] or [[art]]istic creation. Apart from "work of art", which may be used of any work regarded as [[art]] in its widest sense, including works from [[literature]] and [[music]], these terms apply principally to tangible, portable forms of [[Visual arts|visual art]]: 
*An example of [[fine art]], such as a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]]
*An object that has been designed specifically for its aesthetic appeal, such as a piece of [[jewellery]]
*An object that has been designed for aesthetic appeal as well as functional purpose, as in [[interior design]] and much [[folk art]] 
*An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by [[Culture|cultural]] outsiders)
*A non-ephemeral [[photograph]], [[film]] or visual [[computer program]], such as a [[video game]] or [[computer animation]]
*A work of [[installation art]] or [[conceptual art]].
Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:
*A fine work of [[architecture]] or [[landscape design]]
*A production of live [[performance]], such as [[theater]], [[ballet]], [[opera]], [[performance art]], musical [[concert]] and other [[performing arts]], and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations.

This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as [[aural]]-[[music]] and written word-[[literature]] have similar issues and philosophies.  The term ''[[objet d'art]]'' is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical).  The term '''''oeuvre''''' is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre Oeuvre] Merriam Webster Dictionary, Accessed April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A ''work of art'' in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent [[aesthetic]] function.  A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger [[art movement]] or artistic [[era]], such as: a [[genre]], aesthetic [[convention (norm)|convention]], [[culture]], or regional-national distinction.&lt;ref name=gell1998/&gt; It can also be seen as an item within an artist's "body of work" or ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]''. The term is commonly used by: [[museum]] and [[cultural heritage management|cultural heritage]] [[curator]]s, the interested public, the [[patronage|art patron]]-private [[art collector]] community, and [[art gallery|art galleries]].&lt;ref name=macdonald2006/&gt;

Physical objects that document immaterial or [[conceptual art]] works, but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some [[Dada]] and [[Neo-Dada]] conceptual and [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] works have received later inclusion. Also, some [[architectural rendering]]s and [[architectural model|model]]s of unbuilt projects, such as by [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[Frank Gehry]], are other examples.

The products of [[environmental design]], depending on intention and execution, can be "works of art" and include: [[land art]], [[site-specific art]], [[architecture]], [[garden]]s, [[landscape architecture]], [[installation art]], [[rock art]], and [[megalith|megalithic monuments]].

Legal definitions of "work of art" are used in [[copyright]] law; ''see {{slink|Visual arts|United States of America copyright definition of visual art}}''.

==Theories==
[[Marcel Duchamp]] critiqued the idea that the work of art should be a unique product of an artist's labour, representational of their technical skill or artistic caprice.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.) 1997, ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Michael Craig-Martin]], creator of ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', said of his work – ''"It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual [[oak|oak tree]] is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/theres-no-need-to-be-afraid-of-the-present-625001.html "There's No Need to be Afraid of the Present"], ''The Independent'', 25 Jun 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|upright|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at his [[291 (art gallery)|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit.]]
Some [[Art criticism|art theorist]]s and writers have long made a distinction between the [[physical art|physical qualities of an art object]] and its identity-status as an artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804100009/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a painting by [[Rembrandt]] has a physical existence as an "oil painting on canvas" that is separate from its identity as a [[masterpiece]] "work of art" or the artist's ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rembrandtresearchproject.org/|title=Rembrandt Research Project - Home|work=rembrandtresearchproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many works of art are initially denied "museum quality" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the [[Impressionists]] and non-representational [[abstract art]]ists are examples. Some, such as the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|"Readymades" of Marcel Duchamp]] including his infamous urinal ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', are later reproduced as museum quality replicas.

There is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between "[[fine art]]" objects made by "[[artist]]s"; and  [[folk art]], [[handicraft|craft-work]], or "[[Applied arts|applied art]]" objects made by "first, second, or third-world" [[designer]]s, [[artisan]]s and [[Artisan|craftspeople]]. Contemporary and archeological [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous art]], [[industrial design]] items in limited or [[mass production]], and places created by [[environmental design]]ers and [[cultural landscape]]s, are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition.
