'''Abdul Majeed Merza''' was a Ceylonese Muslim businessman and politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.lk/members-of-parliament/directory-of-past-members/viewMember/2469|title=Hon.

Merza ran as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] at the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1952|2nd parliamentary election]], held between 24 May 1952 and 30 May 1952, in the [[Kalmunai Electoral District|Kalmunai electorate]]. He won the seat, polling 6,078 votes (43% of the total vote), defeating the sitting [[United National Party]] member, [[M. S. Kariapper]] by 3,908 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slelections.gov.lk/web/images/pdf/general-election-results/general-election-1952.pdf |title=Result of Parliamentary General Election 1952 |publisher=Department of Elections, Sri Lanka |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ceylon Historical Journal|volume=2|author=Tisara Prakasakayo|date=1952|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merza didn't contest his seat at the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1956|1956 parliamentary election]] and was appointed to the board of the [[Valaichchenai Paper Mill|Valaichchenai Paper Corporation]], where he subsequently became the corporation's chairman for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parliamentary Debates: Official Report|volume=85|publisher=Ceylon Government Press|author=[[Parliament of Ceylon]]|date=1969|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ASML''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company and currently the largest supplier in the world of [[photolithography]] systems for the [[semiconductor]] industry.  The company manufactures machines for the production of [[integrated circuits]]. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/equities/indices/euro+stoxx+50+EU0009658145/constituents Frankfurt Stock Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
[[File:ASML headquarters Veldhoven.jpg|left|thumb|200px|ASML’s corporate headquarters in [[Veldhoven]]]]

The [[photolithography]] machines manufactured by ASML are used in the production of computer chips. In these machines, patterns are optically imaged onto a silicon [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] that is covered with a film of light-sensitive material ([[photoresist]]). This procedure is repeated dozens of times on a single wafer. The photoresist is then further processed to create the actual electronic circuits on the silicon. The optical imaging that ASML's machines deal with is used in the fabrication of nearly all integrated circuits, and as of 2010, ASML has 67 percent of the worldwide sales of lithography machines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?ctx=40715&amp;rid=40723 ASML: Sustainability - performance and targets]. ASML.com (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; with the competition consisting of [[Ultratech]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]] and [[Nikon]].

===Immersion lithography===
As of 2011, their high-end Twinscan NXT:1950i system is used for producing features down to 32 [[nanometre]]s (and outlook for 22&amp;nbsp;nm) at up to 200 wafers per hour,&lt;ref name="pr2011-07-12"&gt;[http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?lang=EN&amp;ctx=5869&amp;rid=44387 ASML Enhances NXT:1950i to Meet Challenging Imaging and Overlay Requirements and Provide a Cost Effective Platform for 22nm]. Press release, 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; using a water [[immersion lens]] and an [[argon fluoride laser]] that produces light at a wavelength of 193&amp;nbsp;nm.  As of 2011, an average lithography machine costs 27 million euros.&lt;ref name="pr2011-Q3"&gt;[http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?lang=EN&amp;ctx=5869&amp;rid=44696 Third quarter 2011 results]. ASML press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EUV lithography===
ASML manufactures [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]] machines that produce 13.5&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength light. A high-energy laser is focused on microscopic droplets of molten tin to produce a plasma, which emits EUV light. In 2009, the [[IMEC]] research center in Belgium produced the world’s first functional 22&amp;nbsp;nm [[CMOS]] [[Static random access memory|SRAM]] memory cells with a prototype EUV lithography machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.imec.be/be_en/press/imec-news/archive-2009/imec-22nm-sram-cells-with-euv.html IMEC presents functional 22 nm SRAM cells fabricated using EUV technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601181534/http://www2.imec.be/be_en/press/imec-news/archive-2009/imec-22nm-sram-cells-with-euv.html |date=1 June 2010 }}. IMEC press release, 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Series-produced (non-prototype) EUV machines were shipped in 2011.&lt;ref name="pr2011-Q3"/&gt;

===Other===
In addition to immersion-based lithography and EUV lithography, ASML has a substantial [[intellectual property]] portfolio covering [[Nanoimprint lithography|imprint lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, U. S. Patents 7618250, 7692771 and U. S. Patent Applications 20070018360, 20100193994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company==
ASML’s corporate headquarters is in [[Veldhoven]], [[Netherlands]]. It is also the location for research, development, manufacturing and assembly. ASML has a worldwide customer base and over sixty service points in sixteen countries. The company is listed on both the [[AEX index|AEX]] and [[NASDAQ]] Stock Exchanges, as ASML.

The company (originally named ASM Lithography)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ASML: Questions and Answers|url=http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?ctx=32894#33198|publisher=ASML Holding|accessdate=3 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100728054310/http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?ctx=32894| archivedate= 28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between the Dutch companies [[ASM International (company)|Advanced Semiconductor Materials International]] (ASMI) and [[Philips]]. Nowadays it is a public company with only a minority of the shares owned by Philips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?ctx=33254&amp;year=2006-present ASML corporate history]&lt;/ref&gt; When the company became independent in 1988, it was decided that changing the name was not desirable, and the abbreviation ASML became the official company name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?ctx=32894#_15|title = ASML: About ASML|date = 2014-02-20|accessdate = 2014-11-30|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, ASML acquired the Silicon Valley Group (SVG), a US lithography equipment manufacturer, in a bid to supply 193&amp;nbsp;nm scanners to [[Intel Corp]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1182430&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1181104&lt;/ref&gt;

ASML is subject to [[cyclical industrial dynamics]]. For example, at the end of 2008, ASML experienced a large drop in sales, which led management to cut the workforce by about 1000 worldwide—mostly contract workers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?ctx=5869&amp;rid=37022 ASML Takes Action to Adjust Its Organization Due to Severe Order Slowdown] Press release.&lt;/ref&gt;—and to apply for support from the Dutch national unemployment fund to prevent even larger layoffs .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122959783756317881 Chip-Equipment Firm ASML Cuts Outlook, Sets Layoffs]. WSJ.com,  19 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Two and a half years later, ASML expected a record-high revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703730104576260091610455466 ASML Sees Record Year]. Wall Street Journal, April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, [[Intel]] announced a deal to invest $4.1 billion into ASML in exchange for 15% ownership, in order to speed up the transition from 300&amp;nbsp;mm to  [[Wafer (electronics)#Standard wafer sizes|450 mm wafers]] and further development of EUV lithography.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/10/intel-asml-idUSL2E8I9DTL20120710 ASML wins funds for chip technology from Intel].

ASML Press release, 9 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This deal is without exclusive rights to future ASML products and, as of July 2012, ASML is offering another 10% of the shares to other companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/09/us-intel-asml-idUSBRE86819B20120709 |title=Intel funds next-gen chipmaking, buys into ASML for $4.1 billion |date=9 July 2012 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of their EUV strategy, ASML announced the acquisition of DUV and EUV sources manufacturer [[Cymer, Inc.|Cymer]] in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asml.com/asml/show.do?ctx=5869&amp;rid=47397] ASML Press release, 17 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ASML paused development of 450-mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.&lt;ref name='ASML 2013 Annual report'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/937966/000119312514046822/d546896d20f.htm |title=ASML 2013 Annual Report Form (20-F) |publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission |format=XBRL |date=11 February 2014 |quote=In November 2013, following our customers’ decision, ASML decided to pause the development of 450mm lithography systems until customer demand and the timing related to such demand is clear. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, ASML announced their plans to acquire Taiwan-based Hermes Microvision Inc. for about $3.1 billion to add technology for creating smaller and more advanced [[semiconductors]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian King, Bloomberg. “[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-15/asml-to-buy-taiwan-s-hermes-microvision-for-3-1-billion ASML to Acquire Taiwan’s Hermes Microvision for $3.1 Billion].” June 15, 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14959">The '''aging workforce,''' controversially referred to as '''[[The Silver Tsunami]]''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; refers to the rise in the median age of the United States workforce to levels unseen since the passage of the [[Social Security Act of 1935]]. It is projected that by the year 2020, about 25% of the U.S. workforce will be composed of older workers (ages 55 and over).&lt;ref name ="chosewood"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Chosewood, L. Casey |url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/agingworkforce/|title=CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - Safer and Healthier at Any Age: Strategies for an Aging Workforce|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |date=July 19, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many factors contribute to the aging workforce, the [[Post-World War II baby boom]] created an unusually large birth [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] for the [[Demographics of the United States|U.S. population]], resulting in a large aging population today. This phenomenon has many short-term and long-term implications, affecting many areas, including the [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]], [[Society of the United States|society]] and [[public health]].

==Baby boom==
[[Image:US Birth Rates.svg|thumb|350px|right|United States birth rate (births per 1000 population). The red segment from 1946 to 1964 is the postwar baby boom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] Bottom of this page https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus.htm "Vital Statistics of the United States, 2003, Volume I, Natality", Table 1-1 "Live births, birth rates, and fertility rates, by race: United States, 1909–2003."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Starting in the years following [[World War II]], from 1946 to 1964, about 76 million people were born in the United States, creating a large birth cohort known as the [[Baby boomers]].&lt;ref name ="silverstein"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Silverstein, Michael|title=Meeting the challenges of an aging workforce |journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine |volume=51|pages=269–280|year=2008|pmid=18271000 |doi=10.1002/ajim.20569 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="toossi"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Toossi, Mitra|title=A new look at long-term labor force projections to 2050 |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=129 |issue=11 |pages=19–39 |date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that the unemployment rate of the Baby Boomers rose to 5.9 percent in February as a result of retirements among the Baby Boomers as reported by the State Labor Department of Buffalo Niagara.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/03/28/local-jobless-rate-rises-5-9-percent-february/|title=Local jobless rate rises to 5.9 percent in February|last=Robinson|first=David|date=2017-03-28|website=The Buffalo News|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in joblessness remained below 6 percent in February for the third time in the last 15 years which can be explained as the wave of Baby Boomers retired from the workforce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2008, the unemployment rate began to drop as low as the rates seen in the last recession in Buffalo Niagara.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In January 2013, the unemployment rate increased to 9.3 percent and has been declining after that.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can be a reason for the fewer local workers that were employed in Buffalo Niagara.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], as of April 2014, the [[workforce|labor force participation rate]] was 62.8%.&lt;ref name="bls2012"&gt;{{Cite web|author=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000/|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics Data|date=July 26, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall labor force participation rate is expected to decline for the remainder of the decade, projected to fall to 62.5% in 2020.&lt;ref name ="toossi2"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Toossi, Mitra|title=Labor force projections to 2020: a more slowly growing workforce|journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=43–64 |date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 2020, the subpopulation of older adults in the United States is expected to reach 97.8 million people, comprising 28.7% percent of the entire U.S. population, a rise from the 24.7% in 2010.&lt;ref name ="toossi2"/&gt; This increase in proportion of older adults can be attributed to the entire Baby Boomer cohort joining the older adult population (ages 55+) by 2020.

It is projected that by 2020, the proportion of the U.S. labor force that is composed of older adults will be 25.2%.&lt;ref name ="chosewood"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="toossi2"/&gt; This continues a trend in increasing rates of older adults remaining in the workforce, as the rates were 13.1% in 2000 and 19.5% in 2010.&lt;ref name ="toossi2"/&gt; A complementary trend that follows this is the increasing median age of the U.S. workforce. By 2020, the workforce is expected to have a median age of 42.8, which will be an increase from 39.3 in 2000 and 41.7 in 2010.&lt;ref name ="blsmedian"&gt;{{Cite web|author=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_306.htm|title=Median age of the labor force, by sex, race and ethnicity|date=February 1, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further factor contributing to an aging workforce is the fact that employment rates among older workers are increasing. The rate of people who continue working after they are 65 is relatively high in the US, when compared to other developed countries. For example, in 2011, 16.7% among people aged 65 and over and 29.9% among 65–69 were employed in the US.

==Impacts==
With continuing trends of an aging American workforce and a declining labor force participation rate, there may be many consequences arising from this phenomenon. The impending repercussions from a large aging workforce entering retirement has led some to call this situation "[[The Silver Tsunami]]",&lt;ref name="uab"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bob Shepard, The University of Alabama at Birmingham |url=http://main.uab.edu/Sites/MediaRelations/articles/82818/ |title=Beware the "silver tsunami" - the boomers turn 65 in 2011 |publisher=The University of Alabama at Birmingham |date=December 30, 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026115354/http://main.uab.edu/Sites/MediaRelations/articles/82818/ |archivedate=October 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="economist"&gt;{{Cite web|author=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15450864|title=Schumpeter: The silver tsunami|publisher=The Economist |date=February 4, 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alliance"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Alliance for Aging Research |url=http://www.agingresearch.org/content/article/detail/826/ |title=Alliance for Aging Research: Publications: Preparing for the Silver Tsunami |publisher=Alliance for Aging Research |date=Summer 2006 |accessdate=2012-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807104937/http://www.agingresearch.org/content/article/detail/826/ |archivedate=2012-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this metaphorical phrase has been controversial due to its [[Ageism|ageist]] connotations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Barusch|first = Amanda|date = 2013|title = The Aging Tsunami: Time for a New Metaphor?|url =|journal = Journal of Gerontological Social Work 56: 181–4.|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
Due to a declining labor participation rate, there is expected to be a shortage of workers in the U.S. workforce. Projections show that the demand for labor needed now is not being fulfilled, and the gap between labor needed and labor available will continue to expand over the future.&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Howard | first1 = John| contribution = The Future Workforce and Applied Ergonomics| title = 14th Annual Applied Ergonomics conference &amp; Expo| place = Orlando, Florida| date = March 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schill"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Schill | first1 = Anita L.| title = The Future of Work &amp; the Aging Workforce| series = Electricity Safety Summit| place = Washington, District of Columbia| date = May 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the differences in population size between the Baby Boomers and the following younger generations, there has been negative growth in the working age population.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schill"/&gt; The retirement of members of the aging workforce could also possibly result in shortages of skilled labor.&lt;ref name="chosewood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt; A majority of experienced utility workers and hospital caregivers, for example, will be eligible for retirement.&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt;

===Social security benefits===
The [[Social Security (United States)|U.S. federal social security system]] functions through the taxation of large numbers of young workers, in order to support smaller numbers of older dependents.&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt; A diminishing workforce, coupled with growing numbers of longer-living elderly can deplete the social security system. The Social Security Administration estimates that the old age [[dependency ratio]] (people ages 65+ divided by people ages 20–64) in 2080 will be over 40%, compared to the 20% old age dependency ratio in 2005.&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt; Increasing life expectancies of the older population will not only result in decreases in Social Security Benefits, but also devalues private and public pension programs.&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="schwatka"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Schwatka | first1 = Natalie V.| last2 = Butler | first2 = Lesley M. | last3 = Rosecrance | first3 = John R.| title = An aging workforce and injury in the construction industry | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 34| pages = 156–167|year=2012|pmid=22173940 | doi=10.1093/epirev/mxr020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of funds supplying programs such as social security and Medicare may be a contributing factor for adults to delay retirement and to continue working.&lt;ref name ="caban-martinez"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Caban-Martinez | first1 = Alberto J.| last2 = Lee | first2 = David J. | last3 = Fleming | first3 = Lora E.| last4 = Tancredi | first4 = Daniel J. | last5 = Arheart | first5 = Kristopher L. | last6 = LeBlanc | first6 = William G. | last7 = McCollister | first7 = Kathryn E. | last8 = Christ | first8 = Sharon L. | last9 = Louie | first9 = Grant H. | last10 = Muennig | first10 = Peter A. |title = Arthritis, occupational class, and the aging US workforce | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 101| issue = 9 | pages = 1729–1734|year=2011|pmid=21778483 | doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational safety and health===
Because of the many older adults opting to remain in the U.S. workforce, many studies have been done to investigate whether the older workers are at greater risk of occupational injury than their younger counterparts. Due to the physical declines associated with [[ageing|aging]], older adults tend to exhibit losses in eyesight, hearing and physical strength.&lt;ref name ="silverstein"/&gt; Data shows that older adults have low overall injury rates compared to all age groups, but are more likely to suffer from fatal and more severe occupational injuries.&lt;ref name ="silverstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="grosch"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Grosch | first1 = James W.| last2 = Pransky | first2 = Glenn S.| chapter = Safety and Health Issues for an Aging Workforce | title = Aging and Work: Issues and Implications in a Changing Landscape | editor1-last = Czaja | editor1-first = Sara J | editor2-last = Sharit | editor2-first = Joseph | place = Baltimore, Maryland | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all fatal occupational injuries in 2005, older workers accounted for 26.4%, despite only comprising 16.4% of the workforce at the time.&lt;ref name="grosch"/&gt; Age increases in fatality rates in occupational injury are more pronounced for workers over the age of 65.&lt;ref name="grosch"/&gt; The return to work for older workers is also extended; older workers experience a greater median number of lost work days and longer recovery times than younger workers.&lt;ref name="grosch"/&gt; Some common occupational injuries and illnesses for older workers include [[arthritis]]&lt;ref name="caban-martinez"/&gt; and [[bone fracture|fractures]].&lt;ref name ="mmwr"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses among older workers - United States, 2009 | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 60| issue=16|pages = 503–508|year=2011|pmid=21527887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among older workers, hip fractures are a large concern, given the severity of these injuries.&lt;ref name ="mmwr"/&gt;

===Health care===
With larger numbers of older adults, there will be an increased need for [[geriatrics|geriatric care]]. Older adults will have to deal with more chronic diseases; older adults who have worked in the construction industry have shown high rates of chronic diseases.&lt;ref name="schwatka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dong"&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Dong|first1 = Xiuwen S.|last2 = Wang|first2 = Xuanwen|last3 = Daw|first3 = Christina|last4 = Ringen|first4 = Knut|title = Chronic disease and functional limitations among older construction workers in the United States: a 10-year follow-up study|journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume = 53|issue = 4|pages = 372–380|year = 2011|pmid = 21407096|doi = 10.1097/jom.0b013e3182122286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts suggest that the number of geriatricians will have to triple to meet the demands of the rising elderly.&lt;ref name="uab"/&gt; There is expected be a similarly increased demand in other [[health care provider|healthcare professionals]], such as nurses, [[Occupational therapist|occupational therapists]], physical therapists and dentists.&lt;ref name="uab"/&gt; In addition, there is expected to be an increasing demand over common geriatric care consumption needs, such as [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]], [[joint replacement]]s and [[coronary artery bypass surgery|cardiovascular operations]].&lt;ref name="uab"/&gt;

===Society===
Population aging can potentially change American society as a whole. Many companies use an antiquated system, in which older, tenured workers get raises and benefits over time, eventually hitting retirement.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; With larger numbers of older workers in the workforce, this model is possibly unsustainable. In addition, perceptions of older adults in society will change, as the elderly are living longer lives and more active than before. Some state that society faces a cultural [[ageism]] in the perceptions about older adults, which will change over time.&lt;ref name="uab"/&gt;

'''''Airline Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]] by Thomas Holz and Robert Kleinert, in which the player must successfully manage an airline. The original was developed by [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]], and published by [[Infogrames]], however, the succeeding versions were published by a variety of publishers. The original ''Airline Tycoon'' was created for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], however, the later ''Deluxe'' version was also [[porting|ported]] to [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[MorphOS]], [[Magnussoft ZETA|ZETA]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. In this game, like all Tycoon computer games, the objective is to become a tycoon, and in this case, an “Airline Tycoon.” This is achieved through the balance of income and expenditures.

== Gameplay==
A simulation computer game where the player acts as manager of an airline, competing against three other tycoons. The names of the four tycoons are: Tina Cortez (Sunshine Airways), Siggi Sorglos (Falcon Lines), Igor Tuppolevsky (Phoenix Travel) and Mario Zucchero (Honey Airlines). The player must keep their aircraft in good shape and equip them at such a level as to keep the customers satisfied, buy new planes (from the expensive Airplane Agency or from Mr Schlauberger at the museum who sells old planes at a much lower cost) and take out bank loans if required.
The player must also manage their personnel, plan flights, buy fuel, attend meetings in the airport manager's office and, if there is the time, slip into Rick's café for a quick cup of coffee. The player can also perform sabotages on the other players. The graphics are bright and decidedly tongue in cheek: the tycoon Igor Tuppolevsky has a set of Russian dolls on his desk—and an open tin of caviar, while Tina Cortez has a picture of a matador and a bull's head.

With a network, up to four people can play at once and the game status can be saved (as it can in single-player mode) for longer games.

=== Releases ===
The original game was released in August 1998 in [[Germany]]. It was not released in any English-speaking country; however, there was an official English [[Game demo|demo]].&lt;br /&gt;
The first Airline Tycoon title to be released in [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] was ''Airline Tycoon First Class''. It was published in 2001 by [[Monte Cristo (company)|Monte Cristo]]; however, the publisher decided to remove ''First Class'' subtitle from the game box and [[Instruction manual (computer and video games)|manuals]], though it remained in-game. Features added in First Class include ten brand new missions, [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] mode with up to 4 players, new [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] music, [[cargo]] transportation and more.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2002, ''Airline Tycoon Evolution'', second Airline Tycoon re-release was published by [[Monte Cristo (company)|Monte Cristo]]. The game introduced ten new missions, possibility of buying self-designed aircraft (and possibility of sharing these planes via [[Internet]]), possibility of hiring aircraft security agents, five new [[sabotage]]s and more.

In 2003, [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] released a third Airline Tycoon addition, named ''Airline Tycoon Deluxe''. It included all of previous versions, the only new part of the game was twenty new airports and possibility of accepting cargo from remote estates. Originally it was released in [[special edition|limited edition]] of 5000 items. It was available only in [[Germany]], though it was not translated into other languages. However, Linux, Mac OS X and ZETA versions released in Autumn 2005 and Winter 2006 by [[RuneSoft]] are available in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rune-soft.com/Games/Released/Game-239/game=Airline_Tycoon_Deluxe-6 Airline_Tycoon_Deluxe] on rune-soft.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March, 2015 Airline Tycoon Deluxe was re-released on the [[digital distribution]] platform [[gog.com]], including the [[source code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/release_bairline_tycoon_deluxeb|title=Release: Airline Tycoon Deluxe |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-08-01 |quote=''Airline Tycoon Deluxe is a golden oldie with native versions for Mac OS X and Linux.

=== Successor Airline Tycoon 2 ===
{{Distinguish|Air Tycoon 2}}
On May 24, 2006 Spellbound announced it would be releasing a full sequel to Airline Tycoon, Airline Tycoon II due to be released in Germany sometime in the second half of 2007. The release date was, however, not met. Spellbound stated they could not find a publisher for the game and announced no new release date. On October 22, 2009 Airline Tycoon II was announced by [[Kalypso Media]] and scheduled to be released in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/airline-tycoon-ii-spellbound-s-plane-accumulating-sim-to-be-published-worldwide-by-kalypso|title=Airline Tycoon II Announced|date=October 22, 2009 |publisher=[[Games Industry]]|accessdate=2009-10-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091029140525/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/airline-tycoon-ii-spellbound-s-plane-accumulating-sim-to-be-published-worldwide-by-kalypso| archivedate= 29 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was scheduled to be released in the United States On October 2, 2011 by [[Amazon.com]], however, [[Kalypso Media]] scheduled their North American release for October 14, 2011. The Game as of date has been released and includes a demo version which the original lacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airline-tycoon2.com/us/index.php |title=Airline Tycoon II Official Website |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first extra content or expansion for the game was announced on March 29, 2012. '''''Honey Airlines DLC''''' finally became available on April 19 of the same year. It would feature a new character, new airline company, two additional campaign missions and a Cargo area for the airport. The second one, announced on May 31, 2012 called '''''Falcon Lines DLC''''' was eventually released on June 14 of that year. This DLC would add another character and airline company, another two additional campaign missions, the Last-Minute Counter as a new airport area and the ability to open branch offices anywhere throughout the world.

== Reception ==
Sales of ''Airline Tycoon'' surpassed 150,000 units worldwide by 2001.&lt;ref name=pczonepreview&gt;{{cite journal| title=This town ain't big enough... ''Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive'' | author=Pullin, Keith | journal=[[PC Zone]] | date=January 2001 | issue=98 | page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 an [[IGN]] review gave Airline Tycoon a good rating with 7.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/21/airline-tycoon IGN Airline Tycoon Reviewon PC] on [[IGN.com]] (20 Feb 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Airline Tycoon 2 received on [[Metacritic]] a mediocre score of 57/100 from four reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/airline-tycoon-2 airline-tycoon-2] on [[Metacritic]] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4905">'''AttentionTracking''' is an attention measurement procedure. In contrast to classical machine-based [[eye tracking]], during AttentionTracking the attention is measured with a [[mouse (computing)|computer mouse]] or a comparable [[pointing device]]. The attention data occurs in the form of mouse clicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodrich |first=Kendall |title= What's up? Exploring Upper and Lower Visual Field Advertising Effects |journal= [[Advertising Research Foundation|Journal of Advertising Research]] |volume=50 |date=January 2010 |page=91 |url=http://www.journalofadvertisingresearch.com/ArticleCenter/default.asp?ID=91412&amp;Type=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

The basic idea for AttentionTracking emerged during a research project at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S. Egner |author2=C. Scheier |title=Beobachten statt Fragen |journal=Planung &amp; Analyse |volume=1 |year=2005 |page=53 |url=http://www.mediaanalyzer.com/veroeffentlichungen/MediaAnalyzer-Artikel-P&amp;A-Beobachten-statt-Fragen-2005.pdf |access-date=2018-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309195814/http://www.mediaanalyzer.com/veroeffentlichungen/MediaAnalyzer-Artikel-P%26A-Beobachten-statt-Fragen-2005.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this project the correspondence of eye tracking and clicking data was found by accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S. Egner |author2=L. Itti |author3=C. R. Scheier |title= Comparing attention models with different types of behavior data |journal= Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (Proc. ARVO 2000) |volume=41 |issue=4| year=2000 |page=39|url= http://ilab.usc.edu/publications/Egner_etal00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general the procedure is based on the fact that [[attention]] does not only control the view but also other motoric systems. After a short introduction and training, respondents can follow their attention with the mouse.

In comparative studies with classical machine-based procedures significant [[correlations]] (r&gt;0.92) were found between the data gained with the machine-based procedure and the data gained with AttentionTracking.&lt;ref&gt;Scheier, Christian (2003a). Time- and Cost-Effetive Measurement of Consumer Attention. Research World, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement process ==

The measurement starts with a small training during which the respondent is gradually introduced and accustomed to the desired click behavior. The training ensures that only respondents with sufficient mouse competence and speed take part in the test – simply put, hand and [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] are synchronized. Directly after the training the actual measurement starts. The trained click behavior is then continued on the presented visual stimuli. In the same time [[point-and-click]] is recorded. The click data are interpreted as points of attention ([[Fixation (visual)]]) and can be analyzed and visualized analogously to the classical eye tracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodrich |first=Kendall |title= What's up? Exploring Upper and Lower Visual Field Advertising Effects |journal= [[Advertising Research Foundation|Journal of Advertising Research]] |volume=50 |date=January 2010 |page=97 |url=http://www.journalofadvertisingresearch.com/ArticleCenter/default.asp?ID=91412&amp;Type=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields of application ==

The AttentionTracking procedure can generally be used for all areas of application in which classical eye movement tracking can be used. The procedure is used in basic research as well as in applied research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C. Scheier |author2=K. Koschel |title= Your Customer’s Eyes |journal= Planung &amp; Analyse |volume=5 |year=2002 |page=43 |url= http://www.planung-analyse.de/services/printarchiv/pages/protected/show.php?id=345&amp;sortierid=1&amp;currPage=1&amp;timer=1264058463&amp;params=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 the procedure is commercially used in [[market research]] especially [[advertising research]] and [[marketing research]] to analyze the effect of [[advertising material]]. Through the online realization of the procedure the attention measurement can be included in target group-specific, supra-regional surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Scheier, Christian (2003b).

The '''Auckland central business district''' ('''CBD'''), also called the '''city centre''' by [[Auckland Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Auckland's city centre|url=http://temp.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/planspoliciesprojects/CouncilProjects/citycentretransformation/Pages/home.aspx|publisher=Auckland Council|accessdate=28 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the geographical and economic heart of the [[Auckland|Auckland metropolitan area]]. The area is made up of the city's largest concentration of skyscrapers and businesses.

The CBD is one of the most densely developed places in New Zealand, with many commercial and some residential developments packed into a space of only {{convert|433|hectare}}.&lt;ref name="teara" /&gt; Bounded by several major motorways and by the harbour coastline in the north, it is surrounded further out by mostly [[suburban]] areas.

==Geography==

Located on the northern shore of a narrow [[isthmus]], the CBD extends from the [[Auckland waterfront]] on the [[Waitematā Harbour]] southwards along [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] and a number of other parallel-running streets. The CBD is generally considered to be bounded by the main motorways that surround all non-harbour sides, with [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] forming the southern and western boundaries, and State Highway 16 / [[Grafton Gully]] forming the eastern boundary.&lt;ref name="GLANCE"/&gt;

The CBD has an area of {{convert|433|hectare}},&lt;ref name="teara" /&gt; similar to the [[Sydney central business district|Sydney CBD]], and twice as large as the CBDs of [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]].&lt;ref name="GLANCE"&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/glance.asp Auckland's CBD at a glance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624084513/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/glance.asp |date=24 June 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt; The CBD is to a substantial part located on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] of the Waitematā Harbour. For a closer discussion of this aspect, see the [[Commercial Bay]] and [[Auckland waterfront]] articles.

==History==
{{Expand section |talksection=Unreferenced section|date=June 2008|small=no}}
The town of Auckland was created in 1840 with the first European colonisation of the area, marked by an official ceremony on the now non-existent [[Point Britomart]]. The initial centre of the new town was focused on what is now the corner of Shortland and Queen Streets, which was at the shoreline of Commercial Bay. From approximately their junction, the main wharf ran north off the end of Queen Street, with Shortland Street leading up to Fort Britomart and Government House, around which many of the richer people built houses. Shortland Street tended to be the location of the more important businesses and most of the 'luxury' shops of the mid 19th century. The 1850s onwards saw an increasing number of businesses, and especially retail, locating further south along [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]], which still to this day forms the 'spine' of the area.

In 1841, one year after the European founding, the census counted approximately 2,000 people, with "mechanics" the largest group at 250, and other groups of note being 150 agricultural labourers, 100 shopkeepers, 100 domestic servants, and 125 "upper class members".&lt;ref name=PROPCENTRAL&gt;{{cite news|title=Auckland Central |newspaper=Property Report - insert to [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=5 September 2011|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the remainder of the 19th century, Commercial Bay was progressively filled in, allowing a northward extension of Queen Street and the creation of Fort Street, Customs Street, and Quay Street. The part of Queen Street north of Customs Street is today referred to informally as Lower Queen Street.

As well as being the location of a great many multi-storey warehouses, initially the Lower Queen Street area also contained many manufacturing businesses, though many of these started to move to other areas such as Freeman's Bay, Newton and Parnell, especially if they took up a lot of room (such as timber yards) or created noise or pollution (such as brick yards or foundries). Up until the middle of the 20th century the centre of town still contained a large number of small factories including clothing manufacturers.

The relocation of industries to outlying suburbs became especially pronounced in the 1950s, partly due to incentives made by council planners to create industrial areas in Penrose and Rosebank Road (amongst others) and thus rid the inner city area of noise, pollution and heavy traffic. This was mirrored by the development of suburban shopping malls (the first being [[LynnMall]] in 1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/9294196/Fifty-years-of-the-shopping-mall|accessdate=24 July 2016|title=Fifty years of the shopping mall|date=20 October 2013|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enticed retailers to vacate the inner city as well. Attempts by the council to halt this pattern by constructing numerous public car parking buildings met with varying success. The rise of suburban supermarket and mall shopping that was created in places such as Pakuranga from 1965 onwards has been added to by the appearance of [[Big Box]] retailers in places such as Botany and the North Shore.&lt;ref name="NZHA75"&gt;''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' - McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor). David Bateman, 1997. Plate 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential numbers in the inner city (including the inner suburbs) were also declining in the 20th century from as early as the 1920s. In the two-mile zone surrounding the CBD, there were approximately 70,000 people in 1926, with only around 50,000 in 1966 - a change made even more marked by the development of the remainder of Auckland's population, which grew more than fourfold in the same timeframe.&lt;ref name="NZHA75"/&gt; In the 1990s, only a token population of around 1,400 was still residing within the CBD, though this was to grow substantially with a boom of new apartment buildings around the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;See 'Population' section in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 24,000 apartment units exist as of 2010.&lt;ref name="UPDATE"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Aerial view of Auckland.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of the CBD.]]

===Overview===

The CBD of Auckland has been the leading centre of New Zealand's business and economic development for nearly two centuries. The area of today's CBD was the site of the original European settlement of Auckland, oriented along the coastline and then Queen Street, in a southward direction. From those origins, it has grown progressively, and become much more densely built-up, now being an area of high-rise buildings mainly used for commercial and retail uses. It has the highest concentration of arts, culture and higher education institutions and venues in the country.&lt;ref name="ABOUT"/&gt;

Some commentators have noted that the recent decades have not been kind to the aesthetics and the community values of the inner city. The demolishing of many older buildings, often the prerequisite for low-quality or uninspired new office and residential developments, is considered by them to be due to a combination of developers uninterested in long-term outcomes and Council planning direction being too weak.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/466/story.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10437437 Michael Stevens: Leaders stand by as city is desecrated]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Thursday, 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to reverse the decline of aesthetics in the CBD, previous Auckland City Councils and the current unitary [[Auckland Council]] have instigated several urban regeneration schemes. These include the recent redevelopment of [[Aotea Square]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/aoteasquare/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515125213/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/aoteasquare/default.asp |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the upgrade of Saint Patrick's Square in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/stpatrickssquare.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301105138/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/stpatrickssquare.asp |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The area east of the [[Britomart Transport Centre]] is currently undergoing major changes, with the development of new commercial buildings, development of public spaces and restoration of several heritage buildings. Another major regeneration scheme currently underway is the redevelopment of [[Wynyard Quarter]], which involves replacing industrial facilities covering a large portion of the CBD waterfront with residential or commercial buildings and public spaces.

The Auckland CBD is one of the few places in New Zealand that has skyscraper-sized buildings, such as the [[Vero Centre]], [[ANZ Centre, Auckland|ANZ Centre]] or the [[Metropolis (Auckland building)|Metropolis]], with the [[Sky Tower (Auckland)|Sky Tower]] rising above them.

[[File:Khartoum Place1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Khartoum Place]], a pedestrian square in the central CBD]]

===Population===

Residential high-density buildings constructed within the last decade have helped to increase the population living in the CBD to around 40,000 (2010 estimate) from earlier 16,000 (2004 estimate), all being growth from only 1,400 in 1991.&lt;ref name="UPDATE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GLANCE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABOUT"&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/aboutcbd.asp About the CBD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807050153/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/aboutcbd.asp |date=7 August 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this growth has been driven by [[immigration to New Zealand]], particularly from Asia, and the CBD is the area in New Zealand with the highest percentage share (32%) of the Asian ethnic group in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/research.asp#peste Auckland City CBD PESTE analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001240/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/research.asp#peste |date=28 September 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt; Also striking is the high number of students (both tertiary education and overseas students studying English in one of the many institutes), making up 27% of all residents (2001 Census) and contributing to the relative youth of the city residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/residents.asp Residents of Auckland's CBD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624231937/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/residents.asp |date=24 June 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing population, available services have also changed - from only about one [[superette]] in the early 2000s, this has ballooned to one supermarket and 38 superettes by 2011. In early 2012, two major supermarket chains opened a branch in the city centre, with Countdown opening on Victoria Street in January and New World opening a branch on Queen Street in early March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10777892|title=Biggest new supermarket opens in Auckland CBD|work=The New Zealand Herald|first=Anne|last=Gibson|date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the population remains highly focused on ethnically diverse, mostly young and childless residents.&lt;ref name=PROPCENTRAL/&gt;

According to an in-depth study of security perception in the Auckland CBD undertaken in 2005, most visitors and locals feel safe visiting and living in the CBD. Police and the Council have in part ascribed these positive feelings to over a dozen safety initiatives undertaken by authorities (from alcohol bans in parts of the CBD to [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] surveillance and street lighting measures). However, in spite of the general perception of the CBD being safe, there was a feeling that crime had risen somewhat in the last five years (whereas in fact numbers had declined). This was considered to be mostly due to a media-driven public image.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release.html?id=2129 Most feel Auckland CBD safe, survey shows] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009221738/http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release.html?id=2129 |date=9 October 2008 }}'' (from a [[New Zealand Police]] press release, Tuesday 4 October 2006.

Many of these buildings saw strong criticism - and sometimes lack of tenant interest - due to perceived problems with building quality, lack of urban design and too-small unit sizes (with a bylaw banning very small units coming in only in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tenants shun CBD’s shoebox apartments|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10352969|accessdate=18 June 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]1|date=1 November 2005|first=Anne|last=Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
[[File:Auckland waterfront at night.jpg|thumb|right|308px|The CBD economy is dominated by [[Ports of Auckland]] and by business and financial support services.]]&lt;!-- this image is fixed to the infobox width --&gt;

===Economy===

With 8,500 businesses, the CBD accounts for 18% of all businesses in Auckland City, with the largest being [[Ports of Auckland]], and the largest employment sectors being financial services, business and [[Information communication technology|ICT]] services. The CBD is also the largest employment centre in New Zealand, with around 65,000 jobs, representing 13% of the regional workforce, and 25% of the Auckland City workforce. Around 73,000 people enter the CBD every morning between 7 am and 9 am, 60% of these by car,&lt;ref name="GLANCE"/&gt; while the total 'turnover' is around 270,000 people per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/dayinlife.asp A day in the life of Auckland's CBD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624230648/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/dayinlife.asp |date=24 June 2007 }} (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]]. Accessed 2008-02-18.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 many large corporations were housed in the Auckland CBD. During the same year, an Auckland City report stated that the Auckland CBD, compared to several [[central business district]]s in Australia, had "a broader and more dominant role in its regional economy" compared to the economies of the Australian central business districts.&lt;ref name="AucklandCityReport2003"&gt;"[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/docs/theeconomyofcbd%20.pdf The Economy of Auckland’s Central Business District] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222053333/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/docs/theeconomyofcbd%20.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }}." City of Auckland. September 2003. Executive Summary (5/77). Retrieved on 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBD remains attractive to shops, partially due to the very high pedestrian numbers on the main shopping streets like Queen Street, where footfalls are estimated to be up to 10 times as high as on Broadway in [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]], seen as Queen Street's closest rival.&lt;ref name=PROPCENTRAL/&gt;

Auckland CBD has a higher share of employment in large firms than other areas in Auckland. Over half of the large firms in Auckland CBD are in office-based sectors (such as property and business services and finance and insurance) and are in the Downtown and Waterfront areas of the CBD. In 2004 Auckland CBD had 72,540 employees and 9125 businesses. 2006 Auckland CBD had 78,444 employees and 9,461 businesses.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/economy.asp CBD facts and figures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423024155/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/economy.asp |date=23 April 2009 }}."

===Education===

There are significant educational institutions located in the Auckland CBD, notably the [[University of Auckland]] and the [[Auckland University of Technology]]. The CBD also has many of the English language schools for foreigners which form a significant part of Auckland's education business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/4c2567ef00247c6a4c2567be0008d2f8/4c2567ef00247c6acc2571b900127ca3?OpenDocument Survey of English Language Providers - Year ended March 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234407/http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/4c2567ef00247c6a4c2567be0008d2f8/4c2567ef00247c6acc2571b900127ca3?OpenDocument |date=27 September 2007 }} (from [[Statistics New Zealand]].

== Transport ==
[[File:Auckland Ferry Terminal from Harbour.jpg|thumb|250px|The Ferry Building from the harbour]]
The CBD, with its substantial employment, and increasing number of residents, contains the main public transport hubs of the city. These services are concentrated around the [[Britomart Transport Centre]] (rail and buses) and the nearby [[Auckland Ferry Terminal]], both near the [[Auckland waterfront]]. Many bus services travel the length of the CBD along the main streets, in particular via the bus lanes on Albert Street and the [[Central Connector, Auckland|Central Connector]] [[bus priority]] route. In 2010, around 33,000 people entered the CBD via public transport every day.&lt;ref name="CITYSCENEAUG2010"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report looks into the state of our city |newspaper=CityScene|date=29 August 2010 |publisher=Auckland City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, much of the transport to and around the CBD post-1950s was by private vehicles, partly because the CBD provides numerous parking buildings&lt;ref name="NZHA75"/&gt; and parking spaces associated with office buildings, and is almost totally surrounded (and easily accessible) by motorways.

[[Auckland Council]] has begun the construction phase of the [[City Rail Link]]. Once completed, it will connect the [[Britomart Transport Centre|Britomart]] transport hub more directly to the [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] in the vicinity of [[Mount Eden Train Station]] by way of a tunnel running under the CBD. Two new stations will be constructed, one at [[Aotea Square]] and one on [[Karangahape Road]], and the existing stations at each end of the link, Britomart and Mount Eden, will receive substantial upgrades.

The main street of the CBD is [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]], which was upgraded between 2006 and 2008 to modernise it and make it more pedestrian friendly. 
In 2009, the former Auckland City Council proposed the redevelopment of several CBD streets into [[shared space]]s, with the goal of improving pedestrian and cyclist amenity by slowing down vehicle traffic while retaining the possibility for car access - compared to a [[pedestrian mall]] which allows no motor vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/auckland-new-copenhagen-102761 Auckland: the new Copenhagen?]". ''[[National Business Review]]''. 25 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Auckland Council is continuing this project. Darby Street, Lorne Street, Fort Street, Jean Batten Place, and Fort Lane have been converted into shared spaces since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/en/planspoliciesprojects/councilprojects/sharedspaces/Pages/home.aspx |accessdate=24 July 2016|title=Council projects |publisher=Auckland Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portion of Federal Street between Wellesley Street West and Victoria Street West has also been made shared space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/263877/auckland%27s-side-streets-too-%27car-centric%27|accessdate=28 July 2017|title=Auckland's side streets too 'car-centric'|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For food sold by weight in stores, see [[bulk bins]].''

A '''bulk sale''', sometimes called a '''bulk transfer''', is when a [[business]] sells all or nearly all of its [[inventory]] to a single buyer and such a sale is not part of the [[ordinary course of business]]. This type of action is often used in an attempt to dodge [[creditors]] who intend to seize such business's inventory; in order to protect the purchaser from claims made by [[creditors]] of the seller, the seller must usually complete an [[affidavit]] outlining its secured and unsecured creditors, which must usually be filed with a government department, such as a court office. Such procedures are outlined in the '''bulk sales act''' of most jurisdictions. If the buyer does not complete the registration process for a bulk sale, creditors of the seller may obtain a declaration that the sale was invalid against the creditors and the creditors may take possession of the goods or obtain judgment for any proceeds the buyer received from a subsequent sale.
==History==
Bulk sales legislation came into place to prevent the fraudulent practice of selling the entire inventory of a farm or a store in order to defeat the claims of creditors who would otherwise be able to seize the goods to satisfy a [[debt]].  Under traditional [[fraudulent conveyance]] law, such a sale was not void against creditors unless it was made in [[bad faith]] for insufficient [[consideration]].  However, a bulk sale would generally allow a storekeeper to abscond with money while leaving creditors unpaid.  However, because such a transaction was generally at [[arm's length]], was for appropriate consideration, and may have been made in [[good faith]], it was generally binding on creditors until bulk sales statutes were passed.  Bulk sales legislation, such as Article Six of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] was designed to eliminate this type of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/6/ Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the [[ordinary course of business]], a [[car dealer]] would sell a number of cars in one day.  In extraordinary circumstances, it might sell its entire inventory to different buyers within a short period of time.  However, if it attempted to sell all its cars to a single buyer, this would be considered a bulk sale, as it is not something an auto dealer would generally do in the normal course of business.

However, not all sales in bulk are outside of the ordinary course of business. For example, [[farmers]] often have agreed well in advance of [[harvesting]] their crop to sell it to a single buyer. This is a normal part of farming practice. However, a dairy farmer, although he might sell his milk in bulk, would never sell his dairy cows in bulk in the normal course of business.

==Application==
Although statutes vary, the legal requirements for a bulk sale generally apply to a sale of all or most of the materials, supplies or inventory of a business in a way not normally done in the ordinary course of the seller's business.  Bulk transfers in the [[United States]] (U.S.) were generally governed by Article 6 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC).  However, Article 6 has now been repealed by most states,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniformlaws.org/LegislativeFactSheet.aspx?title=UCC%20Article%206,%20Bulk%20Sales%20(1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption]] for list of U.S. jurisdictions retaining UCC Article 6.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of revisions to other provisions of the UCC that apply to sales and secured transactions.

The sale of an entire inventory is not a bulk sale if it is sold to buyers in a manner that ensures adequate consideration.  For example, if a merchant holds an [[auction]] sale for the entire contents of the business and the sale is in good faith, the buyer in not required to comply with bulk sales legislation.  However, the buyer of a business with inventory would be expected to complete the bulk sales registration as part of the normal course of closing the sale.  Similarly, if a merchant has a deep discount sale, that is not a bulk sale as deep discounts can be made in the ordinary course of business.

'''→In the modern era, many retail businesses operate on consignment or short credit terms, so compliance with bulk sales registration in the purchase of such a business, or its assets, is generally mandatory.  For example, in a typical [[convenience store]], generally the terms of sale are on [[consignment]] (return for full credit, pay for what you keep) or 30 days net (pay 30 days after delivery), with very little cash up front.  As such, little of the inventory in a convenience store has actually been paid for by the merchant, and suppliers expect to be paid out of the ongoing cash flow of the business.'''

'''Carl Wilhelm Andreas Falck''' (27 May 1907 – 23 July 2016&lt;ref name="NorwayToday"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://norwaytoday.info/news/norways-oldest-man-dead/|title=Norway's oldest man is dead|last=Tatone|first=Joseph|date=25 July 2016|website=norwaytoday.info|publisher=Norway Today|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Norwegian businessman, [[centenarian]], and Norway's oldest living man. He was head of the [[wholesale]]rs' organization Norges Grossistforbund from 1948 to 1975. At the age of 105, Falck became Norway's oldest man in 2012 and a subject of media interest.

==Early years and career==
Falck was born in [[Tønsberg]], South Norway to a bookseller and his wife. He got a master's degree in law (''[[cand.jur.]]'') in 1931 at the [[University of Oslo]] and subsequently held various positions as jurist in the [[Norwegian Police Service]], a deputy judge ({{lang-no|dommerfullmektig|links=no}}), assistant lawyer and as jurist in the [[Ministry of Social Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Social Affairs]]. After 1939, he mostly worked within various business organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1973/0148.html "Hvem er Hvem?"    (1973), p. 148] Runeberg.org; retrieved 5 January 2014 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, he was named CEO of the wholesalers' organization Norges Grossist-forbund, (which in 1990 was merged into the [[Federation of Norwegian Enterprises]]). In this position and as part of the [[Marshall Plan]], he spent two months in large cities in the US in 1952 to study the American wholesale industry. He became particularly interested in how the Americans kept stock in big one-level warehouses, as opposed to the Norwegian practice where stocks often were kept in narrow multilayer warehouses where ladders were needed to get the stocks in and out. Coming back to Norway, he advocated what he thought was the more effective American system. He published a book about structural changes in the wholesaler industry in 1969. He was a member of various Norwegian and European committees during his career.&lt;ref&gt;Marita E. Valvik (13 April 2013) [http://www.aftenposten.no/okonomi/Lagersjefen-Carl-Falck-7172836.html#.UsisULTeDIU "Lagersjefen Carl Falck"] ''[[Aftenposten]]''; retrieved 5 January 2014 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elderly years and death==
In 2012, at age 105, Falck became Norway's oldest man and since then was portrayed by various media outlets. Remaining in good health, he lived in his own home until 2012. when he moved into a nursing home in Oslo. He used to smoke until he was around 50. In his eighties, he started going to a gym, and later worked out daily at the nursing home.&lt;ref&gt;Hilde Nordlund (24 August 2012) [http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/08/24/tema/helse/eldre/trening/velvere/23109764/ "Norges nest eldste mann synes damene på senteret er for gamle"] ''[[Dagbladet]]''. Retrieved 5 January 2014 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[NRK]] published an article by Carl Falck titled "Some thoughts from Norway's oldest man" ({{lang|no|Noen tanker fra Norges eldste mann}}) where he reflected upon his own life and how society had changed since he was born.&lt;ref name=falck&gt;Carl Falck (12 June 2013) [http://www.nrk.no/ytring/noen-tanker-fra-norges-eldste-mann-1.11076691 "Noen tanker fra Norges eldste mann"] NRK.

He encouraged people to use their right to vote and declared he would vote the same party as he always had;&lt;ref name=falck/&gt; he voted for the 43rd time in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Johanne Karstensen (7 September 2013) [http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/09/07/magasinet/pluss/norges_eldste_mann/reportasjen/valg/29067889/ "Mandag stemmer Norges eldste mann, Carl Falck (106), på samme parti for 43. gang"] ''Dagbladet''; retrieved 5 January 2014 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Joseph Lambert''' / '''Carlos José Lambert''' (1826 - 1888) was a [[Chile|Chilean]]-born mining entrepreneur and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gaceta de los tribunales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGQvAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA87| year=1865|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Family provenance and early years===
Carlos José Lambert is believed to have been born in or near [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]].   However, surviving records of his birth and baptism have not been identified.  (In the 1820s members of the European expatriate community frequently attended to baptismal formalities not in [[Roman Catholic]] churches onshore, but on British ships moored offshore.)

His father {{ill|Charles Saint Lambert|es|Carlos Lambert}} (1793-1876), was a prominent, and increasingly prosperous, mining entrepreneur who had been born in [[Strasbourg]] and emigrated to [[Chile]] in 1817.&lt;ref name=Lamberts&amp;BathsperMJ&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.henrybath.com/assets/_files/documents/jun_11/HENRYBATH__1308588481_Complete_Henry_Bath_History.pdf| date=October 2010| author=Mike Jackson| title=Henry Bath &amp; Son - A Company and family History| accessdate=1 November 2016}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   He established contacts in England, acquired British nationality and returned to Chile in 1823 as a representative of a British company called the "Chilean Mining Association", which later went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=JM&amp;SConCLambert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistahistoria.uc.cl/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mayo-collier-couyoumdjian-32.pdf|author1=John Mayo and Simon Collier (authors)|author2=Juan Ricardo Couyoumdjian (translator into Spanish - currently the only version of the text location online)|title=Mining in Chile's Norte Chico.

|date=1998|publisher=Publication of the Instituto de Historia, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The career of Charles Saint Lambert (the father) continued to prosper, however.  Little is known of his mother, who is frequently described as "English", although at least one source indicates that she was born further north, in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=MomselonGeni&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/n-n-Spears/6000000030736249152|title=n.n. Spears|publisher=Geni.com|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Charles Joseph Lambert spent much of his childhood in Britain.   Around 1840 his father relocated the family base to [[Swansea]] which was becoming the principal smelting centre for industrial scale copper (and other) ores from [[Chile]], following the exhaustion of principal mines closer to hand in Cornwall.&lt;ref name=Lamberts&amp;BathsperMJ/&gt;   In Swansea he was involved in regular commercial negotiations with Edward Bath, scion of a major industrial family in the area (and subsequently his brother-in-law twice over).&lt;ref name=Lamberts&amp;BathsperMJ/&gt;   In practice, he appears to have divided his time between Chile and South Wales throughout his working life.

===Activities in Chile===
As a mining engineer he exploited new  copper-smelting technology employing "coal-using reverbatory furnaces"&lt;ref name="Minchinton2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=W.E Minchinton|title=Industrial South Wales 1750-1914: Essays in Welsh Economic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXD_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141|date=5 November 2013| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-136-61779-9|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; which his father had introduced to Chile in 1848,&lt;ref name=CLperJM&amp;SC&gt;{{cite book|title=Mining in Chile's Norte Chico: Journal of Charles Lambert, 1825-1830 (Dellplain Latin American Studies)| author1=John Mayo |author2=Simon Collier |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mining-Chiles-Norte-Chico-1825-1830/dp/0813335841| publisher=Westview Press Inc|isbn=978-0-813-33584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which at this stage gave an important competitive advantage.   He was also active as a farmer, with an extensive property in the valley of the [[Rapel River]], centred on a Welsh style farmhouse.   This farm also included silver deposits which he exploited.

He actively promoted the construction of the railway connecting [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] with the port of [[Coquimbo]], taking a significant shareholding in the project, which also linked up two of the family's smelting locations.   He promoted the exploitation of sheep imported from [[England]] and [[Australia]], as well as raising sheep himself.   In La Serena has also backed the drainage project, proposing the construction of a canal to divert water from the [[Elqui River]] to an outlet near the port which would drain the coastal area of the Bay of Coquimbo.

At the start of the [[War of the Pacific|Pacific War]] in 1879 he is identified as the originator of fortifications along the Bay of Coquimbo.&lt;ref name=FLsegunHab&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuerte Coquimbo|url=http://fuertecoquimbo.jimdo.com/antecedentes/|publisher= Jaime Patricio Espejo Rojas|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This involved (at least) three gun emplacements covering the bay.   There were good strategic reasons to protect the port in order to avoid the interruption of the transport of ores from the Lambert mines to the industrial processing plants in [[Swansea]] and to prevent an attack on the domestic smelting works at "La Compañía", a couple of kilometers inland from the bay.   It was thought likely that Peruvian forces would attempt to paralyse the mining industry in the region which was seen as vital to sustaining the economy in wartime.

===Philanthropy===
Lambert was an active philanthropist, funding the construction and operation of hospitals in [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] and [[Vicuña, Chile|Vicuña]].   He funded the health commission to combat cholera and smallpox.   At Christmas he was in the habit of appearing on the city streets accompanied by his family loaded with parcels for distribution to the poor families of La Serena.

===Round the world in 713 days===
On 5 May 1880, embarking from [[Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] ([[England]]), Charles Joseph Lambert set sail aboard the company yacht for a round the world trip, accompanied by his wife, their four youngest children, a governess, a nurse, a maid, a valet, a footman, a minister of the church and an artist called Robert Prichett.   Their boat, "The Wanderer", was coal powered, also capable of sail propulsion when the wind blew appropriately.   Lambert kept a detailed record of the adventure in which he recorded that 1265&lt;small&gt;½&lt;/small&gt; [[Long ton|(British) tons]] were consumed by the voyage.&lt;ref name=Wandererjournals&gt;{{cite web| url=https://archive.org/stream/voyagewandererf00unkngoog#page/n26/mode/1up|title="The voyage of the "Wanderer," from the journals and letters of C. and S. Lambert" |author=Gerald Young (compiler)|publisher=Macmillan, London|date=1883|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The ship was operated by 8 officers and 35 crewmen (not necessarily all at once) and the staff also included 7 ships' stewards.&lt;ref name=Wandererjournals/&gt;   It may have been this voyage that inspired William Stanley Lambert, the couple's youngest son, who celebrated his eleventh and twelfth birthdays during the voyage, regarding his subsequent decision to join the [[Royal Navy|British navy]], which he did in 1885.&lt;ref name="Demaus2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ed. A. B. Demaus|title=Letters from HMS Britannia: William Lambert &amp; The Late Vic| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L26oAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|date=30 November 2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |isbn=978-1-4456-1256-0|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the voyage the family were able to visit [[Hawaii]] to pay their respects to their dead son Carlos who had drowned there on 20 November 1870 while serving in the navy. The family had already erected a memorial to their dead son back home at "La Compañía" outside [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], and now they were able to erect another "cenotaph" with a cross near the site of his death.

===Death===
Charles Joseph Lambert himself died on 11 July 1888.   He suffered "an epidemic of ‘choleric diarrhoea’" and booked a passage on a steamship to [[Liverpool]] where he spent his final months staying in an hotel beside the [[Royal Yacht Club]].&lt;ref name=Lamberts&amp;BathsperMJ/&gt;   The actual death took place not in Liverpool, however, but at [[Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=n1duTmYW6cgg8wNLsFpGzg&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=1 November 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7756">A '''Certified Government Financial Manager''' ('''CGFM''') is a professional certification issued by the [[Association of Government Accountants]] (AGA) in the [[United States]].  It was created in 1994 to provide a professional standard of financial expertise and ethics in government and a standard by which government financial management professionals are measured.  Its education, experience and ethics requirements have served to elevate the most seasoned financial professionals.

The certification requires experience, education, and examinations.  Candidates must have a [[bachelor's degree]] from an accredited U.S. college or university and a minimum of two years' of professional-level experience in U.S. government financial management.  The examinations consists of 3 two-hour tests which must be taken within 3 years of the enrolling.  A CGFM must complete [[Continuing Professional Education]] (CPE) credits to maintain certification.

The curriculum of the CGFM certification covers such topics as accounting; auditing; internal controls; budgeting and financial reporting, and applies to federal, state, and local government.  

==Need for excellence in government finance==
The [[Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990]] (CFO Act) was signed into law by President [[George H. W. Bush]]. For each of 23 federal agencies, the position of chief financial officer was created. Since that time, federal efforts have been intended to improve the government's financial management and develop standards of financial performance and disclosure. Similar financial expectations exist at state and local government levels.

The [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) of a public agency is the corporate officer primarily responsible for managing the financial risks of the business or agency. This officer is also responsible for budgeting, financial planning, record-keeping, cash flow management, higher management. communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community. The title may vary, such as finance director or treasurer, from agency to agency. The CFO typically reports to the city manager or other chief executive officer.

Financial reporting has multiple audiences, with a responsibility to citizens, taxpayers and voters to provide transparent accountability for use of public funds (taxes).  Additionally, financial reporting must provide internal guidance to program managers to maintain budgetary control and to governing city councils and boards of directors to provide adequate financial policy guidelines.

The United States government in general has sought to improve the quality of financial reporting.  The [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB) has a stated mission to "establish and improve standards of state and local governmental accounting and financial reporting that will result in useful information for users of financial reports and guide and educate the public, including issuers, auditors, and users of those financial reports." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasb.org/ Government Accounting Standards Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Pronouncements in particular have trended to incorporate more comparable elements of business-sector.

The need for and value of financial managers has increased. Over the past decades, a number of factors have created a rapidly changing environment for today's government financial managers.  Beginning with the [[New York City]] financial crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, state and local governments began overhauling their financial management systems. In 1990, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) act called for reforms that brought the goal of accountability to the forefront.  The 1994 Bankruptcy of [[Orange County, California]], further underscored the need for ongoing excellence and expertise in the field of municipal finance.

==Service provided by CGFMs==
Those who may be qualified and have the skills to lead can subject themselves to peer credentialing. The Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM) does this. A professional certification provides a degree of confidence that practitioners are adequately trained, educated and experienced to be prepared for financial challenges in the real world.

The CGFM is broad; it covers federal, state and local government financial management. It measures a wide range of knowledge and skills that a professional needs to succeed in the federal government financial environment, or to meet the unique challenges faced by state and local government financial managers.

The foundation of the CGFM are the requirements for education, experience, examination and commitment to excellence. This includes adherence to a Code of Ethics and required Continuing Professional Education (CPE).

==CGFM requirements==
In addition to submitting an application for the CGFM program and abiding by AGA's Code of Ethics, candidates for CGFM certification must meet the following requirements: 

===Education===
A [[bachelor's degree]] from an accredited U.S. college or university.

===Professional experience===
A least two years of professional-level experience in government financial management. A candidate's experience must involve U.S. government financial management at a professional level in federal, state or local government and encompass one or more of the following areas: Financial systems design, implementation, or operation; Budget formation, execution or analysis; Accounting or auditing policy and procedure development, implementation or interpretation; Accounting or auditing standards-setting; Audit of financial operations, financial statements, internal controls, or compliance with laws and regulations; Audit or evaluation of program performance or operations; Audit of contract compliance or costs; Financial report design or preparation; Financial planning or analysis; Cost or program accounting systems or asset management systems development or operation; Information resources management or electronic data processing; Government financial management training course design or instruction; Investigation of financially related fraud or criminal activities; Other experience in government financial management that the Professional Certification Board deems acceptable.

'''Colour Index International''' is a reference database jointly maintained by the [[Society of Dyers and Colourists]] and the [[American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists|url=http://www.aatcc.org/ |website=Colour Index International|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently contains over 27,000 individual products listed under 13,000 Colour Index Generic Names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About (Colour Index International)|url=http://colour-index.com/about|website=Colour index international|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first printed in 1925 but is now published solely on the [[World-Wide Web]]. The index serves as a common reference database of manufactured colour products and is used by manufacturers and consumers, such as artists and decorators.

Colorants (both [[dyes]] and [[pigments]]) are listed using a dual classification which use the '''Colour Index Generic Name''' (the prime identifier) and '''Colour Index Constitution Numbers'''. These numbers are prefixed in Brazil and various other countries with C.I. or CI, for example, [[Acid orange 7|CI 15510]]. This abbreviation is sometimes thought to be CL, due to the font used to display the information. A detailed record of products available on the market is presented under each Colour Index reference. For each product name, Colour Index International lists the manufacturer, physical form, and principal uses, with comments supplied by the manufacturer to guide prospective customers.

For manufacturers and consumers, the availability of a standard classification system for pigments is helpful because it resolves conflicting historic, proprietary, and generic names that have been applied to colours.

== Colour index numbers ==
The colour index numbers are 5-digit numbers grouped into numerical ranges according to the chemical structure.&lt;ref name="Gürses2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gürses |first1=Ahmet |last2=Açıkyıldız |first2=Metin |last3=Güneş |first3=Kübra |last4=Gürses |first4=M.

'''Document imaging''' is an [[information technology]] category for systems capable of replicating documents commonly used in business. Document imaging systems can take many forms including [[microfilm]], on demand printers, [[facsimile machine]]s, [[copier]]s, [[multifunction printer]]s, [[Image scanner#Document processing|document scanners]], computer output microfilm (COM) and archive writers. Document Imaging means the conversion of paper files (of any size or description) or microfilm / fiche to digital images.

==Document management==
Document imaging is a part of [[enterprise content management]]. In the early days of content management technologies, the term "document imaging" was used interchangeably with "document image management" as the industry tried to separate itself from the micrographic and reprographic technologies.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In the late 1980s, a new document management technology emerged: [[Electronic document management system|electronic document management]]. This technology was built around the need to manage and secure the escalating volume of electronic documents ([[spreadsheet]]s, [[word processing|word-processing]] documents, [[PDF]]s, [[Email|e-mails]]) generated in organizations.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Identity document scanning==
Customer [[identity document]] scanning and storage is used for the purpose of age verification, identifying barred members and identifying individuals to the authorities in the case of criminal incidents. They are typically used at [[nightclubs]], [[casino]]s, music venues, and many entities governed under the US [[Customer Identification Program]] (CIP) &lt;ref&gt;Efficiently Check ID with Passport Scanning, Alaris, https://www.alarisworld.com/en-us/insights/articles/secure-passport-scanning&lt;/ref&gt;.

Systems used include Id Scan Biometrics's ''Scan Net'' and ID Vista products.{{r|id1}} Id Scan Biometrics system was developed by Tamlyn Thompson in 2005.{{CN|date=April 2016}}

===United Kingdom nightclubs===
UK licensing authorities are increasingly requiring [[nightclub]]s to scan and retain clubbers' ID details. Privacy and data security concerns have been raised by customers and the protest group [[NO2ID]].{{r|id1|id2|id3}} For example, '''Clubscan''' was an [[ID card]] scanning system invented invented in 2003.{{CN|date=April 2016}} It took scanned images of [[nightclub]] patrons' ID documents and stored their personal details, for the purpose of age verification, identifying barred members and identifying individuals to the authorities in the case of criminal incidents. Clubscan is now discontinued and replaced by [[SCAN NET]] (the Safer Clubbing At Night Network) and serving over 1200 connected venues in the UK.

===Proof of delivery (POD)===
POD receipt can be generated into a digital image and full POD status report is generated into an excel spreadsheet. With e-retrieval of shipping documents,&lt;ref&gt;Art Zipkin, DDC FPO, http://ddcfpo.com/solutions/pod-retrieval&lt;/ref&gt; basic functions are dimensionalized, and newly streamlined administrative operations suddenly become a very strategic step in a business model.

Downtown [[Hartford, Connecticut]] is the primary business district and the center of [[Connecticut]]'s state government.  Due to the large number of insurance companies headquartered downtown, Hartford is known as the "Insurance Capital of the World".

==Business==
Downtown Hartford is home to such corporations as [[The Hartford]], [[Travelers Insurance]], [[Hartford Steam Boiler]], [[The Phoenix Companies]], [[Aetna]] and [[United Technologies Corporation]], most of which are housed in office towers constructed over the last 20–30 years. Downtown also serves as the hub for bus routes of [[Connecticut Transit Hartford]]. [[Union Station (Hartford)|Union Station]] is located in the western part of downtown.

Downtown is also home to the [[Hartford City Hall]], the [[Hartford Public Library]], which is undergoing a major expansion and renovation, the [[Old State House (Hartford)|Old State House]], which is one of the oldest state houses in the nation, the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] which is the oldest public art museum in the country, [[Travelers Tower]], historic [[Hotel Bond]], [[Bushnell Park]], and the [[Connecticut State Capitol]] and Legislative Office Complex.

The south downtown area south of Bushnell Park is the site of several imposing buildings built in the early decades of the 20th century as the headquarters for large [[insurance]] companies. The Scottish Union and National Insurance Company building, in the [[Georgian Revival style]], was built in 1913. The [[Renaissance Revival-style]] [[Connecticut General Life Insurance Company]] building, built in 1926, was inspired by the [[Medici-Riccardi Palace]] in [[Florence, Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartfordpreservation.org/images/HPANewsletter_2005Winter.pdf South Downtown] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726141407/http://www.hartfordpreservation.org/images/HPANewsletter_2005Winter.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }}, ''Hartford Preservation Alliance Newsletter'', Winter 2005-2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Along Main Street, [[Capital Community College]] and the [[Hartford Public Schools (Connecticut)|Hartford Public Schools]] offices are located in the 11-story building that until 1993 housed the [[G. Fox and Company]] department store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chs.org/fox/store.html The Store] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912040937/http://www.chs.org/fox/store.html |date=September 12, 2009 }}, Remembering G. Fox &amp; Co., Connecticut Historical Society website, accessed October 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The newly renovated [[University of Connecticut School of Business]] is located at [[Constitution Plaza]]. At the eastern edge of downtown at Adriaens Landing the [[Connecticut Convention Center]] opened in June 2005 near the new Marriott Hartford Hotel. 

==Housing== 
A major feature of the downtown and the city skyline is [[Hartford 21]], a 36-story apartment tower completed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/nyregion/04hartford.html Downtown Hartford Stirs From Slumber], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014 the 26-story office building at [[777 Main Street (Hartford, Connecticut)|777 Main Street]] (formerly the Bank of America Building) was converted into 285 luxury apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gosselin |first1=Kenneth R. |title=70 Percent Of 777 Main Apartments Are Occupied, Developer Says |url=https://www.courant.com/real-estate/property-line/hc-777-main-grand-opening-20151117-story.html |website=courant.com |publisher=Hartford Courant |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic places==
The downtown area includes eight [[historic district (United States)|historic district]]s listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: the [[Ann Street Historic District]], the [[Buckingham Square Historic District]], the [[Department Store Historic District]], the [[Downtown North Historic District (Hartford, Connecticut)|Downtown North Historic District]], the [[Elm Street Historic District (Hartford, Connecticut)|Elm Street Historic District]], the [[High Street Historic District (Hartford, Connecticut)|High Street Historic District]], the [[Main Street Historic District No. 2]], and the [[Pratt Street Historic District]].

'''Ebenezer "Eben" Allen''' (15 November 1868 – 20 May 1931) was an Australian businessman and politician who was a member of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Western Australia]] from 1911 to 1917, representing the [[Electoral district of West Perth|seat of West Perth]].

Allen was born in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], to Mary Selina (née Cant) and Joseph Allen. He attended Glenelg Grammar School (run by [[F. I. Caterer]]), and after leaving school worked for various Adelaide firms. Allen married Effie Marian Conigrave in 1895 (with whom he later had two children), and in 1899 moved to Western Australia to work for her father, [[J. Fairfax Conigrave]]. He eventually went into business on his own, as an auctioneer, real estate agent, and shipping agent. He became secretary of the [[Perth Chamber of Commerce]], and was also a director of a local [[building society]]. Allen served on the [[City of Perth|Perth City Council]] from 1904 to 1912 and again from 1915 to 1918. He first ran for parliament at the 1908 [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] elections, but lost to [[Arthur Jenkins (Australian politician)|Arthur Jenkins]] in [[Metropolitan Province]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/library/MPHistoricalData.nsf/(Lookup)/32491D035B28BD35482577E50028A4FC?OpenDocument Ebenezer Allen] – Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 4 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Western Australian state election, 1911|1911 state election]], Allen was elected to parliament running for the newly formed [[Western Australian Liberal Party (1911–1917)|Liberal Party]]. He replaced the retiring member in West Perth, [[Thomas Draper]]. Allen was re-elected at the [[Western Australian state election, 1914|1914 election]], but at the [[Western Australian state election, 1917|1917 election]] was opposed by Draper, who had decided he wished to resume his parliamentary career. Both he and Draper stood for the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]], which had been created earlier in the year, but Draper was more popular, winning back his former seat with 53.3 percent of the [[First preferences|first-preference vote]]. Allen recontested West Perth at the [[Western Australian state election, 1921|1921 election]], but polled only the third-highest number of votes. Draper lost his seat regardless, with the winning candidate, [[Edith Cowan]], becoming the first female member of parliament in Australia.&lt;ref name="res"&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=David|authorlink=David Black (historian)|last2=Prescott|first2=Valerie|title=Election statistics : Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, 1890-1996|year=1997|publisher=Western Australian Parliamentary History Project and Western Australian Electoral Commission|location=Perth, [W.A.]|isbn=0730984095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen died in Perth in May 1931, aged 62.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4470">{{Nihongo|'''Eitaro Itoyama'''|糸山 英太郎|Itoyama Eitarō|born June 4, 1942 in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]}} is one of Japan's wealthiest citizens with a fortune estimated to exceed $500 million. He is a controversial figure in Japanese political and commercial life.

Itoyama has served four terms as a member of the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]], the Japanese Parliament with nearly twenty years of active involvement in the ruling party, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. He was a principal figure in a 1974 bribery scandal that resulted in the arrests of more than 90 people, including a senior vice president of Itoyama's company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Farrell|first=John|title=90 arrested in Japanese ballot scandal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19740725&amp;id=zbRUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xpADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6586,2300807|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Age|date=24 July 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter Herzog characterized Itoyama as "one of the worst offenders" in having a "cavalier attitude" toward Japanese election laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herzog|first=Peter J|title=Japan's Pseudo-Democracy|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSiMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Eitaro+Itoyama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bCJJF5MTyK&amp;sig=zvhjhuxZoWOJ7cwSwBGBclrpOnU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BifKUu2hIMiwkgWj04GABg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Itoyama became the single largest shareholder in [[Japan Airlines]] in February 1998 and publicly called for significant changes to management and business structures. He traveled to the United States and began negotiating the sale of JAL hotel properties such as the [[Ihilani Resort &amp; Spa]] in Honolulu and the [[JW Marriott Essex House|Essex House]] in New York, despite having no actual authority to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Russ|title=Thorn in JAL's side is top shareholder|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/98/06/12/business/index.html|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=12 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; JAL management moved to compromise with Itoyama by appointing him Special Adviser to the Chief Executive Officer in exchange for Itoyama's giving up the right to object to management decisions at shareholder meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gadfly Weighs Selling Japan Airlines Stake|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/06/business/international-briefs-gadfly-weighs-selling-japan-airlines-stake.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fF%2fFinances|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=6 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold half of his JAL stake on the open market in 2006 after the company failed to pay dividends for two years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Itoyama sheds half of JAL shareholdings|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/03/30/business/itoyama-sheds-half-of-jal-shareholdings/#.UsooMtIW1_0|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=Japan Times|date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erwin Leonard Guy Abel''' (23 October 1911 – 1 May 1995) was a New Zealand grocer, businessman, athlete and racehorse owner. He was born in [[Ohakune]], [[Rotorua/Taupo]], [[New Zealand]] on 23 October 1911.&lt;ref name="DNZB Abel"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Erwin Leonard Guy Abel|first= Lynette J.|last= Williams|id=5a1|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onthey opened Abel opened New Zealand's first shopping mall, The Big A Plaza, at [[Glenview, New Zealand|Glenview, Hamilton]] in October 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mp.natlib.govt.nz/detail/?id=41793 |title=Object 41793 Detail |publisher=National Library of New Zealand |access-date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early Life &amp; career===
On 23 October 1911, Erwin Leonard Guy Abel was born in Ohakune to a farm worker and bush contractor named Leonard Guy Abel, and his wife Rosa Hunt. He was the second of four children and was known as, Wynn. Abel grew up [[Waikato Region|Waikato]] and the [[King Country]], both regions in North-Western New Zealand; he did live for a few months on [[Banks Peninsula]]. In Cambridge, Abel worked as a grocery assistant at the Farmer's Trading Company store; he was fourteen and finished with school, he would work for eight years there.

On 16 March 1933, Abel married Jean Winifred Keene in [[Auckland]]. The couple would have five children together: Four daughters and one son. It was soon after Abel's wedding that he would get a promotion at the grocery store: Able was transferred to the [[Whangarei]] branch of farmers where he was to manage the grocery department of the store.

Abel was a very precocious young man who was constantly driven by self-improvement: He studied bookkeeping, grocery retailing and business management until he was well versed in all three subjects. In fact, Abel took up a second job, for some extra money, selling correspondence classes. In 1936, Abel had received a diploma from the London-based Fern Business Institute for management. It was soon after receiving this academic accolade that he purchased his own grocery business, the Wellworth While stores; it was located in central Whangarei.

Abel found success with his grocery business in central Whangarei, credit is likely due to his business philosophy: Combining the lowest prices with the highest quality and standards of personal services, both helping to ensure quality customers that had loyalty. His business had a catch phrase that it advertised to customers: "If Abels hasn’t got it … nobody has!". This catch phrase had really captured the essence of Abel's dedication to customer service and what his business was all about.

During the [[Second World War]] Abel and his family provided and packaged its own products at his grocery store; these products included pickled onions, bottled jam, and cream biscuits. By the 1950s, Abel purchased a second store in Whangarei and had his only son—Len—manage it.

Able was truly an innovative businessman, especially for the grocery industry; he claimed to be the first grocer to take the backs out of their shop windows at the store to allow for the customers to provide themselves with self-service.

===Mid-life and career===
In 1953, Abel had won a research trip to Europe and North America to study grocery retailing, wholesaling plus the new and wildly popular supermarkets. When Abel returned from his research trip he decided to open his own supermarket with his son. On 29 November 1961, Abel and his son had chosen [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] as the site for their new supermarket; it opened in the Hamilton suburb of [[Hillcrest, Waikato|Hillcrest]]. It was Hamilton's first supermarket and in turn was one of New Zealand's first supermarkets. The supermarket venture became a huge success: They very next year the Abels built four new adjoining supermarkets.

On 8 October 1969, Abel and his son opened their "Big 'A' Plaza" at [[Glenview, New Zealand|Glenview]]; at the time a fast developing suburb in Hamilton. The "Big 'A' Plaza" was the first shopping mall for New Zealand: The shopping mall was another new concept in retailing during that time. The Abels had opened three new shops at the Plaza in Glenview: A juvenile boutique, an electric appliance store, and a supermarket.

The Abels continued to purchase, sell and develop business after creating the "Big 'A' Plaza" shopping mall. The family company soon became composed of Erwin Abel, his wife Jean Abel, and his son Len Abel. The new Abel team would start with the purchase of the supermarket in [[Tauranga]]. The other purchases would soon expand to two discount grocery stores, properties in Hamilton and [[Rotorua]], and the acquisition of company to manufacture household cleansers and hardware goods.

From 1958 to 1961, Abel had served on the board of directors for [[Foodstuffs|Foodstuffs Limited]], a New Zealand grocery and liquor retailer—Abel had served on the Board in Auckland. After Abel was a consultant for [[Pak'nSave|Pak n' Save]]'s development—a New Zealand retail grocery warehouse chain that provides discount goods—he was considered highly influential and the Foodstuffs Limited board of directors became re-interested and impressed with Abel; the Directors asked him to rejoined the board of directors at Foodstuffs Limited starting in 1970 and ending in 1982.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Abel and his wife decided to move from their home in Hillcrest to a new property ranging 26 acres in [[Tamahere]]; the property was called Malabar Farm. One of the appeals of their new residence was that the land could support the breeding and raising of race horses. It was at this farm that the Abels would start to breed thoroughbred race horses and raised a number of winners; the most notable was Van Der Hum whom, in 1976, won the [[Melbourne Cup]].

Abel had a serious interest in athletics and in his older years became quite an accomplished athlete. His main focus and interests in athletics lied in [[Cross country running|cross-country running]] and [[Marathon|marathon running]]. In 1965, Abel ran his first marathon. In 1981, at the New Zealand [[World Masters Athletics Championships|Veteran's Championships]], Abel—at the age of 70—had competed and won in four different events: The over 400 meter run, the over 800 meter run, the over 1500 meter run, and the over 5000 meter run. In 1983, at the All-American Championships in [[Texas]], Abel had won the gold medal for the 1500 meter in the 70 – 74 age group.

In 1982, the Abel's had finally sold their last two businesses: The supermarkets in Glenview and Hillcrest. The family decision was made on a couple of factors, however, the most important reasoning was that their son, Len, died that year due to poor health; this left the Abel couple to run two businesses past their ages of retirement, a grossly unwanted burden during their time of mourning.

===Retirement &amp; death===
In Abel's retirement he maintained his athletic endeavours (i.e. competitive cross-country running and marathon running). Both him and his wife, Jean, also continued to breed, raise, and race thoroughbreds. In addition to Abel's other activities, he enjoyed growing and maintaining an organic vegetable garden; he served as a member of the [[Soil &amp; Health Association of New Zealand|Soil and Health Association of New Zealand]]. Abel even took up practising [[yoga]] for relaxation and to sustain mental vitality.

In 1989, Abel and his wife, Jean, sold their home—Malabar Farm—and bought a more suitable property for their senior years; they moved to the Alandale Retirement Village, just outside Hamilton, by purchasing one of its villas. On 1 April 1995, Erwin Abel died at the Waikato Hospital in Hamilton. He had suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] for twelve years before finally succumbing to the condition. Abel was survived by his wife, Jean (whom died in 1997), and his three daughters.

'''Francesco De Rubertis''' (born January 23, 1970) is a partner at medicxi, a [[venture capital]] firm with offices in [[London]], Jersey and [[Geneva]], having co-founded the firm in February 2016.&lt;ref name="BBGMed"&gt;{{cite news |title= J&amp;J and GSK join Medicxi’s European life sciences push |url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/10e91eac-c921-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0.html#axzz3yzLTOazH |work= FT |date= February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that he was a partner at another venture capital firm, [[Index Ventures]], having led the firm’s efforts to establish its life sciences practice after joining in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Veni, vidi, V.C.|url=http://www.unige.ch/presse/campus/pdf/c83/etudiantEs.pdf|work= University of Geneva student magazine|date= November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
De Rubertis was born in [[Italy]]. He graduated from the [[University of Pavia]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Genetics]] and [[Microbiology]], before earning a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Molecular Biology]] from the [[University of Geneva]], where he also met his wife, Sandra Henchoz, who was a fellow student. De Rubertis engaged in [[postdoctoral research]] in [[molecular genetics]] at the [[Whitehead Institute]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), and later earned the [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Executive Profile|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=160717&amp;privcapId=111656446&amp;previousCapId=91996&amp;previousTitle=Index%20Ventures|work= Bloomberg Businessweek|date= May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After his postdoctoral work at MIT, in 1997 De Rubertis moved back to [[Geneva]], where he joined Index Ventures and helped co-found the firm’s [[life sciences]] practice. In 2009 he moved to [[London]] (site of another Index office) where he continues to reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Veni, vidi, V.C.|url=http://www.unige.ch/presse/campus/pdf/c83/etudiantEs.pdf|work= University of Geneva student magazine|date= November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Rubertis is responsible for all of Index Ventures’ investments in the life sciences. He has served on the Boards of Directors of many companies, including Addex Therapeutics ({{SWX|ADXN}}), CellZome (acquired by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] for $120 Million
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= GSK acquires Cellzome 100% |url=http://www.eurobiotechnews.eu/news/news/2012-02/gsk-acquires-cellzome-100.html|work= EuroBiotechnologyNews|date= May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Genmab]] ({{OMX|CSE11143|GEN}}), Molecular Partners ({{SWX|MOLN}}), PanGenetics (acquired by [[Abbott Laboratories]]), and Parallele Bioscience (acquired by [[Affymetrix]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= GSK Press release|url=http://us.gsk.com/html/media-news/pressreleases/2012/2012-pressrelease-1090596.htm|work= GlaxoSmithKline|date= May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2012 De Rubertis spearheaded the launch of Index Ventures’ $200 Million life sciences fund in partnership with [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] (J&amp;J), to invest in early-stage biotechnology companies
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Index Launches Its First Life Sciences Fund: $200M And Partnering With Glaxo and Johnson &amp; Johnson |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/20/index-launches-its-first-life-sciences-fund-200m-and-partnering-with-glaxo-and-johnson-johnson/|work= [[TechCrunch]]|date= March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

De Rubertis is the author of several publications in international scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Scholar search: "Francesco De Rubertis"|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Francesco+De+Rubertis%22&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 De Rubertis was named by ''BioWorld'' as one of 28 "movers and shakers" predicted to shape the biotechnology industry over the next two decades
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Future Is Here: Who Will Shape Biotech Over the Next 20 Years? BioWorld Says…|url= http://www.bioworld.com/img/BIO20.pdf|work= BioWorld 20th Anniversary Edition|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2012 De Rubertis was named by ''[[Xconomy]]'' as one of 40 of “Young and Proven” biotech venture capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Who Will Survive the Biotech VC Downturn? The Young and the Proven|url= http://www.xconomy.com/national/2012/10/22/who-will-survive-the-biotech-vc-downturn-the-young-and-the-proven/|work= [[Xconomy]]|date= October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

De Rubertis is a member of the Strategic Advisory Board of the University of Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medicxi.com/team/francesco-de-rubertis|title=Medicxi Partner bio: Francesco De Rubertis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016 De Rubertis launches an independent venture capital firm Medicxi (formerly Index Ventures Life Sciences) and announces the closing of Medicxi Ventures 1 (MV1) a €210m fund including GSK and Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicxi.com/news/medicxi-formerly-index-ventures-life-sciences-launches-as-an-independent-venture-capital-firm-and-announces-closing-of-a-210m-fund-including-gsk-and-johnson-johnson-innovation|title=Medicxi Ventures, Formerly Index Ventures Life Sciences, Launches as an Independent Venture Capital Firm and Announces Closing of a €210m Fund including GSK and Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation {{!}} Medicxi|website=www.medicxi.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicxi is managed by four Partners Francesco de Rubertis, Kevin Johnson, David Grainger and Michèle Ollier all of whom previously led the Life Sciences practice at Index Ventures.

On November 30, 2017 De Rubertis was named in the Bloomberg Top 50 most influential people of 2017. He was selected as one of 10 nominees in the Tech (&amp; Science) category along with Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX), Masayoshi Son (Softbank Group) and Martin Lau (Tencent Holdings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-bloomberg-50/|title=Meet This Year’s Bloomberg 50|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bloomberg Top 50 consists of 5 categories Tech (&amp; Science), Business, Politics, Finance and Entertainment.

De Rubertis’s reputation for halving the time it takes for a return on biotech investments has Silicon Valley eager to get in on a $300 million fund he’s raised for late-stage startups.

Medicxi Growth 1, which made its first investments in health care and diabetes treatments, is taking minority stakes in companies that are developing multiple therapies, have full management teams, and intend to go public as independent businesses. This is a departure for De Rubertis. He has focused on “skinny” startups—with small management teams and only one therapy—that can integrate into larger companies after being bought. The shift hasn’t diminished interest in the fund. Verily, Alphabet Inc.’s life-sciences arm, has also invested in MG-1

'''Gaisano Capital''' is a chain of malls and supermarkets owned by Edmund S. Gaisano Sr., the second son of Henry S. Gaisano Sr. In the 1970s, he had his own construction business independent of his [[Gaisano family|relatives]]. One of his projects was to construct a building (which was to be named the Henry Gaisano Building after his father, one of Doña Modesta's sons) located along Leon Kilat and [[Colon Street|Colon]] streets in [[Cebu City]] which was to be leased as a supermarket by his relatives. When the supermarket venture failed, Edmund Gaisano Sr. decided to open his own supermarket. This supermarket became the first Gaisano Capital supermarket and is presently known as Gaisano Capital South.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History|url=http://www.gaisanocapital.com/about/brief-history/|website=Gaisano Capital|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the last quarter of 2015, Gaisano Capital has 31 stores, with the recent shopping mall opened December 2011 located in [[Surigao City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Almeda|first1=Vanessa|title=Gaisano opens 17th mall amid Sendong wrath|url=http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2011/12/21/gaisano-opens-17th-mall-amid-sendong-wrath/|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=MindaNews|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were in [[San Francisco, Agusan del Sur]] (also opened in November 2014), [[Tandag]], [[Bislig]] and [[Butuan]].

'''Sir Thomas Harcourt Clarke "Pat" Caughey''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KBE|CStJ|JP}} (4 July 1911 – 4 August 1993) was a New Zealand [[rugby union]] player.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Auckland]] in 1911, Caughey was the son of James Marsden Caughey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19110708.2.2.1 | title=Births | date=8 July 1911 | work=New Zealand Herald | accessdate=16 November 2014 | page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose aunt, [[Marianne Smith]] (née Caughey), founded in 1880 what became [[Smith &amp; Caughey's]] department store. Educated at [[King's College, Auckland|King's College]], he excelled at sports, playing in the 1st XV rugby and 1st XI cricket teams, and winning the school athletics, swimming and boxing championships.&lt;ref name="AB profile"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=141 |title = Pat Caughey | last = Luxford | first = Bob | publisher = New Zealand Rugby Union | accessdate = 16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby union==
A [[Rugby union positions#Centre|centre three-quarter]], Caughey represented [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]] at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the [[All Blacks]], from 1932 to 1937. He played 39 matches for the All Blacks including nine internationals.&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt;

Caughey played for Auckland University RFC and represented the Auckland provincial team and the national team before his 21st birthday. He toured Australia with the All Blacks in both [[1932 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia|1932]] and [[1934 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia|1934]], playing as a centre. He was one of 188 players who took part in the All Blacks trials for the [[1935–36 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and Canada]], and was selected for the final touring party. During the journey to Europe the tour management decided to play Caughey at second five-eighth, in which position he played 20 tour matches including three of the four tests. Caughey scored 14 tries on tour including a hat-trick against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], which were the only tries of his international career.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Huw|title=A different world of All Blacks|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/newzealand/rugby/story/142808.html|website=espn.co.uk|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caughey played two more tests for New Zealand, in 1936 and 1937, before business commitments ended his high-level rugby career. In addition to his nine full internationals he played 30 non-test games for the All Blacks, scoring 31 tries. Rugby journalist [[Terry McLean]], whose brother Hugh was a teammate of Caughey on the 1935–36 tour, described Caughey as 'an elegant and stylish back of English style' and [[Charlie Oliver (rugby union)|Charlie Oliver]], vice-captain of the 1935–36 tour, assessed him as 'a temperamental player. He was a world beater on his day and was in the match-winner class, but he was liable to be inconsistent. His dashing attacks, and wonderful sense of anticipation, were features of the team's play. His defence, however, was not up to the same standard'.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

==Business and public life==
Caughey worked at the family department store, Smith &amp; Caughey, for 63 years beginning in 1930, and was managing director and chairman of the company for 30 years. He served on the Auckland Hospital Board for 25 years, including 15 years as chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesshalloffame.co.nz/past-laureates/caughey-thomas-harcourt-clarke/ |title=Caughey, (Thomas Harcourt Clarke |date= |website= |publisher=Young Enterprise Trust |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1967 New Year Honours]], Caughey was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for community services, especially as chair of the Auckland Hospital Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=44212 |date=1 January 1967 |page=44 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, in the [[1972 New Year Honours]], he was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], for services to health administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45556 |date=1 January 1972 |page=42 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed an [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Officer of the Order of St John]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43613 |date=30 March 1965 |page=3197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to Commander of the same order in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=44569 |date=19 April 1968 |page=4527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Caughey was awarded an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] by the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=University of Auckland Calendar 1987 |url=http://www.calendar.auckland.ac.nz/archive/1987-calendar.pdf |accessdate=16 November 2014 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Auckland in 1993 and his ashes were buried in Purewa Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purewa.co.nz/details.asp?id=7446&amp;type=Ashes%20Burial |title=Burial &amp; cremation details |date= |website= |publisher=Purewa Cemetery and Crematorium |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand business hall of fame in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Business laureates recognised at glittering gala | date=2 October 1998 | work=National Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jack De Garis promoting "Sun-Raysed", which later became "Sunraysia".jpg|thumb|right|220px|De Garis on one of his promotion tours for "Sun-Raysed"]]
'''Clement John ("Jack") De Garis''' (22 November 1884{{spaced ndash}}17 August 1926) was an [[Australia|Australian]] entrepreneur and aviator. He worked in the [[dried fruit]]s industry in the [[Sunraysia]] area around [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]] in the early 20th century, and was noted for his vibrant personality and colourful marketing style.&lt;ref name=adb1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080289b.htm|title=De Garis, Clement John (Jack) (1884–1926)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|author=[[Janet McCalman|McCalman, J.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Jack De Garis was the son of [[Elizee De Garis]], a noted irrigationist, and the younger brother of [[Mary De Garis]], a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery who served as a Chief Medical Officer of a field hospital in [[Serbia]] during [[World War I]]. Jack went to Mildura State School where he was described as an above-average student.&lt;ref name=brighton /&gt;  However, he left at the age of nine to work in his father's businesses in Mildura. He returned to school for his secondary education at his father's urging, boarding at [[Wesley College, Melbourne]] from 1899 to 1901, where he rose to become [[dux]] of his class.

Described as being short in stature, he capitalised on an affectionate smile and a magnetic personality. He excelled in school [[cricket]] and [[Australian rules football|football]], in which, despite his size, being only {{convert|150|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall and weighing only {{convert|43|kg|abbr=on}}, he confounded opposition players and coaches.&lt;ref name=brighton /&gt;

==Career==

De Garis' father, [[Elizee De Garis]], had established a successful [[Market gardening|market garden]] business in Mildura from about 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080290b.htm|title=De Garis, Elisha Clement (Elizee) (1851–1948)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|author=McCalman, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1908 the day-to-day business was left to Jack, and Elisha moved to Melbourne establish a selling agency for the business.  Jack was just 17, but had a strong self-belief and effervescent charm.  Theatrical entrepreneur [[Claude Kingston]] described him as the 'prince of ballyhoo'.&lt;ref name=adb1 /&gt;

De Garis expanded the business rapidly, and in 1910 borrowed heavily to establish a packing shed, Sarnia Packing Pty Ltd, which later became part of the Sunbeam Foods Group.  In 1913 he borrowed again to purchase the {{convert|10009|acre|adj=on}} Pyap Village Estate at [[Pyap, South Australia|Pyap]], near [[Loxton, South Australia|Loxton]] in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name=brighton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightoncemetery.com/HistoricInterments/150Names/degarisc.htm|title=Clement John 'Jack' De Garis|work=Brighton Cemetery|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The estate was moderately successful as a farm produce settlement, but in 1921 it was broken up and sold to fund De Garis's [[Kendenup, Western Australia|Kendenup]] venture.&lt;ref name=victories&gt;{{cite book|title=The Victories of Failure|author=C.J. De Garis|year=1925|publisher=Modern Printing Company, Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;  £23,000 was raised from the sale.

In 1919, a shortage of shipping space hit the dried fruits industry which was, at that time, highly dependent on British markets.  Realising his ability to market, the Australian Dried Fruits Association funded De Garis to undertake an Australia-wide American-style publicity campaign to increase domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=nichols&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-3955185/An-Australian-Ohio-Fighting-for.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121212538/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-3955185/An-Australian-Ohio-Fighting-for.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-21|title=An Australian Ohio? Fighting for Mildura, 1919-1921|work=Journal of Australian Studies|author=Nichols, D.|date=2004-09-01|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expanded into book publishing, as well as producing the ''[[Sunraysia Daily]]'' newspaper in Mildura, which employed nearly 100 staff.

Also in 1919, De Garis exposed a con-man, with a 'rank but not-too-well-sustained American accent', named George Henry Cochrane. Cochrane wrote for ''[[The Bulletin]]'' as "Grant Hervey", and had recently been released from prison for forgery and uttering. Cochrane emerged in Mildura and presented himself to two thousand Mildura citizens, selling the idea that the town should [[secede]] from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. He started receiving ₤5 subscriptions before De Garis revealed his true identity and criminal record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/victoria/mildura/2005/02/17/1108500206964.html|title=Mildura|date=14 July 2008|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his dried-fruits marketing De Garis travelled to [[Western Australia]] where, in 1920, he purchased the {{convert|47000|acre|adj=on}} property of the Hassell family at Kendenup, for the purpose of building a new settlement to grow apples, potatoes and farm produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanygateway.com.au/Town/Kendenup/Town_History/ |title=The History of Kendenup |work=Albany Gateway |accessdate=2008-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021051112/http://albanygateway.com.au/Town/Kendenup/Town_History/ |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subdivided the land into blocks ranging from {{convert|10|acre|0}} to {{convert|60|acre}}, and set up the De Garis Kendenup (W.A.) Development Company, and the Kendenup Fruit Packing Company, which ran a dehydrating factory to process vegetables and fruit grown by the 350 settlers who he had encouraged into the area. In December 1921, De Garis was living there himself, and the enterprise was under way, with a townsite being established. However the settlement eventually foundered. It had insufficient capital and the lot sizes were uneconomically small. De Garis travelled to the United States to raise urgently needed capital, which was promised but was never forthcoming.  After two years, only 30 settlers remained.

The collapse of the settlement was the subject of a 1923 Western Australian [[Royal Commission]] into Kendenup land schemes, in which fraud had been alleged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150233b.htm|title=McDonald, Sir Robert Ross (1888–1964)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|author=[[Geoffrey Bolton|Bolton, G.C.]], Shorter, T}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Garis was eventually cleared of any charges.

==Artistic Endeavours==
De Garis wrote a four-act military drama ''Ambition Run Mad'', which was published both as a booklet and in serial form, in the ''[[Murray Pioneer]]'' newspaper in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article74814885 |title=Local News |newspaper=[[The Mildura Cultivator]] |location=Vic. |date=27 March 1915 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his publicity campaign for the Australian Dried Fruits Association, De Garis engaged the services of popular composer [[Reginald Stoneham]] to put tunes to promotional lyrics he had written. The resulting ''Sun-Raysed Waltz'' was published as sheet music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4638098 Advertisement] ''The Argus (Nelbourne)'' 13 December 1919 p.8 accessed 1 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration must have enthused De Garis, as he and Stoneham then worked on an ambitious "mystery" musical comedy ''[[F.F.F. (musical)|F.F.F.]]'', which had a short but successful season for [[Hugh D. McIntosh]]'s Tivoli theatres in [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Melbourne]] in late 1920.

==Aviation==

De Garis described himself as an [[aviator]], and he owned several aeroplanes, but the reality was that he employed pilots to ferry him between Australian cities to carry on his business interests.  Nevertheless, in an era of pioneer aviation, his intense involvement was considered relatively dangerous, and at one stage he was asked by investors to refrain from use of aeroplanes for transport.

With his pilots, De Garis set several interstate flying records.&lt;ref name=adb1 /&gt; His first plane, which he acquired in June 1920, was a {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} [[Boulton Paul P.9]], and was flown by pilot Lieutenant A.L. Lang ([[Australian Flying Corps|AFC]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Victories of Failure''. p348&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1920, after the P.9 had crashed, De Garis purchased a [[Sopwith Gnu]] for £1,800. In July 1920 he employed Lieutenant [[Francis Stewart Briggs]] as his permanent pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Stewart Briggs, S. H. Harris, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Joysticks_and_Fiddlesticks.html?id=KyNXNQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y "Joysticks and Fiddlesticks: (the Unofficial History of a Flying Kangaroo) Or, The Flying Kangaroo"], ''Hutchinson &amp; Company Limited'', 1938. Retrieved 2014-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Victories of Failure''. p367&lt;/ref&gt;  He also purchased an [[Airco DH.4]].

De Garis's first major interstate flight was in the DH.4 from Melbourne to [[Perth]], the first time Australia had been crossed by air from east to west, a distance of {{convert|2169|mi}}. The plane landed at [[Belmont Park, Western Australia|Belmont Park Racecourse]] on 2 December 1920, after 19 hours 10 minutes.  One stretch of {{convert|1105|mi}} was done in 8¾ hours. De Garis, Briggs and their mechanic, Sergeant Stoward, were given a mayoral reception on their arrival in Perth. On 14 December they flew from Perth to [[Sydney]], a distance of {{convert|2462|mi}} in a time of 21½ hours.

Another notable flight was from Mildura to Sydney (5½ hours) and on to [[Brisbane]] (4 hours 50 minutes), in January 1921. Then, on 16 January, they set off on a one-day flight from Brisbane to Melbourne, leaving at 6:15 am and reaching their destination at 7:20 pm, a flying time of 10½ hours.  Stopovers were made in [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]], Sydney and [[Cootamundra]].&lt;ref&gt;''Victories of Failure''. p432&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

The Kendenup collapse coincided with a number of other financial failures within his empire.  With mounting debts, he faked his own [[suicide]] by drowning in [[Port Phillip]] on 5 January 1925, having written almost seventy farewell letters.&lt;ref name=adb1/&gt; His letter to Stoneham read:
:"You will have the papers by now, and will have seen what has become of me. The strain has been too long and too strong, and I have cracked up under it. I hope, however, for the sake of dear Vy that my new song "Moonoloo", turns out a winner, for she will need to get every penny she can. Think as pleasantly as you can of me, who came nearer to being a big success than people think; and who consequently became the greatest failure. Regards and regrets.–De Garis." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66933667 |title=His Last Song |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=10 January 1925 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Suspicions that De Garis was still alive soon surfaced and he became the subject of an eight-day nationwide search. He was apprehended the following week after arriving in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], on the {{SS|Maheno}}.&lt;ref name=adb1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Garis Arrested|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2025583|accessdate=2013-02-11|newspaper=The Argus|date=1925-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 17 August 1926, with debts of £420,000, De Garis committed suicide by gassing himself at his [[Mornington, Victoria|Mornington]] home.&lt;ref name=brighton/&gt;

Shortly before he died, an [[autobiographical novel]] ''Victories of Failure: A Business Romance'' (1925) was published in which he described his life and business career in great detail under the pseudonym of "K.J. Rogers".&lt;ref name=brighton /&gt;&lt;ref name=victories/&gt;

De Garis married Rene (née Corbould) in September 1907 and they divorced in May 1923.  The following month he married his former private secretary Violet (née Austin), with whom he had one daughter.  De Garis is buried at [[Brighton Cemetery]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=adb1/&gt;&lt;ref name=brighton/&gt;

'''James Caan''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born '''Nazim Khan''', 28 December 1960) is a [[British Pakistanis|British-Pakistani]] [[entrepreneur]] and television personality.

He is best known as a former investor on the BBC television programme ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons’ Den]]'', in which he was one of the Dragons from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/about/history.shtml|title=History of the Den|publisher=[[BBC Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he has hosted ''The Business Class'' on [[CNBC]], a series which sees him joined by experts from a cross-section of industries to analyse and advise innovative UK [[small and medium enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/49037243|title=The Business Class|publisher=[[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also Chairman of the UK Government's [[Start Up Loans Scheme]], which supports entrepreneurs with funding and mentoring to start their own business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2312176/|title=Former Dragons' Den judge James Caan helps 3,000 young entrepreneurs roar|publisher=MailOnline|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caan initially achieved success in the recruitment industry, founding the recruitment company Alexander Mann in 1985, which he sold in 2002. In 1993, he co-founded the executive head-hunting firm Humana International, in which he sold his stake in 1999. He is also the founder and current CEO of the UK-based private equity firm [[Hamilton Bradshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/smallbusiness/article-3610338/|title=Ex-Dragon James Caan's Start-up Secrets: I'm happy to admit I’ve had many failures throughout my career - accepting failure is as important as being successful'|publisher=MailOnline|date=30 May 2016|author=Eleanor Lawrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he was named Chairman of the Year at the International Business Awards.&lt;ref name=bip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiponline.co.uk/bip/james-caan-awarded-chairman-of-the-year-at-the-2013/|title=James Caan awarded Chairman of the Year at the 2013…|date=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caan has been involved in a number of charitable activities and founded the James Caan Foundation in 2006.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], Pakistan, Caan's family emigrated to the United Kingdom when he was two years old. His father came to the UK without any money or knowing the language but was able to build a successful business from scratch. He subsequently established a clothing company in [[Brick Lane]], east London. Caan's father had intended him to join the family business once his formal education was completed, but Caan decided he wanted to find his own way in the world. At 16, before he had begun his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-Levels]], he left home and moved to a flat in [[Kensington]]. This led to Caan's being estranged from his father for many years.&lt;ref name=mirror13216/&gt;

Other than a Saturday job at Mr Buyright, Caan had no formal experience of work and so went to a recruitment agency to find some. His first job was door to door sales, which he found tiring. At this point, he knew he wanted to work in an office. He went back to the recruitment agency and asked for something that was indoors and saw a job working for [[Grand Metropolitan]]. He worked for several recruitment companies and started a fashion boutique with his wife before deciding he wanted to start his own company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Deal: My Story from Brick Lane to Dragons' Den|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|author=James Caan|year=2008|isbn=9781905264452|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DaQnAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caan started his own recruitment company in the early 1980s. His first office was in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] but was so small that the door could not be fully opened as it was blocked by his desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startups.co.uk/james-caan.html|title=James Caan The Dragons’ Den panellist on gap years, what makes the ideal investment and his unwavering obsession with windows|publisher=[[UK Startup Awards]]|date=17 April 2008|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He purposely chose the prestigious address to add credibility to his business.&lt;ref name="telegraphjun13"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/10106803/James-Caan-To-succeed-you-have-to-be-ready-to-lose.html|title=James Caan: 'To succeed, you have to be ready to lose'
|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|first=Ewing|last=Sarah|date=9 June 2013|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As he had no meeting rooms, client meetings would often take place in coffee shops, and he would tell them that they were so busy that all the rooms were full. At this time he also changed his name from Nazim Khan to James Caan after seeing a film by the [[James Caan|famous actor]] and an alternative way to spell “Khan”; this also helped him in his recruitment company, as the name was more easily recognisable.&lt;ref name=mailwife/&gt; --&gt;

Caan did not excel at school and did not attend university as an undergraduate, but graduated from the 7-week Advanced Management Program at [[Harvard Business School]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/3161421/How-money-stopped-mattering-for-Dragons-Den-mogul-James-Caan.html|title=How money stopped mattering for Dragons' Den mogul James Caan|author=Celia Walden|date=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Business===
He founded the recruitment company Alexander Mann in 1987. In 1993 Caan co-founded the executive headhunting firm Humana International with Doug Bugie, eventually growing the business to over 147 offices in 30 countries. In the same year, Caan launched the trade magazine ''Recruitment International'', which he later sold in 2000. In 1996 Caan co-founded the business process outsourcing company AMS with Rosaleen Blair. Caan subsequently sold his interests in AMS in 2002. In 1999, Caan sold Humana International to CDI International, a New York listed company. Later in that year, Caan sold a minority stake in Alexander Mann Group to private equity firm [[Advent International]].

In 2002 Caan sold his interests in Alexander Mann, which by that time had a turnover of around £130m. In 2004 Caan established the London-based private equity firm, Hamilton Bradshaw.

'''Jürg Marquard''' (born 13 July 1945 in [[Zürich]]) is a [[Swiss]] publisher. He attended school in Zürich, where he became involved in journalism at a young age. Having done his leaving certificate (Matura) at the “Kantonsschule” for Economics in Zürich, he launched the youth magazine “POP” with SFR 2'000., which he borrowed from school friends. This founded the basis of his journalistic and entrepreneurial career.

At that time Jürg Marquard already sensed that the flourishing pop and rock culture was not just a fly-by-night phenomenon, but also a strong youth movement with revolutionary potential. He sensed this movement would embrace a large spectrum beyond the music and entertainment industry, such as fashion, lifestyle, culture and that it would even penetrate politics.

At the same time as putting his magazine “POP” on the map, Jürg Marquard was also working as a radio and TV presenter, specialising in pop music. He was the first presenter of the Radio-Hit-Parade to achieve great popularity in Switzerland.

==A successful entry into the German-speaking magazine market==

After the eventful early days, in which Jürg Marquard himself edited the magazine with a lot a passion, the magazine became a commercial success. After various mergers with other German youth magazines, POP became POP/ROCKY, which was Germany's second largest youth magazine for many years. POP/ROCKY maintained this status for decades until it was eventually merged with POPCORN in 1998. POPCORN was one of Marquard Media’s international [[umbrella brand]]s.

His big breakthrough in the German-speaking magazine market was achieved with the takeover of COSMOPOLITAN in 1981. Before then the German version of COSMOPOLITAN had been dragging its feet without any noticeable success. With radical editorial changes he turned COSMOPOLITAN into a huge success in less than a year. COSMOPOLITAN led the way for a new type of women's magazine. When taking over COSMOPOLITAN on October 14, 1981, Jürg Marquard said: "I believe in the future of this brand because recent years have brought about deep changes with regards to the self-image and the role behaviour of women. COSMOPOLITAN is the journalistic answer to these changes. The success is therefore pre-determined." COSMOPOLITAN subsequently became the most successful premium women’s magazine in the German-speaking market and therefore the basis for the expansion of the premium lifestyle segment of the Marquard Media Group.

==The internationalisation of Marquard Media==

In 1988 Jürg Marquard launched the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] versions of POPCORN and MÄDCHEN (Girl). With these launches he became the first western publisher of periodical magazines behind the then still existing “Iron Curtain”. The big success as well as the positive perspectives after the political change made Jürg Marquard invest dynamically in Central European markets and expand his activities – including the acquisition of daily newspapers in Hungary and Poland, as well as launching new magazines. In 1999, during the process of a strategic re-orientation, Jürg Marquard focused his activities on the premium magazine segment and therefore streamlined his portfolio: The youth and music titles were sold to Axel Springer, the Hungarian newspapers to Ringier and the Polish printing house to Baring Private Equity Partners. Following this phase of consolidation Marquard Media again expanded by launching various new magazines as well as taking over and integrating VIPress (PLAYBOY und VOYAGE) in [[Poland]]. In summer 2005, Marquard Media with a successful public offer, secured a 91,4% stake in Computec Media AG, a stock exchange listed publisher of various consumer magazines in the area of Electronic Entertainment and Multi-Media.

In 2005 Jürg Marquard was the co-producer and protagonist of the TV show „Traumjob“, a licensed version of Donald Trumps „The Apprentice“. This was a top-rated show on Kanal 1 on Swiss television.

===Marquard Media today===

In 2012, Marquard Media published 41 magazines in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and Poland. It is currently active with license editions in many other countries. The ever-growing online business encompasses 25 websites in the German-speaking markets.

In Hungary, Marquard Media is the leading publisher of premium magazines in the women’s as well as the men’s segment with a wide-ranging portfolio: JOY, EVA, INSTYLE, SHAPE, JOY CELEBRITY, FITT MAMA, PLAYBOY, PLAYBOY EXCLUSIVE, CKM and DESIGN ROOM.

Marquard Media continues to expand in the premium magazine segment in Poland. With CKM and PLAYBOY, it is the leading publisher in the men’s segment and also holds a top position in the women’s premium segment with COSMOPOLITAN, JOY, OLIVIA and SHAPE as well as with the travel magazine VOYAGE. Marquard Media is also successfully represented in the segment of weekly women’s magazines and true-stories magazines in Poland with PANI DOMU, CIENIE I BLASKI und SEKRETY SERCA.

Jürg Marquard plans to keep expanding his company. Further expansion is occurring via new launches, as well as further acquisitions.

==Shareholdings==

His total shareholding in London FTSE listed Kea Petroleum is 29,033,253 ordinary shares representing 4.16% of the Company's current voting rights.

''Reuters'', 20 October 2013, DHAKA | By Shyamantha Asokan and Serajul Quadir&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Fellow of the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh.  In 2015 he is a member of the executive committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh, and a director of the Chittagong Stock Exchange.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Early life and education==
Ahmed was born on 21 January 1956 in [[Dhaka]]. He graduated in mechanical engineering from [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]] (BUET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iccbangladesh.org.bd/committee/details/kutubuddin-ahmed |title=Executive Board: Kutubuddin Ahmed |website=International Chamber of Commerce Bangladesh |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Ahmed began his career at [[Janata Bank]], but resigned in 1983 to start his own business. Raising the BDT 10 lakh (US$37,500 in 1984) initial capital for what is now known as the [[Envoy Group]] proved difficult. In the end, Ahmed took out a bank loan with his father's house as collateral and brought in a partner, [[Abdus Salam Murshedy]],&lt;ref name="ds20May2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mirdha |first=Refayet Ullah |date=20 May 2017 |title=Fortune favours the brave |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/fortune-favours-the-brave-1407907 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[striker (football)|striker]] for [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Dhaka)|Mohammedan Sporting Club]] who had gained fame in 1982 by scoring a league-record 27 goals, but who had no previous business experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wedson's near miss |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/wedsons-near-miss-34787 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=25 July 2014 |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.envoy-group.com/md-profile.php |title=Managing Director's Profile: Abdus Salam Murshedy |website=Envoy Group |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the partners set up a small factory in the [[Khilgaon Thana]] area of Dhaka, equipped it with 46 sewing machines, and hired 200 garment workers. Initially the company sub-contracted for other garment manufacturers.&lt;ref name="ds20May2017" /&gt; They were early participants in a sector that would become a powerhouse of the Bangladesh economy,&lt;ref name="ds5Dec2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mirdha |first=Refayet Ullah |date=5 December 2014 |title=From baby steps to giant strides |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/from-baby-steps-to-giant-strides-53432 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but orders were sporadic at first, and the factory was idle for long spells. Sometimes they had to borrow from banks to meet payroll. The turning point came when they received their first order as a primary contractor, 6,500 trousers for a Swedish retailer.&lt;ref name="ds20May2017" /&gt;

The agent who placed the order was impressed with their work and directed more business their way. In the next 16 months, Envoy Group recorded a BDT 1 crore (US$385,000 in 1985) profit. They paid off their debt and bought two more garment factories, building on the experience gained running their first.&lt;ref name="ds20May2017" /&gt;

Through expansion, by attracting investment and purchasing existing businesses, Ahmed led the company as it grew over the years into a large manufacturing and exporting group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/business/envoy-textiles-raises-tk-70cr-through-commercial-papers-1205938 "Envoy Textiles raises Tk 70cr through commercial papers"].

Ahmed completed a term as President in Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), Dhaka and Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers &amp; Exporters Association (BGMEA) in 2001 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1482751.stm "Inquiry into Dhaka stampede"].

He received the "Arthakantha Business Award-2002" by a national financial fortnightly of Bangladesh.

''News from Bangladesh'' 31 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He received an outstanding achievement award from International Islamic University Chittagong in 2008.

At that time the company was employing about 20,000 people,&lt;ref name="ds5Dec2014" /&gt; and had received several awards, including the President's Export Trophy, and the National Export Trophy.  In 2015, Ahmed was named a "commercially important person" by the government of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.dhakatribune.com/business/2015/apr/28/56-individuals-get-cip-status-fy14 "56 individuals to get CIP status for FY14"].

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
The company was founded in 1969 as Demographics, Inc. by Charles D. Ward in [[Conway, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt; The company was initially involved in producing mailing lists using phone books, and payroll processing.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

In 1980, the company changed its name to Conway Communications Exchange, and in 1983 it incorporated as CCX Network, Inc. and made its first public offering. In 1988 it became Acxiom Corporation.&lt;ref name=funding&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Acxiom-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=Acxiom Corporation History |website=fundinguniverse.com |date=|accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In November 1997, Acxiom acquired Buckley Dement, a provider of healthcare fulfillment and professional medical lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmnews.com/dataanalytics/acxiom-expands-health-unit-with-horizon-acquisition/article/61650/|title=Acxiom Expands Health Unit With Horizon Acquisition |website=dmnews.com |date=1999-04-16 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998, Acxiom made the announcement that it would acquire one of its competitors, May &amp; Speh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmnews.com/acxiom-to-buy-may-speh-for-600-million/article/59262/# |title= Acxiom to Buy May &amp; Speh for $600 Million |website=dmnews.com|date=1998-05-28 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In 2003, ''Wired Magazine'' criticized the company for only accepting third party consumer opt-out requests from the [[Direct Marketing Association (United States) |Direct Marketing Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/news/2003/11/61240 | work=Wired | title=Acxiom Opts Out of Opt-Out | date=2003-11-17 | accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2004, Acxiom acquired part of Claritas, a European data provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiefmarketer.com/acxiom-acquires-claritas-europe/ |title=Acxiom Acquires Claritas Europe |website=chiefmarketer.com |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Acxiom acquired Digital Impact for $140 million and integrated its digital and online services into its business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://adage.com/article/btob/acxiom-agrees-buy-digital-impact-140-million/259977/ | work=AdAge | title=Acxiom agrees to buy Digital Impact for $140 million | date=2005-03-28 | accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Acxiom was a nominee for the [[Big Brother Awards]] for ''Worst Corporate Invader for a tradition of data brokering''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-187899 PI Announces U.S. Big Brother Awards winners for 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814003104/http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-187899 |date=August 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2006, [[EMC Corporation]] acquired Acxiom’s information grid software in a $30 million deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/emc-and-acxiom-ink-grid-computing-deal/1843094378 |title=EMC and Acxiom Ink Grid Computing Deal|website=networkcomputing.com |date=2006-01-06 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, EMC canceled the software purchase after 2 years of development because the software was not up to commercial software standards, essentially 'giving back' the grid technology software to Acxiom.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

On May 16, 2007, Acxiom agreed to be bought by investment firms [[Silver Lake Partners]] and [[ValueAct Capital]] in an all-cash deal valued at $3 billion, including the assumption of about $756 million of debt. However, in October 2007, citing poor credit markets, the companies terminated the deal. The company also announced that Chairman Charles Morgan was retiring upon the selection of a successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmnews.com/dataanalytics/silver-lake-and-valueacts-acquisition-of-acxiom-corp-falls-through/article/98622/ |title=Silver Lake and ValueAct's acquisition of Acxiom Corp falls through|website=dmnews.com|date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 17, 2008, Acxiom named John Meyer (from [[Alcatel-Lucent]]) as new CEO and president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/meyer-leaves-alcatel-lucent-to-lead-acxiom |title=Meyer leaves Alcatel-Lucent to lead Acxiom |website=fiercetelecom.com |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2008, Acxiom acquired [[ChoicePoint]]'s database marketing solutions division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dmnews.com/Acxiom-acquires-ChoicePoints-database-marketing-solutions-division/article/112350/ |title=Acxiom acquires ChoicePoint's database marketing solutions division |publisher=Direct Marketing News |author=Chantal Todé|date=2008-07-11|accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In 2010, Acxiom acquired part of [[GoDigital]], a Brazilian direct marketing and data quality company.{{cn|date=April 2018}} In October 2010, the company launched AbiliTec Digital, a web-based tool to match digital identities to traditional name and address data, such as that collected from loyalty programs.&lt;ref name=dmnews1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmnews.com/digital-marketing/acxiom-adds-digital-component-to-abilitec-data-product/article/180502/ |title=Acxiom adds digital component to AbiliTec data product |website=dmnews.com |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2011, Acxiom named Scott E. Howe, as the company’s chief executive officer and president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/33931/updated-acxiom-names-former-microsoft-exec-scott-howe-as-ceo|title=UPDATED: Acxiom Names Former Microsoft Exec Scott Howe as CEO |last=Permalink |last2=Story |first2=Email |website=Arkansas Business |language=en|accessdate=2018-05-09|last3=Story|first3=Print}}{{paywall|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, Acxiom announced the sale of its background screening business, Acxiom Information Security Services (AISS), to Sterling Infosystems, now SterlingBackcheck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/32959/company-buys-background-screening-firm-from-acxiom |title=Company Buys Background Screening Firm From Acxiom |website=arkansasbusiness.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}{{paywall|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the NY Times reported that the company had the world’s largest commercial database on consumers.&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html |title=Mapping, and Sharing, the Consumer Genome |website=nytimes.com |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[CNBC]] announced that the Federal Trade Commission was investigating Acxiom and eight other companies to learn how they collected and used consumer data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100590334|title=Facebook is Watching You...And Not Just on Facebook |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=2013-03-26 |work=CNBC|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2014, Acxiom announced that it had acquired LiveRamp, a data onboarding company, for $310 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/datadriven-marketing/acxiom-buys-liveramp-offline-online-data-capability/293212/ |title=Acxiom Acquires LiveRamp to Boost Offline-to-Online Data Capability|website=adage.com |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LiveRamp's services combined customers' CRM and loyalty program data with other available data sources, to better segment and target consumers. LiveRamp was earlier spunoff from digital data company [[Rapleaf]], and was co-founded by [[Auren Hoffman]] and several others.  Acxiom kept the business operating under the LiveRamp name, and three years later it was reportedly worth $1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/three-years-later-acxioms-acquisition-liveramp-worked/ |title=Three Years Later: Why Acxiom’s Acquisition of LiveRamp Worked|website=adexchanger.com |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the company sold its IT outsourcing division, Acxiom IT Outsourcing (Acxiom ITO), to Charlesbank Capital Partners and M/C Partners, and Acxiom ITO was subsequently rebranded as Ensono.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/300079348/acxiom-it-picks-new-name-encono-to-underscore-massive-cloud-investment.htm|title=Acxiom IT Picks New Name -- Ensono -- To Underscore Massive Cloud Investment |website=crn.com |date=2016-01-12 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, LiveRamp acquired two data and identity-matching startups, Arbor and Circulate, for more than $140 million combined.&lt;ref name=adexchanger1/&gt; The company also announced the launch of IdentityLink, a method of anonymizing consumer's identities as they are tracked across multiple platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://martechtoday.com/liveramp-launches-identitylink-publishers-201145 |title=LiveRamp launches IdentityLink for Publishers |website=martechtoday.com |date=2017-07-18 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2016, Acxiom sold its marketing automation solution, Acxiom Impact, for $50 million, to New York City-based marketing firm Zeta Interactive, now [[Zeta Global]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/zeta-interactive-acquires-acxiom-impact-for-over-50m/ |title=Zeta Interactive acquires Acxiom Impact for over $50M |website=techcrunch.com |date=2018-12-04 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2017, the company launched Audience Cloud, an anonymous targeting tool that allowed demographic segmentation of customers without revealing their actual identities.&lt;ref name=martech1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://martechtoday.com/acxiom-launches-audience-cloud-unified-generation-audience-segments-targeting-194011|title=Acxiom launches Audience Cloud for unified audience segmentation and targeting |website=martechtoday.com |date=2018-12-04 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, Acxiom announced that it was moving its headquarters back to [[Conway, Arkansas]] after selling its corporate office building in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. The building was acquired by [[Simmons Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://katv.com/news/local/acxiom-pulls-out-of-little-rock-sells-building-to-simmons-bank|title=Acxiom pulls out of Little Rock, sells building to Simmons Bank|website=katv.com|date=2017-03-10|accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, LiveRamp announced a consortium formed with two other ad tech companies, AppNexus and MediaMath, to compete with Facebook and Google in the area of programmatic advertising, the term used to refer to the use of automation software to buy advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.adweek.com/digital/these-ad-tech-players-are-teaming-up-to-challenge-facebook-and-googles-data-dominance/ |title=These Ad-Tech Players Are Teaming Up to Challenge Facebook and Google’s Data Dominance |website=adweek.com |date=2017-05-04 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Acxiom announced a reorganization from three divisions into two - a marketing services group and its LiveRamp business.&lt;ref name=adexchanger2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adexchanger.com/online-advertising/investors-perk-acxiom-announces-strategic-review-potential-asset-sale/ |title=Investors Perk Up As Acxiom Announces Strategic Review, Potential Asset Sale |website=adexchanger.com |date=2018-02-07 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the company announced international expansion into Brazil, Netherlands and Italy, and released Global Data Navigator (GDN), a portal for identifying available data elements by country.&lt;ref name=mediapost1&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/319009/acxiom-expands-its-global-data-services-adds-thre.html |title=Acxiom Expands Its Global Data Services, Adds Three Countries |website=mediapost.com |date=2018-05-09 |accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, Consumer research firm GfK MRI has partnered with Acxiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.research-live.com/article/news/gfk-mri-and-acxiom-join-forces-on-joint-data-solution/id/5039242|title=GfK MRI and Acxiom join forces on joint data solution {{!}} News|work=Research Live|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2018, advertising company [[Interpublic Group of Companies]] (IPG) announced they were buying Acxiom's Marketing Solutions (AMS) business for $USD2.3 billion. The deal reportedly did not include the LiveRamp business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/agencies/ipg-confirms-2-3-billion-deal-to-acquire-data-marketing-company-acxiom/|title=IPG Confirms $2.3 Billion Deal to Acquire Data Marketing Company Acxiom |website=adweek.com |date=2018-07-02 |accessdate=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acxiom Corporation was subsequently renamed to LiveRamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s22.q4cdn.com/928934522/files/doc_financials/annual_reports/2018/2018-Annual-Report-(Web-Ready-Version).pdf|title=Annual Report 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/article/acxiom-to-divest-ams-to-interpublic-group-for-23-billion-cm986864|title=Acxiom to Divest AMS to Interpublic Group for $2.3 Billion|date=2018-07-03|work=NASDAQ.com|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Axciom brand was transferred to IPG alongside the AMS business unit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acxiom.com/news/acxiom-marketing-solutions-joins-ipg-family-of-companies/|title=Acxiom Marketing Solutions Joins IPG Family of Companies|work=Acxiom|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products and services==
After a February 2018 reorganization, Acxiom's business was divided into two groups: Marketing Solutions and LiveRamp.&lt;ref name=adexchanger1/&gt; The Marketing Solutions business was later sold off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Marketing Solutions===

The Marketing Services segment includes tools to help clients collect and consolidate their customer data, for targeted marketing purposes, and strategy and analytics services to help identify growth opportunities. The company's InfoBase product segments consumers into demographic and socio-economic elements.  A related service, Personicx, divides the American population into composite characters for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/personicx-demographic-grouops-2014-1 |title=Here Are The Hilariously Detailed Descriptions Of The Fake Lives Advertisers Draw Up For Their Ideal Consumers |website=businessinsider.com |date=2014-01-07 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2015 book, ''Data and Goliath'', American privacy expert [[Bruce Schneier]] wrote that Acxiom sells companies lists of consumers that include "potential inheritor," "adult with senior parent," as well as addresses of households with a "diabetic focus" or "senior needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2015|isbn=978-0393244816|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's AbiliTec product tracks and manages how consumer identities vary over time and across multiple channels both online and offline.&lt;ref name=dmnews1/&gt;

The Marketing Services group also includes Audience Cloud, a tool for anonymizing prospects' identities, and creating ad campaigns to match the customers with media sites that attract their demographic; and Global Data Navigator, a portal for customers to identify available international data elements.&lt;ref name=martech1/&gt;&lt;ref name=mediapost1/&gt; 

===LiveRamp===

The company's LiveRamp group allows clients to combine customer data from various online and offline sources.  LiveRamp's product is called IdentityLink, and centers around the use of [[HTTP cookie|web cookies]] to allow web sites to remember visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://martechtoday.com/liveramps-identitylink-acts-centerpiece-new-identity-consortium-198117 |title=LiveRamp’s IdentityLink acts as centerpiece for new identity consortium |website=martechtoday.com |date=2017-05-04 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/acxiom-acquires-data-onboarding-startup-liveramp/ |title=Acxiom acquires data onboarding startup LiveRamp |website=zdnet.com |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory and security matters==

===Electronic Privacy Information Center (2003)===
In 2003, the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] filed a complaint before the [[Federal Trade Commission]] against Acxiom and [[JetBlue Airways]], alleging the companies provided consumer information to Torch Concepts, a company hired by the [[United States Army]] "to determine how information from public and private records might be analyzed to help defend military bases from attack by terrorists and other adversaries."&lt;ref name=epic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epic.org/privacy/airtravel/jetblue/ftccomplaint.html |title=EPIC Complaint Against JetBlue Airways and Acxiom Corp. to the Federal Trade Commission |website=epic.org |date=2003-09-22 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the complaint, Acxiom's activities constituted unfair and deceptive trade practices, as "Acxiom has publicly represented its belief that individuals should have notice about how information about them is used and have choices about that dissemination, and has stated that it does not permit clients to make non-public information available to individuals", yet Acxiom proceeded to sell information to Torch Concepts without obtaining consent, an ability to opt out, or furnishing notice to the affected consumers.&lt;ref name=epic/&gt;

The FTC took no action against Acxiom, which had responded that it had followed its privacy principles and was not deceptive in its business practices. "Torch Concepts was acting under contract to the Department of Defense in their efforts to research ways to improve military base security", a company spokesman said. "Our policy clearly states that we 'provide information products which include financial information, [[Social Security number]] and other related information where permitted by law,' and that this information is 'provided to government agencies for the purposes of verifying information, employment screening and assisting law enforcement.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2003-09-23-acxiom-jetblue_x.htm |title=Tech |website=usatoday.com |date=2003-09-23 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security breach (2003)===
In 2003, more than 1.6 billion customer records were stolen during the transmission of information to and from Acxiom's clients; the information included names, addresses, and e-mail addresses. Prosecutors described the 2006 case against the hacker accused of stealing the data as the "largest ever invasion and theft of personal data" ever tried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/23/acxiom_spam_hack_sentencing/ |title=Acxiom database hacker jailed for 8 years |website=theregister.co.uk |date=2006-02-23 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stolen data came to light during an investigation of a separate data theft incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/7697 |title=Chats led to Acxiom hacker bust |website=securityfocus.com |date=2006-02-23 |accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on their investigation, prosecutors said there was no risk of identity theft or harm to individuals based on the breaches. They also praised Acxiom for being aggressive in pursuing the hackers and cooperating with authorities. "The positive outcome of this investigation is testament to the strong partnerships we have established with our counterparts at the headquarters and field offices of various organizations, from the FBI and Department of Justice to the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Attorneys' Office in Little Rock", said K. C. Crowley, [[Special Agent in Charge]] of Secret Service's Little Rock Field Office. "Furthermore, I commend Acxiom Corporation for their cooperation and responsible approach to the situation. Acxiom's quick response in contacting federal investigators after determining there had been a network intrusion should serve as a model for others in similar circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/press/pub1604.pdf U.S. Secret Service news release, July 21, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916201245/http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/press/pub1604.pdf|date=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''management buyout''' ('''MBO''') is a form of acquisition where a company's existing managers acquire a large part or all of the company from either the parent company or from the private owners. Management and [[leveraged buyout]]s became phenomena of the 1980s. MBOs originated in the US and traversed the Atlantic, spreading first to the UK and throughout the rest of Europe. The [[venture capital]] industry has played a crucial role in the development of buyouts in Europe, especially in smaller deals in the UK, the Netherlands, and France.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Mike, Steve Thompson, and Ken Robbie. "Venture capital and management-led, leveraged buyouts: a European perspective." Journal of Business venturing 7.1 (1992): 47-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Management buyouts are similar in all major legal aspects to any other acquisition of a company. The particular nature of the MBO lies in the position of the buyers as managers of the company and the practical consequences that follow from that. In particular, the [[due diligence]] process is likely to be limited as the buyers already have full knowledge of the company available to them. The seller is also unlikely to give any but the most basic [[warranties]] to the management, on the basis that the management know more about the company than the sellers do and therefore the sellers should not have to warrant the state of the company. 

Some concerns about management buyouts are that the [[Information asymmetry|asymmetric information]]
possessed by management may offer them unfair advantage relative to current owners. The impending possibility of an MBO may lead to [[principal–agent problem]]s, [[moral hazard]], and perhaps even the subtle downward manipulation of the stock price prior to sale via adverse information disclosure, including accelerated and aggressive loss recognition, public launching of questionable projects, and adverse earning surprises.
Naturally, such [[corporate governance]] concerns also exist whenever current senior management is able to benefit personally from the sale of their company or its assets. This would include, for example, large parting bonuses for CEOs after a takeover or management buyout.  

Since corporate valuation is often subject to considerable uncertainty and ambiguity, and since it can be heavily influenced by asymmetric or inside information, some question the validity of MBOs and consider them to potentially represent a form of [[insider trading]].

The mere possibility of an MBO or a substantial parting bonus on sale may create [[perverse incentive]]s that can reduce the efficiency of a wide range of firms&amp;mdash;even if they remain as public companies. This represents a substantial potential [[negative externality]]. The managers of the target company may at times also set up a holding company for the purpose of purchasing the shares of the target company.

==Purpose==
Management buyouts are conducted by management teams as they want to get the financial reward for the future development of the company more directly than they would do as employees only. A management buyout can also be attractive for the seller as they can be assured that the future stand-alone company will have a dedicated management team thus providing a substantial downside protection against failure and hence negative press.{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Additionally, in the case the management buyout is supported by a private equity fund (see below), the private equity will, given that there is a dedicated management team in place, likely pay an attractive price for the asset.

==Financing==
===Debt financing===
The management of a company will not usually have the [[money]] available to buy the company outright themselves. They would first seek to borrow from a [[bank]], provided the [[bank]] was willing to accept the [[financial risk|risk]]. Management buyouts are frequently seen as too risky for a bank to finance the purchase through a loan.  Management teams are typically asked to invest an amount of capital that is significant to them personally, depending on the funding source/banks determination of the personal wealth of the management team.  The bank then loans the company the remaining portion of the amount paid to the owner.  Companies that proactively shop aggressive funding sources should qualify for total debt financing of at least four times (4X){{Citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=Is 4x a general rule of thumb? Or would this vary according to industry?.}}  [[cash flow]].

===Private equity financing===
If a bank is unwilling to lend, the management will commonly look to [[private equity]] investors to fund the majority of buyout. A high proportion of management buyouts are financed in this way. The private equity investors will invest money in return for a proportion of the [[shares]] in the company, though they may also grant a [[loan]] to the management. The exact financial structuring will depend on the backer's desire to balance the risk with its return, with [[debt]] being less risky but less profitable than [[Capital (economics)|capital]] investment.

Although the management may not have resources to buy the company, private equity houses will require that the managers each make as large an investment as they can afford in order to ensure that the management are locked in by an overwhelming vested interest in the success of the company. It is common for the management to re-mortgage their houses in order to acquire a small percentage of the company.

Private equity backers are likely to have somewhat different goals to the management. They generally aim to maximise their return and make an exit after 3&amp;ndash;5 years while minimising [[risk]] to themselves, whereas the management rarely look beyond their careers at the company and will take a long-term view.

While certain aims do coincide&amp;mdash;in particular the primary aim of [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]]&amp;mdash;certain tensions can arise. The backers will invariably impose the same [[warranties]] on the management in relation to the company that the sellers will have refused to give the management. This "[[warranty gap]]" means that the management will bear all the risk of any defects in the company that affect its value.

As a condition of their investment, the backers will also impose numerous [[contracts|terms]] on the management concerning the way that the company is run. The purpose is to ensure that the management run the company in a way that will maximise the returns during the term of the backers' investment, whereas the management might have hoped to build the company for long-term gains. Though the two aims are not always incompatible, the management may feel restricted.

The European buyout market was worth €43.9bn in 2008, a 60% fall on the €108.2bn of deals in 2007. The last time the buyout market was at this level was in 2001 when it reached just €34bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/business/cmbor/Press/23February2009.html |title=European buy-out market hits a seven year low, reports the Centre for Management Buy-out Research |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2011-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315142717/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/business/cmbor/Press/23February2009.html |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seller financing===
In certain circumstances, it may be possible for the management and the original owner of the company to agree a deal whereby the seller finances the buyout. The price paid at the time of sale will be nominal, with the real price being paid over the following years out of the profits of the company. The timescale for the payment is typically 3&amp;ndash;7 years.

This represents a disadvantage for the selling party, which must wait to receive its money after it has lost control of the company. It is also dependent, if an earn-out is used,  on the returned profits being increased significantly following the acquisition, in order for the deal to represent a gain to the seller in comparison to the situation pre-sale. This will usually only happen in very particular circumstances. The optimum structure would be to convert the earn-out to contracted deferred consideration which has compelling benefits for the seller as it legally fixes the total future amount paid to them. It's paid like a quarterly annuity, and then the seller needs to secure the annuity by taking out a deferred consideration surety guarantee from an independent surety institution. The direct beneficiary of the surety is the seller and should the sold firm become insolvent, following its sale, with any outstanding deferred payments due the seller, then the surety will pay the money to the vendor on the purchaser's behalf.  

The vendor agrees to vendor financing for tax reasons, as the [[consideration]] will be classified as capital gain rather than as income. It may also receive some other benefit such as a higher overall purchase price than would be obtained by a normal purchase.

The advantage for the management is that they do not need to become involved with private equity or a bank and will be left in control of the company once the consideration has been paid.

==Examples==
A classic example of an MBO involved [[Springfield ReManufacturing |Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation]], a former plant in [[Springfield, Missouri]] owned by [[Navistar]] (at that time, [[International Harvester]]) which was in danger of being closed or sold to outside parties until its managers purchased the company. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressreleaserocket.net/non-profit-public-sector-organizations-embrace-open-book-management-by-implementing-the-great-game-of-business/48235/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, [[New Look (store)|New Look]] was the subject of a management buyout in 2004 by [[Tom Singh]], the founder of the company who had floated it in 1998. He was backed by private equity houses [[Apax]] and [[Permira]], who now own 60% of the company. An earlier example of this in the UK was the management buyout of Virgin Interactive from [[Viacom]] which was led by [[Mark Dyne]].

The [[Virgin Group]] has undergone several management buyouts in recent years. On September 17, 2007, [[Richard Branson]] announced that the UK arm of [[Virgin Megastores]] was to be sold off as part of a management buyout, and from November 2007, will be known by a new name, [[Zavvi Entertainment Group Ltd|Zavvi]]. On September 24, 2008, another part of the Virgin group, [[Virgin Comics]] underwent a management buyout and changed its name to [[Liquid Comics]]. In the UK, [[Virgin Radio]] also underwent a similar process and became [[Absolute Radio]]''.

In Australia, another group of music and entertainment stores were subject to a management buyout in September 2009, when [[Sanity (music store)|Sanity]]'s owner and founder, [[Brett Blundy]], sold [[BB Retail Capital]]'s Entertainment Division (including Sanity, and the Australian franchises of [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin Entertainment]] and [[HMV]]) to the company's Head of Entertainment, Ray Itaoui. This was for an undisclosed sum, leaving [[Sanity Entertainment]] to become a private company in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/news/e3i1224fdfbab2618f30d2dc43dba2b7464|title=Australia's Sanity In Management Buyout|first=Lars|last=Brandle|work=Billboard|date=24 September 2009|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realestatesource.com.au/sanity-entertainment-owner-of-virgin-hmv-sells-to-management-team-for-undisclosed-sum.html|title=Sanity Entertainment, owner of Virgin, HMV, sells to management team for undisclosed sum|first=Marc|last=Pallisco|work=RealEstateSource.com.au|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]] is a [[Stealth game|stealth]] video game series [[video game developer|developed]] by the [[Denmark|Danish]] company [[IO Interactive]]. Previously published by [[Eidos Interactive]] and [[Square Enix]]. IO Interactive remained a subsidiary of Square Enix until 2017, when Square Enix started seeking sellers for the studio, IO Interactive completed a management buyout, regaining their independent status and retaining the rights for ''Hitman'', in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/16/e3-2017-io-interactive-officially-goes-indie-gains-full-rights-to-hitman-ip|title=E3 2017: IO Interactive Officially Goes Indie, Gains Full Rights to Hitman IP|first=Alex|last=Osborn|date=16 June 2017|website=ign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National League of American Pen Women''', Inc. (NLAPW) is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) membership organization for women.

==History==
The first meeting of The League of American Pen Women was organized in 1897 by [[Marian Longfellow O'Donoghue]], a writer for newspapers in Washington D.C. and Boston. Together with [[Margaret Sullivan Burke]] and [[Anna Sanborn Hamilton]] they established a "progressive press union" for the women writers of Washington.
&lt;ref name="Rise" /&gt;

Seventeen women joined them at first, professional credentials were required for membership and the ladies determined that Pen Women should always be paid for their work. By September 1898, members were over fifty members "from Maine to Texas, from New York to California."
&lt;ref name="Rise" /&gt;

In 1921 the association became The National League of American Pen Women with thirty-five local branches in various states. 
&lt;ref name="Rise" /&gt;

The League's headquarters are located in the historic Pen Arts Building and Art Museum in the DuPont Circle area of Washington.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6343">{{about |the managerial practice of leaving office door open|the economic policy in China|Open Door Policy}}
An '''open door policy''' (as related to the [[business]] and [[corporate]] fields) is a communication policy in which a [[manager]], [[CEO]], MD, president or supervisor leaves their [[office]] door "open" in order to encourage openness and transparency with the employees of that company. As the term implies, employees are encouraged to stop by whenever they feel the need to meet and ask questions, discuss suggestions, and address problems or concerns with management. An open door policy is typically intended to foster an environment of [[collaboration]], high performance, and mutual respect between upper management and employees. 

{{quote|An open door policy means, literally, that every manager's door is open to every employee. The purpose of an open door policy is to encourage open communication, feedback, and discussion about any matter of importance to an employee.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.thebalance.com/open-door-policy-1918203 What Does an Open Door Policy at Work Mean?] - The Balance&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Benefits ==
Open door policies exist to encourage employees to offer suggestions and ideas, provide or solicit feedback, seek personal or professional counsel, or address concerns within the company. The policy establishes an environment of trust and mutual respect between the employer and employee. The practice is viewed as a [[morale]] booster by letting employees feel as if they are able to openly speak with their employer about issues face-to-face, rather than through [[e-mail]] or [[voicemail]]. In essence, an open door policy serves to empower employees, knowing that their voice is heard and issues are quickly addressed and resolved.&lt;ref name=hp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/diversity/open-door.html |title=HP Diversity: Open Door Policy |publisher=Hp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-11-30/business/bs-twp-infotek-corp-20111204_1_employee-benefits-open-door-policy-infotek |title=Baltimore's Top Workplaces: InfoTeK Corp.: Open-door policy - Baltimore Sun |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust in the company tends to improve and grow, when employees understand that they are welcome to confide in senior management, when immediate supervisors are unavailable.&lt;ref name=sba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/open-door-policy-business-143.html |title=Open Door Policy in Business &amp;#124; Small Business - Chron.com |publisher=Smallbusiness.chron.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
While open door policies intend to encourage and instill a sense of transparency and openness, some employees hesitate to speak their mind or be honest, for fear of intimidation, criticism, and censure. Management personnel may tend to communicate the willingness to hear suggestions, while belittling the suggestions when unaccompanied by solutions. 

Open door policies have also been seen as a way for companies to discourage the formation of [[labor unions]]. Formal, written policies may encourage openness, however, the response received in attempts to engage are often seen as threats to the authority or management style of the individual working in a supervisory or management capacity.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-44440188/is-your-open-door-policy-silencing-your-staff/ |title=Is Your 'Open Door' Policy Silencing Your Staff? |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, in essence, allows employees to forgo meeting with their immediate supervisors, choosing rather to engage in communication with their senior managers to discuss their employment or personal issues. 

A process of open communication and transparency allows employees to bypass their supervisors to engage with senior management. This may inadvertently lead to tension and strife between employees and middle management. Supervisors may either see this as an implication that they are the primary issue of concern, or they may feel threatened, suspecting the employee of undermining him in an attempt to cause problems between him and senior management.&lt;ref name=sba/&gt;

== Other uses ==
In other examples, commonly in college dorms,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} an open door policy means everyone's door must remain open. The idea remains the same, that having the door(s) open will make for a more comfortable and social school or work environment. 

Government officials at the local, state, and federal level often implement an open door policy for the purpose of meeting with constituents. In Salt Lake City, mayor [[Ralph Becker (mayor)|Ralph Becker]] maintains an open door policy every Wednesday to meet with residents one-on-one to discuss issues, concerns, and suggestions involving the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/event-108072-open-door-meetings-w.html |title=Open Door Meetings with Mayor Ralph Becker at City &amp; County Building |publisher=Cityweekly.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Caucus of Orange County, New York has maintained an open door policy for over ten years, where all individuals, regardless of political affiliation are welcome to attend the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120121/OPINION/201210303/-1/SITEMAP&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, in an effort to introduce a more open and transparent government, Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] of New York extended an open door policy to members of the public. A lottery was introduced that allowed for 300 New Yorkers to visit [[Gracie Mansion]] following the inaugural festivities. The following week, for the first time in the history of the State of New York, a lottery was held to open the State of the State Address to additional members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/131531/cuomo-extends-open-door-policy-to-governor-s-mansion/ |title=Cuomo Extends Open Door Policy To Governor's Mansion |publisher=NY1.com |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pendulum arbitration''', otherwise known as final offer arbitration (or "FOA"), is a type of [[interest arbitration]] in which the [[arbitrator]] chooses one of the parties' proposals on each (or perhaps all) disputed issues. For example, in the case of [[labor union|labor]] [[collective bargaining]], a trade union may demand a wage increase of 7% and the management may offer 3%. The arbitrator's decision has to choose between awarding a 3% or a 7% increase. This procedure is opposed to conventional interest arbitration, in which the parties present evidence and the arbitrator acts as fact-finder and crafts an award. In disputes over labor contracts, this [[dispute resolution]] procedure is known to be a common type of [[contract arbitration]]. Perhaps the most well-known instance is [[Major_League_Baseball_transactions#Free_agency_and_salary_arbitration|salary arbitration]] in [[Major League Baseball]], where a certain class of players may elect to arbitrate their salary instead of accepting their team's salary offer. Final-offer arbitration is widely used to determine public union contracts in the United States, either as a substitute for collective bargaining or as a mechanism to determine the contract when bargaining has failed. 

A primary purpose and effect of FOA is to encourage the parties to arrive at a settlement by introducing uncertainty into the arbitration procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dir.ca.gov/chswc/BasebalArbFfinal.htm California Department of Labor Relations, Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation: literature review – Final Offer Arbitration]&lt;/ref&gt; Parties who fail to compromise during negotiations risk a total loss on some or all arbitrated issues under FOA. This uncertainty is considered a "cost" of arbitration that the parties can avoid by settling. By contrast, in conventional arbitration, parties are more likely to call on the arbitrator to decide disputed issues, giving the arbitrator the power to craft a "reasonable" award. In addition to promoting settlement, use of FOA leads parties to adopt reasonable positions during the arbitration, because an unreasonable position will almost certainly be rejected in favor of a more reasonable competing proposal. 

== Pendulum arbitration outside the U.S. ==

Chile's Secretary of Labor and Social Security [[José Piñera]] pioneered the introduction in a national law utilizing this mechanism. In fact, Chile's 1979 Labor Reform mandates pendulum arbitration for special collective bargaining cases. The Chilean law also required the parties to pay the full cost of the arbitrator, another incentive to try to avoid the arbitration and reach bilateral agreements. The law created a register of private arbitrators (economists and lawyers with a solid reputation for expertise and fairness), some or all of whom the parties shall agree to select, to decide conclusively the terms of the contract. There is consensus among experts that this system in Chile has proved very successful, and it has not been disturbed by subsequent governments.{{fact|date=August 2016}}

The "'''worm'''" is a [[market research]] analysis tool developed by [[Roy Morgan Research]] (who called it "The Reactor"), with the purpose of gauging an audience's reaction to some visual stimuli over some time period. The name "worm" describes its visual appearance – as a line graph snaking up or down.

Each member of the audience firstly fills out a questionnaire, used to describe the composition of the audience. Then, each member is given a control device (such as a dial or keypad) with which they select their feelings towards the vision or stimuli (for example, whether they regard the comments currently being made by a speaker favourably or unfavourably). This dial is checked centrally three times per second, and as the audience reacts differently over time, the collective feelings of the audience are gathered.

The "worm" has been used in [[television|televised]] [[debate]]s for [[Australian federal election]]s, including those between then Australian prime minister [[John Howard]] and then-leader of the opposition [[Kevin Rudd]] in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the first UK general election debate on 15 April 2010 between Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Conservative leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]], "the worm" was used in certain segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPlmnO9mRl8|title=The First Election Debate: Immigration – The Worm|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in March 2011 suggests that the worm may influence voters.&lt;ref name=distortion&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0018154 | title = Social Influence in Televised Election Debates: A Potential Distortion of Democracy | first =Colin J. | last = Davis  | first2 =Jeffrey S. | last2 = Bowers  | first3 =Amina | last3 = Memon  |date = 30 March 2011 | accessdate = 1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, the worm has been controversially credited with increasing the support for [[United Future]] leader [[Peter Dunne]] in the 2002 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10747425|title=Worm returns for leaders' debate|first=John|last=Drinnan|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
