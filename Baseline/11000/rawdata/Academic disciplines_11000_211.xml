      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1575">An '''active chromatin sequence''' (ACS) is a region of [[DNA]] in a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[chromosome]] in which [[histone]] modifications such as [[acetylation]] lead to exposure of the [[DNA sequence]] thus allowing binding of [[transcription factors]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] to take place. Active chromatin may also be called [[euchromatin]]. ACSs may occur in non-expressed gene regions which are assumed to be "poised" for [[gene transcription|transcription]]. The sequence once exposed often contains a promoter to began transcription. At this site [[acetylation]] or [[methylation]] can take place causing a conformational change to the chromatin. At the active chromatin sequence site deacetylation can caused the gene to be repressed if not being expressed.

In [[linguistics]], an '''alphaphonetic pronunciation''' is the pronunciation of an [[alphabet]]ical glyph ("[[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]") with the canonical pronunciation employed in learning the alphabet, rather than in accord with other [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] variants. It is a concept within [[phonemic orthography]], particularly with the pronunciation of [[vowel]]s, in which the alphabetic pronunciation of a letter name is taken as a default and employed in the pronunciation of particular [[word]]s spelled with that letter. [[Phonological change]] may be constrained by the influence of canonical [[alphabet#Pronunciation|alphabet pronunciation]].

== Overview ==
In languages such as [[English language|English]] in which many words have several [[morphophonemic]] variants, the pronunciation of the letters of the alphabet influences an invariant "alphaphonemic pronunciation" of words. The concept is less relevant to languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in which the phonemic orthographies are always alphaphonemic, and thus no distinctions are relevant. The latter type of languages may be said to have "good" or "1:1" grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence.

For example, the letter "a," in English alphaphonemic pronunciation, is pronounced {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} and not {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} as in [[Latin]]-based languages. 
Hence a word like "[[amen]]," which in its original Latin alphaphonemic pronunciation is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} ("ah-men"), in English it is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} ("A-men"). In both American and British English, the English alphaphonemic pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} is colloquially (if not formally) dominant, while the {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} pronunciation is typically regarded as "Latin" or "Latinized" (which, in context of Protestantism, may carry a certain negative connotation of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] culture and influence).

The English alphaphonemic pronunciation of many words can be confusing to non-English speakers. The letter "i" in English words like "light" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|t}}, "bicycle" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|s|ᵻ|k|əl}}, "triad" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|.|æ|d}}, "final" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|aɪ|n|əl}}, and "spike" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|aɪ|k}} are all pronounced alphaphonemically, and thus differ particularly from other orthographies. (The historic basis for this is in the [[Great Vowel Shift]].) For example, with Latin-based language speakers, a Latin-based pronunciation of "i" is constant, and considers "i" to always indicate {{IPAc-en|ɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|iː}}. In Latin orthography, the English alphaphonemic "I" {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is spelled "ai," not "i," thus the Latin orthographic transcription of English pronunciations would be close the IPA examples above, while their native pronunciations of these English words would unintelligible (variations from English [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], etc. isolated in [brackets],): "light" {{IPA|/ˈliː[x]t/}}, "bicycle" {{IPA|/ˈbiːsikl[ɛ]/}}, "triad" {{IPA|/ˈtriː[aː]d/}}, "final" {{IPA|/ˈfiːn[aː]l/}}, and "spike" {{IPA|/ˈspiːk[ɛ]/}}.

As these examples show, because English alphaphonemics deviate significantly from Latinate pronunciations, the correspondence of English word spellings with their correct English pronunciations are not intuitively obvious to a learner.

The '''American Innovation and Competitiveness Act''' ("'''AICA'''") is a [[United States federal law]] enacted in 2017.

The act updated instructions to the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) to conduct and support research on [[cybersecurity]] and [[cryptography]].  It created a Director of Security at NIST.  It revised the program requirements on the [[Networking and Information Technology Research and Development]] program which coordinates advanced computer research across U.S. government agencies.  It assigned to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] a responsibility to create an interagency working group to reduce administrative burdens on federally-funded researchers.&lt;ref name=conggov/&gt;

The act authorizes creation of an interagency advisory panel and working groups to consider education for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.&lt;ref name=conggov/&gt;

The act supports the coordination of [[citizen science]] and [[crowdsourcing]] by [[Government agency#Government agencies in the United States|Federal agencies]] to accomplish their missions.&lt;ref name=conggov&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3084 S.3084 - American Innovation and Competitiveness Act] on congress.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arborloo-en.svg|thumb|Steps of usage of the arborloo.]]
[[File:Arborloo (5567538554).jpg|thumb|Arborloo in [[Ekwendeni]], [[Malawi]]]]
An '''arborloo''' is a simple type of [[composting toilet]] in which [[feces]] are collected in a shallow pit and a [[Fruit tree|fruiting tree]] is later planted in the fertile soil of the full pit. Arborloos have a pit like a [[pit latrine]] but less deep, a concrete slab, superstructure (toilet house or [[outhouse]]) to provide privacy and possibly a ring beam to protect the pit from collapsing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecosanres.org/toilets_that_make_compost.htm|title=Toilets That Make Compost|website=www.ecosanres.org|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arborloo works by temporarily putting the slab and superstructure above a shallow pit while this pit fills. When the pit is nearly full, the superstructure and slab is moved to a newly dug pit and the old pit is covered with the earth got by digging the new pit and left to compost. The old pit serves as a bed for a fruit tree or some other useful vegetation, which is preferably planted during the rainy season.&lt;ref name="Morgan 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Peter|title=Toilets that make compost: Low-cost, sanitary toilets that produce valuable compost for crops in an African context|year=2007|publisher=EcoSanRes Programme|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-9-197-60222-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arborloo is a type of [[dry toilet]]. In using the nutrient-rich soil of a retired pit, the arborloo, in effect, treats feces as a resource rather than a waste product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecological Sanitation|last=Winblad|first=Uno (et al.)|publisher=Ecosanres Program of the Stockholm Environment Institute|year=2004|isbn=|location=http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/Ecological_Sanitation_2004.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production. 35p|last=Jönsson et al.|first=|publisher=Ecosanres Program of the Stockholm Environment Institute|year=2004|isbn=|location=http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/ESR_Publications_2004/ESR2web.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arborloos are used in rural areas of many [[developing countries]], for example in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Design==
The defecation pit may be circular or square and this may depend on the slab and superstructure. A circular pit is less likely to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=WEDC|title=An engineer's guide to latrine slabs|year=2012|publisher=WEDC|location=Loughborough University|isbn=978 1 84380 143 6|page=4|url=http://wedc.lboro.ac.uk/resources/booklets/BK005_LTS_A5_Pages.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pit of the arborloo is shallow (between 1-1.5 meter).&lt;ref name="Morgan 2007"/&gt;
[[File:Slab mounted over pit with ring beam (5372370329).jpg|thumb|A [[Squat toilet|squat slab]] covering the drop hole of an Arborloo in Malawi. The slab can be rolled from one location to the next.]]

Biotextiles include implantible devices such as [[surgical suture]]s, [[hernia]] repair fabrics, [[artery|arterial]] [[Medical grafting|grafts]], [[artificial skin]] and parts of [[artificial heart]]s.  They were first created 30 years ago by Dr. Martin W. King, a professor in [[North Carolina State University]]’s College of Textiles[http://www.tx.ncsu.edu/faculty_center/directory/detail.cfm?id=63]. 

'''Medical textiles''' are a broader group which also includes bandages, wound dressings, hospital linen, preventive clothing etc.  [[Antiseptic]] biotextiles are textiles used in fighting against [[cutaneous]] [[bacteria]]l proliferation.  [[Zeolite]] and [[triclosan]] are at the present time the most used molecules.  This original property allows to fightinhibits the development of odours or bacterial proliferation in the diabetic foot.

== New developments ==

In the new paradigm of [[tissue engineering]], professionals are trying to develop new textiles so that the body can form new tissue around these devices so it’s not relying solely on synthetic foreign implanted material.  Graduate student Jessica Gluck has demonstrated that viable and functioning liver cells can be grown on textile scaffolds [http://www.physorg.com/news96302396.html].

==History==
Bird Technologies was created with the merger of two RF communications companies, Bird Electronic Corporation and TX RX Systems. The merged company was formed in 1995 but its timeline began in 1942 when J. Raymond "Ray" Bird teamed up with a college friend to form the Bird Engineering Company in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  The company began operating as a "job shop," which then led Ray Bird to develop a line of products for measuring the power generated by television and radio transmitters.  During his career, Ray Bird has been awarded 40 patents.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The Bird Engineering Company later changed its name to the Bird Electronic Corporation.

TX RX Systems, located in Angola, New York was founded in 1976 by Dan Kaegebein and Elliot Johnson. 
One of TX RX Systems most successful product lines are RF Signal Boosters. In response to a requirement by [[Motorola]] Communications in 1978, TX RX Systems manufactured the first UHF two-way repeater amplifiers in an [[Inland Steel Company|Inland Steel Corporation]] coal mine in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| title =Repeater Amplifier Systems -- Principles and Applications| url =http://www.rfglobalnet.com/article.mvc/Repeater-Amplifier-Systems-Principles-and-App-0001| accessdate =20 March 2005| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080929202444/http://www.rfglobalnet.com/article.mvc/Repeater-Amplifier-Systems-Principles-and-App-0001| archivedate =29 September 2008| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bird acquired X-COM Systems located near [[Washington D.C.]] in [[Reston, Virginia]]. X-COM Systems was founded in 1994 by David Erisman as a technology firm specializing in the design and manufacture of digital communication hardware and software for military and commercial applications. The company's equipment is primarily used by the [[US Navy]] to support shore-based systems that are used for the development and training on [[Naval Tactical Data System]] (NTDS) equipment. Much of X-COM's equipment is used by the Navy in its land-based test and development sites which support the Cruisers and Destroyers that contain the [[Aegis Combat System|AEGIS Combat System]], considered to have the most advanced tracking and combat system in the world. These land-based sites often have multiple missions that include NTDS systems testing, systems development, and training personnel for the Fleet.

X-COM is the holder of multiple technical patents including '''Time-Shift Keying''' and other related technologies. TSK is a physical layer advancement that significantly improves bandwidth efficiency, noise immunity, and power consumption. TSK-based products provide low-cost solutions for communication links including twisted pair, microwave, satellite and RF.

Bird acquired DeltaNode from Scandinavian Health Ltd. (SHL Group) in September 2013. DeltaNode, located in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] was founded in 2005 by a group of engineers and established a strong presence in Eurpoe, the United States and Canada as a supplier of RF-over-fiber distributed antenna systems and repeaters designed to enhance the coverage of commercial wireless and public safety communication systems.

In January 2017, Bird Technologies consolidated it's group of acquired companies and products under the '''Bird''' brand.

Bird's Radio Frequency Products Division (RFIP), ''(formerly known as TX RX Systems)'',  was acquired by the Combilent Group on August 31, 2018 and operates under the name TX RX Systems, Inc from their US headquarters in Angola, New York. Bird has retained it's RF Signal Booster and Distributed Antenna System product lines.

==Model 43 Thruline Directional Wattmeter==
[[File:Bird 43 RF power meter.jpg|thumb|120px|Bird Model 43 Wattmeter]]
The Bird '''Model 43''' Thruline Wattmeter was created in the early 1950s. The self-contained instrument used microwatts of energy from the transmission it measured. Its reference line section made it economical and provided built-in reference accuracy that remained consistent with age. The patent was granted for the Directional Wattmeter in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | inventor1-last = Bird | inventor1-first = James R. | inventor2-last = Calderhead | inventor2-first = Henery J. | inventor3-last = Heller | inventor3-first = Herbert H. | title = Directional Wattmeter | issue-date = 1958 | patent-number = 2852741 | country-code = US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s the [[mobile radio]] had the majority of its components stored in the trunk of a car and was comparable in size to a microwave oven. A Model 43 wattmeter was used to test the power output of the two-way mobile radio transmitter and to match it to an antenna most commonly mounted on the trunk. The transmission line to the antenna was very short providing easy access to the equipment which in turn made measuring the equipment convenient. Additionally, the same wattmeter was used to measure the RF power in the operational base station.

In the 1970s, the mobile radio had advanced from the trunk of the car to the car's front interior. The Model 43 was still used in the same capacity of testing the RF output and matching the transmitter to the antenna. However, the new interior position of the mobile radio, and the existing rear antenna position required a longer transmission line. This still provided easy access to test and measure the system.

The Model 43 was also used in the aviation industry to accomplish identical results. Measure the power from the transmitter and match the antenna to the system.

== RF Signal Boosters==
'''Signal Boosters''' are also known as Two-Way Repeater Amplifiers, [[Bi-directional amplifier|Bi-Directional Amplifiers]] (BDA), RF Reperaters.

The Bird Signal Booster lineup consist of the 700/800&amp;nbsp;MHz '''Signal Booster I''', performance and value series, '''Signal Booster II''' series which provides in-building coverage in basements, parking garages, correctional facilities, courthouses, hospitals and malls, subways, rapid transit systems, airports, stadiums/arenas, high-rise buildings, large private enterprise facilities, schools and campuses. '''Channelized and Digital Signal Booster III''' series,  offering user programmable center frequencies and filter characteristics and intuitive user interfaces and the '''RescueLine Signal Booster''', designed to comply with the new International Fire Code and [[National Fire Protection Association]] standards. The objective of this series is to ensure that first responders have reliable radio communications in large structures.

==Spectro-X, RF Signal Editor Software Applications and IQC5000 Series, Spectrum Capture and Playback System==

Bird's Spectro-X, Signal Analysis Toolkit graphically displays I &amp; Q sample files and provides menu-driven signal search and analysis tools. The software lets users visualize and analyze up to four recorded RF and microwave spectrum files at the same time making it a valuable tool for system and test engineers developing and analyzing the performance of radar, ELINT, [[SIGINT]], [[Electronic countermeasure|ECM]], [[Electronic Surveillance Measures|ESM]], multi-channel communications, [[telemetry]], and [[MIMO]] systems, or for characterizing and testing conventional and [[Active electronically scanned array|AESA]] radar systems.

Spectro-X is compatible with Bird's RF Signal Editor software and IQC5000 Series, Spectrum Capture and Playback System. The RF Editor, Graphical Signal Editing software lets users modify signal data, insert new spectra and waveforms, modify spectrum in the frequency domain, and move any waveform or slice of spectrum anywhere among 10 tracks in the recording. The IQC5000 Series, Spectrum and Playback System can record and play back one or two independent channels of signal activity up to 160&amp;nbsp;MHz in bandwidth from HF through millimeter wavelengths.

This time, Barbas dedicated to develop the next generation of drugs with the help of the antibodies invented in his researches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== Research ==
He developed the first laboratory manual of antibody phage with his colleagues at TSRI. The phage display is the most straight-forward technique to study the interactions between various forms of proteins with the virus infected bacteria. With the help of this technique, more studies on operations on specific part of human genes are available.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He created ZF Tools with Jeff Mandell at TSRI. The [[zinc finger proteins]] (ZFPs) can target on the specific zones in [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]] which helps the researchers to identify the particular sites in any DNA sequence efficiently with ZF Tools.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;He created the first commercially catalytic antibodies in the world. Catalytic antibody are capable of accomplishing the tasks that have been designed by the researchers in the body, which helps the researchers to understand the mechanisms of the particular zone in human body in order to develop new drugs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Barbas and his co-workers at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] (TSRI) invented antibody-drug conjugates to help create new therapies which can target on specific cell types.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These antibodies are programmed with chemical methods and specialized in treatments of chronic illnesses due to its ability to target on particular sites accurately.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;He studied on [[Hajos–Parrish–Eder–Sauer–Wiechert reaction|Hajos-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction]] and developed theories on [[organocatalysis]] based on the studies of aldolase antibodies with [[L-Proline]]. He found the similarity between the Hajos-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction and the mechanical canalization function happened in the aldolase antibodies and research on the difference between the efficiency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;After researching the nucleic acid libraries, he emphasize on the functions of [[nucleotide triphosphates]] and came up with the idea of the creating the DNA enzymes which can provide vitro DNA selection studies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;He also developed new therapies that can target HIV-1 and some kinds of cancer and put them in&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;to clinical trails.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scripps.edu/barbas/research.html|title=The Barbas Laboratory Research|website=www.scripps.edu|access-date=2018-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228160331/http://www.scripps.edu/barbas/research.html|archive-date=2018-02-28|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
From 1992 to 1995, Barbas won the Scholar of The American Foundation for AIDS Research.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Since 2003, Barbas is an ISI Highly Cited Reseach.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In 2009, Barbas has been honored with numerous awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9178">'''Cognitive ergonomics''', defined by the [[International Ergonomics Association]] "is concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system. The relevant topics include mental workload, decision-making, skilled performance, [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], human reliability, work stress and training as these may relate to human-system design."&lt;ref name="IEA website"&gt;[http://www.iea.cc/whats/index.html What is Ergonomics?] International Ergonomics Association&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive ergonomics studies cognition in work and operational settings, in order to optimize human well-being and system performance.  It is a subset of the larger field of [[human factors and ergonomics]].

== Goals ==
Cognitive ergonomics (sometimes known as [[cognitive engineering]] though this was an earlier field) is an emerging branch of [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]] which places particular emphasis on the analysis of [[cognitive]] processes required of operators in modern industries and similar milieus.   Examples include diagnosis, workload, situation awareness, [[decision making]], and planning. Cognitive ergonomics aims at enhancing performance of cognitive tasks by means of several interventions, including these:
*user-centered design of human-machine interaction and [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI);
*design of information technology systems that support cognitive tasks (e.g., cognitive artifacts);
*development of training programs;
*work redesign to manage [[cognitive workload]] and increase [[human reliability]].

== History ==
The field of cognitive ergonomics emerged predominantly in the 70's with the advent of the personal computer and new developments in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. CE contrasts the tradition of physical ergonomics because "cognitive ergonomics is...the application of [[psychology]] to work...to achieve the optimization between people and their work."&lt;ref name="Long 2000"&gt;{{cite news |title= Cognitive ergonomics - past, present, future: 10 lessons learned (10 lessons remaining) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society ... Annual Meeting |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/235419773/ |newspaper= human factors and ergonomics society |date= June 6, 2010 |accessdate= November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed as an applied science, the methods involved with creating cognitive ergonomic design have changed with the rapid development in technological advances over the last 27 years. In the 80's, there was a worldwide transition in the methodological approach to design. According to van der Veer, [[Enid Mumford]] was one of the pioneers of [[interactive systems engineering]], and advocated the notion of user-centered design, wherein the user is considered and "included in all phases of the design".&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=van der veer GC |title= Cognitive Ergonomics in Interface Design – Discussion of a Moving Science |journal= journal of universal computer science |volume=14 |issue=16 |pages=2614–2629 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different models which describe the criteria for designing user-friendly technology. A number of models focus on a systematic process for design, using [[task analysis]] to evaluate the cognitive processes involved with a given task and develop adequate interface capabilities. Task analysis in past research has focused on the evaluation of cognitive task demands, concerning motor control and cognition during visual tasks such as operating machinery, or the evaluation of [[attention]] and focus via the analysis of eye saccades of pilots when flying.&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008" /&gt;  [[Neuroergonomics]], a subfield of cognitive ergonomics, aims to enhance [[human-computer interaction]] by using neural correlates to better understand situational task demands. Neuroergonomic research at the university of Iowa has been involved with assessing safe-driving protocol,  enhancing elderly mobility, and analyzing cognitive abilities involved with the navigation of abstract virtual environments."&lt;ref name="IDNU"&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/~neuroerg/research.html Division of Neuroergonomics] University of Iowa Division of Neuroscience&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Successful, [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic]] intervention in the area of cognitive tasks requires [[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment|a thorough understanding not only of the demands of the work situation]], but also of user strategies in performing cognitive tasks and of limitations in human cognition. In some cases, the artifacts or tools used to carry out a task may impose their own constraints and limitations (e.g., navigating through a large number of GUI screens). Tools may also co-determine the very nature of the task.&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008" /&gt; In this sense, the analysis of cognitive tasks should examine both the interaction of users with their work setting  and the user interaction with artifacts or tools; the latter is very important as modern artifacts (e.g., control panels, software, expert systems) become increasingly sophisticated. Emphasis lies on how to design human-machine interfaces and cognitive artifacts so that human performance is sustained in work environments where information may be unreliable, events may be difficult to predict, multiple simultaneous goals may be in conflict, and performance may be time constrained.&lt;ref name= "Lee 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lee JD |title= Emerging challenges in cognitive ergonomics: managing swarms of self-organizing agent-based automation |journal= Theoretical Issues in ergonomic science |volume= 2 |issue= 3 |pages= 238–250 |year= 2001 |doi=10.1080/14639220110104925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive task analysis ===
{{See also|Task analysis}}
''Cognitive task analysis'' is a general term for the set of methods used to identify the mental demands and cognitive skills needed to complete a task.&lt;ref name="Militello et al. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hutton RJB, Militello LG |title= applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA): a practitioner’s toolkit for understanding cognitive task demands |journal= Ergonomics |volume= 41|issue= 11 |pages= 1618–1641 |year= 1998 |doi=10.1080/001401398186108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks like [[GOMS]] provide a formal set of methods for identifying the mental activities required by a task and an artifact, such as a desktop computer system. By identifying the sequence of mental activities of a user engaged in a task, cognitive ergonomics engineers can identify bottlenecks and critical paths that may present opportunities for improvement or risks (such as [[human error]]) that merit changes in training or system behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, K. M., Helton, W. S., &amp; Wiggins, M. W. (2013). Cognitive engineering. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science, 4(1), 17-31.{{DOI|10.1002/wcs.1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
As a design philosophy, cognitive ergonomics can be applied to any area where humans interact with technology. Applications include aviation (e.g., cockpit layouts),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baxter|first1=Gordon|last2=Besnard|first2=Denis|last3=Riley|first3=Dominic|title=Cognitive mismatches in the cockpit: Will they ever be a thing of the past?|journal=Applied Ergonomics|date=July 2007|volume=38|issue=4|pages=417-423|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2007.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; transportation (e.g., collision avoidance), the health care system (e.g., drug bottle labelling), mobile devices, appliance interface design, product design, and nuclear power plants.

'''Computational epidemiology''' is a multidisciplinary field that uses techniques from [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[geographic information science]] and [[public health]] to better understand issues central to [[epidemiology]] such as the spread of diseases or the effectiveness of a public health intervention.

==Introduction==
In contrast with traditional [[epidemiology]], computational epidemiology looks for patterns in unstructured sources of data, such as social media. It can be thought of as the hypothesis-generating antecedent to hypothesis-testing methods such as national surveys and randomized controlled trials.
A mathematical model is developed which describes the observed behavior of the viruses, based on the available data. Then simulations of the model are performed to understand the possible outcomes given the model used. These simulations produce as results projections which can then be used to make predictions or verify the facts and then be used to plan interventions and meters towards the control of the disease's spread.

'''Cytotaxonomy''' is the branch of biology dealing with the relationships and classification of organisms using comparative studies of chromosomes during meiosis.

==Description==
Cytotaxonomy is branch of taxonomy,which uses the characteristics of cellular structures,such as somatic chromosome to classify organism.Improvement in the cytological techniques permit chromosomal studies.The Study of primate chromosome is another very active field,which provide very much information on relationships(chiarelli,1996).
The number, structure, and behaviour of chromosomes is of great value in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], with [[chromosome number]] being the most widely used and quoted character. Chromosome numbers are usually determined at [[mitosis]] and quoted as the [[diploid]] number (2n), unless dealing with a [[polyploid]] series in which case the base number or number of chromosomes in the genome of the original haploid is quoted. Another useful taxonomic character is the position of the [[centromere]]. [[Meiotic]] behaviour may show the [[heterozygosity]] of inversions. This may be constant for a taxon, offering further taxonomic evidence. Cytological data is regarded as having more significance than other taxonomic evidence.

The '''Economics Education and Research Consortium''' (EERC) is an organization founded with the purpose of improving economics education and research within the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Established in [[Kiev]] in 1995, the organization supports policy-research, training, workshops and research infrastructure as part of the wider [[Global Development Network]]'s operations in post-Soviet states. The work of the EERC is supported by a panel of international donor organizations that joined forces in 1995 to modernize [[economics education]] and research in the CIS. The members of the Consortium are: the [[Eurasia Foundation]], [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], [[Government of Finland]], [[Global Development Network]], [[Interpipe Group]], [[Open Society Institute]], [[Government of Sweden]], and the [[World Bank]]. Support for EERC has also been provided by the [[Citigroup]] Foundation, [[ING Bank]] Ukraine, Industrial Union of Donbas, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, Kraft Foods Ukraina, the Kytasty Foundation, National Bank of Ukraine, [[Tetra Pak]] Ukraine, the Pew Charitable Trusts, Slavutich, Soyuz-Victan, and Swedbank (previously TAS-Kommerzbank). The EERC's mission is also supported by a range of corporate sponsors, such as  AcadEx Ltd., [[Coca-Cola]] Beverages Ukraine, Eastern Economist, [[Kraft Foods]] Ukraina, JSC Obolon, Orfey Publications, [[Oriflame]] Ukraine, Robert [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] Ukraine, Sun Interbrew, System Integration (SI) [[IBM]] partner, [[US Embassy]] to Ukraine.

The Consortium has two distinct programs - one in [[Ukraine]] and the other in [[Russia]]. In Ukraine at the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], the EERC has established the two-year English-language master’s program in [[economics]] that produces Ukrainian economist trained in modern market economics. The intent is to position these economists as future leaders in Ukraine’s economic policy circles through post-[[Master of Arts|MA]] careers in public service, research institute, or private sector positions, or through completing [[PhD]]s abroad and returning to Ukraine to teach. Having achieved initial success in its teaching program, the longer-term aim of the EERC is to create a local centre for academic excellence in economics. By enabling graduates with Western training to return to Ukraine to teach and conduct research, EERC hopes to encourage the development of a dynamic economics community in Ukraine.

In Russia, the mission has been established to encourage the application of modern economics theory to policy analysis and to facilitate the creation of an economic policy community in Russia and elsewhere in the CIS, EERC operates a Moscow-based Economics Research Network which provides individual economists in the region with research funding, advanced training, and professional networking opportunities at home and abroad. Since 2000, EERC-Russia has been serving as the regional representative of the Global Development Network (GDN) in CIS countries. The EERC also holds semi-annual grant competitions and other tenders for research on specific topics, and hosts workshops and produces working papers on relevant economic policy questions in the CIS. Researchers and projects supported reach right across the CIS, and the EERC facilitates networking and resource sharing between researchers and institutions to foster a policy community and network of exchange on economic questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6158">'''FLAG-tag''', or '''FLAG octapeptide''', or '''FLAG epitope''', is a polypeptide [[protein tag]] that can be added to a protein using [[recombinant DNA]] [[technology]], having the sequence motif DYKDDDDK (where D=[[aspartic acid]], Y=[[tyrosine]], and K=[[lysine]]).&lt;ref name = "Hopp_1988"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt1088-1204 |title=A Short Polypeptide Marker Sequence Useful for Recombinant Protein Identification and Purification |year=1988 |last1=Hopp |first1=Thomas P. |last2=Prickett |first2=Kathryn S. |last3=Price |first3=Virginia L. |last4=Libby |first4=Randell T. |last5=March |first5=Carl J. |last6=Pat Cerretti |first6=Douglas |last7=Urdal |first7=David L. |last8=Conlon |first8=Paul J. | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Bio/Technology |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=1204–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an artificial antigen to which specific, high affinity monoclonal antibodies have been developed and hence can be used for protein purification by [[affinity chromatography]] and also can be used for locating proteins within living cells. It has been used to separate [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]], overexpressed protein from [[wild-type]] protein expressed by the host organism. It can also be used in the isolation of [[protein complexes]] with multiple subunits, because its mild purification procedure tends not to disrupt such complexes. It has been used to obtain proteins of sufficient purity and quality to carry out 3D structure determination by x-ray crystallography.

A FLAG-tag can be used in many different [[bioassay|assays]] that require recognition by an [[antibody]]. If there is no antibody against a given protein, adding a FLAG-tag to a protein allows the protein to be studied with an antibody against the FLAG sequence. Examples are cellular localization studies by [[immunofluorescence]] or detection by [[SDS PAGE]] protein electrophoresis and Western blotting.

The peptide sequence of the FLAG-tag from the N-terminus to the C-terminus is: DYKDDDDK (1012 Da). Additionally, it may be used in tandem, commonly the 3xFLAG peptide: DYKDHD-G-DYKDHD-I-DYKDDDDK (with the final tag encoding an enterokinase cleavage site). It can be fused to the C-terminus or the N-terminus of a protein, or inserted within a protein. Some commercially available antibodies (e.g., M1/4E11) recognize the [[epitope]] only when it is present at the N-terminus. However, other available antibodies (e.g., M2) are position-insensitive. The tyrosine residue in the FLAG-tag can be [[Tyrosine sulfation|sulfated]], which can affect antibody recognition of the FLAG epitope.&lt;ref name="Hunter_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunter MR, Grimsey NL, Glass M | title = Sulfation of the FLAG epitope is affected by co-expression of G protein-coupled receptors in a mammalian cell model | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 27316 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27273047 | pmc = 4895180 | doi = 10.1038/srep27316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLAG-tag can be used in conjunction with other affinity tags, for example a polyhistidine tag ([[His-tag]]), [[HA-tag]] or [[myc-tag]].

== History ==
The first use of epitope tagging was described by Munro and Pelham in 1984.&lt;ref name="Munro_1984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Munro S, Pelham HR | title = Use of peptide tagging to detect proteins expressed from cloned genes: deletion mapping functional domains of Drosophila hsp 70 | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 3 | issue = 13 | pages = 3087–93 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6526011 | pmc = 557822 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLAG-tag was the second example of a fully functional, improved epitope tag, published in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name = "Hopp_1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11694294"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Einhauer A, Jungbauer A | title = The FLAG peptide, a versatile fusion tag for the purification of recombinant proteins | journal = Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods | volume = 49 | issue = 1-3 | pages = 455–65 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11694294 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-022X(01)00213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Addition of an epitope to a protein coding sequence: FLAG-tag | url = http://www-users.med.cornell.edu/~jawagne/FLAG-tag.html | work = The logic of molecular approaches to biological problems | publisher = Cornell University }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the only epitope tag to be patented.&lt;ref&gt;FLAG is a registered trademark of Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 4703004 | status = granted | title = Synthesis of protein with an identification peptide (vectors) | gdate = 1987 | invent1 = Hopp TP | assignee = Immunex Corp }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become the most commonly used protein tag in laboratories worldwide. Unlike some other tags (e.g. myc, HA), where a monoclonal antibody was first isolated against an existing protein, then the epitope was characterized and used as a tag, the FLAG epitope was an idealized, artificial design, to which monoclonal antibodies were raised. The FLAG tag's structure was optimized for compatibility with proteins it is attached to, in that it is more hydrophilic than other common epitope tags and therefore less likely to denature or inactivate proteins to which it is appended. In addition, N-terminal FLAG tags can be removed readily from proteins once they have been isolated, by treatment with the specific protease, enterokinase ([[enteropeptidase]]).

The third report of epitope tagging, ([[HA-tag]]),&lt;ref name="Field_1988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Field J, Nikawa J, Broek D, MacDonald B, Rodgers L, Wilson IA, Lerner RA, Wigler M | title = Purification of a RAS-responsive adenylyl cyclase complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by use of an epitope addition method | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 2159–65 | year = 1988 | pmid = 2455217 | pmc = 363397 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared about one year after the Flag system had been first shipped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15454">'''First magnitude stars''' are the brightest stars in the night [[sky]], with [[Apparent magnitude|apparent magnitudes]] lower than +1.50.&lt;ref name=SGnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stargazing.net/david/constel/brightstars.html |title=First Magnitude Stars |work=stargazing.net |accessdate=31 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Learning the first magnitude stars. Campbell, Frederick. Journal: Popular Astronomy, 1917. Vol. 25, p.245&lt;/ref&gt;[[Hipparchus]], in the 1st century B.C., introduced the magnitude scale. He allocated first magnitude to the 20 brightest stars and the [[sixth magnitude star|sixth magnitude]] to the faintest stars visible to the naked eye.

In the 19th Century, this ancient scale of [[apparent magnitude]] was logarithmically defined—so that a star of 1.00 mag is exactly 100 times brighter than a star of 6.00 magnitude. The scale also was extended to even brighter [[celestial bodies]] like [[Sirius]] (-1.5 mag), [[Venus]] (-4 mag), [[full Moon]] (-12.7 mag) and [[Sun]] (-26.7 mag).

== Hipparchus ==
Hipparchus ranked his stars in a very simple way. He listed the brightest stars as ''"of the first magnitude"'', which meant "the biggest." Stars less bright Hipparchus called ''"of the second magnitude"'', or second biggest. The faintest stars visible to the naked eye he called ''"of the sixth magnitude"''.&lt;ref name=SandT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/the-stellar-magnitude-system/ |title=The Stellar Magnitude System |author=Alan MacRobert |date=1 August 2006 |publisher=Sky &amp; Telescope |work=skyandtelescope.com |accessdate=31 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naked-eye magnitude system==
During a series of lectures given in 1736 at the University of Oxford, its then Professor of Astronomy explainedː&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keill|first=John|title=An Introduction to the True Astronomy, 3rd ed.|publisher=Henry Lintot|date=1739|place=London|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=ITKLbufR_DsC|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The fixed Stars appear to be of different Bignesses, not because they really are so, but because they are not all equally distant from us. Those that are nearest will excel in Lustre and Bigness; the more remote Stars will give a fainter Light, and appear smaller to the Eye. Hence arise the Distribution of Stars, according to their Order and Dignity, into Classes; the first Class containing those which are nearest to us, are called Stars of the first Magnitude; those that are next to them, are Stars of the second Magnitude ... and so forth, 'till we come to the Stars of the sixth Magnitude, which comprehend the smallest Stars that can be discerned with the bare Eye. For all the other Stars, which are only seen by the Help of a Telescope [...]''

''And even among those Stars which are reckoned of the brightest Class, there appears a Variety of Magnitude; for Sirius or Arcturus are each of them brighter than Aldebaran [...] And there are some Stars of such an intermedial Order, that the Astronomers have differed in classing of them; some putting the same Stars in one Class, others in another. For Example: The little Dog was by Tycho placed among the Stars of the second Magnitude, which Ptolemy reckoned among the Stars of the first Class [...]''

== Distribution on the Sky ==
In the modern scale, the 20 brightest stars of Hipparchos have magnitudes between -1.5 (Sirius) and +1.6 ([[Bellatrix]], γ Orionis). The table below shows 22 stars brighter than +1.5 mag, but 5 of them the Greek astronomers probably didn't know for their far southern position.

Twelve of the 22 brightest stars are on the actual Northern sky, ten on Southern sky. But on the seasonal evening sky, they are unevenly distributed: In Europe and USA 12-13 stars are visible in winter, but only 6-7 in summer. Nine of the brightest winter stars are part of the [[Winter Hexagon]] or surrounded by it.

'''Food contamination''' refers to the presence of harmful chemicals and microorganisms in food, which can cause consumer illness. This article addresses the chemical contamination of foods, as opposed to microbiological contamination, which can be found under [[foodborne illness]].

The impact of chemical contaminants on consumer health and well-being is often apparent only after many years of processing and prolonged exposure at low levels (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[cancer]]). Unlike food-borne pathogens, chemical contaminants present in foods are often unaffected by thermal processing. Chemical contaminants can be classified according to the source of contamination and the mechanism by which they enter the food product.

==Agrochemicals==
[[Agrochemical]]s are chemicals used in agricultural practices and animal husbandry with the intent to increase crop yields. Such agents include [[pesticides]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[insecticides]], [[herbicides]], [[rodenticides]]), plant growth regulators, veterinary drugs (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[nitrofuran]], [[fluoroquinolones]], [[malachite green]], [[chloramphenicol]]), and [[bovine somatotropin]] ([[Recombinant bovine somatotropin|rBST]]).

==Environmental contaminants==
[[Environmental contaminant]]s are chemicals that are present in the environment in which the food is grown, harvested, transported, stored, packaged, processed, and consumed. The physical contact of the food with its environment results in its contamination. Possible sources of contamination and contaminants common to that vector include:

*Air: radionuclides ([[caesium-137]], [[strontium-90]]), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAH)
*Water: [[arsenic]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]]
*Soil: [[cadmium]], [[nitrate]]s, [[perchlorate]]s
*Packaging materials: [[antimony]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA), [[semicarbazide]], [[benzophenone]], [[isopropylthioxanthone]] (ITX), [[bisphenol A]]
* Processing/cooking equipment: [[copper]] or other metal chips, lubricants, cleaning and sanitizing agents
*Naturally occurring toxins: [[mycotoxin]]s, [[Phytohaemagglutinin|phytohemagglutinin]], [[pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s, [[grayanotoxin]], [[mushroom]] toxins, [[scombrotoxin]] ([[histamine]]), [[ciguatera]], shellfish toxins (see [[shellfish poisoning]]), [[tetrodotoxin]], among many others.

==Pesticides and carcinogens==
There are many cases of banned pesticides or carcinogens found in foods.

* [[Greenpeace]] exposed in 2006 that 25% of surveyed supermarkets in China stocked agricultural products contaminated with banned pesticides.  Over 70% of tomatoes that tested were found to have the banned pesticide [[Lindane]], and almost 40% of the samples had a mix of three or more types of pesticides. [[Tangerine]], [[strawberry]], and Kyofung [[grape]] samples were also found contaminated by banned pesticides, including the highly toxic [[methamidophos]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinacsr.com/en/2006/06/13/537-greenpeace-exposes-guangzhou-pesticide-contamination/|title=Greenpeace Exposes Guangzhou Pesticide Contamination|date=June 13, 2006|work=ChinaCSR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace says there exists no comprehensive monitoring on fruit produce in the Hong Kong as of 2006.
* In India, [[soft drinks]] were found contaminated with high levels of pesticides and insecticides, including lindane, [[DDT]], [[malathion]] and [[chlorpyrifos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merinews.com/catFull.jsp?articleID=146797|title=Ban the Colas!|author=TribhuMRatta|date=Nov 5, 2008|work=MeriNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Formaldehyde]], a [[carcinogen]], was frequently found in the common Vietnamese dish, [[Pho]], resulting in the [[2007 Vietnam food scare]]. "Health agencies have known that Vietnamese [[soy sauce]], the country's second most popular sauce after [[fish sauce]], has been chock full of cancer agents since at least 2001", reported the ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' daily. "Why didn't anyone tell us?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iiMrrBvLTLGX3P0uXmSqeT1Zjayw |title=Toxic soy sauce, chemical veggies -- food scares hit Vietnam |date=Sep 11, 2007 |work=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |publisher=[[Google News]] |location=Hanoi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119040101/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iiMrrBvLTLGX3P0uXmSqeT1Zjayw |archivedate=2010-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carcinogen in Asian sauces is [[3-MCPD]] and its metabolite [[1,3-Dichloropropan-2-ol|1,3-DCP]], which has been an ongoing problem affecting multiple continents. Vietnamese vegetables and fruits were also found to have banned pesticides.
* The [[2005 Indonesia food scare]], where carcinogenic formaldehyde was found to be added as a preservative to noodles, [[tofu]], salted fish, and [[meatball]]s.
* In [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]], melamine was discovered to have been added to milk and infant formula which caused 54,000 babies to be sent to the hospital. Six babies died because of kidney stones related to the contaminant. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Scott|title=Chinese top food safety official resign|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26827110/#.WqAcNWaZPBI|website=NBCNEWS|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hair in food==
There is a heavy stigma attached to the presence of hair in food in most societies. There is a risk that it may induce choking and [[vomiting]], and also that it may be contaminated by toxic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/rtph.2000.1403|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/rt/2000/00000032/00000001/art01403|title=Regulatory Action Criteria for Filth and Other Extraneous Materials IV.

In most countries, people working in the food industry are required to cover their hair because it will contaminate the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohioagriculture.gov/pubs/divs/food/curr/hcomm/letters/food-ltr-hairestraint.stm|title=Ohio Department of Agriculture}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campden.co.uk/whatsnew/news66.htm|title=CCFRA newsletter|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224642/http://www.campden.co.uk/whatsnew/news66.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people are served food which contains hair in restaurants or cafés, it is usual for them to complain to the staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20060920/ai_n16750428/pg_2|title=Looking under the tables|work=The Gazette | date=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a range of possible reasons for the objection to hair in food, ranging from cultural taboos to the simple fact that it is difficult to digest and unpleasant to eat. It may also be interpreted as a sign of more widespread problems with hygiene. The introduction of complete-capture [[hairnet]]s is believed to have resulted in a decrease in incidents of contamination of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifst.org/uploadedfiles/cms/store/ATTACHMENTS/foodbitessep05.pdf|title=IFST.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823131430/http://www.ifst.org/uploadedfiles/cms/store/ATTACHMENTS/foodbitessep05.pdf|archivedate=2006-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes protein from human hair is used as a food ingredient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/2007/01/does_your_daily_bread_contain_human_hair.html|title=Does your daily bread contain human hair?|author=Justin Rowlatt|date=10 Jan 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; in bread and other such similar products. Such use of human hair in food is forbidden in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Quad/2406/islam1.htm|title=Halaal/Haraam Food Awareness|author=Amir Khan|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022204853/http://geocities.com/CollegePark/Quad/2406/islam1.htm|archivedate=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, in [[Judaism]], finding hair in food was a sign of bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lilith's Cave: Jewish Tales of the Supernatural|author=Howard Schwartz|year=1991|isbn=0-19-506726-6|authorlink=Howard Schwartz (writer and editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing contaminants==
Processing contaminants are generated during the processing of foods (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;heating, [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]]). They are absent in the raw materials, and are formed by chemical reactions between natural and/or added food constituents during processing. The presence of these contaminants in processed foods cannot be entirely avoided. Technological processes can be adjusted and/or optimized, however, in order to reduce the levels of formation of processing contaminants. Examples are: [[nitrosamines]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAH), [[heterocyclic amine]]s, [[histamine]], [[acrylamide]], [[furan]], [[benzene]], [[trans fat]], [[3-MCPD]], [[semicarbazide]], [[4-hydroxynonenal]] (4-HNE), and [[ethyl carbamate]]. There is also the possibility of metal chips from the processing equipment contaminating food. These can be identified using metal detection equipment. In many [[conveyor]] lines, the line will be stopped, or when weighing the product with a [[Check weigher]], the item can be rejected for being over- or underweight or because small pieces of metal are detected within it.

==Emerging food contaminants==
While many food contaminants have been known for decades, the formation and presence of certain chemicals in foods has been discovered relatively recently. These are the so-called emerging food contaminants like [[acrylamide]], [[furan]], [[benzene]], [[perchlorate]], [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] ([[PFOA]]), [[3-monochloropropane-1,3-diol]] (3-MCPD), [[4-hydroxynonenal]], and (4-HNE).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Safety and regulation==
[[Acceptable daily intake]] (ADI) levels and tolerable concentrations of contaminants in individual foods are determined on the basis of the "No Observed Adverse Effect Level" (NOAEL) in animal experiments, by using a safety factor (usually 100). The maximum concentrations of contaminants allowed by legislation are often well below toxicological tolerance levels, because such levels can often be reasonably achieved by using good agricultural and manufacturing practices.

Regulatory officials, in order to combat the dangers associated with foodborne viruses, are pursuing various possible measures. 
*The [[European Food Safety Authority|EFSA]] published a report in 2011 on “scientific opinion regarding an update of the present knowledge on the occurrence and control of foodborne viruses”. 
*This year, an expert working group created by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN), is expected to publish a standard method for the detection of [[norovirus]] and [[hepatitis&amp;nbsp;A]] virus in food. 
*The CODEX Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH) is also working on a guideline which is now ready for final adoption. 
*[[European Commission]] Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 indicates that “foodstuffs should not contain micro-organisms or their toxins or metabolites in quantities that present an unacceptable risk for human health”, underlining that methods are required for foodborne virus detection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:338:0001:0026:EN:PDF Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005], Official Journal of the European Union, 15 November 2005, Retrieved 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food contaminant testing==
To maintain the high quality of food and comply with health, safety, and environmental regulatory standards, it is best to rely on food contaminant testing through an independent third party, such as laboratories or certification companies. For manufacturers, the testing for food contaminants can minimize the risk of noncompliance in relation to raw ingredients, semi-manufactured foods, and final products. Also, food contaminant testing assures consumers [[Food Safety|safety]] and quality of purchased food products and can prevent [[Foodborne illness|foodborne diseases]], and chemical, microbiological, or physical food hazards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/Quality-Safety/Study-finds-novel-method-to-test-food-for-contamination Study finds novel method to test food for contamination]&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of ADIs for certain emerging food contaminants is currently an active area of research and regulatory debate.

In [[drama]], a '''frame''' is a situation or position of importance given to a person, and '''distance''' relates to how engaged the frame makes the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinematography|url=http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
*A [[news reporter|reporter]] would be furthest away from the action as they would be a [[wikt:spectator|spectator]], reporting on events.
*A [[soldier]] or [[policeman]] would be in the action, and is actually within the [[drama]], being closest.

[[Dorothy Heathcote]] created the idea of frames and distance. These concepts can be applied to thinking about a [[target group]] and how willing they would be to interact with the drama. A younger child is more likely to want to become part of the action, while a [[teenager]] is more likely to want to observe and comment on the action.

'''Human-centered computing''' ('''HCC''')  studies the design, development, and deployment of mixed-initiative human-computer systems. It is emerged from the convergence of multiple disciplines that are concerned both with understanding human beings and with the design of computational artifacts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242103770_Human-Centered_Computing_Toward_a_Human_Revolution/file/3deec52c7194105294.pdf | title=Human-centered computing: toward a human revolution | publisher=IEEE Computer | date=Nov 20, 2007 |author1=Alejandro Jaimes |author2=Daniel Gatica-Perez |author3=Nicu Sebe |author4=Thomas S. Huang }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human-centered computing is closely related to [[human-computer interaction]] and [[information science]]. Human-centered computing is usually concerned with systems and practices of technology use while human-computer interaction is more focused on [[ergonomics]] and the [[usability]] of computing artifacts and information science is focused on practices surrounding the collection, manipulation, and use of [[information]].

Human-centered computing researchers and practitioners usually come from one or more of disciplines such as [[computer science]], [[human factors]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[anthropology]], [[communication studies]], [[graphic design]] and [[industrial design]]. Some researchers focus on understanding humans, both as individuals and in social groups, by focusing on the ways that human beings adopt and organize their lives around computational technologies. Others focus on designing and developing new computational artifacts.

== Overview ==

=== Scope ===
HCC aims at bridging the existing gaps between the various disciplines involved with the design and implementation of computing systems that support human's activities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242103770_Human-Centered_Computing_Toward_a_Human_Revolution/file/3deec52c7194105294.pdf | title=Human-centered computing: toward a human revolution | publisher=IEEE Computer | date=Nov 20, 2007 |author1=Alejandro Jaimes |author2=Daniel Gatica-Perez |author3=Nicu Sebe |author4=Thomas S. Huang }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, it is a set of methodologies that apply to any field that uses computers in applications in which people directly interact with devices or systems that use computer technologies.

HCC facilitates the design of effective computer systems that take into account personal, social, and cultural aspects and addresses issues such as information design, human information interaction, human-computer interaction, human-human interaction, and the relationships between computing technology and art, social, and cultural issues.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

=== HCC topics ===
The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) defines the trends of HCC research as "a three dimensional space comprising human, computer, and environment."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = US NSF - CISE - IIS|url = https://www.nsf.gov/cise/iis/hcc_pgm.jsp|website = www.nsf.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the NSF, the human dimension ranges from research that supports individual needs, through teams as goal-oriented groups, to society as an unstructured collection of connected people.  The computer dimension ranges from fixed computing devices, through mobile devices, to computational systems of visual/audio devices that are embedded in the surrounding physical environment.  The environment dimension ranges from discrete physical computational devices, through mixed reality systems, to immersive virtual environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some examples of topics in the field are listed below.

==== List of topics in HCC field ====
* Problem-solving in distributed environments, ranging across Internet-based information systems, grids, sensor-based information networks, and mobile and wearable information appliances.
* Multimedia and multi-modal interfaces in which combinations of speech, text, graphics, gesture, movement, touch, sound, etc. are used by people and machines to communicate with one another.
* Intelligent interfaces and user modeling, information visualization, and adaptation of content to accommodate different display capabilities, modalities, bandwidth and latency.
* Multi-agent systems that control and coordinate actions and solve complex problems in distributed environments in a wide variety of domains, such as disaster response teams, e-commerce, education, and successful aging.
* Models for effective computer-mediated human-human interaction under a variety of constraints, (e.g., video conferencing, collaboration across high vs. low bandwidth networks, etc.).
* Definition of semantic structures for multimedia information to support cross-modal input and output.
* Specific solutions to address the special needs of particular communities.
* Collaborative systems that enable knowledge-intensive and dynamic interactions for innovation and knowledge generation across organizational boundaries, national borders, and professional fields.
* Novel methods to support and enhance social interaction, including innovative ideas like social orthotics, affective computing, and experience capture.
* Studies of how social organizations, such as government agencies or corporations, respond to and shape the introduction of new information technologies, especially with the goal of improving scientific understanding and technical design.
* Knowledge-driven human-computer interaction that uses ontologies to addresss the semantic ambiguities between human and computer's understandings towards mutual behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dong|first=Hai, Hussain, Farookh, and Chang, Elizabeth|date=2010|title=A human-centered semantic service platform for the digital ecosystems environment|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220301904_A_Human-Centered_Semantic_Service_Platform_for_the_Digital_Ecosystems_Environment|journal=World Wide Web|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human-centered semantic relatedness measure that employs human power to measure the semantic relatedness between two concepts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280775027_UCOSAIS_A_Framework_for_User-Centered_Online_Service_Advertising_Information_Search|title=UCOSAIS: A Framework for User-Centered Online Service Advertising Information Search, Web Information Systems Engineering – WISE 2013|last=Dong|first=Hai, Hussain, Farookh, Chang, Elizabeth|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=267–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human-centered systems ==
'''Human-centered systems (HCS)''' are systems designed for human-centered computing. This approach was developed by [[Mike Cooley (engineer)|Mike Cooley]] in his book ''[[Architect or Bee?]]'' &lt;ref&gt; http://www.spokesmanbooks.com/Spokesman/PDF/131OGrady.pdf | Architect or Bee? The human price of technology &lt;/ref&gt; drawing on his experience working with the [[Lucas_Industries#Lucas_Plan_(1976)|Lucas Plan]]. HCS focuses on the design of interactive systems as they relate to human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human-Centered Systems &amp;#124; Research Areas &amp;#124; Research {{!}} Computer Science &amp; Engineering {{!}} College of Engineering|url = http://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/research/areas/human-centered-systems|website = engineering.tamu.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-17|first = Texas|last = Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kling et al., the Committee on Computing, Information, and Communication of the [[National Science and Technology Council]], identified human-centered systems, or HCS, as one of five components for a High Performance Computing Program.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human Centered Systems in the Perspective of Organizational and Social Informatics|url = http://philfeldman.com/Human_centered_systems_in_the_perspective_of_organizational_and_social_informatics.pdf|website = philfeldman.com|accessdate = 2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human-centered systems can be referred to in terms of human-centered automation.  According to Kling et al., HCS refers to "systems that are:
# based on the analysis of the human tasks the system is aiding
# monitored for performance in terms of human benefits
# built to take account of human skills and
# adaptable easily to changing human needs."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, Kling et al. defines four dimensions of human-centeredness that should be taken into account when classifying a system: &amp;nbsp;systems that are human centered must analyze the complexity of the targeted social organization, and the varied social units that structure work and information; &amp;nbsp;human centeredness is not an attribute of systems, but a process in which the stakeholder group of a particular system assists in evaluating the benefit of the system; the basic architecture of the system should reflect a realistic relationship between humans and machines; &amp;nbsp;the purpose and audience the system is designed for should be an explicit part of the design, evaluation, and use of the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Human-centered activities in multimedia ==
[[File:Wikimania Human Centered Design Visualization.jpg|thumb|Wikimania human-centered design visualization, created by ''[[Myriapoda]]''.]]

The '''human-centered activities in multimedia''', or '''HCM''', can be considered as follows according to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1580429|title = Human-centered multimedia: culture, deployment, and access|last =Jaimes |first =A. |journal = IEEE Multimedia Magazine |volume=, 13 |issue=1 |pages=12–19 |year=2006 |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; media production, annotation, organization, archival, retrieval, sharing, analysis, and communication, which can be clustered into three areas: production, analysis, and interaction.

=== Multimedia production ===
Multimedia production is the human task of creating media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Human-Centered Computing: A Multimedia Perspective|journal = Jaimes, Alejandro, Nicu Sebe, and Daniel Gatica-Perez. "Human-centered computing: a multimedia perspective." Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM international conference on Multimedia. ACM, 2006.|doi = 10.1145/1180639.1180829|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, photographing, recording audio, remixing, etc. It is important that all aspects of media production concerned should directly involve humans in HCM. There are two main characteristics of multimedia production. The first is culture and social factors. HCM production systems should consider cultural differences and be designed according to the culture in which they will be deployed. The second is to consider human abilities. Participants involved in HCM production should be able to complete the activities during the production process.

=== Multimedia analysis ===
Multimedia analysis can be considered as a type of HCM applications which is the automatic analysis of human activities and social behavior in general. There is a broad area of potential relevant uses from facilitating and enhancing human communications, to allowing for improved information access and retrieval in the professional, entertainment, and personal domains.

=== Multimedia interaction ===
Multimedia interaction can be considered as the interaction activity area of HCM. It is paramount to understand both how humans interact with each other and why, so that we can build systems to facilitate such communication and so that people can interact with computers in natural ways. To achieve natural interaction, cultural differences and social context are primary factors to consider, due to the potential different cultural backgrounds. For instance, a couple of examples include: face-to-face communications where the interaction is physically located and real-time; live-computer mediated communications where the interaction is physically remote but remains real-time; and non-real time computer-mediated communications such as instant SMS, email, etc.

== Career ==

=== Academic programs ===
As human-centered computing has become increasingly popular, many universities have created special programs for HCC research and study for both graduate and undergraduate students.

===User interface designer===
{{Main|User interface design}}

A user interface designer is an individual who usually with a relevant degree or high level of knowledge, not only on [[technology]], [[cognitive science]], [[human–computer interaction]], [[learning sciences]], but also on [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. A user interface designer develops and applies [[user-centered design]] methodologies and [[Agile software development|agile development]] processes that includes consideration for overall usability of interactive software applications, emphasizing interaction design and front-end development.

===Information architect (IA)===
{{Main|Information architecture}}

Information architects mainly work to understand user and business needs in order to organize information to best satisfy these needs. Specifically, information architects often act as a key bridge between technical and creative development in a project team. Areas of interest in IA include search schemas, metadata, and taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/information-architecture.html|title=Information Architecture Basics|date=2013-10-08|website=www.usability.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

=== NASA/Ames Computational Sciences Division ===
[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|NASA Mars Project]]
The Human-Centered Computing (HCC) group at NASA/Ames Computational Sciences Division is conducting research at Haughton as members of the Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) to determine, via an analog study, how we will live and work on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/hc-computing.html|title=NASA - Human Centered Computing|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''HMP/Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Field Robotics Experiments'''—HCC is collaborating with researchers on the HMP/CMU field robotics research program at Haughton to specify opportunities for robots assisting scientists. Researchers in this project has carried out a parallel investigation that documents work during traverses. A simulation module has been built, using a tool that represents people, their tools, and their work environment, that will serve as a partial controller for a robot that assist scientists in the field work in mars. When it comes to take human, computing and environment all into consideration, theory and techniques in HCC filed will be the guideline.
# '''Ethnography of Human Exploration of Space'''—HCC lab is carrying out an ethnographic study of scientific field work, covering all aspects of a scientist's life in the field. This study involves observing as participants at Haughton and writing about HCC lab`s experiences. HCC lab then look for patterns in how people organize their time, space, and objects and how they relate to each other to accomplish their goals. In this study, HCC lab is focusing on learning and conceptual change.

In this context, "imagined" does not mean to be “false” or “made-up”, but rather is used synonymous with “perceived”. Imagined geographies refers to the perception of a space created through certain imagery, texts, and/or [[discourse]]s&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016. Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography. Geoforum, 75, pp. 249-252. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Imagined geographies can be seen as a form of [[social constructionism]] on par with [[Benedict Anderson]]'s concept of [[imagined communities]]. Edward Said's notion of [[Orientalism]] is tied to the tumultuous dynamics of contemporary history. [[Orientalism]] is often referred to as the West's patronizing perceptions and depictions of the East, but more specifically towards [[Islamic]] and [[Confucian]] states. [[Orientalism]] has also been labeled to as the cornerstone of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]]&lt;ref&gt;Nash, C., 2014. Postcolonial geographies: spatial narratives of inequality and interconnection. In Envisioning human geographies (pp. 110-133). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite often being constructed on a national level, imagined geographies also occur domestically in nations and locally within regions, cities, etc.

==Orientalism==
{{main|Orientalism (book)}}

In his book ''Orientalism'', Edward Said argued that Western culture had produced a view of the "[[Orient]]" based on a particular imagination, popularized through [[academic]] [[Orientalism|Oriental studies]], [[travel writing]], [[anthropology]] and a [[Colonialism|colonial]] view of the Orient. This imagination included painting the orient as feminine- however, Said's view on the gendered nature has been criticized by other scholars due to a limited exploration of the construct.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne P. "Geographies of Postcolonialism: Ch. 1, Imagining the World." London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 1993 lecture located at York University, Toronto, Canada, Said stressed the role culture plays in Orientalism-based imperialism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=ESaid&gt;Edward Said. "Culture and Imperialism" (Lecture): York University, Toronto, February 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; By differentiating and elevating a national culture over another a validating process of "othering" is undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Mountz, Key Concepts in Political Geography, Ch. 28 "The Other". 328-329.&lt;/ref&gt;  This process underlies imagined geographies such as orientalism as it creates a set of preconceived notions for self-serving purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Mountz, Key Concepts in Political Geography, Ch. 28 "The Other"; Edward Said. "Culture and Imperialism" (Lecture): York University, Toronto, February 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In constructing itself as superior, the imperial force or colonizing agent is able to justify its actions as somehow necessary or beneficial to the "other".&lt;ref name=ESaid/&gt;

Despite the broad scope and affect of orientalism as an imagined geography, it and the underlying process of "othering" are discursive and thereby normalized within dominant, Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne P. Sharp. Geographies of Postcolonialism: Ch.1 "Imagining the World". 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in this sense that Orientalism may be reinforced in cultural texts such as art, film, literature, music, etc. where one-dimensional and often backwards constructions prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Gregory The Colonial Present. Ch. 1. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A prime source of cinematic examples is the documentary-film ''Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People''.&lt;ref name=Jhally&gt;Sut Jhally. Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People.&lt;/ref&gt; The film demonstrates the process of orientalism centric "othering" within Western films from the silent era to modern classics such as Disney's ''Aladdin''.&lt;ref name=Jhally/&gt; Inferior, backwards, and culturally stagnate constructions of Oriental "others" become normalized in the minds of Western consumers of cultural texts; reinforcing racist or insensitive beliefs and assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Gregory The Colonial Present. Ch. 1. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Orientalism'', Said says that Orientalism is an imagined geography because a) Europeans created one culture for the entirety of the 'Orient', and b) the 'Orient' was defined by text and not by the 'Orient'.

==Theory==
Said was heavily influenced by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], and those who have developed the theory of imagined geographies have linked these together. Foucault states that power and knowledge are always intertwined. Said then developed an idea of a relationship between power and descriptions. Imagined geographies are thus seen as a tool of [[power (sociology)|power]], of a means of controlling and subordinating areas. Power is seen as being in the hands of those who have the right to [[Objectification|objectify]] those that they are imagining. Imagined geographies were mostly based on myth and legend, often depicting monstrous "others". [[Edward Said]] elaborates that: “Europe is powerful and articulate; Asia is defeated and distant." &lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward.  “Imaginative Geography and Its Representations: Orientalizing the Oriental.”  Orientalism.  New York: Vintage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further writers to have been heavily influenced by the concept of imagined geographies including [[Derek Gregory]] and [[Gerard Toal|Gearóid Ó Tuathail]]. Gregory argues that the [[War on Terror]] shows a continuation of the same imagined geographies that Said uncovered. He claims that the [[Islamic]] world is portrayed as uncivilized; it is labeled as backward and failing. This justifies, in the view of those imagining, the military intervention that has been seen in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. [[Edward Said]] mentions that when [[Islam]] appeared in Europe in the Middle Ages, the response was conservative and defensive. Ó' Tuathail has argued that [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] knowledges are forms of imagined geography. Using the example of [[Halford Mackinder]]'s [[Heartland Theory]], he has shown how the presentation of Eastern Europe/Western Russia as a key geopolitical region after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] influenced actions such as the recreation of [[Poland]] and the [[Polish Corridor]] in the 1918 [[Treaty of Versailles]].

This theory has also been used to critique several geographies created; both historically and contemporarily—an example is [[Maria Todorova]]'s work ''[[Imagining the Balkans]]''. [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' has also been criticized as showing a whole set of imagined geographies.{{by whom|date=December 2012}} Halford Mackinder's "imperial gaze" has also been argued to be an important imagined geography [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rcjo/2000/00000011/00000001/art00005] that emphasised the importance of the [[British Empire]] over colonial peoples, and asserted the view of the geographical "expert" with the "[[God's eye view]]".

The '''Initial Teaching Alphabet''' ('''I.T.A.''' or '''i.t.a.''') is a variant of the [[Latin alphabet]] developed by Sir [[James Pitman]] (the grandson of Sir [[Isaac Pitman]], inventor of a system of shorthand) in the early 1960s. It was not intended to be a strictly phonetic transcription of English sounds, or a spelling reform for English as such, but instead a practical simplified writing system which could be used to teach English-speaking children to read more easily than can be done with traditional [[orthography]]. After children had learned to read using I.T.A., they would then eventually move on to learn standard English spelling. Although it achieved a certain degree of popularity in the 1960s, it has fallen into disuse.

==Details==
The I.T.A. originally had 43 symbols, which was expanded to 44, then 45. Each symbol predominantly represented a single English sound (including [[affricate]]s and [[diphthong]]s), but there were complications due to the desire to avoid making the I.T.A. needlessly different from standard English spelling (which would make the transition from the I.T.A. to standard spelling more difficult), and in order to neutrally represent several English pronunciations or dialects. In particular, there was no separate I.T.A. symbol for the English unstressed [[schwa]] sound {{IPA|[ə]}}, and schwa was written with the same letters used to write full vowel sounds. There were also several different ways of writing unstressed {{IPA|[ɪ]}}/{{IPA|[i]}} and consonants palatalized to {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʒ]}} by suffixes. Consonants written by double letters or "ck", "tch" etc. sequences in standard spelling were written with multiple symbols in I.T.A.

The I.T.A. symbol set includes joined letters ([[typographical ligature]]s) to replace the two-letter [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] "wh", "sh", and "ch" of conventional writing, and also ligatures for most of the [[long vowel]]s. There are two distinct ligatures for the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] "th" sounds in English, and a special merged letter for "ng". There is a variant of the "r" to end syllables, which is silent in [[non-rhotic accents]] like [[Received Pronunciation]] but not in rhotic accents like [[General American]] and [[Scots English]] (this was the 44th symbol added to the I.T.A.).

There are two English sounds which each have more than one I.T.A. letter whose main function is to write them. So whether the sound {{IPA|[k]}} is written with the letters "c" or "k" in I.T.A. depends on the way the sound is written in standard English spelling, as also whether the sound {{IPA|[z]}} is written with the ordinary "z" letter or with a special backwards "z" letter (which replaces the "s" of standard spelling where it represents a voiced sound, and which visually resembles an angular form of the letter "s"). The backwards "z" occurs prominently in many plural forms of nouns and third-person singular present forms of verbs (including ''is'').

Each of the I.T.A. letters has a name, the pronunciation of which includes the sound that the character stands for. For example, the name of the backwards "z" letter is "zess".

A special [[typeface]] was created for the I.T.A., whose characters were all [[lower case]]. Where capital letters are used in standard spelling, the I.T.A. simply used larger versions of the same lower-case characters. The following chart shows the letters of the 44-character version of the I.T.A., with the main pronunciation of each letter indicated by symbols of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] beneath:

[[File:Initial Teaching Alphabet ITA chart.svg|frame|center|Basic ITA chart]]

Note that "d" is made more distinctively different from "b" than is usual in standard typefaces (which is possible since in the I.T.A. there is no "q").

Later a 45th symbol was added to accommodate accent variation, a form of [[diaphoneme|diaphonemic]] writing. In the original set, a "hook a" or "two-storey a" (a) was used for the vowel in "cat" ([[lexical set]] TRAP), and a "round a" or "one-storey a" (ɑ) for the sound in "father" (lexical set PALM). But lexical set BATH (words such as "rather", "dance", and "half") patterns with PALM in some accents including Received Pronunciation, but with TRAP in others including General American. So a new character, the "half-hook a", was devised, to avoid the necessity of producing separate instructional materials for speakers of different accents.

==Decline==
Any advantage of the I.T.A. in making it easier for children to learn to read English was often offset by some children not being able to effectively transfer their I.T.A.-reading skills to reading standard English orthography, and/or being generally confused by having to deal with two alphabets in their early years of reading. Certain alternative methods (such as associating sounds with colours, so that for example when the letter "c" writes a {{IPA|[k]}} sound it would be coloured with the same colour as the letter "k", but when "c" writes an {{IPA|[s]}} sound it could be coloured like "s", as in ''[[Words in Colour]]'' and ''Colour Story Reading''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=J. K Jones|date=1967|title=Colour Story Reading|location=London|publisher=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were found to have some of the advantages of the I.T.A. without most of the disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|author=J. K Jones|date=1968|title=Comparing i.t.a. with Colour Story Reading|work=Educ Res|volume=10|page=226}}
{{Cite book|author=J. K Jones|date=1970|work=Reading: Problems and Perspectives|title=Interim results in the Colour Story reading experiment|others=J. C. Daniels (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the I.T.A. was not originally intended to dictate one particular approach to teaching reading, it was often identified with [[phonics]] methods, and after the 1960s, the pendulum of educational theory swung away from phonics.

The I.T.A. remains of interest in discussions about possible [[English language spelling reform|reforms of English spelling]]. There have been attempts to apply the I.T.A. using only characters which can be found on the [[typewriter]] keyboard&lt;ref&gt;For a proposal by [[Edward Rondthaler]], see ''The Visible Word'' by Herbert Spencer (second edition 1969, {{ISBN|0-8038-7733-1}}), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; or in the basic [[ASCII]] [[character set]], to avoid the use of special symbols.

'''ICOFOM''', the '''International Committee for Museology''' of the [[International Council of Museums|International Council of Museums (ICOM)]] was founded in 1977 at the initiative of Jan Jelínek, in order to promote research and theoretical thinking within the museum world. This committee became one of the most popular in [[International Council of Museums|International Council of Museums (ICOM)]]. It addresses the study of the theoretical foundation that guides museum activities around the world or, more generally, the analysis of the different forms that museums can have.  The committee includes several hundred museologists from all over the world, organizes yearly symposia and publishes, among other monographs, the annual journal ''ICOFOM Study Series'', available online.

== Origins ==

The work of the [[International Council of Museums|International Council of Museums (ICOM)]], begun in 1946, was based on much older programmes, specifically professional symposia, journals of national associations (''Museums Journal'', Great Britain, 1902; ''Museumskunde'', Germany, 1905), and of course the work of the International Office of Museums, founded in 1926 by the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, located in Paris. A large part of the research which grew out of these associations, as with international committees, focused on objectives relating to concrete professional concerns. In 1968 [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] launched an international committee for the training of museum professionals (ICTOP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000795/079510eo.pdf#page=11 P. J. Boylan, "Museum training: a central concern of ICOM for forty years”. ''Museum'', no. 156, 1987,  pp. 225–230.]&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when museum training courses were gaining popularity, in particular in [[Brno]], Czechoslovakia (1963), [[Leicester]], UK (1966) and Paris (1970). On the other hand, the development of specific theories linked to the museum phenomenon – long referred to as "museography", which became "[[museology]]" after WWII – was not a research interest for most museum professionals. Nevertheless, this field was particularly interesting for some researchers and university professors, in particular in Eastern European countries, first of all Jan Jelínek who was director of the Antropos Museum in [[Brno]] and president of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]]. The International Committee for Museology was founded in 1977 at the General Conference of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] in Moscow. Its first president was Jan Jelínek (Vinoš Sofka succeeded him in 1981&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/icofom/pdf/ISS%20HISTORY%201995%20V.%20SOFKA.pdf V. Sofka. ''My adventurous life with ICOFOM, museology, museologists and anti-museologists, giving special reference to ICOFOM Study Series'', 1995, 32 p.]&lt;/ref&gt;). Since that date we can say that three generations of museologists have continued to pursue the work of ICOFOM.

== Three generations of museologists ==

[[Museology]] was already developed in Eastern Europe at the time of the cold war. From the start ICOFOM would be a unique international platform that included researchers from both sides of the Iron Curtain, who were trying to set up museology as an autonomous discipline: without this independent status museology could not be taught in universities in Eastern countries, making this task a challenge of singular importance in the countries of the [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Šola, "What is museology?", ''Papers in Museology, 1'', Stockholm, Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, 1992, pp. 10–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The iconic personalities of museology, such as [[Georges Henri Rivière]], and especially [[André Desvallées]] in France, worked at the same time as influential museologists in the Eastern bloc, among whom are [[Avram Moiseevich Razgon|
Avram Razgon]] ([[USSR|URSS]]), [[Klaus Schreiner]] ([[East Germany|DDR]]), [[Jiří Neustupný]] ([[Czechoslovakia]]), [[Josef Beneš]] ([[Czechoslovakia]]), [[Wojciech Gluzinski]] ([[Poland]]), and especially [[Zbyněk Stránský]] ([[Czechoslovakia]]).&lt;ref&gt;F. Mairesse, ''Le musée, temple spectaculaire'', Lyon, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The stated aim of ICOFOM, under the dynamic leadership of [[Vinoš Sofka]] ([[Sweden]]), was to make an inventory of the different trends in museology throughout the world, and to develop this discipline in order to endow it with the status of science within the academic structure. At the beginning this essentially theoretical approach disconcerted many museum researchers who were much more pragmatic, for example [[George Ellis Burcaw]], author of an influential manual on museum work in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/icofom/pdf/MuWoP%202%20(1981)%20Eng.pdf#page=87 G. E. Burcaw, "Reflexions on MuWop no 1", ''MuWop/Do Tram'', no. 2, 1981, pp. 83–84]; G. E.  Burcaw, ''Introduction to Museum Work'', Nashville, American Association for State and Local History, 1983 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the climate of the cold war, which was still going on, did not help in creating closer links between the two sides. On the other hand, many researchers from Latin countries, in particular [[Waldisia Russio]]&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Oleveira Bruno, ''Waldisa Rússio Camargo Guarnieri Textos e contextos de uma trajetória profissional'', Sāo Paulo, ICOM/Pinacoteca, 2010, 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Brazil]]), are especially attracted to this approach.

Much enlarged new definitions of museology emerged, whose object of study reaches beyond the museum itself. The museum institution per se, the concept of museum as opposed to the specific museum, such as the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]],is relatively recent, and what interests museologists is a specific attitude which led to the creation of museums, as well as cabinets of curiosity, or in the future new forms linked to digital technologies ([[Virtual museum]]s): As already defined by the Czech museologist [[Anna Gregorová]] in 1980 "Museology is a science studying the specific relation of man to reality, consisting in purposeful and systematic collecting and conservation of selected inanimate material, mobile, and mainly three-dimensional objects documenting the development of nature and society" and "the museum is an institution which applies and carries out the specific relation of man to reality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/icofom/pdf/MuWoP%201%20(1980)%20Eng.pdf#page=21 A. Grégorová,  “Museology, science or just practical museum work?”, ''MuWoP / DoTraM'', no 1, 1980, pp. 20–21.]&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, which allowed for better describing the particular activity of selecting and describing an object in a museum – a phenomenon not too far from a sacred act –  more specific concepts were developed, such as musealisation, a term used more in French and Spanish than in English, (the act of introducing an object into a museum context), and museality (the special value of the object which determines its musealisation).&lt;ref&gt;A. Desvallées, and F. Mairesse (Eds), ''Dictionnaire encyclopédique de muséologie'', Paris, Armand Colin, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zbyněk Stránský]], the Czech museologist, was of major importance in this development, through his involvement in ICOFOM and also through the International Summer School of Museology, which he founded in Brno in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Z. Stranský, ''Museology: Introduction to Studies'', Brno, Masaryk University, 1995; Zbynek Z. Stranský, "Ten years of the International Summer School of Museology", in Zbynek Z. Stranský (Ed.), ''Museology for Tomorrow’s World'', Munich, Verlag Müller-Straten (ISSOM Publications), 1997, pp. 143–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this first generation of ICOFOM researchers, under the eight year presidency of [[Vinoš Sofka]], came a second, more diverse group of researchers. A leading member of this generation was Peter van Mensch (Netherlands), author of a 1992 doctoral thesis on museology as a scientific discipline: Towards a Methodology of Museology, who followed Sofka as President of ICOFOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muuseum.ee/et/erialane_areng/museoloogiaalane_ki/ingliskeelne_kirjand/p_van_mensch_towar/ P. van Mensch, ''Towards a Methodology of Museology'', University of Zagreb, Faculty of Philosophy, Doctor’s Thesis, 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other outstanding museologists in this generation were [[Ivo Maroévić]] ([[Croatia]]), [[Bernard Deloche]] and [[Mathilde Bellaigue]] (France), [[Martin Schaerer]] ([[Switzerland]]), as well as [[Teresa Scheiner]] ([[Brazil]]), [[Tomislav Šola]] ([[Croatia]]) and [[Nelly Decarolis]] ([[Argentina]]). [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]], ([[Mali]]), who was particularly attentive to the development of new museology, had a remarkable career: he was elected President of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] in 1989, but did not renew his mandate when he became President of [[Mali]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000859/085994eo.pdf#page=63 A. O. Konaré "An exclusive ''Museum'' interview with Alpha Oumar Konaré, the new President of ICOM”, ''Museum'', no. 165, 1990, pp. 61–62.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Broader definitions of the museum phenomenon began at this time, in particular one by Judith Spielbauer: “The established museum is a means to an end, not the end itself. These ends have been stated in many ways. They include varying perspectives on broadening an individual’s perception of the interdependence of the social, aesthetic and natural worlds in which he lives by providing information and experience and fostering an understanding of self within this widening context. The increase and dissemination of knowledge, the improvement of the quality of life, and preservation for future generations are all included in the usual parades of rationales.”&lt;ref&gt;Judith Spielbauer, 'Museums and Museology: a Means to Active Integrative Preservation', ''ICOFOM Study Series'', no. 12, 1987, pp. 271–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, such as Jennifer Harris and Kerstin Smeds, further expanded the definitions and added provocative nuances.

A third generation, schooled in museology by the second one, gradually joined the work of researchers: in particular one can note Wanchen Chang ([[Taiwan]]) and Bruno Brulon Soares ([[Brazil]]). They all share a global vision of museology founded on critical thinking about the development of museums in the world and on the values that form the conditions for museum work. For the past thirty years the museum has undergone considerable changes, whether becoming more market oriented which has been the case in many countries, museums' relationship to collections, which is endlessly altered, and of course digital technologies whose development has transformed our way of seeing the world. In the light of this evolution of the museum world, it is important to understand and to prepare for the possible evolution of the museum itself.

== Museology today and the work of ICOFOM ==

Today museology – as seen by ICOFOM – can be defined as "comprising all the efforts at theorization
and critical thinking about the museum field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf A. Desvallées, and François Mairesse (Eds), ''Key Concepts of Museology'', Paris, Armand Colin &amp; ICOM, 2010, p. 56.]&lt;/ref&gt; This vision, intentionally very broad, collects trends of thought that are often conflicting as they are linked to critical thinkers in different parts of the world, whether [[Benjamin Ives Gilman]] or [[Georges Brown Goode]], [[John Cotton Dana]] or Joseph Veach Noble, and, more currently, Duncan F. Cameron, Neil Postman, [[Georges Henri Rivière]], [[Zbyněk Stránský]], [[André Desvallées]], [[Stephen Weil]] or [[Roland Arpin]]. ICOFOM is harnessed to this work of research and synthesis, and strives to compile an inventory of the different ways to conceive of museums and museology and to generate, through these syntheses, the trends that emerge from the vast flux of change in the museum field. Within ICOFOM most working researchers teach at universities after having spent part of their career in a museum (or while continuing museum work at the same time). Presently there are about 700 members in the committee, of whom about 60% are from European countries and more than 20% live in Latin America.

ICOFOM is known for its expansion into parts of the world where museums are rapidly developing. In this regard, [[Nelly Decarolis]] and [[Tereza Scheiner]] started and sustained a subcommittee, ICOFOM LAM, or ICOFOM Latin America. The great success of this subcommittee prompted the formation of ICOFOM ASPAC, ICOFOM Asia and the South Pacific, under the strong leadership of Olga Truevtseva and [[Hildegard Vieregg]]. Regional subcommittees such as these provide important support and training for those interested in the work of ICOFOM but who cannot always get to annual meetings. in distant parts of the world.

Right from the start publications were a major part of ICOFOM activities. The first issues of ''Museological Working Papers'', published in 1980 and 1981, were followed by ''ICOFOM Study Series'' (ISS) published annually, which comprise in all several thousand pages and are available on line at the ICOFOM site. In general, ISS publishes papers presented at the ICOFOM symposiums. In 2007, the ICOFOM editorial committee installed a double-blind peer review of papers submitted for publication.

ICOFOM has also published syntheses of museology: ''What is a museum?'',&lt;ref&gt;A. Davis, F. Mairesse, and André Desvallées, ''What is a Museum?'' Munich, Verlag Müller-Straten, 2011. (Original French text by François Mairesse &amp; André Desvallées, ''Vers une redefinition du musée'', Paris, L’Harmattan, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt; the translation into English of the French monograph ''Vers une redéfiniton du musée'', edited in the framework of discussions regarding a new definition of Museum by [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] for its revised Statues in 2007. More recently, in 2010, ICOFOM edited ''Key Concepts of Museology'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom.museum/professional-standards/key-concepts-of-museology/ Available on the ICOM site in different languages].&lt;/ref&gt; a summary that has been translated into 8 languages, of the major points of the ''Dictionnaire Encyclopédique de Muséologie'' published in 2011. This encyclopaedic dictionary of 722 pages, with thematic articles and amply illustrated, is the result of work begun in ICOFOM in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;A.

[[File:MZES Uni Mannheim A5.jpg|thumb|Main building of the MZES in the square A 5]]
The '''Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)''' is an interdisciplinary research institute of the [[University of Mannheim]], founded in 1989. It is located in the square A5 of the city of Mannheim nearby the [[Mannheim Palace]].

The institute devotes itself to research on societal and political developments in [[Europe]]. Research focus is located in comparative research on Europe and the investigation of the [[European integration]]. The MZES mainly carries out basic research, financed by external funds from the German national research foundation (''Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft''), foundations promoting scientific research, and research funds from the [[European Union]]. Furthermore, the MZES, closely related to the ''School of Social Sciences'' of the University of Mannheim, gives training and support to young social scientists, when starting their scientific careers. At present, approximately 80 social scientists and 60 students are working at the MZES. Thus, the MZES is the largest institute of the University of Mannheim, and the largest research institute of a German university in the field of the social sciences.

From 1989–1998 the institute was composed of four work units:
* I Social structure and the Welfare State
* II Elections and Policy Research
* III Political and Social Integration
* IV German Democratic Republic / East Europe (1992 to 1998)

In 1999, these four work units were reduced to two research departments:
* Research Department A, ''The European Societies and their Integration'': since February 2017 directed by the sociologist ''Henning Hillmann''.
* Research Department B, ''The European Political Systems and their Integration '': since February 2017 directed by the political scientist ''Harald Schoen''.

The director and the heads of the research departments together form the executive board of the institute. The activity of the executive board and the institute is controlled by a supervisory board. The institute's research program is outlined for three years and evaluated by an international scientific advisory board. An ''annual report'' informs about the institute's activity.

== Directors ==
The director is elected by the supervisory board for a period of three years.
* [[Peter Flora]] 1989–1992 founding director, sociology
* Franz Urban Pappi 1993–1995, political science
* [[Peter Flora]] 1996–1998, sociology
* Jan W. van Deth 1999–2001, political science
* Walter Müller 2002–2004, sociology
* Wolfgang C. Müller 2005–2007, political science
* [[Bernhard Ebbinghaus]] 2008–2011, sociology
* Rüdiger Schmitt-Beck 2011-2014, political science
* Frank Kalter 2014-2017, sociology
* Marc Debus 2017-, political science

A managing director supports the director in his/her work. This position was held from 1989–1997 by Andreas Weber, and from 1998–2009 by Reinhart Schneider. Since 2010 Philipp Heldmann is managing director of the institute.

'''Melzer's reagent''' (also known as '''Melzer's solution''' or informally as '''Melzer's''') is a [[chemical reagent]] used by [[mycologist]]s to assist with the identification of [[fungi]].

==Composition==
Melzer's reagent is an [[aqueous solution]] of [[chloral hydrate]], [[potassium iodide]], and [[iodine]]. Depending on the formulation, it consists of approximately 2.50-3.75% potassium iodide and 0.75–1.25% iodine, with the remainder of the solution being 50% water and 50% chloral hydrate.&lt;ref name=largent&gt;Largent D, et al. 1977. ''How to Identify Mushrooms to Genus III: Microscopic Features''. Arcata, CA: Mad River Press. {{ISBN|0-916422-09-7}}. p 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller OK, Miller H. 2006. ''North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi''. Guilford, CT: Falcon Guide. {{ISBN|0-7627-3109-5}}. p 549.&lt;/ref&gt; Melzer's is toxic to humans if ingested due to the presence of iodine and chloral hydrate.&lt;ref name=leonard/&gt; Due to the legal status of [[chloral hydrate]], Melzer's reagent is difficult to obtain. To cope with the problems procuring chloral hydrate, Rutgers scientists have developed a working substitute for use in Microscopy known as  [http://visikol.com Visikol™],&lt;ref&gt;http://otc.rutgers.edu/pdf/Simon-2012-146.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is compatible with [[Lugol's iodine]], forming a legal but mediocre replacement for Melzer's.

Melzer's reagent is part of a class of iodine/potassium iodide (IKI)-containing reagents used in biology; Lugol's iodine is another such formula.

==Reactions==
Melzer's is used by exposing fungal tissue or cells to the reagent, typically in a [[microscope slide]] preparation, and looking for any of three color reactions:
* [[Amyloid (mycology)|Amyloid]] or Melzer's-positive reaction, in which the material reacts blue to black.
* Pseudoamyloid or [[dextrinoid]] reaction, in which the material reacts brown to reddish brown.
* Inamyloid or Melzer's-negative, in which the tissues do not change color, or react faintly yellow-brown.&lt;ref name=largent/&gt;

Among the amyloid reaction, two types can be distinguished:
* Euamyloid reaction, in which the material turns blue without [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH)-pretreatment.
* Hemiamyloid reaction, in which the material turns red in [[Lugol's solution]], but shows no reaction in Melzer's reagent; when KOH-pretreated it turns blue in both reagents.&lt;ref name=baral&gt;Baral H-O. 1987. [http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0029/0399.htm Lugol's solution/IKI versus Melzer's reagent: Hemiamyloidity, a universal feature of the ascus wall.] ''Mycotaxon'' 29:399–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melzer's reactions are typically almost immediate, though in some cases the reaction may take up to 20 minutes to develop.&lt;ref name=largent/&gt;

The function of the chemicals that make up Melzer's reagent are several. The chloral hydrate is a [[clearing agent]], bleaching and improving the transparency of various dark-colored microscopic materials. The potassium iodide is used to improve the [[solubility]] of the iodine, which is otherwise only semi-soluble in water. Iodine is thought to be the main active staining agent in Melzer's; it is thought to [[iodine test|react with starch-like polysaccharides]] in the cell walls of amyloid material, however, its mechanism of action is not entirely understood. It has been observed that hemiamyloid material reacts differently when exposed to Melzer's than it does when exposed to other IKI solutions such as Lugol's, and that in some cases an amyloid reaction is shown in material that had prior exposure to KOH, but an inamyloid reaction without such pretreatment.&lt;ref name=baral/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn LM, Korf RP. 1975. [http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0003/001/0165.htm Variation in ascomycete iodine reactions: KOH pretreatment explored.] ''Mycotaxon'' 3:165–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment in which spores from 35 species of [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]] were tested for reactions to both Melzer's and Lugol's showed that spores in a large percentage of the species tested display very different reactions between the two reagents. These varied from being weakly or non-reactive in Lugols, to giving iodine-positive reactions in Lugol's but not in Melzer's, to even giving dextrinoid reactions in Lugol's while giving amyloid reactions in Melzer's.&lt;ref name=leonard&gt;Leonard LM. 2006. [http://www.namyco.org/images/pdf%20files/Melzer__Lugo.pdf Melzer's, Lugol's, or iodine for identification of white-spored Agaricales?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025325/http://www.namyco.org/images/pdf%20files/Melzer__Lugo.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }} ''McIlvainea'' 16(1):43–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melzer's degrades into a cloudy precipitate when combined with alkaline solutions,&lt;ref name=largent/&gt; hence it cannot be used in combination or in direct series with such common mycological reagents such as potassium hydroxide or [[ammonium hydroxide]] solutions. When potassium hydroxide is used as a pretreatment, the alkalinity must be first neutralized before adding Melzer's.

==History==
The use of iodine-containing solutions as an aid to describing and identifying fungi dates back to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=leonard/&gt;

Melzer's reagent was first described in 1924 and takes its name from its inventor, the mycologist [[Václav Melzer]], who modified an older chloral hydrate-containing IKI solution developed by botanist [[Arthur Meyer (botanist)|Arthur Meyer]].&lt;ref name=baral/&gt; Melzer was a specialist in ''[[Russula]]'', a genus in which the amyloidy on the [[spore]] ornamentation or entire spore is of great taxonomic significance.&lt;ref&gt;The Russulales News Team. 2007.

A '''mesenchymal–epithelial transition''' ('''MET''') is a reversible biological process that involves the transition from motile, multipolar or spindle-shaped [[mesenchymal cell]]s to planar arrays of polarized cells called [[epithelia]].  MET is the reverse process of [[epithelial–mesenchymal transition]] (EMT).  Unlike epithelial cells – which are stationary and characterized by an apical-basal polarity, [[tight junction]]s, and expression of cell-cell adhesion markers such as [[E-cadherin]], mesenchymal cells do not make mature cell-cell contacts, can invade through the [[extracellular matrix]], and express markers such as [[vimentin]], [[fibronectin]], [[N-cadherin]], [[Twist transcription factor|Twist]], and [[SNAI1|Snail]].&lt;ref name="pmid18343170 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baum B, Settleman J, Quinlan MP | title = Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states in development and disease | journal=Semin Cell Dev Biol | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 294–308 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18343170 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.semcdb.2008.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12189386"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thiery JP. | title = Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in tumour progression | journal=Nat Rev Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 442–54 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12189386 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1038/nrc822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  METs occur in normal development, cancer [[metastasis]], and induced [[pluripotent stem cell]] reprogramming.

==In development==
During [[embryogenesis]] and early development, cells switch back and forth between different cellular phenotypes via MET and its reverse process, [[epithelial–mesenchymal transition]] (EMT).

===Nephrogenesis===
One example of this, the most well described of the developmental METs, is kidney [[ontogenesis]].  The mammalian kidney is primarily formed by two early structures: the ureteric bud and the nephrogenic mesenchyme, which form the collecting duct and nephrons respectively (see [[kidney development]] for more details).  During kidney ontogenesis, a reciprocal induction of the ureteric bud epithelium and nephrogenic mesenchyme occurs.  As the ureteric bud grows out of the Wolffian duct, the nephrogenic mesenchyme induces the ureteric bud to branch.  Concurrently, the ureteric bud induces the nephrogenic mesenchyme to condense around the bud and undergo MET to form the renal epithelium, which ultimately forms the nephron.&lt;ref name="pmid8395349"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kreidberg JA, Sariola H, Loring JM, Maeda M, Pelletier J, Housman D, Jaenisch R | title = WT-1 is required for early kidney development | journal=Cell | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 679–91 | year = 1993 | pmid =8395349 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(93)90515-R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Growth factors, integrins, cell adhesion molecules, and protooncogenes, such as ''c-ret'', ''c-ros'', and ''c-met'', mediate the reciprocal induction in metanephrons and consequent MET.&lt;ref name="pmid10508232"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horster MF, Braun GS, Huber SM | title = Embryonic Renal Epithelia: Induction, Nephrogenesis, and Cell Differentiation | journal=Physiol Rev | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 1157–91| year = 1999 | pmid = 10508232 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somitogenesis===
Another example of developmental MET occurs during [[somitogenesis]].  Vertebrate somites, the precursors of axial bones and trunk skeletal muscles, are formed by the maturation of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  The PSM, which is composed of mesenchymal cells, undergoes segmentation by delineating somite boundaries (see [[somitogenesis]] for more details).  Each somite is encapsulated by an epithelium, formerly mesenchymal cells that had undergone MET.  Two [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho family GTPases]] – [[Cdc42]] and [[Rac1]] – as well as the transcription factor [[Paraxis]] are required for chick somitic MET.&lt;ref name="pmid15363416"/&gt;

==In cancer==
While relatively little is known about the role MET plays in cancer when compared to the extensive studies of EMT in tumor metastasis, MET is believed to participate in the establishment and stabilization of distant metastases by allowing cancerous cells to regain epithelial properties and integrate into distant organs.&lt;ref name="pmid18539112"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang J, Weinberg RA | title = Epithelial-mesenchymal transition: at the crossroads of development and tumor metastasis | journal=Dev Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 818–26| year = 2008| pmid = 18539112 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2008.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, researchers have begun to investigate MET as one of many potential therapeutic targets in the prevention of metastases.&lt;ref name=Patt2016&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/aad3680 Activation of PKA leads to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and loss of tumor-initiating ability. March 2016.] doi=10.1126/science.aad3680&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to preventing metastasis is known as differentiation-based therapy or [[differentiation therapy]].

==In iPS  cell reprogramming==
A number of different cellular processes must take place in order for somatic cells to undergo reprogramming into [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPS cells).  iPS cell reprogramming, also known as somatic cell reprogramming, can be achieved by ectopic expression of Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc (OKSM).&lt;ref name="pmid16904174"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal=Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 6 | pages = 652–5| year = 2006| pmid = 16904174| url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon induction, mouse fibroblasts must undergo MET to successfully begin the initiation phase of reprogramming.  Epithelial-associated genes such as E-cadherin/Cdh1, Cldns −3, −4, −7, −11, Occludin (Ocln), Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Epcam), and Crumbs homolog 3 (Crb3), were all upregulated before [[Homeobox protein NANOG|Nanog]], a key transcription factor in maintaining pluripotency, was turned on.  Additionally, mesenchymal-associated genes such as Snail, Slug, Zeb −1, −2, and N-cadherin were downregulated within the first 5 days post-OKSM induction.&lt;ref name="pmid20621051"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samavarchi-Tehrani P, Golipour A, David L, Sung HK, Beyer TA, Datti A, Woltjen K, Nagy A, Wrana JL | title = Functional genomics reveals a BMP-driven mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the initiation of somatic cell reprogramming | journal=Cell Stem Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–77 | year = 2010| pmid = 20621051| url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2010.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Addition of exogenous TGF-β1, which blocks MET, decreased iPS reprogramming efficiency significantly.&lt;ref name="pmid20621050"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li R, Liang J, Ni S, Zhou T, Qing X, Li H, He W, Chen J, Li F, Zhuang Q, Qin B, Xu J, Li W, Yang J, Gan Y, Qin D, Feng S, Song H, Yang D, Zhang B, Zeng L, Lai L, Esteban MA, Pei D | title = A mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition initiates and is required for the nuclear reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts | journal=Cell Stem Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–63 | year = 2010| pmid = 20621050 | url = | issn = | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2010.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings are all consistent with previous observations that [[embryonic stem cell]]s resemble epithelial cells and express E-cadherin.&lt;ref name="pmid18343170 "/&gt;

Recent studies have suggested that ectopic expression of Klf4 in iPS cell reprogramming may be specifically responsible for inducing E-cadherin expression by binding to promoter regions and the first intron of ''CDH1'' (the gene encoding for E-cadherin).&lt;ref name="pmid20621050"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">A '''model transformation''', in [[model-driven engineering]], is an automated way of modifying and creating models. An example use of model transformation is ensuring that a family of [[Computer model|model]]s is consistent, in a precise sense which the software engineer can define. The aim of using a model transformation is to save effort and reduce errors by automating the building and modification of models where possible.

== Overview ==
Model transformations can be thought of as programs that take models as input. There is a wide variety of kinds of model transformation and uses of them, which differ in their inputs and outputs and also in the way they are expressed.

A model transformation usually specifies which models are acceptable as input, and if appropriate what models it may produce as output, by specifying the [[Metamodeling|metamodel]] to which a model must conform.

== Classification of model transformations ==

Model transformations and languages for them have been classified in many ways.&lt;ref name="CzarneckiHelsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens-landscape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jakumeit"/&gt;
Some of the more common distinctions drawn are:

=== Number and type of inputs and outputs ===

In principle a model transformation may have many inputs and outputs of various types; the only absolute limitation is that a model transformation will take at least one model as input. However, a model transformation that did not produce any model as output would more commonly be called a model analysis or model query.

=== Endogenous versus exogenous ===

Endogenous transformations are transformations between models expressed in the same language. Exogenous transformations are transformations between models expressed using different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mens, Pieter Van Gorp: A Taxonomy of Model Transformation. Electr. Notes Theor. Comput. Sci. 152: 125-142 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a process conforming to the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] [[Model Driven Architecture]], a [[platform-independent model]] might be transformed into a [[platform-specific model]] by an exogenous model transformation.

=== Unidirectional versus bidirectional ===

A unidirectional model transformation has only one mode of execution: that is, it always takes the same type of input and produces the same type of output.  Unidirectional model transformations are useful in compilation-like situations, where any output model is read-only. The relevant notion of consistency is then very simple: the input model is consistent with the model that the transformation would produce as output, only.

For a bidirectional model transformation, the same type of model can sometimes be input and other times be output. [[Bidirectional transformation]]s are necessary in situations where people are working on more than one model and the models must be kept consistent. Then a change to either model might necessitate a change to the other, in order to maintain consistency between the models. Because each model can incorporate information which is not reflected in the other, there may be many models which are consistent with a given model. Important special cases are:

*bijective transformations, in which there is exactly one model which is consistent with any given model; that is, the consistency relation is bijective. A pair of models is consistent if and only if it is related by the consistency bijection. Both models contain the same information, but presented differently.
*view transformations, in which a concrete model determines a single view model, but the same view model might be produced from many different concrete models. The view model is an abstraction of the concrete model. If the view may be updated, a bidirectional transformation is needed. This situation is known in the database field as [[View (database)|view-update]]. Any concrete model is consistent with its view.

It is particularly important that a bidirectional model transformation has appropriate properties to make it behave sensibly: for example, not making changes unnecessarily, or discarding deliberately made changes.&lt;ref name="Stevens-properties"/&gt;

== Languages for model transformations ==

{{Main|Model transformation language}}

A model transformation may be written in a general purpose programming language, but specialised model transformation languages are also available. Bidirectional transformations, in particular, are best written in a language that ensures the directions are appropriately related. The [[Object Management Group|OMG]]-standardised model transformation languages are collectively known as [[QVT]].

In some model transformation languages, for example the [[QVT]] languages, a model transformation is itself a model, that is, it conforms to a metamodel which is part of the model transformation language's definition. This facilitates the definition of '''Higher Order Transformation'''s (HOTs),&lt;ref name="Tisi"/&gt; i.e. transformations which have other transformations as input and/or output.

[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 12.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Hanged Man (tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] from [[Tarot]] decks is thought to be typical of ''pittura infamante'' frescoes, although none are extant]]
[[File:pitturainfamantesketch.jpg|thumb|right|Preparatory drawings for ''pittura infamante'' by [[Andrea del Sarto]]]]
[[File:schandbild.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] ''[[:de:schandbild|schandbild]]'' (circa 1490)]]

'''''Pittura infamante''''' ({{IPA-it|pitˈtuːra imfaˈmante|pron}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] for "defaming portrait"; plural ''pitture infamanti'') is a [[genre]] of [[defamation|defamatory]] [[painting]] and [[relief]], common in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] in [[city-state]]s in the north and center of the [[Italian Peninsula]] during the [[Trecento]], [[Quattrocento]], and [[Cinquecento]].&lt;ref name="edgerton"/&gt; Popular subjects of ''pittura infamante'' include [[treason|traitors]], [[theft|thieves]], and those guilty of [[bankruptcy]] or public [[fraud]], often in cases where no legal remedy was available. Commissioned by governments of [[city-state]]s and displayed in public centers, ''pittura infamante'' were both a form of "municipal justice" (or "forensic art"&lt;ref name="ed31"&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a medium for internal political struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Wieruszowski, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Samuel Edgerton, the genre began to decline precisely when it came to be regarded as a [[form of art]] rather than [[effigy]]; the power of the genre derived from a feudal-based [[code of honor]], where [[shame]] was one of the most significant [[social punishment]]s.&lt;ref name="edgerton"&gt;Edgerton, 1985. Chapters 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''pittura infamante'' has its roots in the doctrines of ''[[pheme|fama]]'' and ''[[infamia]]'' in ancient [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="mills38"&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
''Pitture infamanti'' could appear in any public place, but some places were more frequently adorned with them; for example, the first floor exterior of the [[Bargello]] periodically contained numerous, life-size, ''pittura infamante'' [[fresco]]es. Florentine law required the ''[[Podestà]]]'' have such caricatures painted, and accompanied by verbal identification those held in [[contempt of court]] for financial offenses (bad debt, bankruptcy, fraud, forgery, etc.).&lt;ref name="ed2"/&gt; ''Pitture infamanti'' were far more common in [[Republic of Florence|Republican Florence]] than in [[Italian city-states|autocratic city states]], whose rulers often deemed them to be sources of "disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Common themes of ''pittura infamante''&amp;mdash;which were meant to be humiliating&amp;mdash;include depicting the subject as wearing a mitre or hanging upside down, being in the presence of unclean animals such as pigs or donkeys or those deemed evil like snakes; ''pittura infamante'' would also contain captions listing the offenses of the subject.&lt;ref name="dean7"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pittura infamante'' could originate as more favorable depictions, only to be transformed after the subject had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imagery==
''Pittura infamante'' always depicted men and never women, and generally depicted upper class men (who would have the most to lose from [[character assassination]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The act of hanging itself was also significant, as affluent criminals would generally be afforded the privilege of beheading rather than hanging; hanging was also shameful in religious contexts (e.g. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The [[Literary topos|topos]] of ''mundus inversus'' ("world upside down") is often associated with comedy and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous artists who painted ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes include [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Andrea del Sarto]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving examples of ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes, but contemporary sources suggest that they were brightly colored.&lt;ref name="ed31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dean7"/&gt; Detailed descriptions of ''pitture infamanti'' in primary sources are rare.&lt;ref name="dean45"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; A very few preparatory drawings, however, are extant, and [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] from [[Tarot]] cards is thought to resemble the archetypal ''pittura infamante'' theme, as Tarot decks were first produced in northern Italy in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt;

==Records==
Documentary evidence for ''pittura infamante'' outside Italy is rarer but existent. For example, records support the use of "very unpleasant pictures" painted on cloths during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in [[France]], and&amp;mdash;later&amp;mdash;in [[England]] and north [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pitture infamanti'' were the counterpoint of another contemporary form of secular, full-length portrait: ''uomini famosi'' ("famous men") or ''uomini illustri'' ("illustrious men"), which depicted figures from the [[Old Testament]] or [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] in a positive context, generally on the interior of private or civic buildings as moral exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects of ''pittura infamante''==
;Bologna
*[[Konrad von Landau]], painted on the walls of [[Bologna]] for treachery; in response Landau created his own "''pittura infamante''" on the saddle of his horse, depicting the local politicians hung upside down by their feet in the hand of a giant whore.&lt;ref&gt;Caferro, 2006, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Fermo
*[[Rinaldo da Monteverde]], the papal governor of [[Fermo]], "fell victim to humiliating popular justice" in the form of a ''pittura infamante''.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights |By claimant}}

'''Plant rights''' are [[rights]] to which [[plant]]s may be entitled. Such issues are often raised in connection with discussions about [[human rights]], [[animal rights]], [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], or [[sentiocentrism]].

==Philosophy==
[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' contains a chapter, "The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ButErew-ButErew-c27.html|chapter=The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables|title=Erewhon|author=Butler, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of whether animal rights can be extended to plants, animal rights philosopher [[Tom Regan]] argues that animals acquire rights due to being aware, what he calls "subjects-of-a-life". He argues that this does not apply to plants, and that even if plants did have rights, abstaining from eating meat would still be moral due to the use of plants to rear animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Regan|first=Tom|title=Animal rights, human wrongs: an introduction to moral philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmBksH1k2RMC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-7425-3354-9|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher [[Michael Marder]], the idea that plants should have rights derives from "plant subjectivity", which is distinct from human personhood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/2013120141156284755.html&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]] holds that all life has [[inherent worth]] and argues for respect for plants, but does not assign them rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vesilind|first1=P. Aarne|last2=Gunn|first2=Alastair S.|title=Engineering, ethics, and the environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFaNf3XdJjIC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58918-5|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher D. Stone, the son of [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[I.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Stone]], proposed in a 1972 paper titled "Should Trees Have Standing?" that if corporations are assigned rights, so should natural objects such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Christopher D.|title=Should Trees Have Standing? Law, Morality, and the Environment|edition=Third|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-973607-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=Christopher D.|year=1972|title=Should Trees Have Standing--Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects|journal=Southern California Law Review|volume=45|pages=450–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- If you feel that this paragraph should be deleted, please explain why on the article talk page. --&gt;Whilst not appealing directly to "rights", Matthew Hall has argued that plants should be included within the realm of human moral consideration. His "Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany" discusses the moral background of plants in western philosophy and contrasts this with other traditions, including indigenous cultures, which recognise plants as persons—active, intelligent beings that are appropriate recipients of respect and care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Matthew|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|year=2011|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=1-4384-3428-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall backs up his call for the ethical consideration of plants with arguments based on [[plant neurobiology]], which says that plants are autonomous, perceptive organisms capable of complex, adaptive behaviours, including the recognition of self/non-self.

==Scientific arguments==
In the study of [[plant physiology]], plants are understood to have mechanisms by which they recognize environmental changes. This definition of [[Plant perception (physiology)|plant perception]] differs from the notion that plants are capable of feeling emotions, an idea also called [[plant perception (paranormal)|plant perception]]. The latter concept, along with [[plant intelligence]], can be traced to 1848, when [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], a German [[experimental psychologist]], suggested that plants are capable of [[emotion]]s, and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, and affection.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Heidelberger ''Nature from within: Gustav Theodor Fechner and his psychophysical worldview'' 2004, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Swiss Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology analyzed scientific data on plants, and concluded in 2009 that plants are entitled to a certain amount of "dignity", but "dignity of plants is not an absolute value."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The dignity of plants|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|first=Florianne|last=Koechlin|date=January 2009|volume=4|issue=1|pages=78–79|doi=10.4161/psb.4.1.7315|pmid=19568336|pmc=2634081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-issue Party for Plants entered candidates in the 2010 parliamentary election in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINTRE62S2HA20100329|title=Plant rights party to contest next Dutch election|date=March 29, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2010|publisher=Reuters|first=Ben|last=Berkowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on topics such as climate, biodiversity and sustainability in general. Such concerns have been criticized as evidence that modern culture is "causing us to lose the ability to think critically and distinguish serious from frivolous ethical concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Silent Scream of the Asparagus|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/065njdoe.asp|author=Smith, Wesley J.|date=May 12, 2008|volume=13|issue=33|publisher=Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal arguments==
[[File:Justice William O Douglas.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Justice [[William O. Douglas]], author of a noted dissent about the legal standing of plants]]
In his dissent to the 1972 ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'' decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]], Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote about whether plants might have [[standing (law)|legal standing]]:
{{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a fiction found useful for maritime purposes... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life...The voice of the inanimate object, therefore, should not be stilled.}}

The [[Swiss Constitution]] contains a provision requiring "account to be taken of the dignity of creation when handling animals, plants and other organisms", and the [[Swiss government]] has conducted ethical studies pertaining to how the dignity of plants is to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The dignity of plants|pmc=2634081|author=Florianne Koechlin|publisher=Plant Signal Behav.|date=January 2009|volume=4|issue=1|pages=78–79|pmid=19568336|doi=10.4161/psb.4.1.7315}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, a river in New Zealand, including the plants and other organisms contained within its boundaries, was legally declared a person with standing (via guardians) to bring legal actions to protect its interests.&lt;ref&gt;Vines T, Bruce A Faunce TA.

==Popular arguments==
When challenged by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] to become [[vegetarian]], [[Timothy McVeigh]] argued that "plants are alive too, they react to stimuli (including pain); have circulation systems, etc".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF02x.htm|title=McVeigh to PeTA: "Where Do You Draw the Line?"|publisher=Fur Commission|date=May 7, 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922060922/http://furcommission.com/news/newsF02x.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/71380695.html?dids=71380695:71380695&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+17%2C+2001&amp;author=Lloyd+Grove+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=The+Reliable+Source&amp;pqatl=google|title=The Reliable Source|publisher=Washington Post|first=Lloyd|last=Grove|authorlink=Lloyd Grove|page=C3|date=April 17, 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Animal Liberation Front]] argues that there is no evidence that plants can experience pain, and that to the extent they respond to stimuli, it is like a device such as a [[thermostat]] responding to sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Morality/Biology/InsectAR.htm#faq42|chapter=Isn't it hypocritical to kill and eat plants?|title=FAQs Insects, Plants|publisher=Animal Liberation Front}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Inrush Current into HVDC Capacitor.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Peak inrush current into a high voltage capacitor upon power up can stress the component, reducing its reliability.]]

'''Pre-charge''' of the powerline [[voltages]] in a high voltage [[Direct current|DC]] application is a preliminary mode which limits the inrush current during the power up procedure. 

A high-voltage system with a large capacitive load can be exposed to high electric current during initial turn-on. This current, if not limited, can cause considerable stress or damage to the system components. In some applications, the occasion to activate the system is a rare occurrence, such as in commercial utility power distribution.  In other systems such as vehicle applications, pre-charge will occur with each use of the system, multiple times per day.  Precharging is implemented to increase the lifespan of electronic components and increase reliability of the high voltage system.

== Background:  inrush currents into capacitors==
[[Inrush current|Inrush currents]] into [[capacitive]] components are a key concern in power-up stress to components. When DC input power is applied to a capacitive load, the step response of the voltage input will cause the input capacitor to charge.  The capacitor charging starts with an inrush current and ends with an exponential decay down to the steady state condition.  When the magnitude of the inrush peak is very large compared to the maximum rating of the components, then component stress is to be expected.  
The current into a capacitor is known to be &lt;math&gt;I = C(dV/dT)&lt;/math&gt;: the peak inrush current will depend upon the [[capacitance]] C and the rate of change of the [[voltage]] (dV/dT).  The inrush current will increase as the capacitance value increases, and the inrush current will increase as the voltage of the power source increases.  This second parameter is of primary concern in high voltage power distribution systems.  By their nature, high voltage power sources will deliver high voltage into the distribution system.  Capacitive loads will then be subject to high inrush currents upon power-up.  The stress to the components must be understood and minimized.

The objective of a pre-charge function is to limit the magnitude of the inrush current into capacitive loads during power-up.  This may take several seconds depending on the system.  In general, higher voltage systems benefit from longer pre-charge times during power-up.

Consider an example where a high voltage source powers up a typical electronics control unit which has an internal power supply with 11000 µF input capacitance. When powered from a 28 V source, the inrush current into the electronics unit would approach 31 amperes in 10 milliseconds.  If that same circuit is activated by a 610 V source, then the inrush current would approach 670 A in 10 milliseconds.  It is wise not to allow unlimited inrush currents from high voltage power distribution system activation into capacitive loads: instead the inrush current should be controlled to avoid power-up stress to components.

== Definition of a pre-charge function==
[[Image:Precharge.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Precharging a high voltage DC power distribution line can control the inrush current into capacitive components, reducing stress and supporting a long component life.]]

The functional requirement of the high voltage pre-charge circuit is to minimize the peak current out from the power source by slowing down the ''dV''/''dT'' of the input power voltage such that a new “pre-charge mode” is created. Of course the inductive loads on the distribution system must be switched off during the precharge mode.  While pre-charging, the system voltage will rise slowly and controllably with power-up current never exceeding the maximum allowed.  As the circuit voltage approaches near steady state, then the pre-charge function is complete.  Normal operation of a pre-charge circuit is to terminate pre-charge mode when the circuit voltage is 90% or 95% of the operating voltage.  Upon completion of pre-charging, the pre-charge resistance is switched out of the power supply circuit and returns to a low impedance power source for normal mode.  The high voltage loads are then powered up sequentially.

The simplest inrush-current limiting system, used in many consumer electronics devices, is a [[thermistor|NTC resistor]]. When cold, its high resistance allows a small current to pre-charge the [[reservoir capacitor]]. After it warms up, its low resistance more efficiently passes the working current.

Many [[active power factor correction]] systems also include [[soft start]].

If the example circuit from before is used with a pre-charge circuit which limits the ''dV''/''dT'' to less than 600 volts per second, then the inrush current will be reduced from 670 amperes to 7 amperes.  This is a “kinder and gentler” way to activate a high voltage DC power distribution system.

== Benefits of pre-charging==

The primary benefit of avoiding component stress during power-up is to realize a long system operating life due to reliable and long lasting components.  

There are additional benefits:  pre-charging reduces the electrical hazards which may occur when the system integrity is compromised due to hardware damage or failure.  Activating the high voltage DC system into a short circuit or a ground fault or into unsuspecting personnel and their equipment can have undesired effects.  [[Arc flash]] will be minimized if a pre-charge function slows down the activation time of a high voltage power-up.  A slow pre-charge will also reduce the voltage into a faulty circuit which builds up while the system diagnostics come on-line. This allows a diagnostic shut down before the fault is fully realized in worst case proportions.

In cases where unlimited inrush current is large enough to trip the source [[circuit breaker]], a slow precharge may even be required to avoid the nuisance trip.

Pre-charging is commonly used in [[battery electric vehicle]] applications. The current to the motor is regulated by a ''controller'' that employs large capacitors in its input circuit. Such systems typically have ''contactors'' (a high-current  [[relay]]) to disable the system during inactive periods and to act as an emergency disconnect should the motor current regulator fail in an active state. Without pre-charge the high voltage across the contactors and inrush current can cause a brief [[Electric arc|arc]] which will cause pitting of the contacts. Pre-charging the controller input capacitors (typically to 90 to 95 percent of applied battery voltage) eliminates the pitting problem. The current to maintain the charge is so low that some systems apply the pre-charge at all times other than when charging batteries, while more complex systems apply pre-charge as part of the starting sequence and will defer main contactor closure until the pre-charge voltage level is detected as sufficiently high.

'''The Quiescent Centre''' is a group of cells, up to 1,000 in number, in the form of a hemisphere, with the flat face toward the root tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clowes|first=F. a. L.|date=1958-03-01|title=Development of Quiescent Centres in Root Meristems|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=57|issue=1|pages=85–88|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1958.tb05918.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a region in the apical meristem of a root where cell division proceeds very slowly or not at all, but the cells are capable of resuming meristematic activity should tissue surrounding them be damaged.
Cells of root apical meristems do not all divide at the same rate. Determinations of relative rates of [[DNA]] synthesis show that primary roots of Zea, Vicia and Allium have quiescent centres to the meristems, in which the cells divide rarely or never in the course of normal root growth (Clowes, 1956a, b). Such a quiescent centre includes the cells at the apices of the histogens of both stele and cortex. Its presence can be deduced from the anatomy of the apex in Zea (Clowes, 1954), but not in the other species which lack discrete histogens.

==History==
In 1953, during the course of analysing the organization and function of the root apices, Frederick Albert Lionel Clowes (born 10 September 1921), at the School of Botany (now Department of Plant Sciences), [[University of Oxford]], proposed the term ‘cytogenerative centre’ to denote ‘the region of an apical meristem from which all future cells are derived’. This term had been suggested to him by Mr Harold K. Pusey, a lecturer in embryology at the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at the same University. The 1953 paper of Clowes reported results of his experiments on Fagus sylvatica and Vicia faba, in which small oblique and wedge-shaped excisions were made at the tip of the primary root, at the most distal level of the root body, near the boundary with the root cap. The results of these experiments were striking and showed that: the root which grew on following the excision was normal at the undamaged meristem side; the nonexcised meristem portion contributed to the regeneration of the excised portion; the regenerated part of the root had abnormal patterning and ‘remained so for a time considered sufficiently long for the complete replacement of all the derivatives of the initials’. The main conclusion from these experiments was that the root tissues originated from a promeristem which was considered to be ‘cytogenerative centre’, also called ‘cytogenetic centre’, ‘ontogenetic centre’, and ‘constructional centre’. Frederick Albert Lionel Clowes indicated that the cytogenerative centre was a property of roots with broad columellas (i.e. of roots having an ‘open’ type of apical meristem, as was the case in the roots of the two species studied). He then wished to know whether the same property applied to thinner roots with narrow columellas (i.e. roots with a ‘closed’ type of meristem). Using roots of Zea mays and Triticum vulgare, this indeed turned out to be the case, and he was then able to state that ‘the cytogenerative centre is conceived as the part of the apical meristem from which all future tissues are derived’. We may infer that Clowes regarded the cytogenerative centre as a universal feature of roots because he used the term also with respect to the structure and function of the root meristem of conifers.

'''Restoration ecology''' is the scientific study supporting the practice of '''ecological restoration''', which is the practice of renewing and restoring [[environmental degradation|degraded]], damaged, or destroyed [[ecosystem]]s and [[habitat]]s in the [[Natural environment|environment]] by active human intervention and action.

==Definition==

Restoration ecology is the academic study of the process, whereas ecological restoration is the actual project or process by restoration practitioners. The Society for Ecological Restoration defines "ecological restoration" as an "intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Society for Ecological Restoration International Science &amp; Policy Working Group|first=|date=2004|title=The SER International Primer on Ecological Restoration|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ser.org/resource/resmgr/custompages/publications/ser_publications/ser_primer.pdf|journal=www.ser.org &amp; Tucson: Society for Ecological Restoration International|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological restoration includes a wide scope of projects including [[erosion]] control, [[reforestation]], removal of [[non-native species]] and weeds, [[revegetation]] of disturbed areas, [[daylighting (streams)|daylighting streams]], reintroduction of [[native species]] (preferably native species that have [[local adaptation]]), and habitat and range improvement for targeted species.

[[E. O. Wilson]], a biologist, states, "Here is the means to end the great extinction spasm. The next century will, I believe, be the era of restoration in ecology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/691398594|title=The diversity of life|last=O.|first=Wilson, Edward|date=2010, ©1992|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674058170|edition=  1st Harvard University Press paperback |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=691398594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of restoration ecology==
'''Restoration ecology''' emerged as a separate field in [[ecology]] in the late twentieth century. "Restoration ecology" was not first formally identified as a distinct scientific field until the late twentieth century. The term was coined by [[John Aber]] and [[Bill Jordan (environmental critic)|William Jordan III]] when they were at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].&lt;ref name="jordan2011"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/750183084|title=Making nature whole : a history of ecological restoration|last=Jordan, III|first=W. R.|date=2011|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781610910422|location=Washington, DC|oclc=750183084}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[indigenous peoples]], land managers, stewards, and laypeople have been practicing ecological restoration or ecological management for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="anderson2005"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56103978|title=Tending the wild: Native American knowledge and the management of California's natural resources|last=Anderson|first=K.|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520238567|location=Berkeley|oclc=56103978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered the birthplace of modern ecological restoration, the first tallgrass prairie restoration was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum]].&lt;ref name="court2012"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/814694131|title=Pioneers of ecological restoration : the people and legacy of the University of Wisconsin Arboretum|last=Court|first=F. E.|date=2012|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299286630|location=Madison|oclc=814694131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jordan2011"/&gt; [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] workers replanted nearby prairie species onto a former horse pasture, overseen by university faculty including renowned ecologist [[Aldo Leopold]], botanist [[Theodore Sperry]], mycologist [[Henry C. Greene]], and plant ecologist [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]]. Curtis and his graduate students surveyed the whole of Wisconsin, documenting native species communities and creating the first species lists for tallgrass restorations.&lt;ref name="curtis1971"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811410421|title=The vegetation of Wisconsin : an ordination of plant communities|last=Curtis|first=J. T.|date=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299019433|location=Madison|oclc=811410421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing prairie remnants, such as locations within pioneer [[cemeteries]] and railroad rights-of-way, were located and inventoried by Curtis and his team. The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm]], and pioneering techniques like [[Controlled burn|prescribed burning]].&lt;ref name="court2012"/&gt;

The latter-half of the 20th century saw the growth of ecological restoration beyond Wisconsin borders. The 285-hectare Green Oaks Biological Field Station at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] began in 1955 under the guidance of zoologist Paul Shepard. It was followed by the 40-hectare Schulenberg Prairie at the [[Morton Arboretum]], started in 1962 by Ray Schulenberg and Bob Betz. Betz then worked with [[The Nature Conservancy]] to establish the 260-hectare [[Fermilab|Fermi National Laboratory]] tallgrass prairie in 1974.&lt;ref name="fermi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fermilab History &amp; Archives Project: Natural History - Prairie |url=https://history.fnal.gov/prairie.html |website=fnal.gov |publisher=Fermilab |accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These major tallgrass restoration projects marked the growth of ecological restoration from isolated studies to widespread practice.

Australia has also been the site of historically significant ecological restoration projects. In 1935 Ambrose Crawford commenced restoring a degraded four acres (1.7 hectares) patch of the Big Scrub (Lowland Tropical Rainforest) at Lumley Park reserve, Alstonville, in northern New South Wales. Clearing of weeds and planting of suitable indigenous flora species were his main restoration techniques. The restored rainforest reserve still exists today and is home to threatened plant and animal species. In 1936 [[Albert Morris]] and his restoration colleagues initiated the Broken Hill regeneration area project, which involved the natural regeneration of indigenous flora on a severely degraded site of hundreds of hectares in arid western New South Wales. Completed in 1958, the successful project still maintains ecological function today as the ''Broken Hill regeneration area''.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, William R. &amp; Lubick, George M.

== Theoretical foundations of restoration ecology ==

Restoration ecology draws on a wide range of ecological concepts.

=== Disturbance ===

[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] is a change in environmental conditions that disrupts the functioning of an ecosystem. Disturbance can occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and is a natural component of many communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173134455|title=Assembly rules and restoration ecology : bridging the gap between theory and practice|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Island Press|others=Temperton, Vicky M.|year=|isbn=9781429495134|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|chapter=Chapter 17: Disturbance, Succession, and Community Assembly in Terrestrial Plant Communities|oclc=173134455}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many forest and grassland restorations implement [[fire ecology|fire as a natural disturbance regime]]. However the severity and scope of anthropogenic impact has grown in the last few centuries. Differentiating between human-caused and naturally occurring disturbances is important if we are  to understand how to restore natural processes and minimize [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts on the ecosystems.

=== Succession ===

[[Ecological succession]] is the process by which a community changes over time, especially following a disturbance. In many instances, an ecosystem will change from a simple level of organization with  a few dominant [[pioneer species]] to an increasingly complex community with many interdependent species. Restoration often consists of initiating, assisting, or accelerating ecological successional processes, depending on the severity of the disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21376331|title=Directing ecological succession|last=1955-|first=Luken, James O.,|date=1990|publisher=Chapman and Hall|isbn=0412344505|edition= 1st |location=London|oclc=21376331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following mild to moderate natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances, restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories. However, in a system that has experienced a more severe disturbance (i.e. physical or chemical alteration of the environment), restoration may require intensive efforts to recreate environmental conditions that favor natural successional processes.

=== Fragmentation ===

[[Habitat fragmentation]] describes spatial discontinuities in a biological system, where ecosystems are broken up into smaller parts through land use changes (e.g. [[agriculture]]) and natural disturbance. This both reduces the size of the populations and increases the degree of isolation. These smaller and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Fragmenting ecosystems decreases quality of the habitat. The [[Edge effects|edge of a fragment]] has a different range of environmental conditions and therefore supports different species than the interior. Restorative projects can increase the effective size of a population by adding suitable habitat and decrease isolation by creating [[wildlife corridor|habitat corridor]]s that link isolated fragments. Reversing the effects of fragmentation is an important component of restoration ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Targeted habitat restoration can reduced extinction rates in fragrmented forests|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9635.abstract|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem function ===
Ecosystem function describes the most basic and essential foundational processes of any natural systems, including [[nutrient cycle]]s and [[Energy flow (ecology)|energy flux]]es. An understanding of the complexity of these ecosystem functions is necessary to address any ecological processes that may be degraded. Ecosystem functions are [[emergent properties]] of the [[Systems theory|system as a whole]], thus monitoring and [[Natural resource management|management]] are crucial for the long-term stability of ecosystems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}A fully functional ecosystem that is completely self-perpetuating is the ultimate goal of restorative efforts.

=== Community assembly ===

Community assembly "is a framework that can unify virtually all of (community) ecology under a single conceptual umbrella".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894509632|title=Urban ecology : an introduction|last=1936-|first=Douglas, Ian,|others=James, Philip (Professor of ecology),|isbn=9781136266966|location=New York, NY|oclc=894509632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community assembly theory attempts to explain the existence of environmentally similar sites with differing assemblages of species. It assumes that species have similar [[ecological niche|niche]] requirements, so that community formation is a product of random fluctuations from a common [[species pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P.|last2=Chase|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Huddleston|first3=Russell T.|date=2001|title=Community Succession and Assembly: Comparing, Contrasting and Combining Paradigms in the Context of Ecological Restoration|jstor=43440887|journal=Ecological Restoration|volume=19|issue=1|pages=5–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, if all species are fairly ecologically equivalent, then random variation in colonization, and migration and extinction rates between species, drive differences in species composition between sites with comparable environmental conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Population genetics ===
Genetic diversity has shown to be as important as species diversity for restoring ecosystem processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=A. Randall|last2=Inouye|first2=Brian D.|last3=Johnson|first3=Marc T. J.|last4=Underwood|first4=Nora|last5=Vellend|first5=Mark|date=2008-04-08|title=Ecological consequences of genetic diversity|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01179.x|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|pages=609–623|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01179.x|issn=1461-023X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence ecological restorations are increasingly factoring genetic processes into management practices.  Population genetic processes that are important to consider in restored populations include [[founder effect]]s, [[inbreeding depression]], [[outbreeding depression]], [[genetic drift]], and [[gene flow]]. Such processes can predict whether or not a species successfully establishes at a restoration site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montalvo|first=Arlee M.|last2=Rice|first2=Susan L.

== Applications of restoration ecology ==

=== Soil heterogeneity effects on community heterogeneity ===

Spatial heterogeneity of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity, and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated [[soil]] resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass [[prairie restoration]] project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which on its own was insufficient to insure [[species diversity]] in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings were consistent with the theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, [[adaptation|best adapted]] to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining the community structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baer|first=Sara G.|last2=Collins|first2=Scott L|last3=Blair|first3=John M.|last4=Knapp|first4=Alan K.|last5=Fiedler|first5=Anna K.|date=2005-06|title=Soil Heterogeneity Effects on Tallgrass Prairie Community Heterogeneity: An Application of Ecological Theory to Restoration Ecology|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00051.x|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=413–424|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2005.00051.x|issn=1061-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invasion and restoration ===

Restoration is used as a tool for reducing the spread of invasive plant species in a number of ways. The first method views restoration primarily as a means to reduce the presence of invasive species and limit their spread.  As this approach emphasizes control of invaders, the restoration techniques can differ from typical restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epanchin-Niell|first=Rebecca|last2=Englin|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Nalle|first3=Darek|date=November 2009|title=Investing in rangeland restoration in the Arid West, USA: Countering the effects of an invasive weed on the long-term fire cycle|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479709003004|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=91|issue=2|pages=370–379|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Török|first=Péter|last2=Miglécz|first2=Tamás|last3=Valkó|first3=Orsolya|last4=Kelemen|first4=András|last5=Deák|first5=Balázs|last6=Lengyel|first6=Szabolcs|last7=Tóthmérész|first7=Béla|date=January 2012|title=Recovery of native grass biodiversity by sowing on former croplands: Is weed suppression a feasible goal for grassland restoration?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S161713811100046X|journal=Journal for Nature Conservation|volume=20|issue=1|pages=41–48|doi=10.1016/j.jnc.2011.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of such projects is not necessarily to restore an entire ecosystem or habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p008/rmrs_p008_001_016.pdf|title=Selecting Plant Species for Ecological Restoration: a Perspective for Land Managers|last=Brown|first=Ray|last2=Amacher|first2=Michael|date=1999|website=USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505022949/https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p008/rmrs_p008_001_016.pdf|archive-date=2017-05-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Rob G.|last2=Orloff|first2=Steve B.|last3=Lancaster|first3=Donald L.|last4=Kirby|first4=Donald W.|last5=Carlson|first5=Harry L.|date=2010|title=Integrating Herbicide Use and Perennial Grass Revegetation to Suppress Weeds in Noncrop Areas|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/invasive-plant-science-and-management/article/integrating-herbicide-use-and-perennial-grass-revegetation-to-suppress-weeds-in-noncrop-areas/31659B7952971D35546D9EE56DE9DC5B|journal=Invasive Plant Science and Management|volume=3|issue=1|pages=81–92|doi=10.1614/ipsm-09-008.1|issn=1939-7291|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not always actively managed following seeding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kettenring|first=Karin M.|last2=Adams|first2=Carrie Reinhardt|date=2011-08-01|title=Lessons learned from invasive plant control experiments: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01979.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=48|issue=4|pages=970–979|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01979.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target areas for this type of restoration are those which are heavily dominated by invasive species. The goals are to first remove the species and then in so doing, reduce the number of invasive seeds being spread to surrounding areas. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing weeds, although it is not always a sustainable solution long term without additional weed control, such as mowing, or re-seeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dana|first=Blumenthal,|last2=Nicholas|first2=Jordan,|last3=Elizabeth|first3=Svenson,|date=2003-03-06|title=Weed Control as a Rationale for Restoration: The Example of Tallgrass Prairie|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol7/iss1/art6/|journal=Conservation Ecology|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.5751/ES-00480-070106|issn=1195-5449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Dana M.|last2=Jordan|first2=Nicholas R.|last3=Svenson|first3=Elizabeth L.|date=2005-05-20|title=Effects of prairie restoration on weed invasions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904003603|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=107|issue=2–3|pages=221–230|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2004.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restoration projects are also used as a way to better understand what makes an ecological community resistant to invasion. As restoration projects have a broad range of implementation strategies and methods used to control invasive species, they can be used by ecologists to test theories about invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Restoration projects have been used to understand how the diversity of the species introduced in the restoration affects invasion.

=== Successional trajectories ===

Progress along a desired successional pathway may be difficult if multiple stable states exist. Looking over 40 years of wetland restoration data, Klötzli and Gootjans (2001) argue that unexpected and undesired vegetation assemblies "may indicate that environmental conditions are not suitable for target communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klotzli|first=Frank|last2=Grootjans|first2=Ab P.|date=2001-06|title=Restoration of Natural and Semi-Natural Wetland Systems in Central Europe: Progress and Predictability of Developments|url=https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002209.x|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=209–219|doi=10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002209.x|issn=1061-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succession may move in unpredicted directions, but constricting environmental conditions within a narrow range may rein in the possible successional trajectories and increase the likelihood of a desired outcome.

=== Sourcing material for restoration ===
For most restoration projects it is generally recommend to source material from local populations, to increase chance of restoration success and minimize the effects of [[maladaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breed|first=Martin F.|last2=Stead|first2=Michael G.|last3=Ottewell|first3=Kym M.|last4=Gardner|first4=Michael G.|last5=Lowe|first5=Andrew J.|date=2013-02-01|title=Which provenance and where?

For example, sourcing for ''Castilleja levisecta'' found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Beth A.|last2=Kaye|first2=Thomas N.|date=2011-03-01|title=Reintroduction of Castilleja levisecta: Effects of Ecological Similarity, Source Population Genetics, and Habitat Quality|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00549.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=19|issue=2|pages=166–176|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00549.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of ecological restoration==
[[File:Regenerated habitat for superb parrot on the abandoned Boroowa railway line.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Ecosystem restoration for the [[superb parrot]] on an abandoned railway line in Australia]]

===Rationale===
There are many reasons to restore ecosystems.  Some include:

*Restoring [[natural capital]] such as drinkable water or wildlife populations 
*Mitigating [[climate change]] (e.g. through [[carbon sequestration]])
*Helping threatened or [[endangered species]]&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., &amp; Lucas, M. C. (2017). Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages? A test with lampreys. Ecological engineering, 102, 291-302&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aesthetic reasons &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris JA, Hobbs RJ, Higgs ES, and Aronson JA.|first=|year=2006|title=Ecological restoration and climate change|url=|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=14|pages=170–76.|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00136.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moral reasons: Human intervention has unnaturally destroyed many habitats, and there exists an innate obligation to restore these destroyed habitats

[[File:Restoration in action at Buffelsdraai.jpg|250px|right|thumb|alt=Buffelsdraai Community Reforestation Project.|Forest restoration in action at the [[Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project]] in South Africa]]

There exist considerable differences of opinion in how to set restoration goals and how to define their success among conservation groups. Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]]. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It can be difficult to set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, "ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium…. [with restoration] we aim [for a] moving target."

Some conservationists argue that, though an ecosystem may not be returned to its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable than its current configuration (Bradshaw 1987).  One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation. [[Afforestation]] involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air. [[Carbon dioxide]] is a leading cause of [[global warming]] (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Another example of a common driver of restoration projects in the United States is the legal framework of the Clean Water Act, which often requires mitigation for damage inflicted on aquatic systems by development or other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-404/compensatory-mitigation-methods|title=Compensatory Mitigation Methods|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological restoration challenges ==
Some view ecosystem restoration as impractical, partially because restorations often fall short of their goals.  Hilderbrand et al. point out that many times uncertainty (about ecosystem functions, species relationships, and such) is not addressed, and that the time-scales set out for 'complete' restoration are unreasonably short, while other critical markers for full-scale restoration are either ignored or abridged due to feasibility concerns.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hilderbrand, R. H., A. C. Watts, and A. M. Randle 2005. The myths of restoration ecology. Ecology and Society 10(1): 19. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol10/iss1/art19/&lt;/ref&gt;  In other instances an ecosystem may be so degraded that abandonment (allowing a severely degraded ecosystem to recover on its own) may be the wisest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HOLL|first=KAREN D.|last2=HAYES|first2=GREY F.|date=2006-02-27|title=Challenges to Introducing and Managing Disturbance Regimes for Holocarpha macradenia, an Endangered Annual Grassland Forb|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00416.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1121–1131|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00416.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local communities sometimes object to restorations that include the introduction of large predators or plants that require [[disturbance regimes]] such as regular fires, citing threat to human habitation in the area.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=David|date=2002|title=The ecological context: a species population perspective|url=|journal=Handbook of ecological restoration|volume=1|pages=47–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High economic costs can also be perceived as a negative impact of the restoration process.

Public opinion is very important in the feasibility of a restoration; if the public believes that the costs of restoration outweigh the benefits they will not support it.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Many failures have occurred in past restoration projects, many times because clear goals were not set out as the aim of the restoration, or an incomplete understanding of the underlying ecological framework lead to insufficient measures. This may be because, as Peter Alpert says, "people may not [always] know how to manage natural systems effectively".&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, P. 2002. Managing the wild: should stewards be pilots? Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 9(2): 494-499.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, many assumptions are made about myths of restoration such as [[carbon copy]], where a restoration plan, which worked in one area, is applied to another with the same results expected, but not realized.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Science-practice gap ===
One of the struggles for both fields is a divide between restoration ecology and ecological restoration in practice. Currently, many restoration practitioners as well as scientists feel that science is not being adequately incorporated into ecological restoration projects.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickens|first=Sara Jo M.|last2=Suding|first2=Katharine N.|date=2013-06-01|title=Spanning the Science-Practice Divide: Why Restoration Scientists Need to be More Involved with Practice|url=http://er.uwpress.org/content/31/2/134|journal=Ecological Restoration|volume=31|issue=2|pages=134–140|doi=10.3368/er.31.2.134|issn=1522-4740}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabin|first=Robert J.|last2=Clewell|first2=Andre|last3=Ingram|first3=Mrill|last4=McDonald|first4=Tein|last5=Temperton|first5=Vicky|date=2010-11-01|title=Bridging Restoration Science and Practice: Results and Analysis of a Survey from the 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International Meeting|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00743.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=18|issue=6|pages=783–788|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2010.00743.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Erica|last2=Dixon|first2=Kingsley W.|last3=Menz|first3=Myles H.

There are a variety of theories about the cause of this gap. However, it has been well established that one of the main issues is that the questions studied by restoration ecologists are frequently not found useful or easily applicable by land managers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabin|first=Robert J.|date=2007-03-01|title=Science-Driven Restoration: A Square Grid on a Round Earth?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00183.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00183.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many publications in restoration ecology characterize the scope of a problem in depth, without providing concrete solutions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally many restoration ecology studies are carried out under controlled conditions and frequently at scales much smaller than actual restorations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Whether or not these patterns hold true in an applied context is often unknown. There is evidence that these small-scale experiments inflate type II error rates and differ from ecological patterns in actual restorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duc|first=M. G.

There is further complication in that restoration ecologists who want to collect large-scale data on restoration projects can face enormous hurdles in obtaining the data. Managers vary in how much data they collect, and how many records they keep. Some agencies keep only a handful of physical copies of data that make it difficult for the researcher to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernhardt|first=Emily S.|last2=Sudduth|first2=Elizabeth B.|last3=Palmer|first3=Margaret A.|last4=Allan|first4=J.

== Contrasting restoration ecology and conservation biology ==

Restoration ecology may be viewed as a sub-discipline of [[conservation biology]], the scientific study of how to protect and restore biodiversity. Ecological restoration is then a part of the resulting [[conservation movement]].

Both restoration ecologists and conservation biologists agree that protecting and restoring habitat is important for protecting biodiversity. However, [[conservation biology]] is primarily rooted in [[population biology]]. Because of that, it is generally organized at the [[Population genetics|population genetic]] level and assesses specific species populations (i.e. [[endangered species]]). Restoration ecology is organized at the [[Community (ecology)|community]] level, which focuses on broader groups within ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P|date=2000-01|title=Restoration ecology and conservation biology|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320799000579|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=92|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(99)00057-9|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, conservation biology often concentrates on [[vertebrate]] animals because of their salience and popularity, whereas restoration ecology concentrates on [[plant]]s. Restoration ecology focuses on plants because restoration projects typically begin by establishing plant communities. Ecological restoration, despite being focused on plants, may also have "poster species" for individual ecosystems and restoration projects.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, the [[Monarch butterfly]] is a poster species for conserving and restoring [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plant habitat, because Monarch butterflies require milkweed plants to reproduce. Finally, restoration ecology has a stronger focus on [[soil]]s, [[soil structure]], [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[microorganism]]s because soils provide the foundation of functional terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Craig D|date=2002|title=Ecological restoration of southwestern Ponderosa pine ecosystems: A broad perspective|url=|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1418–1433|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1418:EROSPP]2.0.CO;2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=J.

==Natural Capital Committee's recommendation for a 25-year plan==
The UK [[Natural Capital Committee]] (NCC) made a recommendation in its second State of Natural Capital report published in March 2014 that in order to meet the Government's goal of being the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it was inherited, a long-term 25-year plan was needed to maintain and improve England's natural capital.  The UK Government has not yet responded to this recommendation.

The Secretary of State for the UK's [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], [[Owen Paterson]], described his ambition for the natural environment and how the work of the Committee fits into this at an NCC event in November 2012:  "I do not, however, just want to maintain our natural assets; I want to improve them. I want us to derive the greatest possible benefit from them, while ensuring that they are available for generations to come. This is what the NCC's innovative work is geared towards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/owen-paterson-s-speech-to-royal-society-on-natural-capital-committee|title=Owen Paterson’s speech to Royal Society on Natural Capital Committee|last=Paterson|first=Owen|date=27 November 2012|work=gov.uk|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ra and dec demo animation small.gif|thumb|The [[equatorial coordinate system]] on the [[celestial sphere]]]]

'''Star position''' is the apparent location of any given [[star]] in the [[sky]], which seems [[fixed stars|fixed]] onto an [[celestial sphere|arbitrary sphere]] centered on [[Earth]]. The location is defined by a pair of [[celestial coordinate system|angular coordinates]] relative to the [[celestial equator]]: [[right ascension]] (''α'') and [[declination]] (''δ''). This pair based the [[equatorial coordinate system]].

While ''δ'' is given in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (from +90° at the north [[celestial pole]] to −90° at the south), ''α'' is usually given in [[hour angle]]s (0 to 24 h). This is due to the observation technique of [[star transit]]s, which [[diurnal motion|cross]] the [[field of view]] of telescope [[eyepiece]]s due to [[Earth's rotation]]. The observation techniques are topics of [[positional astronomy]] and of [[astrogeodesy]].

Ideally, the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (''α'', ''δ'') refers to an [[inertial frame of reference]]. The [[spherical coordinate system|third coordinate]] is the star's [[distance]], which is normally used as an attribute of the individual star.

The following factors change star positions over time:
#[[axial precession]] and [[nutation]] – slow [[axial tilt|tilts]] of Earth's axis with rates of 50 arcseconds and 2 arcseconds respectively, per year;
#the [[aberration of light|aberration]] and [[parallax]] – effects of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun; and
#the [[proper motion]] of the individual stars.

The first and second effects are considered by so-called '''mean places of stars''', contrary to their [[apparent place]]s as seen from the moving Earth. Usually the mean places refer to a special [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], e.g. 1950.0 or [[2000.0]]. The third effect has to be handled individually.

The star positions ''α, δ'' are compiled in several [[star catalogue]]s of different volume and accuracy. ''Absolute'' and very precise coordinates of 1000-3000 stars are collected in [[fundamental catalogue]]s, starting with the FK (Berlin ~1890) up to the modern [[FK6]].

''Relative'' coordinates of numerous stars are collected in catalogues like the [[Bonner Durchmusterung]] (Germany 1852-1862, 200.000 rough positions), the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog|SAO]] catalogue (USA 1966, 250.000 astrometric stars) or the [[Hipparcos]] and Tycho catalogue (110.000 and 2 million stars by space astrometry).

In [[hydrology]], '''stemflow''' is the flow of [[interception (water)|intercepted]] [[water]] down the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] or stem of a [[plant]]. Stemflow, along with [[throughfall]], is responsible for the transferral of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[nutrient]]s from the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] to the [[soil]]. In [[tropical rainforest]]s, where this kind of flow can be substantial, erosion [[gully|gullies]] can form at the base of the trunk. However, in more [[temperate]] climates stemflow levels are low and have little erosional power.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Measurement==
There are a variety of ways stemflow volume is measured in the field. The most common direct measurement currently used is the bonding of [[bisection|bisected]] [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or other [[Pipe (material)|plastic tubing]] around the [[circumference]] of the tree trunk, connected and funneled into a [[graduated cylinder]] for manual or a [[Rain gauge#Tipping bucket rain gauge|tipping bucket rain gauge]] for automatic collection. At times the tubing is wrapped multiple times around the trunk is order to ensure more complete collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Williams | first = Matthew B. | title = Investigating the contribution of stemflow to the hydrology of a forest catchment | journal = University of Southampton  | volume = Dissertation | year = 2004 | url = http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/Measuring_stemflow_dissertation_Williams_2004.pdf/$FILE/Measuring_stemflow_dissertation_Williams_2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determining factors==
'''Precipitation'''

The primary [[meteorology|meteorological]] characteristics of a [[rain]]fall event that influence stemflow are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| doi =10.1002/hyp.3360040205| last =Crockford | first =R.H.| last2 =Richardson |first2 = D.P | title = Partitioning of rainfall in a Eucalypt forest and pine plantation in southeastern Australia: II Stemflow and factors affecting stemflow in a dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest and a ''Pinus radiata'' plantation | journal = Hydrological Processes | volume = 4  | pages =145–155 | year = 1990|bibcode = 1990HyPr....4..145C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rainfall continuity'' &amp;ndash; the more frequent and extended are the gaps during the event where no rainfall occurs, the higher the likelihood that potential stemflow volume is lost to [[evapotranspiration]]; this is also governed by [[air temperature]], [[relative humidity]] and most significantly, [[wind speed]]
* ''Rainfall intensity'' &amp;ndash; the amount of total stemflow is diminished when the amount of rain in a given period surpasses the capacity of the flow paths
* ''Rain angle'' &amp;ndash; stemflow generally starts earlier when rainfall is more horizontal; this is more of a determinant in an open forest with a lesser degree of [[crown closure]]

'''Species'''
[[File:Quercus agrifolia-4.jpg|thumb|Stemflow in [[oak]]s is relatively low, due to their textured bark, few and horizontal branches, and high incidence of absorbent [[epiphyte]]s.]]
The species of the tree affects the amount of timing and stemflow. The particular [[Plant morphology|morphological]] characteristics that are key factors are:
* ''Crown size'' &amp;ndash; stemflow potential is greater as [[crown (botany)|crown size]] relative to the [[diameter at breast height]] increases
* ''Leaf shape/orientation'' &amp;ndash; [[Leaf|leaves]] which are [[wikt:concave|concave]] and elevated horizontally above the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] are able to contribute to stemflow
* ''Branch angle'' &amp;ndash; stemflow potential heightens as the angle of the [[branch]]es and [[twig]]s increases
* ''Flow path obstructions'' &amp;ndash; abnormalities on the flow path, such as detached pieces of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] or scars, on the underside of the branch can divert water from stemflow and become a component in [[throughfall]]
* ''Bark'' &amp;ndash; stemflow is affected by the degree of [[wikt:absorption|absorptive]] ability and smoothness of the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] alongside the branch and stem

'''Stand Characteristics'''

In addition to the effects of individual tree species, the overall structure of the forest stand also influences the amount of stemflow that will ultimately occur, these factors are:&lt;ref name="AndréJonard2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=André|first1=Frédéric|last2=Jonard|first2=Mathieu|last3=Ponette|first3=Quentin|title=Influence of species and rain event characteristics on stemflow volume in a temperate mixed oak-beech stand|journal=Hydrological Processes|volume=22|issue=22|year=2008|pages=4455–4466|issn=08856087|doi=10.1002/hyp.7048|bibcode = 2008HyPr...22.4455A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Species composition'' &amp;ndash; the total stemflow for the stand is determined by the contributions of individuals and their species-specific traits
* ''Stand density'' &amp;ndash; morphological characteristics such as branch angle and thickness are largely determined by the amount of density of competing trees in the stand
* ''Canopy structure'' &amp;ndash; individuals located in the [[understory]] in a stand with multiple vertically-stratified stories will have a lessened amount of total stemflow due to the interception of dominant and codominant individuals

'''Other'''
* ''Seasonality'' &amp;ndash; in the case of [[deciduous]] or [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], stemflow rates are ''slightly'' higher in the [[Dormancy#Trees|dormant]] season when no leaves are present and evapotranspiration is reduced; this effect becomes more pronounced as the stem diameter increases
* ''Diurnality'' &amp;ndash; variations in branch weight influence the amount of stemflow; branches are heavier in the morning (with [[dew]]) and lighter in the afternoon&lt;ref name="ecoscience"&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.2980/i1195-6860-13-3-324.1 | last = Johnson | first = Mark S. | last2 = Lehmann | first2 = Johannes | title = Double-funneling of trees: Stemflow and root-induced preferential flow | journal = Écoscience | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 324–333 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on soil==
'''Chemistry'''

[[Nutrient]]s that have accumulated on the canopy from dry [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition]] or animal [[feces]] are able to directly enter the [[soil]] through stemflow. When precipitation occurs, canopy nutrients are [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]] into the water because of the differences in nutrient [[Molecular diffusion|concentration]] between the tree and the rainfall. Conversely, nutrients are taken up by the tree when concentration is lower in the canopy than the rainfall, the presence of [[epiphyte]]s or [[lichen]]s also contributes to uptake. The nutrients that enter the soil can also reflect the particular environmental conditions around them, for example, plants located in [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] areas exhibit higher rates of [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]] (from [[air pollution]]), whereas those located near the [[ocean]]s have higher rates of [[sodium]] (from [[seawater]]).&lt;ref name="ecoscience" /&gt;

[[Soil acidification]] can be seen around some stems, for example beech trees from dry deposition. &lt;ref name="DOI
10.1023/A:1015846906956"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015846906956 Deposition and soil leaching in stands of Norway spruce and European Beech: Results from the Höglwald research in comparison with other European case studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Precipitation and morphological factors that influence stemflow timing and volume also affect the chemical composition; in general, stemflow water becomes more [[Concentration|dilute]] during the course of a storm event, and rough-barked species contain more nutrients than smooth-barked species.

'''Water distribution'''

In [[forest]]ed areas, water is more able to effectively penetrate past the [[topsoil]] into deeper layers of the [[soil horizon]] along tree [[root]]s and their subsequent creation of [[macropore]]s (termed ''preferential flow''). The loosening of the soil can result in minor [[landslide]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10489">'''Strategic sustainable investing''' ('''SSI''') is an [[investment strategy]] that recognizes and rewards leading companies that are moving society towards [[sustainability]]. SSI relies on a consensus-based scientific definition of [[sustainability]], and the assumption that ‘''[[Backcasting]] from Principles of Sustainability''’,&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J and Robèrt, K-H “Backcasting from non-overlapping sustainability principles – a framework for strategic planning”, International .Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 7:1–18. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a vision of a sustainable future is set as the reference point for developing strategic actions, is the preferred approach to strategically move a company towards sustainability. It was developed by researchers at the [[Blekinge Institute of Technology]] in Sweden.

==The strategic sustainable investment system==
SSI outlines that the financial investment will offer a competitive risk-adjusted return, while providing investment capital to companies that are actively attempting to become more sustainable. It implies lower exposure to sustainability-related risks and it considers financial metrics together with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, as well as strategy analyses to educate investment decision-making.&lt;ref name="SSI"&gt;[http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/535439ccd73cc824c1256608004f0529/a6dcb300241ca812c125746000500631!OpenDocument Blandford, Nick, Timothy Nash and André Winter “Strategic Sustainable Investing: Recognizing Value in Transitional Leadership.” Master's thesis, Blekinge Institute of Technology, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of SSI:&lt;br /&gt;
•	Lower sustainability risk exposure &lt;br /&gt;
•	A definition of sustainability based on scientific consensus&lt;ref name= "tools and concepts"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VFX-44KVV9J-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=214b19c668891d8b85307af38cb9017c Robèrt, K.-H. “Tools and concepts for sustainable development, how do they relate to a framework for sustainable development, and to each other?” Journal of Cleaner Production 8: 243–254. 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
•	Primarily driven by movement towards sustainability&lt;br /&gt;
•	Considers financial, ESG, and strategy analysis

SSI operates by prioritizing investment capital allocation to companies that are taking the lead in shifting away from unsustainable behaviour towards new ways of doing business. This capital allocation will provide an incentive for companies to move forward in a sustainable direction. This movement is reported in [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) and other extra-financial reports, but is also recorded in traditional areas of a firm’s financial [[balance sheets]].

By incorporating sustainability investment and returns into traditional financial reporting, a clearer picture of the bottom-line impact of a company’s actions towards sustainability is made available. In this positive reinforcing loop, greater investor returns and [http://plilend.com/ increased movement towards sustainability] are generated with every cycle.

[[Image:Economic analysis chart of movement towards sustainability.jpg|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''[[Causal loop diagram]] illustrating the strategic sustainable investment''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

[[Institutional investor]]s, such as mutual and pension funds, take a longer-term position on investments and are thus ideally suited to incorporate SSI strategies.

==Theory background==
The theoretical foundation of SSI is strongly linked to ''strategic sustainable development'', made popular by [[The Natural Step]] and its founder Dr. [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]].

This strategy resembles [[socially responsible investing]] (SRI), a growing practice amongst ethical investors. Nevertheless, SSI recognizes the gaps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.responsibleinvesting.org/database/dokuman/SRI%20Report%2010-04_word.pdf Hawken, P. “How the SRI industry has failed to respond to people who want to invest with conscience and what can be done to change it.” Natural Capital Institute. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; of SRI pointed by several academics and practitioners and presents some alternatives.

==SSI analysis tool==
In order to evolve current SRI and traditional investment practices into Strategic Sustainable Investment, two gaps must be considered:

a.	The recognition of companies with true leading strategies for a sustainable future&lt;br /&gt;
b.	A robust and well defined link must be made between movement towards sustainability and higher investment returns

The SSI analysis tool addresses the first gap by measuring a company’s strategy for addressing sustainability. It allows investors to recognize which companies are leading the transition in a new direction, and which are most likely to be strong performers in tomorrow’s market.

This tool is divided in two main parts: the emerging sustainability issue (esi) chart and the strategy analysis component:

===ESI chart===
[[Image:ESI Chart.jpg|right|thumb|250px|ESI Chart Sample&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]
The Sectoral Emerging Sustainability Issue (ESI) chart is used to identify which aspects of a determined market sector will become a socio-environmental problem. In the common sense, an issue is called ‘emergent’ when it gets media exposure. Instead, the Tool relies on scientific [[The_Natural_Step#System_conditions_of_sustainability|Principles of sustainability]]&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., and K.-H. Robèrt “The Rationale behind the System Conditions”. Department of Physical Resource Theory, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., K-H. Robèrt, and K-E. Eriksson “Socio-ecological principles for sustainability”. Getting down to earth — Practical applications of ecological economics. Washington, DC: Island Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to identify what is emergent.

It exposes which Sustainability Issues present high risks for companies within that sector in the short-term; as well as which Issues will be emerging in the medium and long-terms. Due to differences within a sector, the Sectoral ESI Chart should be made as specific as needed, being flexible to account for various geographical locations and sub-sector subtleties.

The process of composing an ESI chart follows:

Once a sector is selected for an ESI analysis, a list of relevant sustainability issues is assembled. This baseline analysis will result in a list of issues outlining the subject sector’s strengths and concerns that impact society and the environment. Next, prioritization colours are assigned to each sustainability issue: red for very high priority; orange for high priority; yellow for medium priority, and green for low priority according to its assessment in each of three categories: urgency, severity, and systematic contribution.

''Urgency'' assesses the time frame pressing each Issue. The ''severity'' assesses the seriousness of the Issue, in terms of its potential consequences for the environment, society, and companies within that sector. The ''systematic contribution'' is used to gauge the sector’s contribution to the overall Issue.

[[Image:ESI WF.jpg|none|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''To fill out the Chart, Researchers follow this process flow.''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

===Strategy analysis component===
====Strategic plan====
The Strategic Plan element assesses the subject company’s planned goals in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI). The qualitative description includes, but is not limited to, information regarding:  public commitments planned operational and business initiatives, political action/ lobbying, and third party partnerships (with NGOs, consultative firms etc.). There is also a comment on the subject company’s core business in relation to the ESI; as this will assist in determining the subject company’s exposure to the emerging risk.

====Strategic actions====
The strategic actions element looks at assessing the subject company’s recent actions taken in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI), thus determining whether the subject company is ‘walking the talk’ in comparison to the vision and goals outlined.
The subject company’s actions are seen through the lens of [[strategic sustainable development]], and thus three questions are emphasized as a mental guideline:

a.	Does this action provide a competitive return on investment (ROI)?&lt;br /&gt;
b.	Is this action taking the subject company in the right direction?&lt;br /&gt;
c.	Is this action a versatile platform?

====Strategy analysis graph====
The strategy analysis graph shows the subject company’s planned path for dealing with the ESI, tangible progress made, and if existent, government regulations. The trajectory of the subject company’s planned path reveals the extent of their future risk exposure. This graph is placed in the center of the strategy analysis page.

[[Image:Strategy Analysis Graph.jpg|none|thumb|300px|Sample of strategy analysis graph&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]

====Assurance assessment====
The assurance assessment provides an overall impression of the validity of the information gathered. This assessment may be applied if the data is verified by an external third party, or if discrepancy is evident between different sources of information used on the report.

'''Technological momentum''' is a theory about the relationship between [[technology]] and [[society]] over time. The term, which is considered a fourth technological determinism variant,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Philosophy of Technology: From Technical Artefacts to Sociotechnical Systems|last=Vermaas|first=Peter|last2=Kroes|first2=Peter|last3=Franssen|first3=Maarten|last4=van de Poel|first4=Ibo|last5=Houkes|first5=Wybo|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781608455980|location=San Rafael, CA|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally developed by the [[history of technology|historian of technology]] [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. The idea is that relationship between technology and society is reciprocal and time-dependent so that one does not determine the changes in the other but both influence each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Technology: An A-to-Z Guide|last=Mulvaney|first=Dustin|last2=Robbins|first2=Paul|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781412996921|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Hughes's thesis is a synthesis of two separate models for how technology and society interact. One, ''[[technological determinism]]'', claims that society itself is modified by the introduction of a new technology in an irreversible and irreparable way&amp;mdash;for example, the introduction of the [[automobile]] has influenced the manner in which [[United States of America|American]] cities are designed, a change that can clearly be seen when comparing the pre-automobile cities on the East Coast to the post-automobile cities on the West Coast. Technology, under this model, self-propagates as well&amp;mdash;there is no turning back once the adoption has taken place, and the very existence of the technology means that it will continue to exist in the future.

The other model, ''[[social determinism]]'', claims that society itself controls how a technology is used and developed&amp;mdash;for example, the rejection of [[nuclear power]] technology in the USA amid the public fears after the [[Three Mile Island]] incident.

''Technological momentum'' takes the two models and adds ''time'' as the unifying factor. In Hughes's theory, when a technology is young, deliberate control over its use and scope is possible and enacted by society. However, as a technology matures, and becomes increasingly enmeshed in the society where it was created, its own deterministic force takes hold, achieving technological momentum in the process. According to Hughes this inertia, which is particularly the case for large technological systems with their technological and social components, makes them difficult to influence and steer as they start to go more on their own way, assuming deterministic traits in the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, Hughes's says that the relationship between technology and society always starts with a ''social determinism'' model, but evolves into a form of ''technological determinism'' over time and as its use becomes more prevalent and important.

Since its introduction by Hughes, the ''technological momentum'' concept has been applied by a number of other historians of technology.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Consuming Power: A Social History of American Energies'' (1998) by [[David E. Nye]]; "Technology and War: A Bibliographic Essay" by Alex Roland in ''Military Enterprise and Technological Change'' (1985), edited by Merritt Roe Smith; and ''Nuclear Fallacies: How We Have Been Misguided since Hiroshima'' (1985) by Robert W. Malcomson.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it is considered an effective approach to reconciling the apparently opposite perspectives of the autonomy of technology and the social and political motivations behind technological choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democratizing Technology: Andrew Feenberg's Critical Theory of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|last2=Cooper|first2=Simon|last3=Doppelt|first3=Gerlad|last4=Feenberg|first4=Andrew|last5=Glazebrook|first5=Trish|last6=Hickman|first6=Larry|last7=Light|first7=Andrew|last8=Stump|first8=David|last9=Thompson|first9=Paul|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2006|isbn=9780791469170|location=New York|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to describe how socially and politically conditioned technological institutions become independent and autonomous over time.

'''Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH''' (formerly '''Grohmann Engineering GmbH''') is a German engineering company based in [[Prüm]]. The company operates a development center in [[Neutraubling]], as well as support offices in [[Chandler, Arizona]], and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://teslagrohmannautomation.de/en/contact |title=Contact |website=Tesla Grohmann Automation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded in 1963 by Klaus Grohman and acquired by [[Tesla, Inc.]] in January 2017.

Although the company makes cars, it is primarily a technology company. The product portfolio includes machinery for the production of [[microprocessor]]s and memory chips, [[airbag]] sensors and [[power steering]] controllers, as well as systems for the production of door and roof seals, lithium-ion [[battery cell]]s and modules. Among other things, the company manufactures robotics that are used in the battery and electronics production for [[Tesla, Inc.]] at its [[Gigafactory 1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2010/20100303corp_a.htm Intel Honors 16 Companies with Preferred Quality Supplier Award], March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm works closely with universities within dual track studies of [[Mechanical Engineering]] and [[Robotic Process Automation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teslagrohmannautomation.de/en/apprenticeship Dual-track University-level studies at Tesla Grohmann Automation], March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it provides training in the field of Technical Product Design, Industrial Mechanics, CNC Operation, Construction Technology, IT, Mechatronics and Industrial Electronic Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teslagrohmannautomation.de/en/apprenticeship Tesla Grohmann Automation Apprenticeship], March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Grohmann Engineering was founded by Klaus Grohmann in 1963.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/065b2cec-a5b1-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1 |title=Tesla buys German engineer for European expansion |first1=Patrick |last1=McGee |first2=Peter |last2=Campbell |date=8 November 2017 |website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the company's stakeholders (including the {{ill|Deutsche Beteiligungs AG|de}}, which owned 25%) agreed to sell the company to American automotive company [[Tesla Motors]].&lt;ref name="ft" /&gt; The company had 700 employees at the time.&lt;ref name="ft" /&gt; The deal was completed on 3 January 2017, at which point the company employed 800 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/rheinland-pfalz-saarland/article161281524/Uebernahme-von-Grohmann-durch-Tesla-abgeschlossen.html |title=Übernahme von Grohmann durch Tesla abgeschlossen |date=18 January 2017 |website=[[Welt (German TV channel)|Welt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, founder Klaus Grohmann left the company due to a dispute with Tesla CEO [[Elon Musk]]. Musk demanded the company halt production for competitors, such as [[BMW]] and [[Daimler AG]], to focus on the Model 3.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-germany-exclusive-idUSKBN17T2IY Tesla's Klaus Grohmann ousted after clash with CEO Musk] Reuters, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

By discontinuing business relations with all customers except Tesla, the company's union was concerned with wage levels and with jobs in the long term if electric cars did not have the expected success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.golem.de/news/deutschland-tesla-mitarbeiter-drohen-mit-streik-1704-127338.html Tesla-Mitarbeiter drohen mit Streik], Golem, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla then offered Grohmann employees 150 euros a month and employee stock options worth $10,000 with a payout over the following four years, as well as a cash payment of 1000 euros. Tesla did not comment on the required collective agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/auto/tarifstreit-mit-tesla-ig-metall-setzt-bei-grohmann-auf-kompromiss-/19723484.html Tarifstreit mit Tesla: IG Metall setzt bei Grohmann auf Kompromiss], April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the company agreed with union representatives on a competitive pay structure. According to the chairman of the works council, the future remuneration was at the level of the collective agreement valid for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article169760888/Tesla-gibt-deutschen-Mitarbeitern-deutliche-Gehaltserhoehung.html Deutschland: Tesla einigt sich auf deutliche Gehaltssteigerung], September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theming''' refers to "the use of an overarching theme...to create a holistic and integrated spatial organization of a consumer venue.”&lt;ref name="Lukas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lukas|first=Scott A.|date=2007|title=The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation and Self|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theme is “a unifying or dominant idea or motif”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theming|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/theming|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so theming is the process of designing and constructing an object or space so that “the particular subject or idea on which the style of something is based”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theme|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is made clear through the “synthesis of recognizable symbols with spatial forms.”&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt;

Theming is applied to an environment in order to create a memorable and meaningful experience for individuals or groups that visit the space, and can be expressed through the use of architecture, decor, signage, music and sound design, costuming, integrated technology, special effects, and other techniques.&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt; Theming is increasingly used to create physical spaces for "[[experiential marketing]],” in which consumers can connect and interact with a brand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/experiential-marketing-definition-ds00/ Experiential Marketing, Defined — and Examples to Inspire You]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, most large-scale themed environments were primarily designed for entertainment, so the industry that creates these venues is known as themed entertainment. Examples include [[theme parks]], water parks, museums, zoos, visitor centers, casinos, [[theme restaurants]], and resorts.&lt;ref name="TEA"&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/About-us/About-us/ About Us]. Themed Entertainment Association. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Theming is also increasingly used on smaller scale projects, including parties and product launches, to make these events more impactful.&lt;ref name="Quainton"&gt;{{cite article|last=Quainton|first=David|date=August 2009|title=Prepare for Impact (Advice Bureau Theming)|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/43616310/prepare-impact|publisher=Event Magazine (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common themes include holidays (such as [[Christmas]] and [[Valentine’s Day]]), historical eras (such as the [[Medieval Period]] and the [[American frontier]]), cultures (such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Polynesian culture]]), and literary genres (such as [[Fantasy]] and [[Science fiction]]).

==History==

Theming has been used in public spaces at least as far back as the [[World's fair|World’s Fairs]] of the Nineteenth Century. Professor Susan Ingram argues that the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London was, in effect, the world’s first theme park, utilizing theming to further its pro-industrial message, and reproducing foreign lands as spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theoryofthemeparks.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-historical-development-of-themed.html The Historical Development of Themed Space: Susan Ingram on Industrial Europe and the Commodification of Leisure]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Columbian Exposition of 1893]] in Chicago introduced a separate [[Midway (fair)|midway]], filled not only with attractions like the first [[Ferris Wheel]], but also exhibits of cultures from around the world, including reproductions of villages from many nations. Themed simulations, including the Italian Capri Grotto and a Hawaiian volcano, were made possible for the first time by combining electricity, theatrical displays, and mechanical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4955/3787 Chicago World’s Fair of 1893: Marketing the modern imaginary of the city and urban everyday life through representation]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Themed dining can also trace its roots to the late 1800s. In the 1890s, at least three different elaborately themed nightclubs were operating Paris, using themes of death, hell, and heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://io9.gizmodo.com/5910963/the-awesomely-insane-heaven-and-hell-nightclubs-of-1800s-paris The awesomely insane Heaven and Hell nightclubs of 1890s Paris]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, in response to the growing popularity of the automobile, theming was applied to roadside architecture in the United States, and buildings themselves became advertisements aimed at passing motorists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://la.curbed.com/maps/roadside-architecture-programmatic-mimetic The weird roadside architecture of Los Angeles]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1920s, a number of [[novelty architecture]] buildings were constructed in and around Hollywood, including the famous [[Brown Derby]] restaurants and Bulldog Cafe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://martinturnbull.com/2015/03/10/bulldog-cafe-1153-west-washington-blvd-opened-1928/ Bulldog Café, 1153 West Washington Blvd, opened 1928]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the popular Egyptian Revival movement saw a range of buildings themed to [[Ancient Egypt]], including everything from apartments to [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]]. Dozens of so-called “programmatic” or “mimetic” style structures were built in the Los Angeles area in the interwar years of 1918-1941, many of them restaurants, including buildings shaped like animals, food, and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waterandpower.org/museum/Programmatic_Style_Architecture.html Early Los Angeles Programmatic-Style Buildings]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The forerunners to today’s themed mega-resorts were the [[El Rancho Vegas]], opened in 1941, and the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Last Frontier]], opened in 1942, the first two properties on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], both with Wild West themes. They were followed by even more elaborately themed hotels, including [[Caesars Palace]] in 1966 and [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] in 1968.

The term “[[theme park]]” came into use circa 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme park|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/theme-park|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme park|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theme%20park|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, likely to describe the many parks built across the United States and around the world following the successful opening of [[Disneyland]] in 1955. Though arguably not the first theme park, Disneyland was the first amusement park to combine multiple named areas (“lands”) with different themes. Theme parks have followed this pattern ever since, including some that have explicitly copied Disneyland’s design.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bathroomreader.com/2013/11/5-disneyland-knockoffs-around-world/ 5 Disneyland Knockoffs From Around the World]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theming has also been applied to retail environments. The advent of mass production led to the creation of large department stores in Europe in the late Nineteenth Century, and in an early example of theming, many used elaborate displays and windows to attract shoppers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/origin-and-development-of-markets.pdf The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[Banana Republic]] reinforced its brand as a travel and safari clothing company by theming its stores with Jeeps and jungle foliage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/banana-republic-was-mainstream-fashion-it-was-weirdly-wonderful-safari-brand-170059/ Before Banana Republic Was Mainstream Fashion, It Was a Weirdly Wonderful Safari Brand]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1987, the [[Disney Store]] chain used theming to popularize the idea of “retail-tainment,” creating a new category of entertainment stores, later copied by competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/16/business/fi-32873 New Theme Player]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, as a response to the growth of online shopping, both individual stores and entire retail complexes like malls are turning to theming to attract customers to physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chapmantaylor.com/insights/themed-retail-to-theme-or-not-to-theme Themed Retail: To Theme Or Not To Theme].

==Scholarship==

In 1997, urbanist [[Mark Gottdiener]]’s ''The Theming of America: Dreams, Visions, and Commercial Spaces'' was published. It is considered by many to be the first serious work to explore the origins, nature, and future of themed environments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/727592/the-theming-of-america-dreams-visions-and-commercial The Theming of America: Dreams, Visions, and Commercial Spaces]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; A revised second edition was published in 2001.

Also in 1997, the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal presented ''The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme Parks'', the first exhibition of some 350 objects from the archives of [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], including plans, drawings, paintings and models for the Disney theme parks and their attractions. Professor Karal Ann Marling curated the exhibit and wrote the principal essay for the accompanying 224 page book, which also included essays by Disney Imagineer [[Marty Sklar]], historian Neil Harris, art historian Erika Doss, geographer [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], and critic [[Greil Marcus]], as well as an interview with architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cca.qc.ca/cca.media/files/9013/7952/CUTdisney_pressrelease.pdf CCA to Examine the Building of a Modern Myth, in ''The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme Parks'']. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Scott A. Lukas has written and edited numerous books and articles on themed entertainment, including his first, ''The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self'', published in 2007. He teaches on the subject of theme parks and themed spaces, video games, popular film, and various forms of popular culture and remaking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottlukas.com/page12/index.html Bio].

In 2010, Dean Peter Weishar and Professor George Head began work on a themed entertainment design program at [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] (SCAD) in Savannah, Georgia. In the fall of 2012, the SCAD School of Film, Digital Media and Performing Arts separated into two schools: the School of Digital Media and the School of Entertainment Arts, which began offering the nation’s first M.F.A. in themed entertainment design. Peter Weishar went on to create the Themed Experience Institute program at [[Florida State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/TEA-blog-post/TEA-Advantage:-Peter-Weishar-themed-entertainment-academic-pioneer/6516 TEA Advantage: Peter Weishar, themed entertainment academic pioneer].

==Criticism==

As perhaps the best known example of theming, the theme park Disneyland has often been a target for criticism. In his overwhelmingly negative review, ''Disneyland and Las Vegas'', published in ''[[The Nation (United States)|The Nation]]'' upon the opening of the park, writer Julian Halevy lamented: {{Quote
|text=“As in the Disney movies, the whole world, the universe, and all man’s striving for dominion over self and nature, have been reduced to a sickening blend of cheap formulas packaged to sell…It’s dangerous and offensive.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/271509661/July-17-1955 Julian Halevy, “Disneyland and Las Vegas,” Nation, July 17, 1955]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noted author [[Ray Bradbury]] responded with a letter to the editor, published three years later, titled ''Not Child Enough'': {{Quote
|text=“The world is full of people who, for intellectual reasons, steadfastly refuse to let go and enjoy themselves…I have a sneaking suspicion, after all is said and done, that Mr. Halevy truly loved Disneyland but is not man enough, or child enough, to admit it. I feel sorry for him.”&lt;ref&gt;Ray Bradbury, "Not Child Enough," Nation, June 28, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another notable criticism of theming, again targeting Disneyland and its guests, can be found in French sociologist [[Jean Baudrillard]]’s 1981 treatise ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'': {{Quote
|text=“Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, whereas all of Los Angeles and the America that surrounds it are no longer real, but belong to the hyperreal order and to the order of simulation…The imaginary of Disneyland is neither true nor false, it is a deterrence machine.”}}

Along with Baudrillard, the Italian writer [[Umberto Eco]] helped develop the idea of “[[hyperreality]],” or the world of "the Absolute Fake," in which imitations don't merely reproduce reality, but try to improve on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparencynow.com/eco.htm Traveling Through Hyperreality With Umberto Eco]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Eco traveled to tourist attractions across the United States and wrote frequently about "America's obsession with simulacra and counterfeit reality.”

More recently, concerns have been raised about theming’s role in influencing consumers, sometimes subconsciously, as part of experiential retailing or “shoppertainment.” Kim Einhorm, director of Theme Traders, points out that “theming becomes an invisible form of branding.”&lt;ref name="Quainton" /&gt; Indeed, because theming has become such a commonplace aspect of so many people’s everyday lives, the public is often unwilling or unable to effectively understand its consequences.&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt; Some have even argued that the growth of experiential marketing is contributing to a degraded quality of life by eliminating “contemplative time.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mngt.waikato.ac.nz/ejrot/cmsconference/2003/proceedings/criticalmarketing/Caru.pdf Antonella Carù and Bernard Cova, “A Critical Approach To Experiential Consumption: Fighting Against The Disappearance Of The Contemplative Time”]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==

In 1920, following the dissolution of several earlier organizations, the National Association of Amusement Parks (NAAP) was formed. In 1934 it merged with the American Association of Pools and Beaches (AAPB) to form the National Association of Amusement Parks, Pools, and Beaches (NAAPPB). After several name changes, it became the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaapa100years.org/timeline6 IAAPA Timeline]. Retrieved 2018-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, IAAPA represents more than 5,300 members from more than 100 countries, including many companies and individuals in the themed entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaapa.org/about-iaapa About IAAPA] Retrieved 2018-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Themed Entertainment Association]] was founded in 1991 to organize small businesses in the industry. Today it has some 1,300 members, and divisions around the world. It hosts annual conferences and presents awards to individuals, parks, attractions, exhibits, and experiences.&lt;ref name="TEA" /&gt;

A number of former employees of [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], Disney’s in-house design and construction subsidiary, went on to form their own themed entertainment companies, some of which later collaborated with Disney on theme park projects. [[Gary Goddard]] left Imagineering to start what became the Goddard Group, now known as Legacy | GGE. [[Bill Novey]] oversaw the special effects for Epcot Center and Tokyo Disneyland before leaving to start Art &amp; Technology, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blooloop.com/Article/Art-Technology-Bill-Novey-and-the-Business-of-Theme-Park-Special-Effects/190 |publisher=BloopLoop.com |title=Bill Novey and the Business of Theme Park Special Effects |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822175056/http://www.blooloop.com/Article/Art-Technology-Bill-Novey-and-the-Business-of-Theme-Park-Special-Effects/190 |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Rogers (designer)| Bob Rogers]] left to found BRC Imagination Arts. [[Bran Ferren]] founded Associates &amp; Ferren, which was acquired by Disney in 1993. Ferren eventually left Disney to start another company, Applied Minds, LLC. [[Phil Hettema]] worked for both Disney and [[Universal Creative]] before starting [[Phil_Hettema#The_Hettema_Group|The Hettema Group]].

Other companies serve organizations and individuals looking to incorporate theming into offices, product launch events, and even parties. [https://www.themetraders.com/ Theme Traders] is a London-based event theming company that serves this niche.

In the social science fields of [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[religious studies]], [[human-centered design]] and organizational development, a '''thick description''' results from a scientific observation of any particular human behavior that describes not just the behavior, but its context as well, so that the behavior can be better understood by an outsider. A thick description typically adds a record of subjective explanations and meanings provided by the people engaged in the behaviors, making the collected data of greater value for studies by other social scientists.

The term was introduced by the 20th-century [[philosopher]] [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1900-1976).  [[Anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]] later developed the concept in his ''[[The Interpretation of Cultures]]'' (1973) to characterise his own method of doing [[ethnography]] (Geertz 1973:5-6, 9-10). Since then, the term and the methodology it represents has gained currency in the [[social science]]s and beyond. Today, "thick description" is used in a variety of fields, including the type of [[literary criticism]] known as [[New Historicism]].

In his essay "Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture" (1973), Geertz explains that he adopted the term from philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], specifically his lecture "What is ''le Penseur'' doing?"

==Adoption==
Geertz's "thick description" approach has become increasingly recognized as a method of symbolic anthropology, enlisted as a working antidote to overly technocratic, mechanistic means of understanding cultures, organizations, and historical settings. 

Influenced by [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Max Weber]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], and [[Alfred Schütz]], the method of descriptive ethnography that came to be associated with Geertz is credited with resuscitating field research from an endeavor of ongoing objectification—the focus of research being "out there"—to a more immediate undertaking, where participant observation embeds the researcher in the enactment of the settings being reported (For critique, see e.g. Munson 1986). 

Geertz is revered for his pioneering field methods and clear, accessible prose writing style (compare Robinson's [1983] critique). He was considered "for three decades...the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, Deirdre. "Thick and Thin Methodologies in the History of Economic Thought," in &lt;i&gt;The Popperian Legacy in Economics. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1988. 245-57.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
He served until his death as professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">In [[genetic engineering]], '''transposon tagging''' is a process where [[transposon]]s (transposable elements) are amplified inside a biological cell by a tagging technique. Transposon tagging has been used with several [[species]] to isolate [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="Ara"&gt;{{cite web |first=Paaras V. |last=Shah |year=2007 |title=Transposable Elements |url=http://arabidopsis.info/students/paaras/transposable_elements.htm}}{{Self-published inline|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even without knowing the nature of the specific genes, the process can still be used.&lt;ref name=Ara/&gt;

==Transposon tagging in plants==
By molecular separation of [[transposon]]s, from a cell nucleus, the [[cloning]] is enabled for genes which contain the transposons.&lt;ref name="NDSU"&gt;{{cite web |title=Transposon Tagging |first=Phillip |last=McClean |year=1998 |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc731/transposon/tag4.htm}}{{Self-published inline|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by [[bioethicists]] about the company's [[citizen science]] business model - namely whether it had actually obtained [[informed consent]] from its customers, and whether [[Genetic_testing#Direct-to-consumer_genetic_testing|direct to consumer genetic testing]] initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of [[Institutional review board]] (IRB) approval.&lt;ref name="WSJ2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ethics-of-experimenting-on-yourself-1414170041|title=The Ethics of Experimenting on Yourself|date=24 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|last1=Marcus|first1=Amy Dockser}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/urban-scientist/on-ethics-and-self-policing-in-citizen-science/|title=On Ethics and Self-Policing in (Citizen) Science|date=February 22, 2013|work=Scientific American Blog Network|last1=DNLee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Crowdsourced-Research-Delves/141795/|title=Crowdsourced Research Delves, Uncertainly, Into the Human Microbiome|date=23 September 2013|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues.&lt;ref name=WSJ2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/meet-your-microbes-ubiome-offers-new-service/|title=Meet Your Microbes: uBiome Offers New Service|date=June 25, 2013|work=Science-Based Medicine|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''world landscape''', a translation of the German '''''Weltlandschaft''''', is a type of composition in Western painting showing an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint that includes mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings.  The subject of each painting is usually a Biblical or historical narrative, but the figures comprising this narrative element are dwarfed by their surroundings.

The world landscape first appeared in painting in the work of the [[Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Joachim Patinir]] (c. 1480–1524), most of whose few surviving paintings are of this type, usually showing religious subjects, but commissioned by secular patrons. "They were imaginary compilations of the most appealing and spectacular aspects of European geography, assembled for the delight of the wealthy armchair traveler",&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ann Sutherland, ''Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture'', 378, 2005, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1856694151}}, 9781856694155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd0CuzsPYJcC&amp;pg=PA378 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; giving "an idealized composite of the world taken in at a single Olympian glance".&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 431&lt;/ref&gt;

The compositional type was taken up by a number of other Netherlandish artists, most famously [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. There was a parallel development by Patinir's contemporary [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and other artists of the [[Danube school]].  Although compositions of this broad type continued to be common until the 18th century and beyond, the term is usually only used to describe works from the [[Low Countries]] and Germany produced in the 16th century.  The German term ''Weltlandschaft'' was first used by Eberhard Freiherr von Bodenhausen in 1905 with reference to [[Gerard David]],&lt;ref&gt;In his monograph on Gerard David and his School (Munich, F. Bruckmann), Weemans, 263&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 1918 applied to Patinir's work by [[Ludwig von Baldass]], defined as the depiction of "all that which seemed beautiful to the eye; the sea and the earth, mountains and plains, forests and fields, the castle and the hut".&lt;ref&gt;Weemans, 263, quoting von Baldass&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of landscape backgrounds in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] was greatly admired in Italy, and Flemish specialists were employed in some Italian workshops, including that of [[Titian]].  The backgrounds to many of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s early prints were appropriated by a number of Italian artists. Patinir, "emboldened by the Italian taste for Northern rusticity, began as early as the 1510s to expand the backgrounds of his paintings out of all proportion" in a way that "violently reversed the ordinary hierarchy of subject and setting".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 42–45, 43 and 45 quoted in turn&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1520 he was well known for these subjects, and when Dürer visited him in [[Antwerp]] he described him in his diary as "the good painter of landscapes" (''gut landschaftsmaler'') in the first use of ''Landschaft'' in an artistic context.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 138; Wood, 45 (dating the visit to 1521)&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called "landscape" format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as "portable panel paintings were almost always vertical in format before 1520" and "Patinir's landscapes were among the first small horizontal panels of any sort".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 47, quoted&lt;/ref&gt; He typically uses three base colours to articulate his compositions, with a brownish foreground, a blue-green middle zone, and blues in the distance.  The horizon-line is relatively high on the picture plane.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 139; Jenson, 280&lt;/ref&gt;  Patinir (and [[Herri met de Bles]]) came from [[Dinant]] on the [[Meuse]] (in modern [[Belgium]]) where, in "a startlingly un-Netherlandish landscape", there are dramatic rock cliffs and free-standing crags along the river. These are frequently recalled in his paintings, and came to form a common feature of works by other artists.  [[Image:Crossing the River Styx.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx]]'', [[Joachim Patinir]], c. 1515–1524, Prado]]
With other vertical features, these are painted as though seen straight on even when in the lower parts of the landscape, and thus "reassert the integrity of the picture plane" in his works, against the sprawling horizontal impetus of the main landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 410; Harbison, 139, quoted ("reassert"); Silver, 30; Schama, 416–417, 416 quoted ("startlingly un-Netherlandish")&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Kenneth Clark]] and [[Simon Schama]] see these as "the last survivors of the landscape of symbols", relating them to medieval and even earlier "corkscrew" representations of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 25–27, 27 quoted; Schama, 415–417&lt;/ref&gt;

The style is related to the landscape backgrounds of [[Hieronymous Bosch]], although in his main works these function as a backdrop to his crowds of figures and are not as concerned to include a variety of landscape elements; but those of smaller works such as his ''[[St. Jerome at Prayer (Bosch)|St. Jerome at Prayer]]'' anticipate the new style.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 27&lt;/ref&gt; In most respects the paintings retain the same elements as many 15th-century treatments of the same subjects but show, in modern cinematic terms, a [[long shot]] rather than a [[medium shot]].

Most art historians regard the figure subject as continuing to be important in the works of Patinir and his followers, rather than mere [[staffage]] for a landscape, and most are of subjects where a wide landscape had relevance.  Among the most popular were the [[Flight to Egypt]], and the Netherlandish 15th-century innovation of the ''Rest on the Flight to Egypt'', and subjects showing hermits such as Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]] with the world from which they had withdrawn laid out beneath them.  As well as connecting the style to the [[Age of Discovery]], the role of [[Antwerp]] as a booming centre both of world trade and [[cartography]], and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 26–36; Wood, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;    
[[File:Cornelis massys-huida egipto-prado.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Rest on the Flight into Egypt'', [[Cornelis Massys]], c. 1540]]

The style is also an early example of the 16th-century artistic trend to "Mannerist inversion" (the term devised by [[Max Dvořák]]) or the "inverted composition", where previously minor or background elements come to dominate the picture space. In the 1550s [[Pieter Aertsen]] began a style of large canvasses dominated by great spreads of food [[still life]] and large [[genre art|genre figures]] of cooks or market-sellers, while in the background small biblical scenes can be glimpsed. Some paintings by [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] place genre figures in the foreground of paintings on religious or moral subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 152–153; Falkenberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century all these subject areas became established as independent genres in Dutch and Flemish painting, and later throughout Western painting.

Patinir's invention was developed by [[Herri met de Bles]] (1510 – c.1555–1560), who was probably his nephew. He took the type into the new style of [[Northern Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 432, 441–2&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists were [[Lucas Gassel]], the [[Brunswick Monogrammist]], and [[Cornelis Massys]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 35–39; Baldwin, 362&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Pieter Bruegel de Oude - De val van Icarus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], now seen as a good early copy of Bruegel's original]]

Massys was the son of [[Quentin Massys]], a friend of Patinir, who had added the figures to at least one Patinir landscape, the ''Temptation of St Anthony'' ([[Prado]]),&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 45; Snyder, 409&lt;/ref&gt; and who had used the style in some of his own works, such as a ''Madonna and Child'' (1513) in [[Poznań]]. Patinir increasingly left the larger figures in his works to other masters, and also seems to have had a large workshop or circle of followers in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 410; Silver, 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The style was adopted and made more natural in the landscapes of [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], who had travelled to Italy via the Alps.  Back in Antwerp he was commissioned in the 1550s by the publisher [[Hieronymus Cock]] to make drawings for a series of [[engraving]]s, the ''Large Landscapes'', to meet what was now a growing demand for landscape images.  Some of his earlier paintings, such as his ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'' ([[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld]], 1563, illustrated at top), are fully within the Patinir conventions, but his ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' (known from two copies) had a Patinir-style landscape, but already the largest figure was a [[genre painting|genre figure]] and not part of the supposed narrative subject.

Other works explored variations on the theme, with his famous set of landscapes with genre figures depicting the seasons being the culmination of his style; the five surviving paintings use the basic elements of the world landscape (only one lacks craggy mountains) but transform them into his own style.  They are larger than most previous works, with a [[genre scene]] with several figures in the foreground, and the panoramic view seen past or through trees.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 39–52; Snyder, 502–510; Harbison, 140–142; Schama, 431–433&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruegel was also aware of the Danube landscape style through [[old master print|prints]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Chapter 5, especially 275–278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danube school==
[[Image:Albrecht Altdorfer, The Battle of Alexander at Issus.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Altdorfer]], ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'', 1529, 158.4 cm × 120.3 cm (62.4 in × 47.4 in)]]

The [[Danube school]] was a contemporary group of German and [[Austria]]n artists who were also pioneers of landscape painting, and the first to regularly paint pure landscapes without figures.  Their landscapes revel in the forests of the Upper Danube, and the place of a foreground figure is often taken by a single tree, a formula invented by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], the most significant artist of the group, and used, mostly in drawings and prints, by [[Wolf Huber]] and [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]. Other innovative works showed close-up views of dense forest with hardly any distant view or even sky.  But many of their landscapes are panoramic in a version of the Netherlandish style, although the river winding out of sight normally replaces the sea that occupies the horizon of many Netherlandish works.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, throughout, especially 160–168; Snyder, 357–359, 362–364; Harbison, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;  It is probable that at least Altdorfer had seen a Patinir by about 1531; one was in [[Augsburg]] from 1517 (an ''Assumption'' now in [[Philadelphia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Altdorfer's painted landscapes are usually vertical,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 49&lt;/ref&gt; and, if only because it was commissioned for a vertical space, this is the case for the most extreme of all large world landscapes, his ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' (1529, Munich). This extraordinary painting shows a view right across the [[Mediterranean]], with a mass of tiny figures fighting a great battle in the foreground. They are in modern [[Turkey]], and the view extends beyond the island of [[Cyprus]] to the coast of [[Egypt]] and the [[Sinai peninsula]] and the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 22–23, 201–202, 266–267; Snyder, 362–363; Harbison,&lt;/ref&gt; The painting originally formed one part of a set of historical paintings in the same format.

==Influence on later landscape painting==
Both the Netherlandish and Danubian approaches to landscape painting were greatly influential for later artists.&lt;ref&gt;On Danubian influence: Wood, 165–171, 234–235, 267–275&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of Flemish artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Anton Mirou]], [[Lucas van Valkenborch]] and [[Gillis van Coninxloo]] continued to produce late Mannerist versions of the full formula, as developed by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, before in the 1590s van Coninxloo let the trees move in like curtains from the sides to restrict and then eliminate a distant view, pioneering the Flemish development of the dense forest views of the Danube school.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 175–176, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rubens]] had studied in the 1590s with his relative [[Tobias Verhaecht]], an especially conservative artist who continued to use world landscape styles derived from Pieter Bruegel the Elder until the 1620s.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;  Though [[Rubens]] rapidly outgrew his influence, in some of his later landscapes, such as the ''Summer, Peasants going to Market'' (c. 1618, [[Royal Collection]]), "the tradition of the old 'world landscape' plainly lives on".&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 189–192, 191 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of the particular formula of the world landscape, though no longer usually described by that term, continue to reappear in different versions until the 19th century.  In [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] the idiosyncratic paintings and prints of [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589 – c. 1638), as rare as Patinirs, were great panoramic views, very often with mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Silvers, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Philips Koninck]] (1619–1688) used the panoramic elevated view, and often included water, but showed vistas of flat farmland or town roofs with a low horizon.

The Italian [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]], part of the [[School of Fontainebleau]], introduced the Flemish world landscape into French art in works such as the ''[[Orpheus]] and [[Euridice]]'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] and the ''Rape of [[Proserpina|Prosperine]]'' in [[the Louvre]], both large paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]], ''Art and Architecture in France, 1500–1700'', p. 61, 2nd edn 1957, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;  In French Baroque or classical painting many artists including both [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]] painted "Landscape with ..." subjects, and for Claude wide panoramic views with mixed elements of mountains, water and small figures formed the bulk of his work, although both the viewpoint and horizon are generally much lower than in 16th-century works. Claude in turn became enormously influential, and until the early 19th century his style continued to have the advantage of giving a painting of a "landscape with" a higher place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and consequently a higher price, than a mere pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Romanticism]] this changed, but panoramic views continued to be painted in the 19th century, and artists such as those in the [[Hudson River School]], [[Edward Lear]] and Russian landscape painters took the compositional style to new landscapes around the world in works such as ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859, [[Frederic Edwin Church]]), though often excluding all people and buildings. These still featured in the huge apocalyptic religious paintings of the English painter [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], which are often literally "end of the world landscapes", taking the history of the genre back to its origins with Bosch.
