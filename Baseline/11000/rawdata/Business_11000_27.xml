      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">In the [[United Kingdom]], the '''advance corporation tax''' (ACT) was part of a partial [[dividend imputation]] system introduced in 1973 under which companies were required to [[withholding tax|withhold tax]] on [[dividend]]s before they were distributed to shareholders. The scheme was similar to the way banks were required to withhold an amount at a set rate on interest earned on bank deposits before it is paid to the account holder.

In general, this payment meant that the recipients of the dividend were considered to have already paid basic rate tax on the dividend income. Non-taxpayers, such as pension funds, who would not otherwise have paid income tax on the dividend income, became entitled to claim a refund of the ACT amount, or after 1993 a lesser amount. The refund of ACT for non-taxpayers was scrapped in 1997, but in 1999 ACT was itself scrapped, effectively making dividend income of non-taxpayers tax-free again.

The amount of ACT paid by a company could also be offset against the company's profits reducing its final [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]] bill. ACT was scrapped in 1999.

== History ==
Until 1973, company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income. In 1973, a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments, under which companies were required to withhold tax on dividends, called an advance corporation tax, before they were distributed to shareholders. UK companies could set off the ACT amount withheld against the overall company tax liability, subject to certain limits.&lt;ref name="CTM20105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm20105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM20105 — ACT: set-off against CT on profits: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (The full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed.) Shareholders of a UK company who received a dividend received a [[tax credit]] representing the ACT paid,&lt;ref name="CTM16120"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm16120.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM16120 — Distributions: impact on CT: franked investment income: general], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which could be set off against their overall income tax liability.&lt;ref name="CTM15150"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM15150.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM15150 — Distributions: general: tax consequences], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Non-taxable shareholders, such as pension funds, were entitled to a refund of the ACT amount.

When introduced in 1973, the ACT rate on the gross dividend (the amount distributed plus the ACT withheld) was 30%, the basic rate of income tax at the time. Until 1993 the income tax rate payable on dividends was the same as all other income, and the ACT rate was adjusted to align it to changes in the basic rate of income tax. From April 1993, the ACT rate was cut to 22.5% while the tax rate on dividend income was set at 20%, the first time it was set at a different rate to that payable on other income (25%). The tax credit was tied to the 20% rate rather than the ACT rate of 22.5%, meaning that non-taxpayers could no longer claim a refund for the full amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The ACT rate was cut to 20% from April 1994.

In 1997, the tax credit was scrapped for non-taxpayers (except charities and [[Personal Equity Plan|PEPs]]), which had a particular impact on pension funds, which could no longer claim a refund for any amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The effect of the change was that pension funds became effectively taxed on dividend income by way of the now non-refundable ACT, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly resulting in the winding up of some pension funds. Treasury argued that the change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/evandavis/2007/04/that_pensions_raid.html That pensions raid], [[Evan Davis (journalist)|Evan Davis]] 2 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' obtained documents under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] in April 2007 that showed the chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] had been advised that pension funds would suffer a £67 billion loss of the actuarial value of their assets as a net result of a combination of policies including the ACT change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1599843.ece Gloomy predictions that the Chancellor chose to ignore - Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

ACT was scrapped from 6 April 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult/consult_2.htm HM Revenue &amp; Customs: A modern system for corporation tax payments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307051505/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult/consult_2.htm |date=March 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a tax credit on dividend income of 10%. From 6 April 2016, the tax credit was itself abolished and replaced with a tax-free dividend allowance of £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dividend-allowance-factsheet/dividend-allowance-factsheet HM Revenue &amp; Customs Policy paper: Dividend Allowance factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16506">The '''American system of manufacturing''' was a set of [[manufacturing]] methods that evolved in the 19th century. The two notable features were the extensive use of  [[interchangeable parts]] and [[mechanization]] for production, which resulted in more efficient use of labor compared to hand methods. The system was also known as '''armory practice''' because it was first fully developed in [[armory (military)|armories]], namely, the United States Armories at [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Harpers Ferry Armory|Harpers Ferry]] in [[Virginia]] (later [[West Virginia]]),&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[inside contracting|inside contractors]] to supply the [[United States Armed Forces]], and various private armories.  The name "American system" came not from any aspect of the system that is unique to the American national character, but simply from the fact that for a time in the 19th century it was strongly associated with the American companies who first successfully implemented it, and how their methods contrasted (at that time) with those of British and continental European companies. In the 1850s, the "American system" was contrasted to the British [[factory system]] which had evolved over the previous century. Within a few decades, manufacturing technology had evolved further, and the ideas behind the "American" system were in use worldwide. Therefore, in manufacturing today, which is global in the scope of its methods, there is no longer any such distinction.

The American system involved semi-skilled labor using [[machine tool]]s and [[jig (tool)|jigs]] to make standardized, identical, [[interchangeable parts]], manufactured to a [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]], which could be assembled with a minimum of time and skill, requiring little to no [[wikt:fit#Verb|fitting]].

Since the parts are interchangeable, it was also possible to separate manufacture from assembly, and repair—an example of the [[division of labor]]. This meant that all three functions could be carried out by semi-skilled labor: manufacture in smaller factories up the supply chain, assembly on an [[assembly line]] in a main factory, and repair in small specialized shops or in the field. The result is that more things could be made, more cheaply, and with higher quality, and those things also could be distributed further, and lasted longer, because repairs were also easier and cheaper. In the case of each function, the system of interchangeable parts typically involved substituting specialized machinery to replace hand tools.

Interchangeability of parts was finally achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and [[machine tools]], which were developed primarily for making textile machinery. These innovations included the invention of new machine tools and jigs (in both cases, for guiding the [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tool]]), fixtures for holding the work in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

==Use of machinery==
English machine tool manufacturer [[Joseph Whitworth]] was appointed as a British commissioner for the New York International Exhibition. Accompanied by another British commissioner, he traveled around several states visiting various manufacturers, and as a result published a highly influential report on American manufacturing, from which he is quoted:

{{quote| The laboring classes are comparatively few in number, but this is counterbalanced by, and indeed, may be one of the causes of the eagerness by which they call in the use of machinery in almost every department of industry. Wherever it can be applied as a substitute for manual labor, it is universally and willingly resorted to….  It is this condition of the labor market, and this eager resort to machinery wherever it can be applied, to which, under the guidance of superior education and intelligence, the remarkable prosperity of the United States is due.&lt;ref&gt;{{Roe1916}}. {{Citation | title = Report of the British Commissioners to the New York Industrial Exhibition | place = London | year = 1854}}.&lt;/ref&gt; | Joseph Whitworth, 1854}}

==Other characteristics==
The American system contributed to efficiency gains through division of labor. Division of labor helped manufacturing transition from small artisan's shops to early factories. Key pieces of evidence supporting efficiency gains include increase in firm size, evidence of returns to scale, and an increase in non-specialized labor. The need for firms to train uneducated people to perform only one thing in the productivity chain allowed for the use of non-specialized labor. Women and children were employed more frequently within larger firms, especially those producing furniture and clothing.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}}.

==History==
In the late 18th century, [[France|French]] General [[Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]] suggested that [[musket]]s could be manufactured faster and more economically if they were made from interchangeable parts. This system would also make field repairs easier to carry out under battle conditions. He provided patronage to [[Honoré Blanc]], who attempted to implement the [[Gribeauval system|''Système Gribeauval'']], but never succeeded.&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt; Until then, under the British [[factory system]], skilled machinists were required to produce parts from a design.  But however skilled the machinist, parts were never identical, and each part had to be manufactured separately to fit its counterpart—almost always by one person who produced each completed item from start to finish.

Mass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]], and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir [[Samuel Bentham]], the Inspector General of Naval Works at [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] at [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], for the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War. By 1808 annual production had reached 130,000 [[Block (sailing)|sailing blocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Enlightenment &amp; measurement |publisher=Making the modern world |url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/enlightenment_and_measurement/05.ST.02/?scene=3&amp;tv=true |place=[[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Portsmouth dockyard | place =UK |url=http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Block |title=Collections |publisher=Science museum |contribution-url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/ |place=UK | type = exhiblet}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gilbert |first=KR |title=The Portsmouth Block-making Machinery |place=London |year=1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cooper |first=CC |title= The Production Line at Portsmouth Block Mill | journal=Industrial Archaeology Review |volume=VI |year=1982 |pages=28–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cooper |first=CC |title=The Portsmouth System of Manufacture |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=25 |year = 1984 | pages =182–225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coad |first=Jonathan |title=The Royal Dockyards 1690–1850 |place=Aldershot |year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coad |first=Jonathan | title =The Portsmouth Block Mills : Bentham, Brunel and the start of the Royal Navy's Industrial Revolution |year=2005 |isbn=1-873592-87-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkin |first=Susan |title=The application of emerging new technologies by Portsmouth Dockyard, 1790–1815 |publisher=The Open University |type=PhD Thesis |year=1999}} (copies available from the British Thesis service of the British Library).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last=Cantrell |editor1-first=J | editor2-last =Cookson |editor2-first=G |title=Henry Maudslay and the Pioneers of the Machine Age |place=Stroud |year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America, becoming known as the ''American System of Manufacturing'', even though it originated in England.

The [[Lowell system]] is also related to the American system during this time.  It emphasized procuring, training, and providing housing and other living necessities for the workforce, as well as using semi-automated machines in a centralized factory building or complex.

Gribeauval's idea was conveyed to the US by two routes. First, Blanc's friend [[Thomas Jefferson]] championed it, sending copies of Blanc's memoirs and papers describing his work to [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]].  Second, artillery officer [[Louis de Tousard]] (who had served with [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]) was an enthusiast of Gribeauval's ideas. Tousard wrote two influential documents after the [[American Revolution]]; one was used as the blueprint for [[West Point]], and the other became the officer's training manual.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

The War Department, which included officers trained at West Point on Tousard's manual, established the armories at [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] and [[Harper's Ferry]] and tasked them with solving the problem of interchangeability. The task was finally accomplished in the 1820s. Historian [[David A. Hounshell]] believes that this was done by [[Captain John H. Hall]], an [[Inside contracting|inside contractor]] at Harper's Ferry.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt; In a letter dated 1822 Hall makes the claim he achieved interchangeability in 1822.&lt;ref name ="Cowan 1997"/&gt; But historian [[Diana Muir]] argues that it is more probable that it was [[Simeon North]], a Connecticut arms contractor manufacturing guns for the US Army. North, not Hall, was the inventor of the crucial [[milling machine]] in 1816, and had an advantage over Hall in that he worked closely with the first industry that mass-produced complex machines from mass-produced [[interchangeable parts]], the Connecticut clock-making industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Diana | last = Muir | title = [[Reflections in Bullough's Pond]] | publisher = University Press of New England}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}  By 1815 the idea of interchangeability was well established in the US government system of procurement; Congressional contracts stipulated this quality in muskets, rifles and pistols ordered after that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = James Burke (science historian)| first = James | last = Burke | title = Connections | publisher = Little, Brown &amp; Co | origyear = 1978 | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-316-11672-6 | page = 151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Interchangeability of firearms parts at the U.S. armories was found to have been in use for a number of years by the time of the 1853 British Parliamentary Commissions Committee on Small Arms inquiry.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

A critical factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several [[machine tool]]s, such as the slide rest lathe, screw cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. One of the most important and versatile of these machine tools was [[David Wilkinson (machinist)#Wilkinson lathe|David Wilkinson's lathe]], for which he received a $10,000 award from the government of the United States.&lt;ref name="Thompson2009"&gt;{{cite book | title=Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790–1865 |last=Thompson |first= Ross |year=2009 |publisher =The Johns Hopkins University Press |location= Baltimore, MD |isbn= 978-0-8018-9141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}

[[Eli Whitney]] is generally credited with the idea and the practical application, but both are incorrect attributions. Based on his reputation as the inventor of the [[cotton gin]], the US government gave him a contract in 1798 for 10,000 muskets to be produced within two years. It actually took eight years to deliver the order, as Whitney perfected and developed new techniques and machines. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott apologizing for the delays, Whitney wrote:
{{quote| One of my primary objectives it to form tools so the tools themselves shall fashion the work and give to every part its just proportion – which when once accomplished, will give expedition, uniformity, and exactness to the whole…  In short, the tools which I contemplate are similar to engraving on a copper plate from which may be taken a great number of impressions, perfectly alike.&lt;ref name= "Cowan 1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cowan |first= Ruth Schwartz |title= A Social History of American Technology | publisher=Oxford University Press | place =New York |year=1997 |pages=7–8 |isbn= 0-19-504606-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}}}

Whitney did use machinery; however, there is no evidence that he produced any new type of metalworking machinery.&lt;ref name= "Cowan 1997" /&gt; After completing the initial contract, Whitney went on to produce another 15,000 muskets within the following two years. Whitney never actually expressed any interest in interchangeability until 1800, when [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.|Wolcott]] exposed him to the memoirs of Blanc,&lt;ref name= "hounshell-1984" /&gt; but he spent far more time and energy promoting the idea than developing it.

In order to spread knowledge of manufacturing techniques, the War Department made contractors open their shops to other manufacturers and competitors.  The armories also openly shared manufacturing techniques with private industry.&lt;ref name = "Thompson2009" /&gt; Additionally, the idea migrated from the armories to industry as machinists trained in the armory system were hired by other manufacturers. Skilled engineers and machinists thus influenced American [[clockmaker]]s and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860.&lt;ref name= "hounshell-1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States |last= Thomson |first = Ross | year = 1989 | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | isbn = 978-0-80781867-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late to adopt the interchangeable system were [[Singer Corporation]] sewing machine (1870s), [[reaper]] manufacturer [[Cyrus McCormick|McCormick Harvesting Machine Company]] (1870s–80s)&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt; and several large steam engine manufacturers such as Corliss (mid-1880s)&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930 | volume = 2: Steam Power |last=Hunter |first= Louis C. | year=1985 |publisher = University Press of Virginia | location = Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as locomotive makers. Large scale of production of bicycles in the 1880s used the interchangeable system.&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt;

The idea would also help lead to the American "Golden Age" of manufacturing when [[Henry Ford]] mass-produced the automobile. Mastering true interchangeability on the assembly line, the Ford plant produced standard model cars. These efficient production strategies allowed these automobiles to be affordable for the middle class.

===Pre-Industrial Revolution===
{{more citations needed |date=November 2006}}
The idea of interchangeable parts and the separate assembly line was not new, though it was little used. The idea was first developed in [[East Asia]] during the [[Warring States]] period and later the [[Qin Dynasty]] over 2200 years ago – bronze crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be interchangeable. [[Venice]] during the late Middle Ages had ships that were produced using pre-manufactured parts, [[assembly line]]s, and [[mass production]]. The [[Venetian Arsenal]] apparently produced nearly one ship every day, in what was effectively the world's first [[factory]].

:''For the French gangster movie, see [[Borsalino (film)|Borsalino]]''
'''Borsalino''' is the oldest Italian company specializing in the manufacture of luxury [[hats]]. Since 1857, the manufacture has been based in [[Alessandria]], Piedmont. The founder, Giuseppe Borsalino, is remembered for creating a particular model of felt hat that has come to be known eponymously as a "borsalino".

==History==
On 4 April 1857, [[Giuseppe Borsalino]] started a workshop in Alessandria that specialized in the production of felt hats. The workshop eventually grew to industrial production, and in 1888 the company moved to a new factory designed by Arnaldo Gardella, located on Corso Cento Cannoni, Alessandria. In these years Borsalino produced 2,500 hats a day, but when the company won the Grand Prix, an important quality certificate, at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900]], spread the brand's fame globally. The succession of Giuseppe Borsalino was complicated: the designated heir, Teresio Borsalino, was opposed to his cousin Giovanni Borsalino, son of Lazzaro, who inaugurated a new hat factory using the family name. Between Borsalino Antica Casa and Borsalino Fu Lazzaro were years of hard commercial battles but in the end the Teresio came out and the name Borsalino became one again. 

On the eve of the [[First World War]] Borsalino produced about 2,000,000 hats annually. The manufacture employed over 2,500 employees, representing a significant resource in the economy of the Piedmontese city. Abroad, the brand spread everywhere, conquering the most important markets: the British, but especially the US, where the hats produced in Alessandria were adopted by the Hollywood starsystem. 

The downsizing of the company occurred in 1950 in conjunction with the beginning of the fall into disuse of formal hats: Borsalino is thus transformed from mass product into a cult object. In 1987 the hat factory moved from the historic center in Alessandria to the current one of Spinetta Marengo, in the suburbs of the city, and the president Vittorio Vaccarino, the last descendant of the Borsalino family, sold the company to a group of Milanese entrepreneurs. 

In the nineties the company changed ownership several times to be finally bought by the entrepreneur Marco Marenco, involved in a €3.5 billion financial crack. 
On 18 December 2017 the Court of Alessandria declared the bankruptcy of Borsalino Giuseppe and Fratello Spa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title=Indiana Jones' Italian hatmaker Borsalino goes bust|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/12/19/indiana-jones-italian-hatmaker-borsalino-goes-bust/|accessdate=20 December 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Famed Italian hatmaker Borsalino declared bankrupt|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20171219-italy-business-famed-italian-hatmaker-borsalino-declared-bankrupt|accessdate=20 December 2017|publisher=France 24|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Haeres Equita, a private equity fund which manages the brand's activities since 2016, confirms the will to continue the production, the distribution and the promoting activities of the forthcoming collections, keeping all employments and maintaining the production site in Alessandria (Piedmont)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lastampa.it/2017/12/18/edizioni/alessandria/borsalino-lattivit-continua-la-societ-di-philippe-camperio-conferma-la-volont-di-andare-avanti-qpQFTj5VypqKSPeFOWoSwL/pagina.html&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, on the occasion of the 160th anniversary of the company, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development recognized Borsalino as one of the 'Excellencies of the production system', dedicating it a stamp worth €0.95&lt;ref&gt;http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/borsalino-160th-anniversary-celebrated-postage-stamp-italy-10857782/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Production==
Borsalino manufacturing has remained faithful to a production process that represents the cultural values of the company, handed down from generation to generation. 
The hats continue to be produced in Alessandria by combining industrial technology and the spirit craftsmanship. The felt models, created from wool fibres, require more than 50 manual steps and seven weeks of work to create; the straw models, which are hand twisted, can take up to 6 months for a single hat&lt;ref&gt;https://maestrosacademy.samsung.it/Alice-Rapetti&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.borsalino.com/en/antica-casa/craftsmanship&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilpost.it/2015/12/04/come-si-fa-un-Borsalino/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Borsalino and Alessandria==
The Borsalino business dynasty has made an important contribution to the city of Alessandria, building the aqueduct, the sewerage network, hospital, sanatorium and retirement home&lt;ref&gt;https://radiogold.it/tempo-libero/40790-nostalgica-fu-alessandria-miti-marchi-fatto-storia-citta-suo-territorio/&lt;/ref&gt;. The historic headquarters of the company, currently located in Corso 100 Cannoni, now hosts the [[University of Eastern Piedmont]] Amedeo Avogadro and the Borsalino Hat Museum&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultural.it/musei/Borsalino.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museimpresa.com/associato/museo-cappello-Borsalino/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/opencms/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Luogo/MibacUnif/Luoghi-della-Cultura/visualizza_asset.html?id=152786&amp;pagename=57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regione.piemonte.it/pinforma/cultura/1167-un-nuovo-museo-del-cappello-Borsalino.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 
In 2016, independent film director Enrica Viola dedicated a documentary to the relationship between Borsalino and Alessandria: Borsalino City&lt;ref&gt;http://www.Borsalinocity.it/index-it.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gqitalia.it/moda/trend/new/2016/04/26/tutto-quello-che-non-sai-sul-cappello-Borsalino/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://film.cinecitta.com/IT/it-it/news/70/2413/Borsalino-city.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; was presented at film festivals in [[Turin]], Barcelona and [[Melbourne]].

==The Borsalino Hat Museum==
In the spring of 2006, the Borsalino Hat Museum opened in the company's historical headquarters in Corso 100 Cannoni, Alessandria. A joint initiative by Alessandria town council and the Borsalino company, the museum covers an exhibition area of 400 m² and houses about two thousand hats, displayed in the historic Chippendale style cabinets made in the 1920s by Arnaldo Gardella for the factory sample room. In 2018, the museum is planning to move to a larger venue with a completely renovated exhibition&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lastampa.it/2017/10/05/edizioni/alessandria/finito-il-cantiere-per-il-museo-borsalino-ora-si-deve-riallestire-ci-vorranno-mesi-DZl3crV7CHCkfQILVjRJcI/pagina.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Borsalino and art==
The relationship between Borsalino and the art world has ancient origins. Since the birth of advertising in Italy, at the turn of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Borsalino has entrusted the realization of its posters to the most important artists of the time. This privileged relationship with art has been confirmed over time and has led the company to collaborate with Cesare Simonetti, Giorgio Muggiani, Giovanni Dradi, Franz Laskoff, [[Marcello Dudovich]], winner in 1910 of a competition organized by Borsalino to publicize the Zenit hat, Giuseppe Minonzio, [[Gino Boccasile]], Luigi Bompard, Jeanne Grignani, [[Luigi Veronesi]], [[Max Huber (graphic designer)|Max Huber]] and [[Armando Testa]]. Today the antique Borsalino advertising posters are collector items that have been beaten in the most important auction houses in the world.

==Borsalino and cinema==
Borsalino has a long-running and special bond with the film industry. One picture stands out above all: [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the unforgettable final scene of [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]. The relationship with the cinema was destined to last: in addition to Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, [[Marcello Mastroianni]] in [[81/2 (Film)|8 ½]] and [[Jean Paul Belmondo]] in [[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]] both wore a Borsalino. 

Above all, the Alessandria factory granted the use of its name to two cult films of the 1970s: [[Borsalino (film)|Borsalino]] and [[Borsalino &amp; Co.]]. The idea was [[Alain Delon]]'s, and Borsalino accepted on the condition that the company logo would appear on the posters. The Italian company was the first luxury brand to give its name to two films. 

In 2011, the [[Triannale Design Museum|Triennale Design Museum]] in Milan hosted an exhibition entitled "Il cinema con il cappello. Borsalino e altre storie"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://old.triennale.org/en/mostre/passate/385-il-cinema-con-il-cappello-Borsalino-e-altre-storie |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113041003/http://old.triennale.org/en/mostre/passate/385-il-cinema-con-il-cappello-Borsalino-e-altre-storie#.WXij6a1aai4#.WXij6a1aai4 |archive-date=2018-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.panorama.com/culture/Al-cinema-col-cappello-i-Borsalino-piu-famosi-del-grande-schermo-in-mostra-alla-Triennale-di-Milano&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/cultura/2011-01-18/bogart-alain-delon-triennale-182145.shtml?uuid=Aa2kju0C&lt;/ref&gt;.

The actor [[Toni Servillo]] wears a Borsalino in the film [[The Great Beauty]], which won [[Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[86th Academy Awards]].

==Borsalino and design==
In 2009, Borsalino was included by the Triennale Design Museum in Milan among quintessential Italian icons in the 'Serie Fuori Serie' exhibition&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triennale.org/design_museum/serie-fuori-serie-seconda-edizione-design-museum/&lt;/ref&gt;. The exhibition was replicated in March 2017 at the [[National Museum of China]] in Beijing&lt;ref&gt; http://musei.beniculturali.it/notizie/mostre/inaugura-a-pechino-la-mostra-serie-fuori-serie&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Chapeau Lamp&lt;ref&gt;https://www.designboom.com/design/philippe-starck-chapeau-for-flos/&lt;/ref&gt; (2014) designed by [[Philippe Starck]] for Flos and the sculpture The Hatband&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/moda/2016-05-20/borne-firma-cappello-benefico-i-125-anni-fenwich-bond-street-124731.shtml?uuid=ADiJZBM&lt;/ref&gt;(2016) by [[Moritz Waldemeyer]] are both tributes to Borsalino.

==Borsalino and fashion==
Borsalino has been collaborating with some of the most important names in the fashion system since the beginning of the millennium. These have led to the creation of capsule collections with Nick Fouquet&lt;ref&gt;https://www.antonia.it/module/anteditorial/article?article_id=520&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Tom Ford]], [[Moschino]], [[Yohji Yamamoto]], [[Marni]], [[Gianfranco Ferré]], [[Rochas]], [[Italia Independent]] and [[DSquared]].

The '''Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport''' (CILT) is a [[professional body]] representing the [[transport]] and [[logistics]] industries worldwide. It is a membership based organisation with over 30,000&amp;nbsp;members in over 30&amp;nbsp;countries. This international body is also known as '''CILT International''' to distinguish it from the [[#Representation|National Councils, sections and branches]].

The principal objective of the CILT is "To promote and encourage the art and science of logistics and transport", which it achieves both through its membership and [[professional certification|professional qualifications]]. It provides extensive opportunities for training and learning opportunities with a range of internationally recognise qualifications and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciltinternational.org/education-development/international-courses/|title=International courses - CILT|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who need support and assistance with their Continuous Professional Development (CPD) CILT have an International Awards Committee that offer a range of scholarships and awards. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciltinternational.org/education-development/awards-and-sponsorship/|title=Awards and sponsorship - CILT|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute of Transport (IoT) was founded 3 November 1919 and granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1926&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciltinternational.org/about-cilt/our-story/|title=Our story - CILT|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become the Chartered Institute of Transport (CIT).

In 1999 the Chartered Institute of Transport and the Institute of Logistics (IoL) combined activities to become the Institute of Logistics and Transport (IOLT). In 2004 "chartered" was adopted into the title, which now reads Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport.

== Membership and Chartered membership ==
The institute of Logistics and Transport offers 5 grades of membership: Associate, Student, Member (MILT), Chartered Member (CMILT) and Chartered Fellow (FCILT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciltinternational.org/membership/individual-cilt-membership/membership-levels/|title=Membership Levels - CILT|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chartered Membership is the Institute's senior professional grade of membership. Only professional bodies that have been granted the Royal Charter can award chartered membership, such as: Chemical, Electrical, Civil, and Mechanical Engineers; Certified, Chartered, Public Finance Accountants; and Surveyors. CILT's Chartership is of equivalent standing to these, and applying for it requires demonstrating achievement of educational attainment, professional competence and (CPD) to a panel. A Chartered Member is awarded the [[post-nominal letters]] CMILT.

Chartered Members who have attained important positions or have had distinguished careers can be nominated for Fellowship, with the post-nominal letters FCILT.

== Teaching and qualifications ==
The Institute has a programme of teaching and qualifications, which can lead to a diploma or a degree in transport or logistics. In addition, they certify academic degrees from other institutions, such as the [[Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds]] and [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lms/en/ The Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies], [[The Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], providing their graduates with exemption from examinations for proceeding to chartered status.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4223">The '''''Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act''''' ('''CFPOA''') (the ''Act'') is an [[anti-corruption]] law in force in [[Canada]]. It was passed in 1999, ratifying the [[OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]] and is often referred to as the [[Canada|Canadian]] equivalent to the United States' ''[[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]'' (FCPA).

== Jurisdiction ==

Canada has jurisdiction over the bribery of a foreign [[public official]] when the offense is committed in whole or in part in its territory. To be subject to the jurisdiction of Canadian courts, a significant portion of the activities constituting the offense must take place in Canada.

The FCPA is considered to have far greater jurisdictional reach than the CFPOA, applying to issuers in the United States, domestic concerns and any person pursuing a bribery arrangement with a foreign official while within the territory of the United States.

== Relevant Provisions ==

The ''Act'' provides under Section 3.(1):

Every person commits an offence who, in order to obtain or retain an advantage in the course of business, directly or indirectly gives, offers or agrees to give or offer a loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind to a foreign public official or to any person for the benefit of a foreign public official.

(a) as consideration for an act or omission by the official in connection with the performance of the official's duties or functions; or

(b) to induce the official to use his or her position to influence any acts or decisions of the foreign state or public international organization for which the official performs duties or functions.

== Criticism ==

In March 2011, [[Canada]] and the CFPOA was criticised by the [[OECD]] which complained of limit to the ''Act'''s jurisdiction, insufficient numbers of investigators, and weak penalties in the event of a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/oecd-slams-canadas-lack-of-prosecution-of-bribery-offences/article1959569/ The Globe and Mail, “OECD slams Canada’s lack of prosecution of bribery offences”]&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2011, the [[NGO]] [[Transparency International]] suggested that [[Canada]] was a long way behind other [[developed countries]], identifying it as one of 21 states undertaking "little or no enforcement" of their anti-bribery legislation". It reported that "Canada is the only G7 country in the little or no enforcement category, and has been in this category since the first edition of this report in 2005".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/24/canada-anti-bribery_n_866461.html The Huffington Post, “Transparency International Criticizes Harper Administration For Not Enforcing Anti-Bribery Laws” ]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] [[consultancy]] Billiter Partners suggested that "unlike its US counterparts, Canadian authorities have yet to charge a well-known Canadian firm for bribery." The most high profile recent CFPOA [[Workplace Investigation|investigation]] resulted in charges being made in May 2010 against Nazir Karigar for allegedly making a payment to an Indian government official to facilitate a multimillion-dollar contract for the supply of a security system. Also notable was the announcement in January 2009, that the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) was reported to be investigating [[Niko Resources]] over allegations that it had made improper payments to [[government officials]] in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110910145519/http://www.billiterpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/OECD-Criticism-Masks-Changes-in-Canada%E2%80%99s-Anti-Corruption-Landscape-March-2011.pdf Billiter Partners, “OECD Criticism Masks Changes in Canada’s Anti-Corruption Landscape”,  March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''customer benefit package (CBP)''' forms part of the [[operations management]] (OM) toolkit. It involves a clearly defined set of tangible (goods) and intangible (services) features that the customer recognizes, purchase or use. This can be the real or perceived value that a customer experiences or believes they are receiving through dealing with a company.

==Overview==
A combination of a primary product with additional goods and services defines the total product to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing for Quality and Performance Excellence|last=Lindsay|first=James R.|last2=Evans|first2=William M.|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=0324783221|edition=Eighth|location=Mason, OH|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a CBP is a combination of services and goods that adds value to the primary product acquired by the customer. The primary product is the “core” offering that attracts customers and satisfy their basic needs. These goods and services adding value to the primary product are called peripheral goods and services, which are not essential to the primary product, but enhance it. Examples of peripheral goods and services in the fast food industry include toys (peripheral goods) that are offered as part of a kiddie’s meal and a kids' play area (peripheral service) inside the fast food restaurant.

The CBP may also contain some variants as part of the product offering. A variant is an attribute that departs from the CBP overall theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OM3|last=Evans|first=David A.|last2=Collier|first2=James R.|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|year=2009|isbn=0538479132|edition=Student|location=Mason, OH|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding unique goods or services like free Internet access inside the fast food restaurant gives the customer the ability to surf the Internet while enjoying a meal. Often a variant will become part of the CBP on a continuous basis, thus it becomes a permanent peripheral good or service.

== Benefits of a CBP ==
* Defines the services or products offering to the customer.
* Serves as guidelines for employees when selling the product.
* Provides a marketing and communication channel to reach the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer-Driven Demand and Operations Management Models: A Systematic Study of Information-Technology-Enabled Sales Mechanisms|last=|first=|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=0387980180|editor-last=Netessine|editor-first=Serguei|location=New York, NY|pages=|editor-last2=Tang|editor-first2=Christopher S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CBP integration as part of OM ==
The CBP cannot stand on its own as a system or tool. OM requires effective management of the whole value chain starting with identifying the customer’s needs and ending with supplying a final product that meets or exceeds the customer’s expectations. Developing the CBP through all these stages of the value chain is essential to create and deliver a process for each peripheral good or service adding to the overall development of the final product to the customer.

== More example CBPs ==
===Automobile industry ===
The requirements of the customer (client) are clearly defined within a contract agreement between the contractor and the customer. However, there are a number of peripheral good and services that can be developed in this highly controlled environment. Disciples like quality management and risk management in conjunction with information technology (IT) systems and operations management (OM) processes can be used to develop systems with the ability to capture real-time data and report directly to the customer. This is just one example of many more possibilities that can differentiate a contractor from the competition.

=== Medical ===
Medicine is evolving daily; there are new cures to diseases, new vaccines and new diagnostic technology that once thought impossible. "There is however an extreme lack in incorporating information technology (IT) and OM processes within medical practices. I have therefore decided to re-evaluate the value chain within my new general practitioner (GP) practice", a South African doctor comments. Living in the information age, patients want to know everything, so much a new term "googlelitis" is used in describing many patients. Embracing this new culture (need) amongst patients can be satisfied with the use of short message service (SMS) technology to report medical results and confirm future appointments.

==Controversy==
After her retirement, controversy arose when [[Micah Wright]], a former Nickelodeon employee and creator of the pilot "Constant Payne" published a document that described embezzlement, corruption &amp; mismanagement within the company during Zarghami's tenure at Nick, Wright described Zarghami as having an extremely hostile personality and stated that she mistreated employees at Nick and stole revenue from them without compensation. Wright also stated that she illegally harassed, fired, &amp; blacklisted staff who were members of the [[Writers Guild of America West]]. Hughes also said that the reason why his cartoon pilot "Constant Payne" was rejected was because Zarghami said that action shows "promoted terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;https://mobile.twitter.com/RiseFallNick/status/1004069919384883200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''David John Gunn''', generally known as '''Davey''' or '''Davy''', (18 September 1887 – 25 December 1955) was a keen promoter of the attractions of the [[Hollyford Track]] and from 1936 guided parties to them.  A farmer and [[the bush#New Zealand|bushman]] he ran his almost wild cattle in the glacier-cut [[Hollyford River|Hollyford Valley]] in [[Fiordland]], [[Westland District|South Westland]], New Zealand. 

Gunn was the fourth of five children of Scottish parents, Isabella Grierson Robertson and her husband, Alexander Gunn. A one-time shepherd,&lt;ref name="DNZB Gunn"&gt;{{DNZB|Owen|Alwyn|4g25|Gunn, David John|24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Gunn ran a sheep farm of 27,000 acres in Central Otago.&lt;ref name=WDA&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WDA19170517.2.21?query=gunn%20waimate Waimate Daily Advertiser, page 3, 17 May 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; For secondary schooling David lived at Hook near [[Waimate]] with his maiden aunts on their 500 acre farm.&lt;ref name=WDA/&gt; Matriculating and leaving school he briefly followed other family members into [[Dalgety and Company|Dalgety's]] working in one of their many branch offices as a clerk before deciding a desk job did not suit him.&lt;ref name=JB&gt;Julia Bradshaw (with Murray Gunn), ''The Land of Doing without, Davey Gunn of the Hollyford'', 2007, Canterbury University Press. {{ISBN|9781877257537}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went back to work on and later manage the farm at Hook.&lt;ref name=WDA/&gt;  He underwent military training at Trentham in 1918 but was too late to be sent overseas.&lt;ref name=JB/&gt;
[[File:Hollyford2036.jpg|thumb|A bridge on Gunn's Hollyford Track]]
He went farming on his own account 100 miles south of Waimate at [[Sutton, New Zealand|Sutton]]. On 10 July 1919 at [[Morven, New Zealand|Morven]] near Waimate he married Ethel May Willetts, a confectioner. They were to have two daughters, Isabel and Dorothy, and a son, Murray. 

George Gunn, an early runholder, mapped some of the [[Hollyford Valley]] in 1861. In 1926 David Gunn bought freehold land there from remaining original settlers, the McKenzie family. He increased his Hollyford landholding in 1929, just before the onset of the [[Great Depression]], by acquiring four leases totalling more than 25,000 acres. He then moved to the valley, establishing his solitary base at Deadman's Hut on the banks of the [[Hollyford River]]. Gunn cut a number of well used tracks and erected huts in the more remote parts of his run. 

His wife took their children to Oamaru to be educated and Gunn returned to his family for brief visits only twice a year.
{{NOTOC}}
==Fox Moth crash==
Gunn came to public attention on 30 December 1936 with a speedy journey to bring assistance to the injured passengers of a [[de Havilland Fox Moth]] cabin plane he had seen crash into the sea at [[Big Bay, New Zealand|Big Bay]]. He covered the 90-kilometre, four-day journey in just 21 hours, a feat which earned him a [[King George VI Coronation Medal]] the following year.
==Hollyford Track and tourism==
[[File:Mt Tutoko, Hollyford Track (5845381298).jpg|thumb|Mt Tutoko, Hollyford Track]]
In 1936, Gunn began guiding tramping parties down his [[Hollyford Track]], and would continue doing so until his death in 1955. Friendly and hospitable by nature, and possessing considerable personal charm, Gunn became a well-known and popular figure. He was respected for his bushcraft, his energy, and his knowledge of the area.

On Christmas Day 1955, Gunn was fording the Hollyford River on horseback near [[Hidden Falls (New Zealand)|Hidden Falls]], with a 12-year-old boy mounted behind him. The horse stumbled and fell, and both riders were seen to find their feet in the river, until the horse stood up and they were both swept away and drowned. Gunn's body was never found.

After his death his son, Murray, continued to guide trampers in the area, and started "Gunn's Camp", a rest-stop for trampers with store and small museum, which still stands near the southern end of the track, around 10&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Milford Sound]]-[[Te Anau]] highway.

'''David Ho Sue San''' ({{zh|c=何树生|p=Hé Shùshēng}}; born September 20, 1949) is a [[Malaysian Chinese]] entrepreneur and businessman in pharmaceutical industry. He is from [[Ipoh]], [[Perak]], [[Malaysia]]. The eldest son of the late Dr. Ho Kai Cheong ({{zh|c=何继昌}}), the founder of [[Ho Yan Hor Herbal Tea]] ({{zh|c=何人可凉茶}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ipoh when Tin was King|author=Ho Tak Ming|publisher=PERAK ACADEMY|isbn=978-983-42500-2-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4jCQh1l78gC&amp;pg=PT196&amp;dq=when+tin+was+king+hovid&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-OsvTfiTO9HRrQfCtdC1CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
When Ho was a young boy, he used to follow his father visiting major cities in Malaysia to promote herbal tea in a commercial van using a loud speaker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipohworld.org/blog/?p=2052&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Ho graduated with a Master of Pharmacy from [[University of Otago]], [[New Zealand]]. He worked as a research pharmacist at [[Wyeth]], [[United Kingdom]] before returned to Malaysia in 1980, to assist his father Dr. Ho in the herbal tea business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoy.com.my/master04.php|title=Master Category 2004 - Mr David Ho Sue San|date=|publisher=Ernst &amp; Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.ipohworld.org/search8/result.asp?strid=4895&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
During the 1980s, the herbal tea business was still using traditional Chinese methods to sun dry the herbal tea ingredients, which was unhygienic. Manual labor was employed to pack the tea bags and this cause the production rate to be very slow moving. Seeing this, Ho introduced the idea of using machines to do the drying and packing.

He successfully  transformed the [[Ho Yan Hor Herbal Tea]] business into a pharmaceutical manufacturing company, [[Hovid Berhad]] (as known as Hovid Public Limited or [[Hovid Inc]]), a public listed company on the main board at Bursa Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://bursanews.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1029&amp;p=19294&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hovid Berhad]] now produces more than 300 types products including generic drugs, dietary supplements and other consumer products. The company exports to more than 50 countries worldwide and has a website for direct end consumer purchase.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.mopi.org.my/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=61&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Ho is also the Managing Director of Carotech Berhad, a listed company on ACE Merket of Bursa Malaysia. Carotech is involved in the extraction of [[Vitamin E]] and [[Carotene]] from crude palm oil and the company is also a producer of [[Biodiesel]] using crude palm oil.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.palmoiltruthfoundation.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=112&amp;Itemid=74&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faith ===
Being a faithful Christian, Ho holds the president post of the Profession Youth Fellowship of Elim Gospel Hall, Ipoh since 1990, leading a group of young working professionals in church ministry and doing charity among the community.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://jumblestation1.blogspot.com/2010/12/elim-gospel-hall-blesses-poor-single.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2363">A '''distribution deal''' (aka '''distribution contract''' or '''distribution agreement''') is a legal agreement between one party and another, to handle [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of a product.

There are various forms of distribution deals.  There are exclusive and non-exclusive distribution agreements.  In an exclusive distribution agreement, there is only one distributor or distribution agent.  The distributor is excluded from having any other distributors.  Thus the product supplier is limited to the performance of that distributor.  If the distributor does not sell product, then no project will be sold.  Thus the law implies some degree of effort into these distribution agreements.  Thus regardless what the distribution agreement says, the law will find it is breached if the distributor does not actually try to distribute the products.  Likewise distribution agreements should have explicit terms on point.  This problem arises when distributors distribute several products and/or have other businesses.  

In a non-exclusive distribution agreement, the supplier may use other distributors, mitigating the above concern.  However, at the other end of the spectrum, the supplier may have several distributors, and this may amount to a glut of them in the market, such that distributors have difficulty due to fierce competition on price and terms.

Distribution agreements are frequently broken up in terms of countries, such that a set of supply companies in one market/country, possibly supply companies in related fields like sports equipment, share a distribution agent in another market/country.  This keeps costs down, allowing the distributor to use economies of scale.

Another issue that arises is when either the quality of the supplier or distributor substantially deteriorate.  If the counterpart supplier/distributor is excessively tied to them, they may suffer as the supplier/distributor's quality/service deteriorates.  All of this should be considered when entering distribution deals.

'''ESCP Europe''' ({{lang-fr|École supérieure de commerce de Paris}}) is a European [[business school]] with campuses in [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], [[London]], [[Madrid]], [[Turin]], and [[Warsaw]]. 
ESCP Europe is one of the most selective French [[Grandes écoles]] and referred in France as one of the "trois Parisiennes" (three Parisians)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://major-prepa.com/concours/dates-oraux-hec-essec-escp/|title=Voici les dates des oraux aux Parisiennes (HEC, ESSEC, ESCP) - Major-Prépa|website=major-prepa.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, together with [[HEC Paris]] and [[ESSEC Business School]]. ESCP is also considered as the world's oldest [[business school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.escpeurope.eu/escp-europe/history-of-escp-europe-business-school|title=History of ESCP Europe|publisher=ESCP Europe|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accredited by the [[Paris Chamber of Commerce]], ESCP Europe is one of the 76 business schools in the world to have obtained the [[triple accreditation]] of [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]], [[European Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]].

==History==
[[File:Jean-baptiste Say.jpg|thumb|247px|French economist and businessman [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] (1767-1832), one of the founders of the school]]
The school was established in Paris on 1 December 1819 as the world's first business school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.generation-europe.eu/assets/resources/youth_centre/career_development_and_employment/career_guidance/FocusOn2012-09Career-GuidanceUK.pdf |title=Focus On - Generation Europe Foundation - Career Guidance (page 5) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517222047/http://www.generation-europe.eu/assets/resources/youth_centre/career_development_and_employment/career_guidance/FocusOn2012-09Career-GuidanceUK.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Renouard, ''Histoire de l'École supérieure de commerce de Paris'', Raymond Castell éditions, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; by a group of economic scholars and businessmen including the well-known economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and the celebrated trader [[Vital Roux]]. It was modeled on the first Grande École, the [[École Polytechnique]] founded by Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge, but was initially much more modest, mainly because it had not been supported by the state. It gradually gained in stature and importance during the 19th century and moved to its current Parisian location on Avenue de la République in 1898.

|}

In 1828, the project to put the school under the authority of the French [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry]] failed. The school remained independent by the intervention of [[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui]] who took it over. Several times during the first half of the 19th century, French politics planned on grouping ESCP Europe with French elite engineering schools such as [[École Polytechnique]]  or [[École Centrale Paris]], but that never occurred. From 1838, the French state began to give scholarships to ESCP Europe's students and in 1852 it accredited ESCP Europe's programs.

Finally, in 1869 the [[Paris Chamber of Commerce]] bought the school to train future business leaders to modern commercial methods. Until 1870 there was only one business school in France: ESCP Europe. In 1892, ESCP Europe set up selective admission processes which still take the form of competitive exams.

On April 5, 1973 the concept of a multi-campus business school was founded with the consecutive inaugurations of campuses in the United Kingdom (London in 1974, move to Oxford in 1975) and in Germany ([[Düsseldorf]] in 1975, move to [[Berlin]] in 1985). Since then, the school has deepened its European presence to become an integrated pan-European business school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kaplan Andreas: A school is “a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside”: Toward the reinvention of the business school| doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* In 1985, the School’s campus in Germany moves from Düsseldorf to Berlin at the invitation of the Government of Berlin.
* In 1988, a fourth campus is opened in Madrid.
* In 1999, ESCP merges with its sister school EAP.
* In 2001, the Master in Management programme of ESCP Europe is validated by [[City University London]].
* In 2004, a fifth campus in Torino, Italy is founded. Validated by the [[University of Turin]], Master in Management students can obtain the Italian degree Laurea Magistrale.
* In 2005, the School inaugurates its London campus having moved from Oxford.
* In 2007, the Master in Management programme is recognized by the [[Charles III University of Madrid]] and students can obtain the Spanish degree of Master Europeo en Administración y Dirección de Empresas.
* In 2015, the School establishes its sixth European campus via a strategic alliance with the Warsaw-based [[Kozminski University]].
* In 2016, the School decides to strengthen its footprint in Paris by adding a second campus located in the [[Montparnasse]] quarter.

==Campus==
ESCP Europe students have the opportunity to study in campuses in France (Paris),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutional website |url=http://www.escpeurope.eu/campus/escp-europe-campus-paris/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK (London), Spain (Madrid), Germany (Berlin), Italy (Turin), and Poland (Warsaw). They can spend either 6 months or 1 year on each campus according to their study choices. Each campus has its own specifics and develops programs with local academic institutions. For instance, in Spain ESCP Europe provides a Master in Business Project Management co-delivered with the [[Technical University of Madrid]].

From 2017, ESCP Europe will have two campuses in Paris. One near the [[Place de la République]] (11th arrondissement of Paris) and another one near the [[Montparnasse Tower]] (15th arrondissement of Paris). Each campus is dedicated to a specific range of programs. The campus in the 11th arrondissement hosts all the [[graduate programs]] whereas the campus in the 15th arrondissement hosts the [[undergraduate education]], the [[executive education]] and the school's start-up [[Business incubator|Incubator]]. This organization is unique to Paris. In every other school undergraduate, graduate and executive education are dispensed in the same campus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7620">An '''equitable adjustment''', in [[government contracting]], is a [[contract adjustment]] pursuant to a [[changes clause]], to compensate the contractor expense incurred due to actions of the Government or to compensate the Government for contract reductions. An equitable adjustment includes an allowance for profit; clauses that provide for adjustments, excluding profit, are not considered "equitable adjustments."

==Variations==

*A "price adjustment" is a change to the established price of the contract arrived at by mutual agreement between the Government and contractor.
*An "adjustment in estimated quantities" is a contract adjustment pursuant to the contract clause on variation in estimated quantities.
*A "bilateral modification" is a supplemental agreement on which the Contracting Officer and the contractor have agreed to a price and/or time adjustment.  Contrast a "unilateral modification," a modification on which the Contracting Officer and the contractor cannot agree to a price and/or time adjustment equal to or within the Government Estimate. In such cases the modification containing the adjustment in price and/or time price contained in the Government Estimate may be issued unilaterally, with or without a Contracting Officer's Final Decision. Unilateral modifications are also used to make administrative changes and to issue termination notices.

==In a "changes clause" in government construction contracts==
[[Changes clause]]s give the government the power unilaterally to order contractual modifications;&lt;ref&gt;4-15 Construction Law P 15.03&lt;/ref&gt; in return, the contract specifies that if the parties are unable to agree on compensation to be received by the contractor for the modified work, the contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment. The goal of an equitable adjustment is to place the contractor in the position he or she would have been in had the change not been encountered. The adjustment should not alter the contractor's profit or loss position from what it was before the change occurred.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Shea Co. v. United States, 10 Cl. Ct. 620 (1986) . Where a contract was bid in a lump sum, the equitable adjustment for substitution of work is computed by the following formula: (1) Adjusted contract price; (2) Less projected cost without changed conditions; (3) Plus actual cost under changed conditions; (4) Plus reasonable profit/overhead computed in accordance with governing regulations on difference between 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
As mutually agreed by the government and contractor.

==Venues==
Equitable adjustments are determined by federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;4-15 Construction Law P 15.03&lt;/ref&gt;  The cornerstone of the regulatory scheme is the [[Federal Acquisition Regulations System]], which comprises the [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]] (hereinafter referred to as "FAR"), which are contained in Chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations,&lt;ref&gt;The FAR were published at  48 Fed. Reg. 42,102&lt;/ref&gt; and agency regulations supplementing or implementing the FAR.&lt;ref&gt;Agency regulations implementing the FAR are as follows:  Agency for International Development (AID), 49 Fed. Reg. 13,236 (1984) ;  Department of Commerce, 49 Fed. Reg. 12,956 (1984) ;  Department of Defense, 49 Fed. Reg. 11,302 (1984) ;  Department of Energy, 49 Fed. Reg. 11,922 (1984) ;  Environmental Protection Agency, 49 Fed. Reg. 8834 (1984) ;  Federal Emergency Management Agency, 49 Fed. Reg. 12,646 (1984) ;  General Services Administration, 49 Fed.

Reg. 42,102 .&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier contracts are governed by the prior agency regulations. The principal prior regulations were the Defense Acquisition Regulations &lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Federal Procurement Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several major legislative changes over the years. The [[Contract Disputes Act]] of 1978&lt;ref&gt;41 U.S.C. §§ 601-613. See also  In re Liberty Constr., 9 F.3d 800 (9th Cir. 1993) (the federal district courts have subject matter jurisdiction in suits against the SBA, even after the passage of the Contract Disputes Act, because the SBA's "sue and be sued" provision independently confers jurisdiction).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Courts Improvement Act]] of 1982&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25 (Apr. 2, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; established new procedures and remedies for the resolution of disputes between the government and contractors. The [[Competition in Contracting Act]] of 1984 (CICA) &lt;ref&gt;41 U.S.C. §§ 251 and 253.&lt;/ref&gt; encourages competitive government [[procurement]] procedures.&lt;ref&gt;See  AT&amp;T Communications, Inc. v. Wiltel, Inc., 1 F.3d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (The [[Competition in Contracting Act|CICA]] does not prevent modifications to a contract if the modifications are not outside the scope of the original contract); Birch &amp; Davis Int'l, Inc. v. Christopher, 4 F.3d 970 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (CICA and FAR preclude the elimination of a bidder as not in competitive range if such bidder has a "reasonable chance" that it will be selected); Rapides Regional Medical Ctr. v. Secretary, 974 F.2d 565 (5th Cir. 1992) (defining "procurement" as the term applies to the CICA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirement of causation==
To paraphrase Ralph L. Jones Co. v. United States, 33 Fed. Cl. 327, 331-332 (Fed. Cl. 1995):
:The ultimate goal of an equitable adjustment is to do equity;&lt;ref&gt;General Dynamics Corp. v. United States. 218 Ct. Cl. 40, 56, 585 F.2d 457 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve equity, the government contractor seeking an equitable adjustment bears the "essential burden of establishing the fundamental facts of liability, causation, and resultant injury."&lt;ref&gt;Wunderlich Contracting Co. v. United States, 351 F.2d 956, 968-969 (Ct. Cl. 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  It must show that the increased costs arose from work which was materially different from that contemplated by the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Mojave Enterprises v. United States 3 Cl. Ct. 353, 357 (1983); Miller Elevator Co., Inc. v. United States 30 Fed. Cl. 662, 678 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The increased costs must be the direct and necessary result of the changes.&lt;ref&gt;Johns-Manville v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 1, 33 (1987) (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;
:An equitable adjustment is determined by whether the work was foreseeable based on the information before the contractor at the time of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;See Johns-Manville v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 1, 33 (1987); Sterling Millwrights v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 49, 72 (1992); Mojave Enterprises, 3 Cl. Ct. at 357.&lt;/ref&gt; "Foreseeability" in this instance refers to work that reasonably could be anticipated based on the contemplation of the parties. The question is whether the work would be a foreseeable consequence of those matters the parties "considered with continued attention," regarded thoughtfully, or "viewed . . . as probable or as an . . . intention."See Webster's New International Dictionary, 2d ed. 574 (1955).

[[File:Morrisons' Distribution Centre, Eurocentral Business Park, Mossend, 18 September 2011.jpg|thumb|Morrisons' distribution centre]]
'''Eurocentral''' is one of the largest industrial estates in Scotland situated on the edge of Holytown and Mossend, [[North Lanarkshire]], just off the A8/M8 motorway, about {{convert|12|mi|km}} east of [[Glasgow]] city centre and {{convert|34|mi|km}} west of [[Edinburgh]]. The nearest communities to the estate are Holytown, Mossend, Chapelhall, Calderbank and Carnbroe. The closest major towns are Bellshill {{convert|4|mi|km}}, Motherwell {{convert|4|mi|km}}, Coatbridge {{convert|4|mi|km}} and Airdrie {{convert|4.5|mi|km}}.

[[File:The Big Heids, Eurocentral (geograph 2584498).jpg|thumb|"The Big Heids" sculpture]]
There is a bus link to and from Glasgow city centre and Livingston, West Lothian. Eurocentral has warehouse distribution centres, factories, call centres, a railfreight centre which links with Grangemouth docks {{convert|28|mi|km}} to the north east, England to the south and beyond to mainland Europe. The estate also has a large modern hotel/restaurant (Dakota). One of the landmarks of the Eurocentral are the so-called "Big Heids" which are three red upturned shipping containers with tubes making the shape of human heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scottish fact of the day: M8 motorway sculptures |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/scottish-fact-of-the-day-m8-motorway-sculptures-1-3621566 |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maxim Office Park is a recent addition opening in March 2010. With 10 buildings totalling over {{convert|756000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Built in a single phase, Maxim is also the UK’s largest speculatively built office park.

==Eurocentral factory==
Eurocentral was the name given to a former factory near [[Holytown]] in [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]] operated by the Taiwanese television parts manufacturer Chunghwa Picture Tubes (中華映管). The building is sometimes referred to as ''The Chunghwa Factory''. The factory is infamous because it was built using large amounts of taxpayers’ money but was demolished within 10 years.

Originally designed as a factory to produce [[cathode ray tube]]s for use in television sets and monitors, the rapid rise in popularity of LCD and plasma televisions contributed to the huge losses made by the Chunghwa company. It is also reported that a huge water bill from [[West of Scotland Water]] also helped contribute to the eventual demise of the site. Opening in 1996 the factory was expected to create 3,000 local jobs. However employment never rose above 1,200 and the factory was empty by 2003. The company was forced to repay £8 million of the £20 million it received from the government.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The factory was demolished and the site developed into a mixed use commercial and business park.

==Maxim Park==
The £330 million park is the UK’s largest speculative office park development, comprising 10 buildings, totalling {{convert|756000|sqft}} of high quality space. The entire park was completed in March 2010. As well as Grade A office accommodation and a wide range of shops and leisure facilities the park also houses one of Scotland's largest nurseries, Papillon Nursery and one of the [[Dakota Hotels]] (although not part of the Maxim estate it is very close by and built in keeping with the park's image).

The park currently has a shuttle bus service provided by Castle Cars of Uddingston.

Current tenants include: Proact IT, Papillon Nursery, [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]], REGUS, Currie &amp; Brown, Vaillant, Berits &amp; Brown, Peppery Horse, ACS Clothing and Sure Thing Insurance, a newly incorporated insurance intermediary.

In June 2014, planning permission was granted for the addition of a sports pavilion.

'''Francesco "Franco" Macri''' (born 15 April 1930) is an [[Italian Argentine]] businessman and father of the Argentine president [[Mauricio Macri]].

==Life and times==
===Childhood in Italy===
Franco Macri was born in [[Rome]], to Giorgio Macri and Lea Garbini.&lt;ref name=repubblica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallori|first1=Paolo|title=Argentina: Mauricio Macri, la saga familiare tra un accento perduto e una "y"|url=http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2015/11/24/news/argentina_mauricio_macri_saga_familiare-127983658/|website=[[La Repubblica]]|publisher=Divisione Stampa Nazionale - Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother belonged to a prosperous local family, proprietors of an [[intercity bus]] service and supporters of Fascist Dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. His father, in turn, was born to a family of fallen nobility from the [[Calabria]] Region of [[Italy]]. Opponents of ''il Duce'', their kinship to the powerful Pellicano clan allowed them to retain a small [[postal service]] carrier in the area around [[San Giorgio Morgeto]].&lt;ref name=repubblica/&gt; The eight-year-old Franco and his two younger siblings were sent to a [[military school]] in 1938, following their parents' divorce two years earlier, a common fate for the children of divorced couples under [[Italian Fascism]]; they were reunited with their father in [[Genoa]] five years later.&lt;ref name=ale&gt;Ale, Ana. ''La Dinastía''. Editorial Planeta, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival in Argentina===
The [[birth of the Italian Republic]] prompted Giorgio Macri to enter politics, by which he co-founded a nationalist party, ''[[Uomo Qualunque Front|L'Uomo Qualunque]]'' ("The Common Man"), ahead of the [[Italian general election, 1946|general elections in June 1946]]; following the party's poor showing, however, he departed for [[Buenos Aires]], settling in the western suburb of [[San Justo, Buenos Aires|San Justo]]. He later obtained housing in the [[Eva Perón Foundation]]'s [[Ciudad Evita]] community, and was joined by his three children in January 1949. Franco Macri found work in as a construction laborer; he was promoted quickly and held an administrative post within a year, later earning his secondary school diploma at the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]] and, in 1950, establishing a [[construction]] firm, Urbana.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

Obtaining a number of small, public contracts, Urbana ultimately failed, and Macri entered into a partnership, Vimac, in 1953. The firm was boosted by a lucrative contract from [[Loma Negra]], the leading Argentine [[cement]] producer, for the construction of a new plant near [[Tandil]] in 1955. He married Alicia Blanco Villegas, the daughter of a prominent Tandil physician, in 1958, relocated to [[Mar del Plata]], and had the first of their four children, Mauricio, in 1959.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

===Leading contractor===
Macri started a [[home builder]], Demaco, and purchased a tony Buenos Aires apartment facing Vicente López Plaza (in the heart of the upscale [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] district). The 1962 installation of ultraconservative Economy Minister [[Alvaro Alsogaray]], however, and the latter's policy of paying state contractors and employees with worthless "Ninth of July Bonds" led to Vimac's closure.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

Joined by two investors and aided by an economic recovery, in 1964 he fused Demaco with the remains of Vimac to establish Impresit-Sideco. The firm secured a coveted contract with Italian automaker [[Fiat]], for the construction and maintenance of their [[Caseros, Buenos Aires|Caseros]] factory, and quickly became a leading [[public works]] contractor, notably in the construction of the [[General Belgrano Bridge]], the [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha I]] and [[Embalse nuclear power plant]]s (Latin America's first), as well as in private works, such as an [[AGIP]] [[gas pipeline]] and the [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Catalinas Norte]] office park.&lt;ref name=konex&gt;[http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/premios/curriculum.asp?id=1448 Fundación Konex: Francisco Macri {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inheriting his father's interest in film (the elder Macri had worked for the iconic [[Cinecittà]] Studios), he also established MBC, which produced [[Argentine cinema|cinema]] for local directors [[Leopoldo Torre Nilsson]] and [[Alejandro Doria]], among others.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

Having had completed over 30 major public works projects worth over US$1.8 billion since 1964, Macri acquired [[Philco]] and [[NEC]]'s Argentine affiliates and gained controlling interest in Impresit and established Socma, a [[holding company]] for his various interests, in 1976.&lt;ref name=konex/&gt; The installation of the [[National Reorganization Process|last dictatorship]] that year, and their appointment of Buenos Aires Mayor [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]] led to the closure of the city's tens of thousands of apartment building [[incinerator]]s, whose noxious disposal of the city's 3,000 daily tons of refuse had been worsening air quality for decades. Cacciatore had them replaced in 1979 with curbside pickup service awarded to ''Manliba'', a consortium between Impresit-Sideco and [[Waste Management, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/08/29/laciudad/h-01987895.htm ''Clarín'' (8/29/2009) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri's marriage ended in separation in 1980 (no provision existed in Argentina for divorce until 1987), and in 1982 he married Cristina Cressier, with whom he had his sixth child, Florencia. The collapse of the Argentine auto industry in 1981-82 allowed Macri to purchase a controlling stake in [[Sevel Argentina S.A.]], a local [[joint venture]] between Fiat and [[Peugeot]] formed in 1980. The acquisition averted the closure of the European automakers' Argentine plants, and tripled Socma's income.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

Macri's finances were undermined, however, from losses stemming from the Banco de Italia y Río de la Plata, of which he was majority shareholder between 1975 and 1980. The subsequent crisis, which resulted from the implosion of Economy Minister [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]]'s financial deregulation and strong [[Peso ley|peso]] policies, also prompted Macri to take advantage of an exchange rate guarantee enacted by the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] in 1980 for large private borrowers facing sharply higher [[U.S. dollar]] payments, a benefit granted to Sevel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavision.com.ar/ocio/interes/a_info_ert1.htm La Vision: El dólar en la Argentina {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventures and misadventures===
He entered into a valuable [[real estate]] venture in [[New York (state)|New York]], when in 1979, developer [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] sold him a 75% stake in 30 hectares (75 acres) of [[Hudson River]]front land formerly owned by [[Penn Central]]. Planning to develop "[[Riverside South (New York City)|Lincoln West]]," a residential complex, Macri invested US$100 million in mandated public works and related expenses, but could not, ultimately, service a [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan]] loan or meet the city's myriad [[zoning]] demands, selling the land to [[Donald Trump]] in 1985 for US$117 million.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

The disappointment was compounded by a heart attack in 1983, and the end of his second marriage in 1986, by which he lost custody of Florencia. He suffered serious losses during the country's repeated currency crises between 1987 and 1990, but gained from a partnership with [[BellSouth]] and [[Motorola]] to form [[Movicom]], the first large-scale Argentine [[mobile phone]] service provider.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

A supporter of [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja Province]] Governor [[Carlos Menem]] ahead of his upset victory in the 1988 [[Justicialist Party]] primaries, Macri broke from the flomboyant President when, after his [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 election]] (which he won on a populist platform), he pursued aggressive [[free trade]] policies that undermined Sevel (by then the largest automaker in Argentina) in favor of cheaper imports.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt; [[Carlos Grosso]], Menem's appointed [[Mayor of Buenos Aires]] (a presidential prerogative until 1996), was a managerial employee of Macri's. A vocal [[Peronist]], Grosso had reportedly been spared becoming one of the "[[Desaparecidos|disappeared]]" upon his 1978 military abduction only by Macri's appeal on his behalf to Internal Affairs Minister [[Albano Harguindeguy]] and [[Apostolic Nuncio]] [[Pio Laghi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-103174-2008-04-27.html ''Página/12'' (4/27/2008) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The family was shaken by the August 23, 1991, kidnapping of [[Mauricio Macri]], Franco Macri's eldest son. Freed after two weeks in captivity for a reported ransom of US$6 million, Macri's abduction was executed by four members of the [[Policía Federal Argentina]], which has policing purview over Buenos Aires (the perpetrators were located only a decade later).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rionegro.com.ar/arch200105/l12j20.html ''Río Negro'' (5/12/2001) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sevel, the Socma Group's centerpiece at the time, initially benefitted from the boom touched of by Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]'s [[Argentine Currency Board|Convertibility Plan]] in 1991, seeing its auto sales grow from 30,000 in 1990 to 200,000 in 1994.&lt;ref name=sevel&gt;[http://www.bradynet.com/docs/sevel.doc Sevel Argentina S.A.]&lt;/ref&gt; The local auto industry was hit hard, however, by the [[Mexican peso crisis]]. A fall in sales to 130,000 led the company to divest itself of the Fiat licence in 1996, and Sevel revenues fell by nearly half, to US$1.1 billion.&lt;ref name=sevel/&gt; During the Menem-era wholesale [[privatization]] drive, Macri was outmaneuvered in a 1997 bid for the management of the nation's 33 main [http://www.aa2000.com.ar/aeropuertos.aspx airports] by [[Eduardo Eurnekian]], though Socma was sold the national [[Communications of Argentina#Post|postal service]] in July 1997. Sevel was eventually liquidated, rescinding its Peugeot licence in March 2000, well into the [[Argentine economic crisis]], and the Socma Group's global revenues fell from US$4.5 billion in 1994 to US$2 billion in 2001.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt; Following Sevel's liquidation, Macri was convicted of [[customs duty]] evasion relating to an auto export-import scheme via neighboring [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=38149 ''La Nación'' (10/24/2000) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Macri, a fan of the [[Boca Juniors]] football club since the 1950s, has had a commercial relationship with it for almost as long, dating from his 1960 partnership in a small [[insurance]] firm with the club's president at the time, Alberto Armando. He leveraged this to promote his elder son, Mauricio, as president of the club in 1992, though he was defeated by the incumbent, Antonio Alegre (credited with saving the club from insolvency in the 1980s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ole.clarin.com/notas/2008/01/03/01576706.html ''Olé'' (1/3/2008) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Macri was elected in 1995, however, and caused controversy by earmarking a multi-million dollar renovation of the ''[[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|Bombonera]]'' stadium, and granting the contract to Impresit (Macri's construction firm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labotellaalmar.com/vercorreo_lector.php?id=1666 ''La Botella del Mar'' (11/8/2005) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Florencia, Macri's youngest daughter, was kidnapped on April 30, 2003, and freed a week later after a ransom of nearly a million dollars was reportedly paid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaeconomica.com/numeros4/211/noticias/chfrancomacrilu.htm ''América Economica'' (5/6/2003) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The federal postal service contract with Socma, through ''Correos Argentinos'', was rescinded, citing the company's debt to taxpayers of US$296 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=547207 ''La Nación'' (11/21/2003) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pago Fácil'', the [[electronic funds transfer]] service operated by Socma, became one of the group's leading firms, processing over 7 million payments a month. Among the group's most significant real estate developments after 2004 was the [[Mulieris towers]], in Buenos Aires' [[Puerto Madero]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francomacri.com/home.php Franco Macri: presente]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri returned to the auto industry in 2007, when he obtained licensing to produce [[Chery]] automobiles, as well as their parts, which would be assembled in Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieco.clarin.com/notas/2007/12/04/01556659.html ''iEco'' (12/4/2007) {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213145805/http://www.ieco.clarin.com/notas/2007/12/04/01556659.html |date=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Mauricio, was elected Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2007, and in 2008, the 78-year-old Macri divested Socma of two of its most important firms, Iecsa (construction) and Creaurban (real estate), in favor of Angelo Calcaterra, his nephew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-101109-2008-03-22.html ''Página/12'' (3/22/2008) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Chery Socma, the joint venture with the [[Chinese automobile industry|Chinese automaker]], exported its first units in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larepublica.com.uy/economia/379381-chery-socma-comenzo-a-exportar ''La república'' (9/5/2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macri published a reflection on his over half-century as an Argentine businessman, ''El futuro es posible'', in 2004; he still keeps the suitcase with which he arrived in Argentina in 1949.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;

In April 2016, following the leak to German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' of 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian [[law firm]] [[Mossack Fonseca]], the leaked [[Panama Papers]] revealed that Macri was [[List of people named in the Panama Papers|listed]] as director of a Bahamas-based trading company that he did not disclose during his tenure as Mayor of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fusion.net/story/287227/famous-presidents-shell-companies-trove/ |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |title=Here are the famous politicos in 'the Wikileaks of the mega-rich' |author=Fusion Investigative Unit |date=April 3, 2016 |work=[[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gV2Vu0h3?url=http://fusion.net/story/287227/famous-presidents-shell-companies-trove/ |archivedate=April 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-panama-papers-massive-leak-reveals-the-global-elites-secret-cash-havens|title=The Panama Papers: Massive Leak Reveals the Global Elite's Secret Cash Havens {{!}} VICE News|website=VICE News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034715/https://news.vice.com/article/the-panama-papers-massive-leak-reveals-the-global-elites-secret-cash-havens|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/04/secret-panamapapers-files-who-did-what/82599656/|title=Panama Papers: Who's accused of what|website=USA TODAY|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Panama Papers made the news, Macri appeared in a short TV interview in which he said his father, Franco Macri, had founded the company through a "legal operation". He added that the company had been intended to carry out investment operations in Brazil but the business was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-argentina-idUSKCN0X1202|title=Argentina's Macri denies wrongdoing at 'Panama Papers' offshore firm|date=2016-04-04|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Joaquín Morales Solá]] considered it unlikely that Macri would be prosecuted for the Panama revelations. Macri appears himself in the directory, Franco Macri had reported it to the AFIP, and it was closed in 2008, just a year after Mauricio Macri became chief of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1886614-el-final-de-un-ciclo-impune|title= El final de un ciclo impune|trans-title=The end of a cycle of impunity|language= Spanish|author= Joaquín Morales Solá|date= April 6, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2016, federal prosecutor Federico Delgado began a formal investigation into Macri's involvement with Fleg Trading Ltd., the company registered in Panama for which President Macri was listed as director. Judge Sebastián Casanello was asked to start the file on the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1913658-panama-papers-el-juez-casanello-ordenan-un-analisis-comparativo-sobre-las-declaraciones-juradas-de-mauricio-macri|title= Panamá Papers: el juez Casanello ordenó un análisis comparativo sobre las declaraciones juradas de Mauricio Macri|trans-title=Panama Papers: judge Casanello ordered a comparative analysis of Mauricio Macri's sworn wealth|language= Spanish|author= Paz Rodríguez Niell|date= June 29, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial petition was made by Norman Martínez, deputee for the [[Front for Victory]].

{{Chinese name|[[Yan (surname)|Gan]] ({{zh|s=颜|t=顏|p=Yán|poj=Gân}})}}
'''Gan Eng Seng''' ({{zh|s=颜永成|t=顏永成|p=Yán Yǒngchéng|poj=Gân Íng-sîng}}; 1844–1899) was a Chinese businessman and philanthropist who was one of the early pioneers of Singapore. He is known for his generosity to many charitable causes in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and Singapore during the British colonial era. Some of his most recognised contributions were the setting up of [[Gan Eng Seng School]], the Thong Chai Medical Institution, [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]], and the [[Ee Hoe Hean Club]].

==Life==
[[File:87 Amoy Street.jpg|thumb|Former residence of Gan Eng Seng at No. 87 [[Amoy Street, Singapore|Amoy Street]].]]

Gan was of [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] Chinese descent, born and educated in [[Malacca|Melaka]], and the eldest son of five in his family. His forefathers emigrated from [[Fujian]], China, to Malaya. Owing to poor circumstances, he had an elementary school education in which he learnt to read and write in simple English and keep accounts. After his father's death, Gan, then 16 years old, was involved in the [[nutmeg]] business on a very small scale.&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;Lim, "Gan Eng Seng", pp. 128—135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gan was later taken as an apprentice by [[Guthrie (Malaysia)|Guthrie and Company]]. He was diligent and capable, and his ability won him the recognition and keen interest of Thomas Scott, one of the partners in the company. Scott was one of the early British pioneers responsible for developing [[Tanjong Pagar|Tanjung Pagar]] and the port of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Tanjong Pagar Citizens' Consultative Committee|title = Tanjong Pagar: Singapore's Cradle of Development|publisher = Singapore: Tanjong Pagar Citizens' Consultative Committee|year = 1989|page =135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gan was subsequently promoted to the post of Assistant Storekeeper and then Chief Storekeeper of the company. In 1874, he became the company's Chief Compradore, a position which he held for the next 25 years. Scott later helped to finance some of Gan's early business ventures, one of which was to supply labour and transport to the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company which helped Gan make most of his personal fortunes.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;

===Family===
Gan married his first wife, Koh Chwee Neo, at the age of 18, and in 1859 adopted his first son, Gan Tiang Tock, who was an important partner in the building of his fortune. He had a total of five wives, seven sons and two daughters. However, only two of his children were born by his wives; his other children were adopted, a customary practice which was then considered auspicious.&lt;ref name="GES"&gt;GESSOSA, "Our Founder: Gan Eng Seng", pp. 18—21.&lt;/ref&gt; His immediate family members were:&lt;ref name="GES"/&gt;

===Gan Eng Seng School===
[[File:GESS Heritage Plaques.jpg|thumb|The [[Gan Eng Seng School Founding Site|original school site]] at Telok Ayer Street was designated by the Singapore government as a Heritage Site in August 1997]]

Although Gan had little education, he realised its value as he prospered and became wealthy. His dream to build a school for the poor which taught both English and Chinese (Hokkien, as Mandarin was not commonly used in Southeast Asia then) was fulfilled in 1885, when he built the ''Anglo-Chinese Free School'' for boys in some shophouses in [[Telok Ayer Street]] (not related to the [[Anglo-Chinese School]] founded a year later by Bishop W.F. Oldham). In 1923, it was renamed to [[Gan Eng Seng School]] (GESS) in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;GESSOSA, "1899—1941: Board of Trustees and The Pre-War Years", pp. 33—47&lt;/ref&gt;

Gan Eng Seng School is unique among the schools in Singapore being the only one initiated, established and maintained by a local citizen with a gift of freehold property, buildings and adequate funds until his demise.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; Most other schools of the time were established by missionary or communal organisations.

Before it became a government school in 1938, it had on its [[Board of Trustees]] fellow Chinese pioneers such as Tan Keong Saik, Ho Yang Peng, Wee Theam Tew, Lee Cheng Yan, S.J. Chan, Wee Swee Teow, [[Song Ong Siang]], and [[Lim Boon Keng]]. Under their management, Gan Eng Seng School was able to serve the local community as a self-funded school for nearly forty years without interference.&lt;ref name="Dabbs"/&gt;

In later generations, some of Gan's descendants choose to return to serve the school:

*Three sons of the founder, Gan Tiang Kwee, Gan Tiang Choon and Gan Tiang Tok, were on the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name="Dabbs"&gt;Dr. Dabbs, ''The History of Gan Eng Seng School'', pp.109—120.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gan Hock Chye, grandson of Gan Eng Seng, was a pupil at the school and later return to serve as the Master of Gan House and committee member of the GESS Old Students' Association in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Dabbs"/&gt;
*Gan Kee Soon, one of the great grandsons of Gan Eng Seng, was a mathematics teacher in GESS at its Anson Road site from 1960 to 1969 teaching pre-university classes.&lt;ref name="Dabbs"/&gt;

As of 2002, it is located at 1 Henderson Road after it has moved eight times during its 122-year history; the most ever known in Singapore schools due to expansion needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = School gets its seventh home: Gan Eng Seng's pioneering spirit lives on|date = 13 July 1989|publisher = [[The Straits Times]]|page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gan also founded a school for the poor in the village of Sam-toh in Fujian, China, where his forefathers were born, and helped to finance and maintain the Tranquerah Chinese Free School in Melaka. He also enabled young men of promise to realise their potential by paying for their university education. An example was the case of Wee Theam Tew, who gave up a clerical post with Macalister &amp; Co. and proceeded to England to further his studies in law and qualify for the Bar in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;GESSOSA, "1885—1899: Our Pioneering Years", pp. 35—37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thong Chai Medical Institution===
[[File:Old Thong Chai Medical Institution, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|The Old Thong Chai Medical Institution along [[Eu Tong Sen Street]], Singapore]]

The [[Old Thong Chai Medical Institution|Thong Chai Medical Institution]] was another major charity which Gan strongly backed and financed. It was established in 1867 and is the oldest charitable institution in Singapore. It began treating the poor of all races and religions in a rented shophouse at 31 Upper Pickering Street. In 1975, it was relocated to 50 Chin Swee Road and till today, the institution continues to provide free medical consultation and herbal medicines to all.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;

==Tan Tock Seng Hospital==
Gan was always among the first to respond to pleas for donations, giving thousands of dollars to local hospitals. He also helped to pay for coffins to bury the poor. The 1892 annual report of [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]] mentioned that Gan donated a freehold property at Rochor to the hospital.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; The hospital is still serving the public and came into the international spotlight when it was designated as the sole treatment centre for the [[SARS]] epidemic which struck Singapore in 2003.

===Ee Hoe Hean Club===
[[File:Ee Hoe Hean Club, Singapore.jpg|thumb|The [[Ee Hoe Hean Club]] at [[Bukit Pasoh Road]], Singapore]]

In 1895, Gan was one of the co-founders of the [[Ee Hoe Hean Club]], a social-cum-business club where like-minded Chinese businessmen could mingle and exchange ideas. Its members included notable Chinese pioneers such as [[Lim Boon Keng]], [[Tan Kah Kee]], [[Lim Nee Soon]] etc. It was originally located on [[Duxton Hill]] but moved to [[Bukit Pasoh Road]] in 1925. The club plays an active role in community services and charity work to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Cornelius-Takahama|first = Vernon|url = http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_526_2005-01-07.html|title = Lim Nee Soon|accessdate = 28 August 2007|publisher = [[National Library Board]] Singapore|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705030338/http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_526_2005-01-07.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate = 5 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 9 September 1899, Gan died at the age of 55 in his house at No. 87 [[Amoy Street, Singapore|Amoy Street]]. His total assets were worth an estimated S$550,000.&lt;ref name="GES"/&gt; He was buried at ''Leng Kee Sua'' somewhere on the hill by the side where Leng Kee Road runs today. Due to redevelopment of the area, his body was disinterred and reburied in a family grave at [[Bukit Brown Cemetery]]. After the death of his father, Gan Tiang Tok continued the family business for three years, though by the turn of century it was no longer so lucrative. Gan Tiang Tok was dogged by ill health from 1903 until his death in 1927 at the age of 68.&lt;ref name="GES"/&gt;

==Commemoration==
[[File:Asian Civilisations Museum, Armenian Street 3, Jan 06.JPG|thumb|Gan's life and generosity to many charitable causes are currently being showcased in the [[Old Tao Nan School|Peranakan Museum]] today]]

In April 2008, Gan's life and generosity to many charitable causes are currently being showcased in a permanent gallery of the [[Peranakan Museum]] (former [[Old Tao Nan School|Tao Nan School building]]) at [[Armenian Street, Singapore|Armenian Street]]. The gallery titled ''Public Life: Making a difference'' (Level 3) honours ''[[Peranakan]]s'' (Straits Chinese), who were prominent public figures and philanthropists such as Gan, Singapore pioneer [[Tan Kim Seng]] and former Cabinet Minister [[Lim Kim San]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Peranakan Museum|title = Peranakan Museum Visitor Guide – Enter the world of the Peranakans|publisher = Singapore: [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]]|year = 2008|isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peranakan Museum presents a Southeast Asian-wide view of Peranakan culture and houses a comprehensive collection of Peranakan artefacts. The museum is the latest addition to the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]]'s family of museums and is managed by the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]] (ACM). The ACM staff consulted academics and collaborated with members of the Peranakan community to bring the museum to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peranakanmuseum.sg/themuseum/abtpernakanmuseum.asp |title=About Peranakan Museum |accessdate=27 April 2008 |publisher=Singapore: [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423080845/http://peranakanmuseum.sg/themuseum/abtpernakanmuseum.asp |archivedate=23 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''general account''' "generally" refers to the combined or aggregate investments and other assets of an [[insurance company]] available to pay claims and benefits to which [[insured]]s or policyholders are entitled.  The general account may also be considered everything that is not represented by a [[separate account]]s of the firm, if such separate account has been established by the company.  Should a firm have no separate accounts, then its only account is the general account.  The term should not be thought of narrowly in terms of a [[bank account]] or [[general ledger]] account, but rather the broader concept introduced in the first sentence.

Policyholders of insurance policies (that are not associated with separate accounts) do not have a legal or other direct interest or right to the assets or investments of the insurance company's general account but rather these obligations for benefits or claims are general obligations of the company.  In this case, policyholders are subject to credit risk of the insurance company-- that is, should the insurance company fail or go bankrupt, the claims or cash values of policies are not directly backed or collateralized by the company's investments and other assets.  In the U.S., state insurance departments examine (audit) insurance companies to evaluate many things, principally to see if the company is sound and policyholder interests are protected. [[A.M. Best]] is an example of an insurance [[rating agency]] who evaluates and rates many companies on various factors such as financial strength, claims-paying and other policyholder servicing experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3710">'''George Hillis Newlove''' (December 16, 1893 - October 2, 1984) was an American accounting scholar, and Professor at the [[University of Texas]], Department of Accounting and, College of Business Administration. his pioneering work in consolidation theory.&lt;ref&gt;Moonitz, Maurice.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Crystal, North Dakota]] to Reverend Samuel Newlove and school teacher Vangie Hillis Newlove, Newlove wanted to follow in his mother's footsteps. He obtained his BA from [[Hamline University]] in 1914, his MA in Mathematics at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1915, and his PhD at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1918. In 1918 he also obtained his Certified Public Accountant license for the State of North Carolina, and  later also for the State of Illinois.&lt;ref name="utexas 1=2015"&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2000-2001/memorials/SCANNED/newlove.pdf In Memoriam : George Hillis Newlove], at ''utexas.edu.'' Accessed 2015-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newlove had started his academic career during his graduate study as instructor in accountancy at the University of Illinois. After graduation he served in the US Navy in World War I. From 1919 to 1923 he was lecturer in accountancy at the University of Washington, and from 1923 to 1928 Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins University.

'''F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: [[Pharmaceutical company|Pharmaceutical]]s and [[Roche Diagnostics|Diagnostics]]. Its [[holding company]], '''Roche Holding AG''', has bearer shares listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].

The company controls the American biotechnology company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2016 were 50.58 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,&lt;ref name="FR16" /&gt; or approximately US$51 billion. Roche is the third-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.&lt;ref name="pharmexec50"&gt;[http://www.pharmexec.com/pharm-execs-top-50-companies-2018 Pharm Exec's 2018 ranking of the top 50 pharma companies worldwide], www.pharmexec.com. Retrieved 21 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm [[Novartis]] owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2016 as the 30th consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/de/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2014-03-04.htm|title=Roche - Roche Annual General Meeting 2014|work=roche.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314234724/http://www.roche.com/de/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2014-03-04.htm|archivedate=14 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; F.

==History==
Founded in 1896 by [[Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche]], the company was early on known for producing various [[vitamin]] preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.

In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.&lt;ref name="fundingroche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981—2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to [[Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings]]).&lt;ref name="sec950515"&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/ds2yr.a4.htm Laboratory Corp of America Holdings · 10-Q · For 3/31/95], SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/15/95, SEC File 1-11353, Accession Number 920148-95-11&lt;/ref&gt; Roche acquired [[Syntex]] in 1994 and [[Chugai Pharmaceuticals]] in 2002.

[[Oseltamivir]] is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the [[H5N1|bird flu]]. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]].  Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.&lt;ref name="royalty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14507&amp;hed=Roche%2C+Gilead+End+Tamiflu+Feud
|work=[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]|title=Roche, Gilead End Tamiflu Feud|date=16 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1120533,00.html|title=Why Roche Released Tamiflu|accessdate=2008-05-22|last=Kher|first=Unmesh|date=2005-10-19|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to [[Afucosylated monoclonal antibodies|afucosylate antibodies]]; one of its products in development was [[obinutuzumab]], which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].&lt;ref name="roche"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205033013/http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2015 |title=Roche - Roche acquires Swiss based GlycArt Biotechnology to strengthen expertise in therapeutic antibody research |publisher=roche.com |accessdate=2015-04-29 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002757/https://ec.europa.eu/research/health/pdf/event04/joel-jean-mairet-31032011_en.pdf Presentation: GlycArt Biotechnology AG From Inception to trade sale – and what happened after...] by Dr. Joël Jean-Mairet.

On 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire [[Genentech]], in which it had held a majority stake since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/05/business/genentech-roche-deal-may-spur-similar-ties.html |title=Genentech-Roche Deal May Spur Similar Ties |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 February 1990 |accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between [[Clifton, New Jersey]] and [[Nutley, New Jersey]] while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in [[South San Francisco, California|South San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/health/article5897691.ece |title=Roche swallows Genentech in third large drugs deal |last=Bawden |first=Tom |work=[[The Times]] |date=13 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-11 | location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612124041/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/health/article5897691.ece|archivedate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genentech became a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] group of Roche on 25 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSLQ73529820090326 |title=Roche completes Genentech buy |last=Jucca |first=Lisa |author2=Cage, Sam |work=[[Reuters]] |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Price-fixing conspiracy ==
{{see also|Cartel}}

[[Stanley Adams (whistleblower)|Stanley Adams]], Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking [[antitrust laws]], engaging in [[price fixing]] and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure&amp;nbsp;— an offence under Swiss law&amp;nbsp;— and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/nov/25/businessofresearch.research | title=Blowing the final whistle | last = Mathiason | first = Nick| work=[[The Observer]] | date=25 November 2001 | accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for [[vitamin supplement|vitamins]] sold in the US and globally.  Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/top100.html#Annotated Corporate Crime Reporter]. Corporate Crime Reporter.

==Biography==
Johan Petter Åhlén was the son of farmers Marits Anders Andersson and Brittas Karin Christoffersdotter. He was born Johan Petter Andersson, but changed his surname to Åhlén after his birthplace (which was called Åhl by the time of his name change) to avoid being confused with numerous namesakes. In 1903 he married Elin Maria Charlotta Brolin and with her he had the sons Gösta Mauritz Åhlén and Anders Ragnar Åhlén, who both became managing directors of his companies. Åhlén died in 1939 while crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on a boat trip from New York.

==Businessperson==
In 1899, Johan Petter Åhlén founded&lt;ref name=ahlens&gt;[http://www.ahlens.se/om-oss/historia/ Åhléns corporate history] Åhléns&lt;/ref&gt; the mail-order company Åhlén &amp; Holm in his hometown, partnered with his uncle Erik Holm. It soon changed name to Insjön and became the leader in its field in Scandinavia. In 1902, Johan Petter Åhlén became the sole owner of the company. In 1906 he launched another company, the book publishing house Åhlén &amp; Åkerlunds, together with Erik Åkerlund. In 1932, after a study tour to the US, he founded the first department store, at Östermalmstorg in Stockholm. 

==Curling player==
Johan Petter Åhlén was a Swedish [[curling]] pioneer, silver medalist at the [[1924 Winter Olympics]], three-time Swedish champion, and vice president of the Swedish Curling Association in 1935–38.&lt;ref name=sref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johan Petter Åhlén |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ah/johan-petter-ahlen-1.html |publisher=Sports Reference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114074719/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ah/johan-petter-ahlen-1.html |archivedate=14 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sok&gt;[http://sok.se/idrottare/idrottare/j/johan-petter-ahlen.html Johan Petter Åhlén] Swedish Olympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kunihiko Iwadare'''|岩垂 邦彦|Iwadare Kunihiko|extra=August 15, 1857 - December 20, 1941}} was a Japanese businessman. A graduate of the [[Imperial College of Engineering]] (Kobu Daigaku) in [[Tokyo]], he worked as a [[telegraph]] engineer for the Japanese government.  He left [[Japan]] in 1886 and traveled to New York.  He was introduced to Charles Batchelor, an assistant of [[Thomas Edison]]. Iwadare was hired to work in an Edison facility in [[Manhattan]] at Goerck Street. Iwadare was transferred to [[Edison Machine Works]] in Schenetady, [[New York (state)|New York]] in January 1887.  

Iwadare returned to Japan, hoping to participate in building the electrical industry in Japan. He first joined Osaka Dento (Osaka Electric Lamp Company) as an electrical engineer, and after eight years resigned from his post to start his own business as a general sales agent in Japan for [[General Electric]] and [[Western Electric]] companies.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1895 [[Western Electric]] wished to expand their telephone equipment sales business in Japan and proposed a limited partnership with Iwadare.&lt;ref&gt;NEC 1984, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Their representative was [[Walter Tenney Carleton]].  Iwadare accepted the proposal and a new firm was created in August, 1898.  In 1899, changes to treaties between Japan and Western countries went into effect.  The limited partnership created in 1898 was restructured into the [[joint stock company]], Nippon Electric Co. Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;NEC 1984, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western Electric held 54% of the stock.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 1987, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Iwadare was named Managing Director of what is now known as  [[NEC Corporation]].  He became Chairman of the Board in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;NEC 1984, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[digital camera]] [[brand]]s'''. Former and current brands are included in this list. With some of the brands, the name is licensed from another company, or acquired after the bankruptcy of an older photographic equipment company.  The actual manufacture of a camera model is performed by a different company in many cases.  In many cases brands are limited to certain countries.  Not all brands of devices that can take digital images are listed here, including many industrial digital camera brands, some [[webcam]] brands, brands of cell phones that feature cameras, and brands of video cameras that can take digital stills.  Defunct brands are listed separately.

==Active consumer camera brands==
{{Expand list|date=August 2013}}

{{as of|2015|02}}, these brands offer some combination of [[compact digital camera]]s, [[bridge camera]], [[digital single-lens reflex camera]]s (DSLRs), and [[mirrorless interchangeable lens camera]]s (MILCs):

'''Miguel Skrobot''' ([[Warsaw]], 1873 - [[Curitiba]], February 20, 1912) was a [[businessman]] Brazilian of Polish origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toczek.com.br/acervo/skrobot.htm Família SKROBOT - Colônia Muricy - Brasil] Toczek {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memoria.bn.br/docreader/DocReader.aspx?bib=240818&amp;pagfis=2104&amp;pesq= newspaper O Olho da Rua - 1911 edition] National Library of Brazil {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memoria.bn.br/docreader/DocReader.aspx?bib=214752&amp;pagfis=1464&amp;pesq= Magazine Almanach do Paraná - 1910s] National Library of Brazil {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miguel Skrobot was born in 1873, in Warsaw, [[Poland]], to José Skrobot and Rosa Skrobot. When he was 18 he migrated to [[Brazil]] and settled in Curitiba as a merchant.

He married Maria Pansardi, who was born in [[Tibagi]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], to Italian immigrants, and she bore him three children. He kept a steam-powered factory where he worked on grinding and toasting coffee beans under the "Rio Branco" brand, located on the spot where today stands the square called ''Praça Zacarias'' (square located in the center of Curitiba). He also owned a grocery store near ''Praça Tiradentes'' (also a square in the center of Curitiba, where the city was born). He died an early death, when he was 39, on February 20, 1912.

'''Organizational culture''' encompasses [[Value (ethics) | values]] and behaviors that "contribute to the unique social and psychological environment of a business. The organisational culture influences the way people interact, the context within which knowledge is created, the resistance they will have towards certain changes, and ultimately the way they share (or the way they do not share)  knowledge.  Organizational culture represents the collective values, beliefs and principles of organizational members and is a product of factors such as history, product, market, technology, strategy, type of employees, [[management style]], and national culture; culture includes the organization's [[goal | vision]], values, norms, systems, symbols, language, assumptions, environment, location,  beliefs and habits. 

[[Business executive]] Bernard L. Rosauer (2013) defines organizational culture as an ''[[emergence]]'' – an extremely complex incalculable state that results from the combination of a few ingredients. In "Three Bell Curves: Business Culture Decoded"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ThreeBellCurves.com "Three Bell Curves: Business Culture Decoded"]&lt;/ref&gt; Rosauer outlines the three manageable ingredients which (he claims) guide business culture:

# employee (focus on engagement)
# the work (focus on eliminating waste increasing value) waste
# the customer (focus on likelihood of referral)

Rosauer writes that the Three Bell Curves methodology aims to bring [[leadership]], their employees, the work and the customer together for focus without distraction, leading to an improvement in culture and brand.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He states: "If a methodology isn't memorable, it won't get used. The Three Bell Curves Methodology is simple (to remember) but execution requires strong leadership and diligence. Culture can be guided by managing the ingredients."  Reliance of the research and findings of Sirota Survey Intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirota.com/enthusiastic-employee Sirota Survey Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been gathering employee data worldwide since 1972, the Lean Enterprise Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lean.org Lean Enterprise Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge, MA, and Fred Reichheld/Bain/Satmetrix research relating to NetPromoterScore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.netpromoter.com/know/ NetPromoterScore]&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh?|date=October 2018}}    
 
Ravasi and Schultz (2006) characterise organizational culture as a set of shared assumptions that guide behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ravasi | first1 = D. | last2 = Schultz | first2 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Responding to organizational identity threats: Exploring the role of organizational culture | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 433–458 | doi= 10.5465/amj.2006.21794663}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the pattern of such collective behaviors and assumptions that are taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving and, even thinking and feeling. Thus organizational culture affects the way people and groups interact with each other, with clients, and with [[Stakeholder (corporate) | stakeholder]]s. In addition, organizational culture may affect how much employees [[organizational identification | identify with an organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schrodt | first1 = P | year = 2002 | title = The relationship between organizational identification and organizational culture: Employee perceptions of culture and identification in a retail sales organization | url = | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 189–202 | doi= 10.1080/10510970209388584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Schein|Schein]] (1992), Deal and Kennedy (2000), and [[John Kotter|Kotter]] (1992) advanced the idea that organizations often have very differing cultures as well as subcultures.&lt;ref name=schein2009&gt;{{cite book|last= Schein|first= Edgar|authorlink= Edgar Schein|title= Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View|year= 1992|publisher= Jossey-Bass|location= San Francisco, CA|pages= 9}}

Flamholtz and Randle (2011) suggest that one can view organizational culture as "corporate personality"&lt;ref&gt;

The study is concerned with the description, analysis, and development of the [[Organizational behavior|corporate group behaviours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868980134|title=Organisational culture : concept, context, and measurement|last=Elizabeth.|first=Kummerow,|publisher=|others=Kirby, Neil., Ying, Lee Xin.|year=|isbn=9789812837837|location=New Jersey|pages=13|oclc=868980134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Elliott Jaques "the culture of the factory is its customary and traditional way of thinking and doing of things, which is shared to a greater or lesser degree by all its members, and which new members must learn, and at least partially accept, in order to be accepted into service in the firm..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In simple terms, to the extent that people can share common wishes, desires and aspirations, they can commit themselves to work together. It is a matter of being able to care about the same things, and it applies to nations as well as to associations and organizations within nations.

Elaborating on the work in ''The Changing Culture of a Factory'' Dr. Elliott Jaques in his concept of [[requisite organization]] established the list of valued entitlements or organizational values that can gain from people their full commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36162684|title=Requisite organization : a total system for effective managerial organization and managerial leadership for the 21st century|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques,|date=1998|publisher=Cason Hall|isbn=1886436037|edition=  Rev. 2nd |location=Arlington, VA|oclc=36162684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they make an organizational culture or credo: 
* Fair and just treatment for everyone, including fair pay based upon equitable pay differentials for level of work and merit recognition related to personal effectiveness appraisal.
* Leadership interaction between managers and subordinates, including shared context, personal effectiveness appraisal, feedback and recognition, and coaching.
* Clear articulation of accountability and authority to engender trust and confidence in all working relationships.
* Articulation of long-term organizational vision through direct communication from the top.
* Opportunity for everyone individually or through representatives to participate in policy development.
* Work for everyone at a level consistent with their level of potential capability, values and interests.
* Opportunity for everyone to progress as his or her potential capability matures, within the opportunities available            
The role of managerial leadership at every organizational level is to make these organizational values operationally real.

== Usage ==
''Organizational culture'' refers to [[culture]] in any type of [[organization]] including that of schools, universities, not-for-profit groups, government agencies, or business entities. In business, terms such as '''corporate culture''' and '''company culture''' are often used to refer to a similar concept. The term corporate culture became widely known in the business world in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Arizona"&gt;"Culture is everything," said Lou Gerstner, the CEO who pulled IBM from near ruin in the 1990s.", [http://knowledge.wpcarey.asu.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1989 Culture Clash: When Corporate Culture Fights Strategy, It Can Cost You] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110012303/http://knowledge.wpcarey.asu.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1989 |date=2011-11-10 }}, knowmgmt, [[Arizona State University]], March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="term"&gt;Unlike many expressions that emerge in business jargon, the term spread to newspapers and magazines. Few usage experts object to the term. Over 80 percent of usage experts accept the sentence ''The new management style is a reversal of GE's traditional corporate culture, in which virtually everything the company does is measured in some form and filed away somewhere.''", The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Corporate culture'' was already used by managers, sociologists, and organizational theorists by the beginning of the 80s.&lt;ref name="Linda"&gt;One of the first to point to the importance of culture for organizational analysis and the intersection of [[culture theory]] and [[organization theory]] is [[Linda Smircich]] in her article Concepts of Culture and Organizational Analysis in 1983. See Linda Smircich, ''Concepts of Culture and Organizational Analysis'', Administrative Science Quarterly, Volume: 28, Issue: 3, Publisher: JSTOR, {{doi|10.2307/2392246}}, 1983, pp. 339–358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hispanicengineer"&gt;"The term "Corporate Culture" is fast losing the academic ring it once had among U.S. manager.

But corporate managers, untrained in sociology jargon, found it difficult to use the term unselfconsciously." in Phillip Farish, Career Talk: Corporate Culture, Hispanic Engineer, issue 1, year 1, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The related idea of [[organizational climate]] emerged in the 1960s and 70s, and the terms are now somewhat overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin, A. W., &amp; Croft, D. B. (1963). ''The organizational climate of schools''. Chicago: Midwest Administration Center of the University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred C. Lunenburg, Allan C. Ornstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jLvG_ASyG5AC&amp;pg=PA67 Educational Administration: Concepts and Practices]'', Cengage Learning, 2011, pp. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

If organizational culture is seen as something that characterizes an organization, it can be manipulated and altered depending on leadership and members.&lt;ref name="Modaff, D.P. 2011"&gt;Modaff, D.P., DeWine, S., &amp; Butler, J. (2011). Organizational communication: Foundations, challenges, and misunderstandings (2nd Ed.). Boston: Pearson Education. (Chapters 1–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Culture as root metaphor sees the organization as its culture, created through communication and symbols, or competing metaphors. Culture is basic, with personal experience producing a variety of perspectives.&lt;ref name="Modaff, D.P. 2011"/&gt;

The organizational communication perspective on culture views culture in three different ways:
* Traditionalism: views culture through objective things such as stories, rituals, and symbols
* Interpretivism: views culture through a network of shared meanings (organization members sharing subjective meanings)
* Critical-interpretivism: views culture through a network of shared meanings as well as the power struggles created by a similar network of competing meanings

== Strong and weak ==
Flamholtz and Randle state that: "A strong culture is that people clearly understand and can articulate. A weak culture is one that employees have difficulty defining, understanding, or explaining."&lt;ref&gt;Flamholtz and Randle, 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
''Strong culture'' is said to exist where staff respond to stimulus because of their alignment to organizational values. In such environments, strong cultures help firms operate like well-oiled machines, engaging in outstanding execution with only minor adjustments to existing procedures as needed.

Conversely, there is ''weak culture'' where there is little alignment with organizational values, and control must be exercised through extensive procedures and bureaucracy.

Research shows{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} that organizations that foster strong cultures have clear values that give employees a reason to embrace the culture. A "strong" culture may be especially beneficial to firms operating in the service sector since members of these organizations are responsible for delivering the service and for evaluations important constituents make about firms.  Organizations may derive the following benefits from developing strong and productive cultures:

* Better aligning the company towards achieving its vision, mission, and goals
* High employee [[motivation]] and [[loyalty]]
* Increased team cohesiveness among the company's various departments and divisions
* Promoting consistency and encouraging coordination and control within the company
* Shaping employee behavior at work, enabling the organization to be more efficient

[[Irving Janis]] defined groupthink as "a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."&lt;ref&gt;Janis, Irving L. ''Victims of Groupthink''. Boston. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; This is a state in which even if group members have different ideas, they do not challenge organizational thinking. As a result, innovative thinking is stifled. Groupthink can lead to lack of creativity and decisions made without critical evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Argote |first1=Linda |title=Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |page=115-146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groupthink can occur, for example, when group members rely heavily on a central charismatic figure in the organization or where there is an "evangelical" belief in the organization's values. Groupthink can also occur in groups characterized by a friendly climate conducive to conflict avoidance.

== Healthy ==
{{quotebox|width=25em| bgcolor=#E1FFBD|align=right|''Culture is the organization's immune system. – Michael Watkins''&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/what-is-organizational-culture|title=What Is Organizational Culture? And Why Should We Care?|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|quote=Culture is the organization's immune system. – Michael Watkins|source=What Is Organizational Culture? And Why Should We Care? – Harvard Business Review}}

Organizations should strive for what is considered a "healthy" organizational culture in order to increase productivity, growth, efficiency and reduce counterproductive behavior and turnover of employees. A variety of characteristics describe a healthy culture, including:

* Acceptance and appreciation for diversity
* Regard for fair treatment of each employee as well as respect for each employee's contribution to the company
* Employee pride and enthusiasm for the organization and the work performed
* Equal opportunity for each employee to realize their full potential within the company
* Strong communication with all employees regarding policies and company issues
* Strong company leaders with a strong sense of direction and purpose
* Ability to compete in industry innovation and customer service, as well as price
* Lower than average turnover rates (perpetuated by a healthy culture)
* Investment in learning, training, and employee knowledge

Additionally, performance oriented cultures have been shown to possess statistically better financial growth.  Such cultures possess high employee involvement, strong internal communications and an acceptance and encouragement of a healthy level of risk-taking in order to achieve innovation. Additionally, organizational cultures that explicitly emphasize factors related to the demands placed on them by industry technology and growth will be better performers in their industries.

According to Kotter and Heskett (1992),&lt;ref name=kotter1992/&gt; organizations with adaptive cultures perform much better than organizations with unadaptive cultures. An adaptive culture translates into organizational success; it is characterized by managers paying close attention to all of their constituencies, especially customers, initiating change when needed, and taking risks. An unadaptive culture can significantly reduce a firm's effectiveness, disabling the firm from pursuing all its competitive/operational options.

Healthy companies are able to deal with employees' concerns about the well-being of the organization internally, before the employees would even feel they needed to raise the issues externally. It is for this reason that [[whistleblowing]], particularly when it results in serious damage to a company's reputation, is considered to be often a sign of a chronically dysfunctional corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Skapinker|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c5059fd2-6881-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title= Lessons from the Deutsche Bank whistleblower Eric Ben-Artzi: A corporate culture must allow employees to dissent, before they take it outside the company|publisher=Financial Times|date=2016-08-24|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another relevant concept is the notion of "cultural functionality".  Specifically, some organizations have "functional" cultures while others have   "dysfunctional" cultures.&lt;ref&gt;lamholtz and Randle, 2011, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; A "functional" culture is a positive culture that contributes to  an organization's performance and success. A "dysfunctional" culture is one that hampers or negatively affects  an organization's performance and success.

== Management of culture ==

There are many different types of communication that contribute in creating an organizational culture:&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Gazi and Zyphur, Michael. (2009). Rituals in organizations: A review and expansion of current theory. Group Organization Management. (34),  1140139.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Metaphors such as comparing an organization to a machine or a family reveal employees' shared meanings of experiences at the organization.
* Stories can provide examples for employees of how to or not to act in certain situations.
* Rites and ceremonies combine stories, metaphors, and symbols into one. Several different kinds of rites affect organizational culture:
** Rites of passage: employees move into new roles
** Rites of degradation: employees have power taken away from them
** Rites of enhancement: public recognition for an employee's accomplishments
** Rites of renewal: improve existing social structures
** Rites of conflict reduction: resolve arguments between certain members or groups
** Rites of integration: reawaken feelings of membership in the organization
* Reflexive comments are explanations, justifications, and criticisms of our own actions. This includes:
** Plans: comments about anticipated actions
** Commentaries: comments about action in the present
** Accounts: comments about an action or event that has already occurred
: Such comments reveal interpretive meanings held by the speaker as well as the social rules they follow.
* Fantasy Themes are common creative interpretations of events that reflect beliefs, values, and goals of the organization. They lead to rhetorical visions, or views of the organization and its environment held by organization members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kreatywna.pl/| title=culture }} wednesday, 16 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bullying culture ==
{{Main|Bullying culture|Workplace bullying}}
Bullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that
they have the support, or at least implicitly the blessing, of senior managers to carry on their abusive
and bullying behaviour. Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as
acceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. That people may be bullied irrespective of their organisational status or rank, including senior managers, indicates the possibility of a negative ripple effect, where bullying may be cascaded downwards as the targeted supervisors might offload their own [[aggression]] on their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the [[boardroom]] may actually threaten the [[productivity]] of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of fear==
{{Main|Culture of fear}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]], i.e. leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies "get away with it", a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name="Organisational"/&gt; Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"/&gt;

In a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[Turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had "got away with it" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

== Tribal culture ==
David Logan and coauthors have proposed in their book [[Tribal Leadership]] that organizational cultures change in stages, based on an analysis of human groups and tribal cultures. They identify five basic stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization |first1=Dave |last1=Logan |first2=John |last2=King |first3=Halee |last3=Fischer-Wright |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2009 |isbn=0061251305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Life sucks'' (a subsystem severed from other functional systems like tribes, gangs and prison—2 percent of population);
#''My life sucks'' (I am stuck in the Dumb Motor Vehicle line and can't believe I have to spend my time in this lost triangle of ineffectiveness—25 percent of population);
#''I'm great'' (and you're not, I am detached from you and will dominate you regardless of your intent—48 percent of population);
#''We are great, but other groups suck'' (citing Zappo's and an attitude of unification around more than individual competence—22 percent of population) and
#''Life is great'' (citing Desmond Tutu's hearing on truth and values as the basis of reconciliation—3 percent of population).
This model of organizational culture provides a map and context for leading an organization through the five stages.

==Personal culture==
: ''Main: [[Personality psychology]], [[Identity (social science)]]''
Organizational culture is taught to the person as culture is taught by his/her parents thus changing and modeling his/her personal culture.&lt;ref name="cindy"&gt;Cindy Gordon, [http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2008/january-february/regulars/camagazine5413.aspx Cashing in on corporate culture], CA magazine, January–February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, employees and people applying for a job are advised to match their "personality to a company's culture" and fit to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careerrocketeer.com/2009/07/personality-and-corporate-culture.html Personality and Corporate Culture: Where's a Person to Fit?], Career Rocketeer, July 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers even suggested and have made case studies research on personality changing.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Lejeune, Alain Vas, [http://www.alba.edu.gr/sites/pros/Papers/PROS-073.pdf Comparing the processes of identity change: A multiple-case study approach],&lt;/ref&gt;

==National culture==
Corporate culture is used to control, coordinate, and integrate company subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="nationalculture"&gt;Susan C. Schneider, ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.3930270207/abstract National vs. corporate culture: Implications for human resource management]'', Human Resource Management, Volume 27, Issue 2, Summer 1988, pp. 231–246, {{doi|10.1002/hrm.3930270207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However differences in national cultures exist contributing to differences in the views on management.&lt;ref&gt;Li Dong, Keith Glaister, [https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/asiapa/v24y2007i2p191-205.html National and corporate culture differences in international strategic alliances: Perceptions of Chinese partners (RePEc)], Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 24 (June 2007), pp. 191–205&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between national cultures are deep rooted values of the respective cultures, and these cultural values can shape how people expect companies to be run, and how relationships between leaders and followers should be, resulting in differences between the employer and the employee regarding expectations. (Geert Hofstede, 1991) Perhaps equally foundational; observing the vast differences in national copyright (and taxation, etc.) laws suggests deep rooted differences in cultural attitudes and assumptions about property rights and sometimes about the desired root function, place, or purpose of corporations relative to the population.

===Multiplicity===
: ''See also: [[Biculturalism]]''

Xibao Zhang (2009) carried out an empirical study of culture emergence in the Sino-Western international cross-cultural management (SW-ICCM) context in China. Field data were collected by interviewing Western expatriates and Chinese professionals working in this context, supplemented by non-participant observation and documentary data. The data were then analyzed objectively to formulate theme-based substantive theories and a formal theory.

The major finding of this study is that the human cognition contains three components, or three broad types of "cultural rules of behavior", namely, Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules, each of which has a mutually conditioning relationship with behavior. The three cognitive components are different in terms of the scope and duration of their mutual shaping of behavior. Values are universal and enduring rules of behavior; Expectations, on the other hand, are context-specific behavioral rules; while Ad Hoc Rules are improvised rules of behavior that the human mind devises contingent upon a particular occasion. Furthermore, they need not be consistent, and frequently are not, among themselves. Metaphorically, they can be compared to a multi-carriage train, which allows for the relative lateral movements by individual carriages so as to accommodate bumps and turns in the tracks. In fact, they provide a "shock-absorber mechanism", so to speak, which enables individuals in SW-ICCM contexts to cope with conflicts in cultural practices and values, and to accommodate and adapt themselves to cultural contexts where people from different national cultural backgrounds work together over extended time. It also provides a powerful framework which explains how interactions by individuals in SW-ICCM contexts give rise to emerging hybrid cultural practices characterized by both stability and change.

One major theoretical contribution of this "multi-carriage train" perspective is its allowance for the existence of inconsistencies among the three cognitive components in their mutual conditioning of behavior. This internal inconsistency view is in stark contrast to the traditional internal consistency assumption explicitly or tacitly held by many culture scholars. The other major theoretical contribution, which follows logically from the first one, is to view culture as an overarching entity which is made of a multiplicity of Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules. This notion of one (multiplicity) culture to an organization leads to the classification of culture along its path of emergence into nascent, adolescent, and mature types, each of which is distinct in terms of the pattern of the three cognitive components and behavior.

==Effects==
Research suggests that numerous outcomes have been associated either directly or indirectly with organizational culture.   A healthy and robust organizational culture may provide various benefits, including the following:

* Competitive edge derived from innovation and customer service
* Consistent, efficient employee performance
* Team cohesiveness
* High employee morale
* Strong company alignment towards goal achievement

Although little empirical research exists to support the link between organizational culture and organizational performance, there is little doubt among experts that this relationship exists.  Organizational culture can be a factor in the survival or failure of an organization – although this is difficult to prove given that the necessary longitudinal analyses are hardly feasible.  The sustained superior performance of firms like [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and [[McDonald's]] may be, at least partly, a reflection of their organizational cultures.

A 2003 [[Harvard Business School]] study reported that culture has a significant effect on an organization's long-term economic performance. The study examined the management practices at 160 organizations over ten years and found that culture can enhance performance or prove detrimental to performance.  Organizations with strong performance-oriented cultures witnessed far better financial growth.  Additionally, a 2002 Corporate Leadership Council study found that cultural traits such as risk taking, internal communications, and flexibility are some of the most important drivers of performance, and may affect individual performance.  Furthermore, innovativeness, productivity through people, and the other cultural factors cited by [[Tom Peters|Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman, Jr.|Waterman]] (1982) also have positive economic consequences.

Denison, Haaland, and Goelzer (2004) found that culture contributes to the success of the organization, but not all dimensions contribute the same.  It was found that the effects of these dimensions differ by global regions, which suggests that organizational culture is affected by national culture.  Additionally, Clarke (2006) found that a safety climate is related to an organization's safety record.

Organizational culture is reflected in the way people perform tasks, set objectives, and administer the necessary resources to achieve objectives.  Culture affects the way individuals make decisions, feel, and act in response to the opportunities and threats affecting the organization.

Adkins and Caldwell (2004) found that job satisfaction was positively associated with the degree to which employees fit into both the overall culture and subculture in which they worked.   A perceived mismatch of the organization's culture and what employees felt the culture should be is related to a number of negative consequences including lower job satisfaction, higher job strain, general stress, and turnover intent.

It has been proposed that organizational culture may affect the level of employee creativity, the strength of employee motivation, and the reporting of unethical behavior, but more research is needed to support these conclusions.

Organizational culture also affects recruitment and retention.  Individuals tend to be attracted to and remain engaged in organizations that they perceive to be compatible.  Additionally, high turnover may be a mediating factor in the relationship between culture and organizational performance.  Deteriorating company performance and an unhealthy work environment are signs of an overdue cultural assessment.

==Change==
When an organization does not possess a healthy culture or requires some kind of organizational culture change, the change process can be daunting. Organizational culture can hinder new change efforts, especially where employees know their expectations and the roles that they are supposed to play in the organization. This is corroborated by Mar (2016:1) who argues that 70% of all change efforts fail because of the culture of an organization's employees. One major reason why such change is difficult is that organizational cultures, and the organizational structures in which they are embedded, often reflect the "imprint" of earlier periods in a persistent way and exhibit remarkable levels of inertia.&lt;ref name=Marquis&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture change may be necessary to reduce employee turnover, influence employee behavior, make improvements to the company, refocus the company objectives and/or rescale the organization, provide better customer service, and/or achieve specific company goals and results. Culture change is affected by a number of elements, including the external environment and industry competitors, change in industry standards, technology changes, the size and nature of the workforce, and the organization's history and management.

There are a number of methodologies specifically dedicated to organizational culture change such as [[Peter Senge]]'s ''Fifth Discipline''. There are also a variety of psychological approaches that have been developed into a system for specific outcomes such as the ''Fifth Discipline's'' "learning organization" or ''Directive Communication's'' "corporate culture evolution." Ideas and strategies, on the other hand, seem to vary according to particular influences that affect culture.

Burman and Evans (2008) argue that it is '[[leadership]]' that affects culture rather than '[[management]]', and describe the difference. When one wants to change an aspect of the culture of an organization one has to keep in consideration that this is a long term project. Corporate culture is something that is very hard to change and employees need time to get used to the new way of organizing. For companies with a very strong and specific culture it will be even harder to change.

Prior to a cultural change initiative, a needs assessment is needed to identify and understand the current organizational culture.  This can be done through employee surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation, customer surveys where appropriate, and other internal research, to further identify areas that require change.  The company must then assess and clearly identify the new, desired culture, and then design a change process.

Cummings &amp; Worley (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491 – 492) give the following six guidelines for cultural change, these changes are in line with the [[Kotter's 8-Stage Change Model|eight distinct stages]] mentioned by Kotter (1995, p.&amp;nbsp;2):
# Formulate a clear strategic vision (stage 1, 2, and 3). In order to make a cultural change effective a clear vision of the firm's new strategy, shared values and behaviors is needed. This vision provides the intention and direction for the culture change (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;490).
# Display top-management commitment (stage 4). It is very important to keep in mind that culture change must be managed from the top of the organization, as willingness to change of the senior management is an important indicator (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, page 490). The top of the organization should be very much in favor of the change in order to actually implement the change in the rest of the organization. De Caluwé &amp; Vermaak (2004, p 9) provide a framework with five different ways of thinking about change.
# Model culture change at the highest level (stage 5). In order to show that the management team is in favor of the change, the change has to be notable at first at this level. The behavior of the management needs to symbolize the kinds of values and behaviors that should be realized in the rest of the company. It is important that the management shows the strengths of the current culture as well; it must be made clear that the current organizational culture does not need radical changes, but just a few adjustments. (See for more: Deal &amp; Kennedy, 1982;&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt; Sathe, 1983; Schall; 1983; Weick, 1985; DiTomaso, 1987). This process may also include creating committees, employee task forces, value managers, or similar. Change agents are key in the process and key communicators of the new values.  They should possess courage, flexibility, excellent interpersonal skills, knowledge of the company, and patience. As McCune (May 1999) puts it, these individuals should be catalysts, not dictators.
# The fourth step is to modify the organization to support organizational change.  This includes identifying what current systems, policies, procedures and rules need to be changed in order to align with the new values and desired culture.  This may include a change to accountability systems, compensation, benefits and reward structures, and recruitment and retention programs to better align with the new values and to send a clear message to employees that the old system and culture are in the past.
# Select and socialize newcomers and terminate deviants (stage 7 &amp; 8  of Kotter, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;2). A way to implement a culture is to connect it to organizational membership, people can be selected and terminated in terms of their fit with the new culture (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491). Encouraging employee motivation and loyalty to the company is key and will also result in a healthy culture. The company and change managers should be able to articulate the connections between the desired behavior and how it will affect and improve the company's success, to further encourage buy-in in the change process. Training should be provided to all employees to understand the new processes, expectations and systems.
# Develop ethical and legal sensitivity. Changes in culture can lead to tensions between organizational and individual interests, which can result in ethical and legal problems for practitioners. This is particularly relevant for changes in employee integrity, control, equitable treatment and job security (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491). It is also beneficial, as part of the change process, to include an evaluation process, conducted periodically to monitor the change progress and identify areas that need further development. This step will also identify obstacles of change and resistant employees, and acknowledge and reward employee improvement, which will encourage continued change and evolvement. It may also be helpful and necessary to incorporate new change managers to refresh the process. Outside consultants may also be useful in facilitating the change process and providing employee training. Change of culture in organizations is very important and inevitable. Cultural innovation&lt;ref&gt;Molly Rose Teuke, [http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/features/p17andrew-143871.html Creating culture of innovation], Oracle Magazine, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is bound to be more difficult than cultural maintenance because it entails introducing something new and substantially different from what prevails in existing cultures. People often resist changes, hence it is the duty of management to convince people that likely gain will outweigh the losses. Besides institutionalization, deification is another process that tends to occur in strongly developed organizational cultures. The organization itself may come to be regarded as precious in itself, as a source of pride, and in some sense unique. The organization's members begin to feel a strong bond with it that transcends material returns, and they begin to identify with it. The organization turns into a sort of clan.

===Mergers and cultural leadership===
One of the biggest obstacles in the way of the merging of two organizations is organizational culture. Each organization has its own unique culture and most often, when brought together, these cultures clash. When mergers fail employees point to issues such as identity, communication problems, human resources problems, ego clashes, and inter-group conflicts, which all fall under the category of "cultural differences".

One way to combat such difficulties is through cultural leadership. Organizational leaders must also be cultural leaders and help facilitate the change from the two old cultures into the one new culture. This is done through cultural innovation followed by cultural maintenance.
* Cultural innovation includes:
** Creating a new culture: recognizing past cultural differences and setting realistic expectations for change
** Changing the culture: weakening and replacing the old cultures
* Cultural maintenance includes:
** Integrating the new culture: reconciling the differences between the old cultures and the new one
** Embodying the new culture: Establishing, affirming, and keeping the new culture

==Corporate subcultures==
Corporate culture is the total sum of the values, customs, traditions, and meanings that make a company unique. Corporate culture is often called "the character of an organization", since it embodies the vision of the company's founders.  The values of a corporate culture influence the ethical standards within a corporation, as well as managerial behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Montana, P., and Charnov, B. (2008) Management (4th ed.), Barrons Educational Series, Hauppauge:NY&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Senior management]] may try to determine a ''corporate culture''. They may wish to impose corporate values and standards of behavior that specifically reflect the objectives of the organization. In addition, there will also be an extant internal culture within the workforce. Work-groups within the organization have their own behavioral quirks and interactions which, to an extent, affect the whole system. Roger Harrison's four-culture typology, and adapted by Charles Handy, suggests that unlike organizational culture, corporate culture can be 'imported'. For example, computer technicians will have expertise, language and behaviors gained independently of the organization, but their presence can influence the culture of the organization as a whole.

==Legal aspects==
Corporate culture can legally be found to be a cause of injuries and a reason for fining companies in the US, e.g., when the [[US Department of Labor]] [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] levied a fine of more than 10.8 million US dollars on Performance Coal Co. following the [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]] in April 2010. This was the largest fine in the history of this U.S. government agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/msha/MSHA20111734.htm  US Labor Department's MSHA cites corporate culture as root cause of Upper Big Branch Mine disaster], MSHA News Release, [[US Department of Labor]], May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views==
Criticism of the usage of the term by managers began already in its emergence in the early 80s.&lt;ref name="hispanicengineer"/&gt; Most of the criticism comes from the writers in [[critical management studies]] who for example express skepticism about the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] and [[unitarist]] views about culture that are put forward by [[mainstream]] management writers. They stress the ways in which these cultural assumptions can stifle dissent management and reproduce propaganda and ideology. They suggest that organizations do not have a single culture and [[cultural engineering]] may not reflect the interests of all stakeholders within an organization.

Parker (2000) has suggested that many of the assumptions of those putting forward theories of organizational culture are not new. They reflect a long-standing tension between cultural and structural (or informal and formal) versions of what organizations are. Further, it is reasonable to suggest that complex organizations might have many cultures, and that such sub-cultures might overlap and contradict each other. The neat typologies of cultural forms found in textbooks rarely acknowledge such complexities, or the various economic contradictions that exist in capitalist organizations.

Among the strongest and most widely recognized writers on corporate culture, with a long list of articles on [[leadership]], [[culture]], [[gender]] and their intersection, is [[Linda Smircich]]. As a part of the [[critical management studies]], she criticizes theories that attempt to categorize or 'pigeonhole' organizational culture.&lt;ref name="Linda" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Brewis, "Othering Organization Theory: Marta Calás and Linda Smircich" ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2005.00542.x/abstract abstract]), The Sociological Review, ''Special Issue: Sociological Review Monograph Series: Contemporary Organization Theory'', editors Campbell Jones and Rolland Munro, Volume 53, Issue Supplement s1, pp. 80–94, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She uses the metaphor of a plant root to represent culture, saying that it drives organizations rather than vice versa. Organizations are the product of organizational culture; we are unaware of how it shapes behavior and interaction (also implicit in Schein's (2002) underlying assumptions{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}), and so how can we categorize it and define what it is?

== Research and models==

Several methods have been used to classify organizational culture.  While there is no single "type" of organizational culture and organizational cultures vary widely from one organization to the next, commonalities do exist and some researchers have developed models to describe different indicators of organizational cultures.  Some are described below:

=== Hofstede ===

{{main|Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory}}

[[Hofstede]] (1980) looked for differences between over 160 000 [[IBM]] employees in 50 different countries and three regions of the world, in an attempt to find aspects of culture that might influence business behavior. He suggested things about cultural differences existing in regions and nations, and the importance of international awareness and multiculturalism for their own cultural introspection. Cultural differences reflect differences in thinking and social action, and even in "mental programs", a term Hofstede uses for predictable behavior. Hofstede relates culture to ethnic and regional groups, but also organizations, professional, family, social and subcultural groups, national political systems and legislation, etc.

Hofstede suggests the need for changing "mental programs" with changing behavior first, which will lead to value change. Though certain groups like Jews and Gypsies have maintained their identity through centuries, their values show adaptation to the dominant cultural environment.

&lt;!-- This text is generally correct but may be wrong in this context. One could add Hofstede's definition of organizational culture. --&gt;Hofstede demonstrated that there are national and regional cultural groupings that affect the behavior of organizations and identified four [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|dimensions of culture]] (later five&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"&gt;Hofstede, Geert H. 2001. Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviors, Institutions, and Organizations Across Nations. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;) in his study of national cultures:

* ''Power distance'' (Mauk Mulder, 1977) – Different societies find different solutions regarding social inequality. Although invisible, inside organizations power inequality of the "boss-subordinate relationships" is functional and according to Hofstede reflects the way inequality is addressed in the society. "According to Mulder's Power Distance Reduction theory subordinates will try to reduce the power distance between themselves and their bosses and bosses will try to maintain or enlarge it", but there is also a degree to which a society expects there to be differences in the levels of power. A high score suggests that there is an expectation that some individuals wield larger amounts of power than others. A low score reflects the view that all people should have equal rights.
* ''Uncertainty avoidance'' is the way of coping with uncertainty about the [[future]]. Society copes with it with [[technology]], [[law]] and [[religion]] (though different societies have different ways of addressing it), and according to Hofstede organizations deal with it with technology, law and [[ritual]]s, or in two ways – rational and non-rational, with rituals being the non-rational. Hofstede listed some of the rituals as the memos and reports, some parts of the accounting system, a large part of the planning and control systems, and the nomination of experts.
* ''Individualism vs. collectivism'' – disharmony of interests on personal and collective goals (Parsons and Shils, 1951). Hofstede raises the idea that society's expectations of [[Individualism]]/[[Collectivism]] will be reflected by the employee inside the organization. Collectivist societies will have more emotional dependence on members in their organizations; when in equilibrium an organization is expected to show responsibility to members. Extreme individualism is seen in the [[US]]. In fact, collectivism in the US is seen as "bad". Other cultures and societies than the US will therefore seek to resolve social and organizational problems in ways different from American ways. Hofstede says that a capitalist market economy fosters individualism and [[competition]], and depends on it, but individualism is also related to the development of the [[middle class]]. &lt;small&gt;Some people and cultures might have both high individualism and high collectivism. For example, someone who highly values duty to his or her group does not necessarily give a low priority to personal freedom and self-sufficiency.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''[[Masculinity]] vs. [[femininity]]'' –  reflects whether a certain society is predominantly male or female in terms of cultural values, [[gender role]]s and power relations.
* Long- Versus Short-Term Orientation&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"/&gt; which he describes as "The long-term orientation dimension can be interpreted as dealing with society's search for virtue. Societies with a short-term orientation generally have a strong concern with establishing the absolute Truth. They are normative in their thinking. They exhibit great respect for traditions, a relatively small propensity to save for the future, and a focus on achieving quick results. In societies with a long-term orientation, people believe that truth depends very much on situation, context and time. They show an ability to adapt traditions to changed conditions, a strong propensity to save and invest, thriftiness, and perseverance in achieving results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831002012/http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html |archivedate=2013-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dimensions refer to the effect of national cultures on management, and can be used to adapt policies to local needs.
In a follow up study, another model&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"/&gt; is suggested for organizational culture.

=== O'Reilly, Chatman, and Caldwell ===

Two common models and their associated measurement tools have been developed by O'Reilly ''et al.'' and [[Daniel R. Denison|Denison]].

O'Reilly, [[Jennifer Chatman|Chatman]] &amp; Caldwell (1991) developed a model based on the belief that cultures can be distinguished by values that are reinforced within organizations.  Their Organizational Cultural Profile (OCP) is a self reporting tool which makes distinctions according eight categories – Innovation, Supportiveness, Stability, Respect for People, Outcome Orientation, Attention to Detail, Team Orientation, and Aggressiveness.  The model is also suited to measure how organizational culture affects organizational performance, as it measures most efficient persons suited to an organization{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} and as such organizations can be termed as having good organizational culture.
Employee values are measured against organizational values to predict employee intentions to stay, and [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]].&lt;ref name="becky"&gt;Becky H. Takeda, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RojvMmfcZfAC&amp;pg=PA2 Investigation of employee tenure as related to relationships of personality and personal values of entrepreneurs and their perceptions of their employees]'', ProQuest, 2007, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through an instrument like Organizational Culture Profile (OCP) to measure employee commitment.&lt;ref name="becky"/&gt;

=== Daniel Denison ===

Daniel Denison's model (1990) asserts that organizational culture can be described by four general dimensions – Mission, Adaptability, Involvement and Consistency.  Each of these general dimensions is further described by the following three sub-dimensions:

* Mission – Strategic Direction and Intent, Goals and Objectives and Vision
* Adaptability – Creating Change, Customer Focus and Organizational Learning
* Involvement – Empowerment, Team Orientation and Capability Development
* Consistency – Core Values, Agreement, Coordination/Integration

Denison's model also allows cultures to be described broadly as externally or internally focused as well as flexible versus stable.  The model has been typically used to diagnose cultural problems in organizations.

=== Deal and Kennedy ===

Deal and Kennedy (1982)&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt; defined organizational culture as ''the way things get done around here''.

Deal and Kennedy created a model of culture that is based on 4 different types of organizations. They each focus on how quickly the organization receives feedback, the way members are rewarded, and the level of risks taken:&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"&gt;[http://changingminds.org/explanations/culture/deal_kennedy_culture.htm Deal and Kennedy's cultural model], ChangingMinds.org&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Work-hard, play-hard culture''': This has rapid feedback/reward and low risk resulting in: Stress coming from quantity of work rather than uncertainty. High-speed action leading to high-speed recreation. Examples: Restaurants, software companies.&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Tough-guy macho culture''': This has rapid feedback/reward and high risk, resulting in the following: Stress coming from high risk and potential loss/gain of reward. Focus on the present rather than the longer-term future. Examples: police, surgeons, sports.&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Process culture''': This has slow feedback/reward and low risk, resulting in the following: Low stress, plodding work, comfort and security. Stress that comes from internal politics and stupidity of the system. Development of bureaucracies and other ways of maintaining the status quo. Focus on security of the past and of the future. Examples: banks, insurance companies.&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt;&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Bet-the-company culture''': This has slow feedback/reward and high risk, resulting in the following: Stress coming from high risk and delay before knowing if actions have paid off. The long view is taken, but then much work is put into making sure things happen as planned. Examples: aircraft manufacturers, oil companies.

=== Edgar Schein ===

According to [[Edgar Schein|Schein]] (1992),&lt;ref name=schein2009/&gt; culture is the most difficult organizational attribute to change, outlasting organizational products, services, founders and leadership and all other physical attributes of the organization.  His organizational model illuminates culture from the standpoint of the [[observation|observer]], described at three levels: ''artifacts'', ''espoused values'' and ''basic underlying assumptions''.

At the first and most cursory level of Schein's model is organizational attributes that can be seen, felt and heard by the uninitiated observer – collectively known as ''artifacts''. Included are the facilities, offices, furnishings, visible awards and recognition, the way that its members dress, how each person visibly interacts with each other and with organizational outsiders, and even company [[slogan]]s, [[mission statement]]s and other operational [[creed]]s.

Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. [[Daniel R. Denison|Daniel Denison]] (1990) describes artifacts as the tangible aspects of culture shared by members of an organization. Verbal, behavioral and physical artifacts are the surface manifestations of organizational culture.

Rituals, the collective interpersonal behavior and values as demonstrated by that behavior, constitute the fabric of an organization's culture.  The contents of myths, stories, and sagas reveal the history of an organization and influence how people understand what their organization values and believes.  Language, stories, and myths are examples of verbal artifacts and are represented in rituals and ceremonies. Technology and art exhibited by members of an organization are examples of physical artifacts.

The next level deals with the professed culture of an organization's members – the ''values''. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g.  loyalty, customer service). At this level, local and personal values are widely expressed within the organization. Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture. Organizational behavior at this level usually can be studied by interviewing the organization's membership and using questionnaires to gather attitudes about organizational membership.

At the third and deepest level, the organization's [[tacit assumption]]s are found.  These are the elements of culture that are unseen and not cognitively identified in everyday interactions between organizational members. Additionally, these are the elements of culture which are often taboo to discuss inside the organization.  Many of these '[[unspoken rules]]' exist without the conscious knowledge of the membership.  Those with sufficient experience to understand this deepest level of organizational culture usually become acclimatized to its attributes over time, thus reinforcing the invisibility of their existence. Surveys and casual interviews with organizational members cannot draw out these attributes—rather much more in-depth means is required to first identify then understand organizational culture at this level.  Notably, culture at this level is the underlying and driving element often missed by organizational behaviorists.

Using Schein's model, understanding paradoxical organizational behaviors becomes more apparent.  For instance, an organization can profess highly aesthetic and moral standards at the second level of Schein's model while simultaneously displaying curiously opposing behavior at the third and deepest level of culture.  Superficially, organizational rewards can imply one organizational norm but at the deepest level imply something completely different.  This insight offers an understanding of the difficulty that organizational newcomers have in assimilating organizational culture and why it takes time to become acclimatized. It also explains why organizational change agents usually fail to achieve their goals: underlying tacit cultural norms are generally not understood before would-be change agents begin their actions. Merely understanding culture at the deepest level may be insufficient to institute cultural change because the dynamics of interpersonal relationships (often under threatening conditions) are added to the dynamics of organizational culture while attempts are made to institute desired change.

According to Schein (1992),&lt;ref name="schein2009" /&gt; the two main reasons why cultures develop in organizations is due to external adaptation and internal integration.  External adaptation reflects an evolutionary approach to organizational culture and suggests that cultures develop and persist because they help an organization to survive and flourish.  If the culture is valuable, then it holds the potential for generating sustained competitive advantages.  Additionally, internal integration is an important function since social structures are required for organizations to exist.  Organizational practices are learned through socialization at the workplace.  Work environments reinforce culture on a daily basis by encouraging employees to exercise cultural values.
Organizational culture is shaped by multiple factors, including the following:
* External environment
* Industry
* Size and nature of the organization's workforce
* Technologies the organization uses
* The organization's history and ownership

=== Gerry Johnson ===

Gerry Johnson (1988) described a cultural web, identifying a number of elements that can be used to describe or influence organizational culture:

* '''The paradigm''': What the organization is about, what it does, its mission, its values.
* '''Control systems''': The processes in place to monitor what is going on. Role cultures would have vast rule-books. There would be more reliance on individualism in a power culture.
* '''Organizational structures''': Reporting lines, hierarchies, and the way that work flows through the business.
* '''Power structures''': Who makes the decisions, how widely spread is power, and on what is power based?
* '''Symbols''': These include organizational logos and designs, but also extend to symbols of power such as parking spaces and executive washrooms.
* '''Rituals and routines''': Management meetings, board reports and so on may become more habitual than necessary.
* '''Stories and myths''': build up about people and events, and convey a message about what is valued within the organization.

These elements may overlap.  Power structures may depend on control systems, which may exploit the very rituals that generate stories which may not be true.

*

=== Stanley G. Harris ===

''Schemata'' (plural of schema) are knowledge structures a person forms from past experiences, allowing the person to respond to similar events more efficiently in the future by guiding the processing of information.  A person's schemata are created through interaction with others, and thus inherently involve communication.

Stanley G. Harris (1994) argues that five categories of in-organization schemata are necessary for organizational culture:

# '''Self-in-organization schemata''': a person's concept of oneself within the context of the organization, including her/his personality, roles, and behavior.
# '''Person-in-organization schemata''': a person's memories, impressions, and expectations of other individuals within the organization.
# '''Organization schemata''': a subset of person schemata, a person's generalized perspective on others as a whole in the organization.
# '''Object/concept-in-organization schemata''': knowledge an individual has of organization aspects other than of other persons.
# '''Event-in-organization schemata''': a person's knowledge of social events within an organization.

All of these categories together represent a person's knowledge of an organization.
Organizational culture is created when the schematas (schematic structures) of differing individuals across and within an organization come to resemble each other (when any one person's schemata come to resemble another person's schemata because of mutual organizational involvement), primarily done through organizational communication, as individuals directly or indirectly share knowledge and meanings.

=== Charles Handy ===

[[Charles Handy]] (1976),  popularized Roger Harrison (1972) with linking [[organizational structure]] to organizational culture. The described four types of culture are:&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Ruiz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ_uPnC6kTIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Discriminate Or Diversify]'', PositivePsyche.Biz Corp, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Power culture''': concentrates [[power (social and political)|power]] among a small group or a central figure and its control is radiating from its center like a web. Power cultures need only a few rules and little [[bureaucracy]] but swift in decisions can ensue.
# '''Role culture''': authorities are delegated as such within a highly defined structure. These organizations form hierarchical bureaucracies, where power derives from the personal position and rarely from an expert power. Control is made by procedures (which are highly valued), strict roles descriptions and authority definitions. These organizations have consistent systems and are very predictable. This culture is often represented by a "Roman Building" having pillars. These pillars represent the functional departments.
# '''Task culture''': teams are formed to solve particular problems. Power is derived from the team with the expertise to execute against a task. This culture uses a small team approach, where people are highly skilled and specialized in their own area of expertise. Additionally, these cultures often feature the multiple reporting lines seen in a [[matrix management|matrix structure]].
# '''Person culture''': formed where all individuals believe themselves superior to the organization. It can become difficult for such organizations to continue to operate, since the concept of an organization suggests that a group of like-minded individuals pursue organizational goals. However some professional partnerships operate well as person cultures, because each partner brings a particular expertise and clientele to the firm.

=== Kim Cameron and Robert Quinn ===

{{see also|Archetype}}

[[Kim S. Cameron|Kim Cameron]] and Robert Quinn (1999) conducted research on organizational effectiveness and success. Based on the Competing Values Framework, they developed the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument that distinguishes four culture types.

Competing values produce polarities like flexibility vs. stability and internal vs. external focus – these two polarities were found to be most important in defining organizational success. The polarities construct a quadrant with four types of culture:

* [[Clan]] culture (internal focus and flexible) – A friendly workplace where leaders act like father figures.
* [[Adhocracy]] culture (external focus and flexible) – A dynamic workplace with leaders that stimulate innovation.
* Market culture (external focus and controlled) – A competitive workplace with leaders like hard drivers
* [[Hierarchical organization|Hierarchy]] culture (internal focus and controlled) – A structured and formalized workplace where leaders act like coordinators.

Cameron and Quinn designated six characteristics of organizational culture that can be assessed with the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI).

Clan cultures are most strongly associated with positive employee [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and product and [[service quality]].&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, D.L., &amp; Haug, R. (nd).VOrganizational Culture: Diagnosing a Customer Contact Company. Retrieved Dec. 14, 2014.[http://inspirexcellence.com/Articles/OrganizationalCulture_Beyer&amp;Associates.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Market cultures are most strongly related with [[innovation]] and financial effectiveness criteria. The primary belief in market cultures that clear goals and contingent rewards motivate employees to aggressively perform and meet stakeholders' expectations; a core belief in clan cultures is that the organization's trust in and commitment to employees facilitates open communication and employee involvement. These differing results suggest that it is important for executive leaders to consider the match between strategic initiatives and organizational culture when determining how to embed a culture that produces competitive advantage. By assessing the current organizational culture as well as the preferred situation, the gap and direction to change can be made visible as a first step to changing organizational culture.

=== Robert A. Cooke ===

Robert A. Cooke defines culture as the behaviors that members believe are required to fit in and meet expectations within their organization. The Organizational Culture Inventory measures twelve behavioral norms that are grouped into three general types of cultures:

* Constructive cultures, in which members are encouraged to interact with people and approach tasks in ways that help them meet their higher-order satisfaction needs.
* Passive/defensive cultures, in which members believe they must interact with people in ways that will not threaten their own security.
* Aggressive/defensive cultures, in which members are expected to approach tasks in forceful ways to protect their status and security.

==== Constructive cultures ====

In constructive cultures, people are encouraged to be in communication with their co-workers, and work as teams, rather than only as individuals. In positions where people do a complex job, rather than something simple like a mechanical task, this culture is efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=R. A.|title=The Organizational Culture Inventory|year=1987|publisher=Human Synergistics, Inc.|location=Plymouth, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Achievement''': completing a task successfully, typically by effort, courage, or skill (pursue a standard of excellence) (explore alternatives before acting) – Based on the need to attain high-quality results on challenging projects, the belief that outcomes are linked to one's effort rather than chance and the tendency to personally set challenging yet realistic goals. People high in this style think ahead and plan, explore alternatives before acting and learn from their mistakes.
# '''Self-actualizing''': realization or fulfillment of one's talents and potentialities – considered as a drive or need present in everyone (think in unique and independent ways) (do even simple tasks well) – Based on needs for personal growth, self-fulfillment and the realization of one's potential. People with this style demonstrate a strong desire to learn and experience things, creative yet realistic thinking and a balanced concern for people and tasks.
# '''Humanistic-encouraging''': help others to grow and develop (resolve conflicts constructively) – Reflects an interest in the growth and development of people, a high positive regard for them and sensitivity to their needs. People high in this style devote energy to coaching and counselling others, are thoughtful and considerate and provide people with support and encouragement.
# '''Affiliative''': treat people as more valuable than things (cooperate with others) – Reflects an interest in developing and sustaining pleasant relationships. People high in this style share their thoughts and feelings, are friendly and cooperative and make others feel a part of things.

Organizations with constructive cultures encourage members to work to their full potential, resulting in high levels of motivation, satisfaction, teamwork, service quality, and sales growth. Constructive norms are evident in environments where quality is valued over quantity, creativity is valued over conformity, cooperation is believed to lead to better results than competition, and effectiveness is judged at the system level rather than the component level. These types of cultural norms are consistent with (and supportive of) the objectives behind empowerment, [[total quality management]], transformational leadership, continuous improvement, re-engineering, and learning organizations.&lt;ref name=kotter1992/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the Organizational Culture Inventory (OCI) to Measure Kotter and Heskett's Adaptive and Unadaptive Cultures|url=http://www.trainersdirect.com/resources/articles/changemanagement/orgcultureinventory.htm|publisher=Human Synergistics|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constructive Styles|url=http://www.human-synergistics.com.au/content/products/circumplex/constructive.asp|publisher=Human-Synergistics|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Passive/defensive cultures ====

Norms that reflect expectations for members to interact with people in ways that will not threaten their own security are in the Passive/Defensive Cluster.

The four Passive/Defensive cultural norms are:

* Approval
* Conventional
* Dependent
* Avoidance

In organizations with Passive/Defensive cultures, members feel pressured to think and behave in ways that are inconsistent with the way they believe they should in order to be effective. People are expected to please others (particularly superiors) and avoid interpersonal conflict. Rules, procedures, and orders are more important than personal beliefs, ideas, and judgment. Passive/Defensive cultures experience a lot of unresolved conflict and turnover, and organizational members report lower levels of motivation and satisfaction.

==== Aggressive/defensive cultures ====

This style is characterized with more emphasis on task than people. Because of the very nature of this style, people tend to focus on their own individual needs at the expense of the success of the group. The aggressive/defensive style is very stressful, and people using this style tend to make decisions based on status as opposed to expertise.&lt;ref name="Aggressive/Defensive Styles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aggressive/Defensive Styles|url=http://www.human-synergistics.com.au/content/products/circumplex/aggressive.asp|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Oppositional''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea that a need for security that takes the form of being very critical and cynical at times.  People who use this style are more likely to question others work; however, asking those tough question often leads to a better product. Nonetheless, those who use this style may be overly-critical toward others, using irrelevant or trivial flaws to put others down.
# '''[[Power (social and political)|Power]]''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea that there is a need for prestige and influence. Those who use this style often equate their own [[self-worth]] with controlling others. Those who use this style have a tendency to dictate others opposing to guiding others' actions.
# '''Competitive''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea of a need to protect one's status. Those who use this style protect their own status by comparing themselves to other individuals and outperforming them.  Those who use this style are seekers of appraisal and recognition from others.
# '''[[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionistic]]''' – This cultural norm is based on the need to attain flawless results. Those who often use this style equate their self-worth with the attainment of extremely high standards. Those who often use this style are always focused on details and place excessive demands on themselves and others.

Organizations with aggressive/defensive cultures encourage or require members to appear competent, controlled, and superior. Members who seek assistance, admit shortcomings, or concede their position are viewed as incompetent or weak. These organizations emphasize finding errors, weeding out "mistakes" and encouraging members to compete against each other rather than competitors. The short-term gains associated with these strategies are often at the expense of long-term growth.&lt;ref name="Aggressive/Defensive Styles"/&gt;

=== Adam Grant ===

[[Adam Grant]], author of the book ''Give and Take'', distinguishes organizational cultures into ''giver'', ''taker'' and ''matcher'' cultures according to their [[norm of reciprocity|norms of reciprocity]]. In a giver culture, employees operate by "helping others, sharing knowledge, offering mentoring, and making connections without expecting anything in return", whereas in a taker culture "the norm is to get as much as possible from others while contributing less in return" and winners are those who take the most and are able to build their power at the expense of others. The majority of organizations are mid-way, with a ''matcher culture'', in which the norm is to match giving with taking, and favours are mostly traded in closed loops.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Grant|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/givers_take_all_the_hidden_dimension_of_corporate_culture|title=Givers take all: The hidden dimension of corporate culture|publisher=McKinsey|date=April 2013|accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by Harvard researchers on units of the US intelligence system, a giver culture turned out to be the strongest predictor of group effectiveness.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"/&gt;

As Grant points out, [[Robert H. Frank]] argues that "many organizations are essentially [[winner-take-all market]]s, dominated by zero-sum competitions for rewards and promotions". In particular, when leaders implement [[forced ranking]] systems to reward individual performance, the organisational culture tends to change, with a giver culture giving way to a taker or matcher culture. Also awarding the highest-performing individual within each team encourages a taker culture.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"/&gt;

=== Stephen McGuire ===

Stephen McGuire (2003) defined and validated a model of organizational culture that predicts revenue from new sources.  An Entrepreneurial Organizational Culture (EOC) is a system of shared values, beliefs and norms of members of an organization, including valuing creativity and tolerance of creative people, believing that innovating and seizing market opportunities are appropriate behaviors to deal with problems of survival and prosperity, environmental uncertainty, and competitors' threats, and expecting organizational members to behave accordingly.

===Eric Flamholtz===
Eric Flamholtz (2001; 2011) has identified and validated a model of organizational culture components that drive financial results (Flamholtz and Randle, 2011). The model consist of five identified dimensions of  corporate culture: 1) treatment of customers, 2) treatment of people, 3) performance standards and accountability, 4) innovation and change, and 5) process orientation. These five dimensions have been confirmed by factor analysis (Flamholtz and Narasimhan-Kannan, 2005) in addition, Flamholtz has published empirical research that show the impact of organizational culture on financial performance (Flamholtz, 2001). Flamholtz has also proposed  that organizational (corporate) culture is not just an asset in the economic sense; but is also an "asset" in the conventional accounting sense (Flamholtz 2005). Flamholtz and Randle have also examined the evolution of organizational culture at different stages of organizational growth (Flamholtz and 
Randle, 2014).

== Ethical frameworks and evaluations of corporate culture ==
Four organizational cultures can be classified as apathetic, caring, exacting, and integrative.

* An apathetic culture shows minimal concern for either people or performance. &amp;nbsp;
* A caring culture exhibits high concern for people but minimal concern for performance issues.
* An exacting culture shows little concern for people but a high concern for performance.
* An integrative culture combines a high concern for people and performance.

A cultural audit is an assessment of an organization's values. &lt;!--TO BE EDITED 2/11/17--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42374">The '''organizing model''', as the term refers to [[trade union]]s (and sometimes other social-movement organizations), is a broad conception of how those organizations should recruit, operate, and advance the interests of their members, though the specific functions of the model are more detailed and are discussed at length below. It typically involves many full-time organizers, who work by building up confidence and strong networks and leaders within the workforce, and by confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. The organizing model is strongly linked to social movement unionism and community unionism. The organizing model contributes to the discussion of how trade unions can reverse the trend of declining membership, which they are experiencing in most industrial nations,{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and how they can recapture some of the political power, which the labor movement has lost over the past century.

The organizing model is frequently compared and contrasted with other methods of union organization, such as the [[servicing model]]. There is disagreement as to the logistics of applying the organizing model and whether it should focus on organizing existing members, recruiting new members, or both. The prominence of the model and the debate over its worth are seen primarily in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

==Defining the Organizing Model==

The principal aim of the organizing model is that of giving power directly to union members. The organizing model in its ideal type has these features:

* Strong emphasis on the importance of personal contact in organizing. Union officials are, according to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, "paid,"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; as opposed to being volunteers from the union itself.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; These are the same people who, had they been employing the service model in their union, would have been offering services to the members, but instead they focus their efforts on organizing the union members to act on their own behalf, rather than simply offering them services.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;
* To facilitate this type of organization, organizers will often put in long hours talking to workers about their situation, and what they believe the union can help them achieve. Visits to workers' homes will often be a component of this. 
* Acceptance of the view that workers need to take some appreciable responsibility for winning union struggles and making the union strong. 
* The identification and recruitment of volunteer leaders from among the workforce, to spread information about the union, and encourage others to join and take action.
* Proactive recruitment drives conducted by either the paid organizers, the volunteers from the union, or both. The important part of the recruitment aspect of the organizing model is, according to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, ensuring "the principle of 'like-recruits-like' such that the recruiters have the same demographic and occupational identity to those being recruited." &lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Though, there can be unions that employ the organizing model without necessarily emphasizing recruitment.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;Fletcher, B., Jr., &amp; Hurd, R. W. (1998). Beyond the organizing model: The transformation process in local
unions [Electronic version]. In K. Bronfenbrenner, S. Friedman, R. W. Hurd, R. A. Oswald &amp; R. L. Seeber
(Eds.) Organizing to win: New research on union strategies (pp. 37-53). Ithaca, NY: ILR Press.
http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/articles/322/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* As a component of these recruitment drives, Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon also discuss "mapping" &lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; of workplaces as a key component of the organizing model, and they also make it clear that the goal of mapping is to "...identify all members of the workplace and rank them systematically in terms of their propensity to become active in the union." &lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; 
* Proactive campaigning, involving a large commitment of resources and large numbers of members. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon assert that this campaigning has to be focused on specific "issues and grievances," &lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; rather than campaigning without any specific, tangible goals in mind.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; 
* Creative campaigning tactics - including demonstrations, street theatre, media stunts, [[direct action]], [[civil disobedience]], music etc.
* A conception of leadership in which leaders are those willing to take the initiative and contribute effort, rather than one based on authority.  It is often the goal for leadership (as confidence to initiation organization with others) will spread as broadly as possible.
* Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon also offer "community support"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; as a key to the success of the organizing model.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; As a way to maintain or even incite this support from the community, Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon suggest "publicising concessions from the employer".&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; 
* Typically a relatively high level of membership dues relative for industrial—as opposed to craft—unions.

==Organizing versus Servicing==
The development of the organizing model is as opposed to the servicing model, and there are various differences between the two models for union structure.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; Edmund Heery, Melanie Simms, Dave Simpson, Rick Delbridge, and John Salmon talk about how in the servicing model, "...the function of the union is to deliver collective and individual services to members who are dependent on the formal organization and its hierarchy of officers to provide what they require." &lt;ref name="Heery et al"&gt;Heery, E., Simms, M., Simpson, D., Delbridge, R., &amp; Salmon, J. (2000). Organizing unionism comes to the UK. ''Employee Relations, 22''(1). 38-57. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.emerald-library.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710185844/http://www.emerald-library.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon state that the organizing model is different from the servicing model because it focuses instead on making union members feel "empowered," &lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; rather than alienated from the whole union process and environment.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt;

Jack Fiorito states that the organizing model and the servicing model cannot be considered separate and there needs to be provision for using both models at the same time;&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; Fiorito's research about British union members showed that "...a large number of responses express reservations about the OM or at least the organizing vs. servicing dichotomy suggested. Many of these responses emphasize the importance of service as an aid to organizing (18%) or something that is expected by the members (23%)."&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; Fiorito believes that the organizing model and the servicing model are not mutually exclusive in some cases;&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; there are some instances when the two models could be complementary.&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; The debate over the organizing model versus the servicing model is widespread and multifaceted.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; Even the goals of the organizing model are debated and disagreed upon.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;

==Internal versus External==
According to Bill Fletcher and Richard W. Hurd, unions that employ the organizing model often try to apply the above tactics in "internal,"&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt; not just "external"&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; campaigns.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;  Indeed, many unions that employ the organizing model attempt to win a greater right to organize non-union workers through pressuring an employer through using current members' collective strength. Richard Hurd says that "Throughout the late 1980's the ''organizing model'' was used almost exclusively to apply to internal organizing;"&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; however, "...by 1995 the ''organizing model'' concept was indiscriminately used to refer to both internal organizing to mobilize members, and external organizing that promotes grassroots activism as a way to build support for union representation."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt;

There is debate as to the proper role of the organizing model and whether it should focus on internal or on external applications.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; Bob Carter talks about the difference between internal organizing and external organizing in the context of the earliest British unions to use the organizing model.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Carter says that "...despite the core message of the American model - that organization, rather than recruitment as such, was primary - officers were given individual recruitment targets...placing an emphasis not so much on the changing nature of unionism but simply on short-term recruitment."&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; There is an apparent disconnect between employing the organizing model primarily for recruitment purposes and using the organizing model to facilitate better union conditions for pre-existing members of the union.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;

According to Fletcher and Hurd, exactly what constitutes internal organizing and what constitutes external organizing is unclear.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; Jack Fiorito offers an argument about internal vs. external organizing in the context of British unions.&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; Fiorito says that external organizing is "...organizing in new areas...",&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; while internal organizing is "...recruitment in sites where the union has recognition..."&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt;  Fletcher and Hurd believe that the organizing model should be more focused on external, rather than internal, organizing,&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; and they cite "Organizing Locals"&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; as a good example of how that could be accomplished.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;

==History and Context of the Union Organizing Model==
Trade unions originally existed to organize their members democratically, and during their early growth, they typically put a strong emphasis on active recruitment and militant rank and file action, including strikes.  By no means did they always unambiguously act in the interests of their members, but they were perceived of as organizations which existed to struggle for collective action.  Particularly since the end of World War II, however, the trade unions have tended more and more to act as service providers for their members: providing legal advice, training and so on; eschewing mass-based, militant action.  During the '60s, '70s and onward, this trend deepened, with union density among the workforce falling all the while, until it could be measured at between 10% and 20% in many industrialized countries.  In the context of this history, the organizing model is in principle not so much a new conception, as an attempt to recapture the essence of the [[labor movement]].

The 1980s saw various attempts, in the United States, to compensate for falling union membership.&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; Richard Hurd says that through the adoption of the "Organizing Institute"&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; in the U.S., the organizing model was able to spread to other countries, as it "...served as a prototype for Australia's Organizing Works and Britain's Organizing Academy."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; Bob Carter explains the logisitics how the organizing model spread across the world.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Carter says that "After a visit to the US of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the influence of the organising approach spread to Australia and New Zealand and back to Britain via MSF."&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Carter asserts that the organizing model started in the US, went to Australia and New Zealand next, and then went to the UK.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; David Peetz and Barbara Pocock state that the ways these various countries implemented the organizing model were quite different, and the model looked slightly different based upon these minor discrepancies.&lt;ref name="Peetz"&gt;Peetz, D., &amp; Pocock, B.

==History in the United States==
According to Richard W. Hurd, the history of the organizing model in the U.S. began from the failure of a "labor law"&lt;ref name="Hurd"&gt;Hurd, R. W. (2004). The rise and fall of the organizing model in the U.S. [Electronic version]. Retrieved from Cornell University, ILR school site:
http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/articles/301/&lt;/ref&gt; to be passed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; In addition, Hurd explains that the 1980s were a very troubling time for unions in the U.S. as a result of "...the anti-union reign of Ronald Reagan..."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; and "Twin recessions."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; Both of these factors contributed to the decline of union membership that so infamously characterized the labor movement in the U.S. in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; In fact, Hurd says that, "The labor movement lost more than one-fifth of its private sector members during the first half of the 1980s."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; Therefore, U.S. unions were forced to try some new tactics in the hopes of regaining the membership they were losing.&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt;

In response to this labor crisis, the AFL-CIO made many attempts to renew its labor movement in the 1980s, but none of them were successful.&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; However, in 1988, an [[AFL-CIO]] organized [[teleconference]] of trade unionists recognized the potential of the nascent organizing model, gave it its name, and resolved to spread it throughout the trade-union movement: this was an element in the model's popularization. After the teleconference, the AFL-CIO, according to Hurd, established the "Organizing Institute,"&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; and the goal of the institute was "...to train union organizers." &lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; While, as Richard Hurd suggests, the attempts at reigniting the flame of union membership were largely unsuccessful,&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; in 1995, former SEIU President [[John Sweeney (labor leader)|John Sweeney]] was elected president of the AFL-CIO on the New Voice slate, on a platform of spreading the organizing model across the members of the federation. According to Richard Hurd, when Sweeney took over, he created an "Organizing Department"&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; to enhance the strategy of employing the organizing model throughout the AFL-CIO,&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; and he encouraged unions to begin "...devoting 30% of their budgets to recruitment."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; The extent of the success of this is disputed, with some suggesting that more rhetoric has changed than anything, but it did have at least some effect. Richard Hurd suggests that "The reality is that the individual national unions determine their own resource allocations and develop their own organizing programs,"&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; but "Most unions have increased the funding of their organizing departments, and many have devoted substantial resources to the effort."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; This is how the AFL-CIO tried to implement the organizing model in response to the membership crisis.

In the mid 1980s, the [[Service Employees International Union|SEIU]] union found itself in a similar state of crisis. A period of intense internal discussion gave rise to the view that a radical program was needed to rebuild the union, and make it relevant to current and potential members. The [[Justice for Janitors]] campaign was launched as the organizational spearhead of the SEIU's attempt to reinvigorate their membership; beginning in [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1985.  In addition to the Justice for Janitors campaign, according to Jennifer Jihye Chun, around the same time, the SEIU also engaged in campaigns for "home care workers"&lt;ref name="Chun"&gt;Chun, J. J. (2009). ''Organizing at the margins: The symbolic politics of labor in South Korea and the United States'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Chun" /&gt; Chun says that "Through a combination of aggressive grassroots organizing strategies, a focused political action campaign, and mass worker mobilizations, SEIU organizers were able to sign up 15,000 workers..."&lt;ref name="Chun" /&gt;

Working along the lines described above, the SEIU experienced a huge growth in membership, and a significant number of high-profile public victories for workers. (Though some proportion of the SEIU's membership growth has resulted from mergers, such as with 1199).It should be noted that the tactics and strategies of the SEIU and Justice for Janitors go beyond the organizing model which is, as has been described, an approach to local level organizing and campaigning.  It applies to a drive for recruitment of members and leaders on the level of a firm or city.  Other aspects of the SEIU's strategies are national or international.  For instance, the drive to gain industry-wide coverage across a large geographical base - i.e. to organize janitors not only within one building, but across a whole city, state and eventually all across the USA - or the advocacy of union mergers.

==History in Australia==
After a wave of massive industrial unrest and unprecedented increases in wages and conditions during the 1970s, the union movement became restrained in their demands, and part of the official apparatus of government during the [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]]-led, [[Corporatist#Neo-corporatism|neo-corporatist]], [[the Accord|Accord]] period (1983–96). According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the ALP and the ACTU formed the "Accord"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; by establishing a formal "relationship" with each other&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; While unions had [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamated]] prior to the Accord, and the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] had itself absorbed other lesser peak industrial councils, the accord period and the later [[enterprise bargaining agreement|enterprise bargaining]] period encouraged mergers into super unions. These super unions often obliterated previous small union identities and loyalties (on both the "left" and "right" of the trade union movement) and created unions with a relatively artificial internal culture.  Often the largest union in the merger imposed its internal culture on the other divisions of the new union.  Additionally, during the period of mergers, the traditional links between members, local organisers, industrial officers, branches and the peak leaderships of unions broke down. This presented a challenge to the union movement. According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the Accord period was very harmful to labor unions, and the super unions did not do anything drastic to improve the conditions of the unions.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that the 1980s and 1990s were particularly bad decades for Australian unions.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; According to Carter and Cooper, the decline of union membership was worse, during the 1980s and the 1990s, in Australia than it was in the U.K.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Carter and Cooper explain that the membership decline in Australian unions was the result of the "...pro-active anti-union approach..."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; by the "...conservative Coalition federal government...,"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; along with other "...structural changes in the labor market."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Peetz and Pocock state that during the 1980s and the 1990s, unions had to deal with "...outright hostility..."&lt;ref name="Peetz" /&gt; and "...successive pieces of legislation..."&lt;ref name="Peetz" /&gt; that were harmful to their membership and growth.&lt;ref name="Peetz" /&gt;

The response to this union crisis in Australia is the ''Organising Works'' program which was established in 1994 to recruit organizers from union members and university students. The Organizing Works Program, in Australia, was established after representatives from Australian unions visited the U.S. and observed the organizing model in practice.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Organising Works is a relatively unique program in Australia, in that it combines explicit training in trade unionism with an apprenticeship system with specific trade unions. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that Organizing Works was successful in spreading the message of the model and recruiting new members for unions,&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; and in general, Australian unions were more committed to the organizing model than were British unions.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; David Peetz and Barbara Pocock state that in the first six years of the Organizing Works Program in Australia, "...it had produced over 300 trainees..."&lt;ref name="Peetz" /&gt; Carter and Cooper discuss the "Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU)"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; as one of the main Australian unions to implement the organizing model on a large scale in response to union decline.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Peetz and Pocock talk about the "''Unions@Work''"&lt;ref name="Peetz" /&gt; report that was published for unions in 1999,&lt;ref name="Peetz" /&gt; which even continued the mission of the Organizing Works program.&lt;ref name="Peetz" /&gt; Peetz and Pocock emphasize that the organizing model was implemented differently in different Australian unions and that the aspects of the organizing model that got implemented differed by union.&lt;ref name="Peetz" /&gt;

==History in the UK and Ireland==
According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the U.K. went through several decades of uncertainty for unions.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Specifically, conditions of the 1970s through the 1990s in the U.K. were particularly prone to hostile conditions for unions.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Carter and Cooper state that British unions, like the "Trades Union Congress (TUC)"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; had to face "government hostility"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; and "job losses."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; In response to unfavorable conditions for unions, according to Carter and Cooper, the TUC tried implementing the "servicing"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; model, but it failed to provide measurable improvements in the labor movement or in "membership."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; According to Bob Carter, the "first major British union"&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Carter, B. (2000). Adoption of the organizing model in British trade unions: Some evidence from Manufacturing, Science, and Finance (MSF). ''Work Employment Society, 14''(117). doi: 10.1177/09500170022118293&lt;/ref&gt; to employ the organizing model was "[[Manufacturing, Science and Finance]] (MSF),"&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; not necessarily the TUC.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that MSF was a combined union, which was formed from both the "Association of Scientific, Technical, Managerial, and Supervisory Staffs (ASTMS)"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; and the "Technical Advisory Staffs (TASS)."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Bob Carter says that when ASTMS and TASS came together to form MSF, the merged organization more closely resembled ASTMS than TASS.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; According to Carter and Cooper, the history of the ASTMS showed that it was "...a much looser form of organization,",&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; while TASS was more "Communist."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Carter states that MSF began implementing the "MSF policy ''Organising Works''"&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; in 1996.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Carter makes the case that the MSF's implementation of the organizing model came after they tried "Reinforcement of a servicing culuture...,"&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; which was, overall, not very successful.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; This is why they switched their strategy toward using the organizing model, rather than the servicing model.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; However, according to Carter, MSF had many problems arise in the wake of the model's adoption, such as the fact that "It was conceived and implemented from the top downwards...without wide discussion in the union."&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Carter sees this as a fundamental problem posed by the organizing model, and he thinks it must be overcome in order for it to be effective.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;

Carter states that the same time period also saw the "launch of the TUC's New Unionism project in 1996." &lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Both unions, MSF and the TUC, were implementing new policies of employing the organizing model in an attempt to revitalize the conditions of their unions.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; The 1990s in the U.K. were especially geared toward experimentation and reorientation of the labor market toward being influential again.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Carter and Cooper question how successful the New Unionism Project was in facilitating growth and organizing for unions.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Carter and Cooper suggest that one of the main problems with the New Unionism was that it was too focused on negotiating with the "employer,"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; rather than just focusing on the goals of the workers.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Carter and Cooper state that the TUC had no real power over its "affiliates,"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; except setting a good example and hoping that the affiliated unions follow their lead by implementing the organizing model.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

The British [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) inaugurated an Organising Academy in 1998, to fulfill a similar role to that of the AFL-CIO's Organizing Institute in the USA (or [[Australian Council of Trade Unions|ACTU's]] Organising Works programme in Australia). Carter and Cooper question how successful the Academy was in spreading the organizing model because of the lack of "trainees"&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; from some unions.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon state that, while the spread of the organizing model was the primary goal of the Academy, the Academy was actually dedicated to helping people traditionally underrepresented in the labor unions, such as "women"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; and the "young"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; or those with "non-standard"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; employment.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt;  While the graduates of the Academy have produced positive results,&lt;ref&gt;Heery, E., Delbridge, R., &amp; Simms, M. (2003, January).''The Organising Academy'' Retrieved from the Web site for the TUC: http://www.tuc.org.uk/newunionism/5yearson.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in general the model has not been implemented in the UK with the same comprehensive commitment as it has been by some unions in the USA. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon state that U.K. unions are more likely to adopt the organizing model if they are or have been affiliated with "the Academy,"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; so the Academy has had a measurable impact on the implementation of the organizing model within the U.K.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt;

There are questions raised by writers on [[Industrial Relations]] about whether the transfer of the SEIU's organizing model has been faithful, or whether a watered down, less radical version has been instantiated.  Sarah Oxenbridge, for example, writes "community organising and organising model methods provided the means by which Californian Unionists put their 'social movement unionism' philosophies and strategies into practice, on a daily basis (see Heery 1998).  However, it may be that most British Trade Unionists will instead see the organising model as - more simply - a range of ''recruitment tactics'', and will pick and choose from amongst these tactics." &lt;ref&gt;Oxenbridge, S. (2000, March). ''Trade Union Organising Among Low-Wage Service Workers: Lessons From American and New Zealand'' Retrieved from the Web site for the University of Cambridge Center for Business Research: http://www.cbr.cam.ac.uk/pdf/wp160.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon have isolated several aspects of the organizing model that are likely to appear in the U.K., namely "one-to-one recruitment,"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; and "petitions, surveys and demonstrations."&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Heery Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon emphasize that these are only some of the core aspects of the organizing model, not all of them.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon state that British unions are more likely to employ the organizing model, rather than the serving model, if they are bigger and more open to influence from "other countries".&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt;

According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, British unions are more likely to focus on the ideological basis for the organizing model, rather than the practical applications of it.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Jack Fiorito states that the U.K.'s adaptation of the organizing model has some very specific characteristics that may or may not be seen in other countries.&lt;ref name="Fiorito"&gt;Fiorito, J. (2004). Union renewal and the organizing model in the United Kingdom. ''Labor Studies Journal, 29''(2). doi: 10.1353/lab.2004.0017
&lt;/ref&gt; Fiorito lists "...less reliance on paid staff and much lower dues levels in U.K. unions..."&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; as important features of the organizing model in the U.K.&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; Fiorito did extensive research about the condition of British unions in the 2000s,&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; which demonstrated that the organizing model was influential in British unions in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; When Fiorito interviewed U.K. union members during this timeframe, "Almost half of respondents (45%) volunteer that their union is adopting the OM,"&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; which is Fiorito's abbreviation for the organizing model.&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; The organizing model was present in many British unions in the 2000s, and the workers were aware of its presence.&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; The British union members largely felt that the organizing model was a good model to have implemented in their unions, and they were satisfied with its results.&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt; Fiorito states that "Although the OM varies somewhat in meaning, a strong majority of unionists feel that their union is truly committed to recruiting and organizing new members...".&lt;ref name="Fiorito" /&gt;

The Irish general union [[SIPTU]] established an Organizing Unit in 2004 and its president, [[Jack O'Connor (trade unionist)|Jack O'Connor]], set as his objective the transformation of SIPTU - hitherto firmly committed to a servicing agenda - into an organizing union. SIPTU is also seeking to learn from the experience of the SEIU. It remains to be seen how (and whether) a commitment to the organizing model of trade unionism can be reconciled with the union's traditional support for national '[[Social Partnership]]'.

The [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (T&amp;G) has begun to make some of the more serious moves of any of the larger British unions to learn from the SEIU's strategies - though some smaller unions (such as [[Community (trade union)|Community]]) have been applying the organizing model for some years.  In 2005, the T&amp;G launched a Justice for Cleaners campaign, which has been organizing workers in Canary Wharf, the Houses of Parliament, and, towards the end of the year, on the London Underground.  In the former of these two, improvements in wages have been won by workers.  The tactics of [[Social Movement Unionism]] have been utilized, insofar as the campaign organizers have worked closely with, for example, The East London Citizens Organisation (TELCO), which has brought in members of faith groups and other trade union branches.  However, there remain concerns about the T&amp;G's commitment to rank and file workers' action, considering how the union acted during the Gate Gourmet strike.

==Advantages of the Organizing Model==
Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon assert that the organizing model has several key advantages that distinguish it from the servicing model, such as the fact that the organizing model promotes "systematic,"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; proactive, and well-thought out campaigns, which help the union's goals get satisfactorily and pragmatically achieved.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; More broadly, one of the obvious advantages of the organizing model is that it allows workers to actually be involved in the campaigns that most closely affect them, promoting both equity and equality.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; In addition, the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, provides for the union's future by broadening its support from the workers and giving them a sense of investment into the day-to-day functions of the union itself.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, in their research about British trade unions and their use of the organizing model, state that, within the unions themselves, there was praise for the organizing model because it upheld the "...core role of trade unions".&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; This is to say that the British union members felt the organizing model adhered to what unions should be doing in regard to their members.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

==Disadvantages of the Organizing Model==

===Practical Disadvantages===

Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon list several disadvantages of the union organizing model, with the most critical being that the model is very "resource-intensive,"&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; in terms of both people and money.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Since the organizing model is, at its core, about people, rather than services, it cannot be effective without people to both implement it and carry it out.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon talk about "...instances of a lack of support or even opposition to organizing within unions."&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Because the organizing model is so dependent upon worker motivation and action, if the workers themselves oppose the implementation of the organizing model, it cannot be effective.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Fletcher and Hurd suggest that even if members are not resistant to adoption of the organizing model, they still have to learn how to perform tasks previously handled by organizers, and there have to be enough active members to facilitate this kind of action.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; This clear dependence on the support and actions of the workers is a disadvantage of the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, which, for the most part, does not require worker support or demand worker action.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, "Employers are often resistant."&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt; Unions that have to deal with this problem would very clearly have a hard time using the organizing model, as it could antagonize the employer even further and erode any previously existing relationship between the employer and the union.&lt;ref name="Heery et al" /&gt;

Fletcher and Hurd state that unions may also face issues of resistance by pre-existing "staff,"&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; who may be hesitant or even suspicious at the adoption of the organizing model.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; Dealing with resistant staff would be a major disadvantage of using the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, to which the staff are both accustomed and familiar with.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; Fletcher and Hurd assert that, based on the fact that unions employing the organizing model have to reassign tasks and take time to train people, "...following the organizing model creates more work than sticking to the servicing model."&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt; Richard Hurd argues that the organizing model can, at times, create "...continual warfare..."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; between the workers and the employer, which is a disadvantage because there is a trend of workers "...preferring stability rather than on-going class struggle."&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; If this is really the mindset of the workers, then it would be hard to actually maintain the organizing model for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Hurd" /&gt; Fred Glass says that "...an organizing model of unionism requires an organizing model of labor communications"&lt;ref name="Glass"&gt;Glass, F. (2003). Amplifying the voices of workers: An organizing model for labor communications. ''Labor Studies Journal, 27''(4), 1-16. doi:10.1353/lab.2003.0009&lt;/ref&gt; because the organizing model requires an effective way to share information with workers quickly and efficiently.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; Bob Carter, in regard to the organizing model  in British unions, is concerned with the method of implementation and whether or not workers consent to switching from servicing to organizing.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Carter says that "A model which is premised on debate and involvement cannot be successfully introduced without discussion..."&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; Carter worries about whether or not workers are a part of the transition process and whether they consent to all of the implications that come with the organizing model.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;

===Criticisms from the Left===
Most practical criticism of the model has emerged as a criticism of the practice of the model by the SEIU and other organizing unions, especially in America.  Criticisms from the left generally contrast (explicitly or not) the organizing model to a rank and file model, in which the confrontational style of organizing, and broad-based member involvement in campaigning is supplemented by broad-based member power. According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the organizing model is not inherently "democratic."&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Carter, B., &amp; Cooper, R. (2002). The organizing model and the management of change: A comparative study of unions in Australia and Britain. ''Industrial Relations, 57''(4), 712-733. Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1468-2338&lt;/ref&gt; In the organizing model, the workers are not as active as they could be, and staff are still responsible for many aspects of union organizing.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; Carter and Cooper believe that the organizing model is rather limited in terms of its scale, and it cannot start a "...wider working class movement."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

===Criticisms from the Right===
Critics argue that the organizing model is inappropriate to the task of unions in the modern global economy.  They say that industrial disputes of the type that organising engenders are harmful to the national economies in which they occur: by increasing uncertainty and raising wages (labor costs), they will make economies less attractive to inward investment. Hence, working people will suffer in the long term, as the less investment there is, the fewer jobs there will be.  The conclusion of those who take this line is that unions should emphasize their service aspects, particularly those that contribute toward the well-being of the employer as well as the employee. In addition, there are the criticisms leveled by the anti-union Right, who often associate collective action with the tyranny of '[[Big labor]]', contrasted to the free operation of the capitalist labor market.

'''Per Ditlev-Simonsen''' (born 12 June 1932) is a [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian politician]]. He was the [[List of mayors of Oslo|mayor of Oslo]], representing [[Conservative Party of Norway|the Conservative Party]], from 1995 to 2007. He stepped down on 23 August 2007 following the Swiss bank-account scandal.

Ditlev-Simonsen was an officer of the [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|Norwegian Royal Guards]], and he later attended [[Stanford University]] getting a [[Master of Arts]] degree. After college, Ditlev-Simonsen became a partner in his father's shipping company [[Sverre Ditlev-Simonsen &amp; Co]] (SDS) in 1955. He was a partner in the company until 1995.

Ditlev-Simonsen was a Member of Parliament from [[List of members of Stortinget 1981-1985|1981 to 1985]], serving in the [[Standing Committee of Finance]]. From 1989 to 1990 Ditlev-Simonsen was [[Minister of Defence (Norway)|Minister of Defense]] in the [[cabinet Syse|Cabinet of Jan P. Syse]].

==Personal life==

Ditlev-Simonsen was born in [[Oslo]] to ship owner [[Sverre Ditlev-Simonsen]] and Lily Kaurin. He was a grandson of [[Olaf Ditlev-Simonsen (born 1865) |Olaf Ditlev-Simonsen Sr]], and nephew of [[Olaf Ditlev-Simonsen]] Jr. He was married to Benedicte Werring (d.1990) from 1960, and to Turi Klaveness from 1992.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Per Ditlev-Simonsen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Bjarne |last=Kortsen |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Per_Ditlev-Simonsen | language=Norwegian |accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swiss bank account tax probe==
{{wikinews|Mayor of Oslo resigns after tax fraud scandal}}
In August 2007, the presence of a hitherto unknown [[Swiss bank account]] was revealed. The revelation came after an acrimonious divorce involving his daughter, [[Cecilie Ditlev-Simonsen]], the communications director of [[Norsk Hydro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1943016.ece |title=Mayor caught in tax probe |date=August 17, 2007 |author=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account, which contained [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 1.5 million had been [[inheritance|inherited]] by Ditlev-Simonsen after his wife died in 1990, and he eventually admitted to not having paid the Norwegian [[wealth tax]] on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1947969.ece |title=Mayor sorry but won’t resign |author=Aftenposten |date=August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelation caused several [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] politicians to call for Ditlev-Simonsen's resignation. [[Erna Solberg]], the head of the Conservative Party, asked that Ditlev-Simonsen refrain from active campaigning for his party ahead of the local elections scheduled for 10 September. Even if he had not resigned, the 75-year-old Ditlev-Simonsen was set to retire after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1947232.ece |title=Oslo's mayor faces resignation demands |author=Aftenposten |date=August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident was believed to be a cause of the Conservative's 4 percent drop in opinion polls, three weeks ahead of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1951245.ece |title=Voters abandon Conservatives |author=Aftenposten |date=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romania]] was the largest European producer of oil in [[World War II]]. The oil extracted from Romania was essential for Axis military operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/social/VIDEO_Inregistrare_senzationala_cu_Hitler-_-Fara_petrolul_din_Romania_nu_as_fi_atacat_niciodata_URSS-ul_0_379162423.html|title=VIDEO Înregistrare senzaţională cu Hitler: "Fără petrolul din România nu aş fi atacat niciodată URSS-ul"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/489/ |title = A Zero Job! Shoveling Out Refuse from the Hot Pools of Oil That Comes up from a Spouting Well |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[petrochemical industry]] near [[Ploieşti]] was bombed heavily by American bombers (see [[Operation Tidal Wave]]). After the war, a heavy reconstruction and expansion was done under the communist regime. Since then, most of the industry has been privatized.

Possessing substantial oil refining capacities, Romania is particularly interested in the Central Asia-Europe pipelines and seeks to strengthen its relations with some [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]]. With 10 refineries and an overall refining capacity of approximately {{convert|504000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, Romania has the largest refining industry in the region. Romania's refining capacity far exceeds domestic demand for refined petroleum products, allowing the country to export a wide range of oil products and petrochemicals — such as lubricants, bitumen, and fertilizers — throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/nte30277.htm Romania has the largest power sector in south-eastern Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petter Gottschalk''' (born March 27, 1950) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] professor of [[IT strategy]] employed at the [[BI Norwegian Business School]] at its Institute for Leadership and Organizational Management.&lt;ref name="BI-bio"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Petter Gottschalk |url= http://www.bi.no/forskning/academic-homepage/?ansattid=fgl98023 |publisher= BI Norwegian Business School |language= Norwegian |accessdate= March 30, 2012 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/66XuPgz8K |archivedate= March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is educated [[Diplom-Kaufmann]] from [[Berlin Institute of Technology]], Master of Science from [[Dartmouth College]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and Doctor of Business Administration from [[Henley Management College]] and [[Brunel University]].&lt;ref name="BI-bio"/&gt;

Gottschalk has previously been CEO of [[Norwegian Computing Center]], ABB Datakabel, Statens kantiner and Norsk Informasjonsteknologi (NIT).&lt;ref name="BI-bio"/&gt;

In recent years, Gottschalk has done research on the [[Norwegian Police Service|police]] and their use of [[Information technology|IT]]. He has also done much research on [[knowledge management]], and he has published a number of books on that subject, as well as books about the police. He has also worked as an advisor to the police. His research on the police and their use of information technology has resulted in his appearance in the news media when this topic has been in the news. Gottschalk also researches crime as seen from the police perspective, in particular [[organized crime]] and [[financial crime]]. In recent years, he has published many articles as well as a number of books in English about organized crime, financial crime and criminal entrepreneurship. Gottschalk was an active participant in the Norwegian public discourse about EU's [[Data Retention Directive]] in 2010 expressing his opinion that the police ought to make better use of the sources they already have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Oreld, Michael |title= - Politiet trenger ikke lagringsdirektiv |trans-title=- The police do not need the Data Retention Directive |url= http://www.idg.no/computerworld/article161438.ece |work= [[Computerworld|Computerworld Norway]] |language= Norwegian |date= March 15, 2010 |accessdate= March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''résumé''' or '''resume'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|r|ɛ|z|ʊ|ˌ|m|eɪ|,_|ˈ|r|eɪ|-|,_|ˌ|r|ɛ|z|ʊ|ˈ|m|eɪ|,_|ˌ|r|eɪ|-}} {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|r|ɛ|zj|ʊ|m|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|ʁezyme|lang}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=résumé|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9|dictionary=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a document used by a person to present their backgrounds and skills. Résumés can be used for a variety of reasons, but most often they are used to secure new employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/resume |title=Resume &amp;#124; Define Resume at Dictionary.com |website=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical résumé contains a "summary" of relevant job [[experience]] and [[education]], as its French origin implies. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a [[cover letter]] and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential [[employer]] sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to [[Screening (economics)|screen]] applicants, often followed by an [[interview]].

The [[curriculum vitae]] (CV) used for employment purposes in the UK (and in other European countries) is more akin to the résumé—a shorter, summary version of one's education and experience—than to the longer and more detailed CV that is expected in U.S. academic circles.

Generally, the résumé is substantially shorter than a CV in [[English Canada]], the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle |first=Alison |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/cs/curriculumvitae/f/cvresume.htm |title=The Difference Between a Resume and a Curriculum Vitae |website=Jobsearch.about.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, [[biodata]] is often used in place of a résumé.&lt;ref name="Sehgal2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=M. K.|title=Business Communication|year=2008|publisher=Excel Books |language=English|isbn=9788174465016|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As has been indicated above, the word résumé comes from the French word {{lang|fr|résumé}} meaning "summary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Merriam-Webster| accessdate=9 March 2015| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resume| title=resume| quote=French résumé, from past participle of résumer to resume, summarize, from Middle French resumer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is credited with the first résumé, though his "résumé" takes the form of a letter written about 1481–1482 to a potential employer, Ludovico Sforza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pratt|first1=Síofra|title=3 Lessons Every Job Seeker Can Learn from the World’s Oldest CV|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141015111116-2417166-3-lessons-every-job-seeker-can-learn-from-the-world-s-oldest-cv|publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Skills of Leonardo da Vinci|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/skills-of-da-vinci.html|website=Lettersofnote.com|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next roughly 450 years, the résumé continued to be a mere description of a person, and included their abilities and past employment. In the early 1900s, résumés listed things like weight, height, marital status, and religion. It was not until 1950 that the résumé evolved into something more than words written on scraps of paper. By then, résumés were considered very much mandatory, and started to include information like personal interests and hobbies. It was not until the 1970s, the beginning of the [[Digital Age]], that résumés took on a more professional look in terms of presentation and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-resumes-have-evolved-since-their-first-creation-in-1482-2011-2|title=The 500-Year Evolution Of The Resume|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In many contexts, a résumé is typically limited to one or two pages of size [[ISO 216|A4]] or [[Letter paper|letter-size]], highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many résumés contain [[Index term|keywords]] or [[skills]] that potential employers are looking for via [[applicant tracking system]]s, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant's name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the résumé, greater chance of being found in a computerized keyword scan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/how-to-create-an-hr-resume.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Résumés can vary in style and length, but should always contain accurate contact information of the job seeker. A recent hiring simulation by ResumeGo concluded that a two-page resume was more likely to lead to being hired than a one-page resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbsnews.com/news/your-one-page-resume-may-be-killing-your-job-search/|title=Your one-page resume may be killing your job search|last=Ivanova|first=Irina|date=|website=CBS News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A résumé is a marketing tool in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. The transmission of résumés directly to employers became increasingly popular as late as 2002. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}} Job seekers were able to circumvent the [[application for employment|job application]] process and reach employers through direct email contact and résumé blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of résumés to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of résumés to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant's chances of securing employment as the résumés tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the résumé for each position applied for and its keywords. In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a 'master résumé' document is recommended, providing job-seekers with the ability to customize a tailored résumé while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.

The complexity or simplicity of various résumé formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and to the industry. Résumés or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist's résumé, typically excluding any non-art-related employment, may include extensive lists of [[Solo exhibition|solo]] and group [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]].

==Styles==
Résumés may be organized in different ways. The following are some of the more common résumé formats:

===Reverse chronological résumé===
A reverse chronological résumé lists a candidate's job experiences in chronological order, generally covering the previous 10 to 15 years. Positions are listed with starting and ending dates. Current positions on a résumé typically list the starting date to the present. The reverse chronological résumé format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Reverse Chronological Resume Format: Focusing on Work History, Growth - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/reverse-chronological-resume-format-focusing-on-w0.html|website = Dummies.com|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly used by those who are not professional résumé writers. In using this format, the main body of the document becomes the Professional Experience section, starting from the most recent experience and moving chronologically backwards through a succession of previous experience. The reverse chronological résumé works to build credibility through experience gained, while illustrating career growth over time and filling all gaps in a career trajectory. A chronological résumé is not recommended to job seekers with gaps in their career summaries. In the United Kingdom the chronological résumé tends to extend only as far back as the applicant's [[GCSE]]/[[Standard Grade]] qualifications.

===Functional résumé===
A functional  résumé lists work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function.

The functional résumé is used to focus on skills that are specific to the type of position being sought. This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency. In contrast, the chronological résumé format will briefly highlight these competencies prior to presenting a comprehensive timeline of career growth through reverse chronological listings, with the most recent experience listed first. The functional résumé works well for those making a career change, having a varied work history or with little work experience. A functional résumé is also preferred for applications to jobs that require very specific skills or clearly defined personality traits. A functional résumé is a good method for highlighting particular skills or experiences, especially when those particular skills or experiences may have derived from a role which was held some time ago. Rather than focus on the length of time that has passed, the functional résumé allows the reader to identify those skills quickly.

===Hybrid résumé===
The hybrid résumé balances the functional and [[chronological]] approaches. A résumé organized this way typically leads with a functional list of job skills, followed by a chronological list of employers. The hybrid has a tendency to repeat itself and is, therefore, less widely used than the other two.

===Online résumés===
As the search for employment has become more electronic, it is common for employers to only accept résumés electronically, either out of practicality or preference. This has changed much about the manner in which résumés are written, read, and processed. Some career experts are pointing out that today a paper-based résumé is an exception rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print |title=To Print Or Not To Print |last=Garone |first=Liz |date=23 June 2014  | website=bbc.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many employers now find candidates' résumés through [[search engine]]s, which makes it more important for candidates to use appropriate keywords when writing a résumé. Larger employers use [[Applicant tracking system|Applicant Tracking Systems]] to search, filter, and manage high volumes of résumés. Job ads may direct applicants to email a résumé to a company or visit its website and submit a résumé in an electronic format.

Many employers, and recruitment agencies working on their behalf, insist on receiving résumés in a particular [[file format]]. Some require [[Microsoft Word]] documents, while others will only accept résumés formatted in [[HTML]], [[PDF]], or plain [[ASCII]] text.

Another consideration for electronic résumé documents is that they are parsed with [[Natural language processing|natural language processors]]. [[Resume parsing|Résumé parsers]] may correctly interpret some parts of the content of the résumé but not other parts. The best résumé parsers capture a high percentage of information regarding location, names, titles, but are less accurate with skills, industries and other less structured or rapidly changing data. Résumés written in a standard format are more likely to be correctly interpreted by résumé parsers, and thereby may make the candidate more findable.

One advantage for employers to online résumés is the significant cost saving compared to traditional hiring methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.careerjournal.com/hrcenter/weddlesguide/19990405-weddle.html |title=Career Advice, Find a Job &amp; Salary Trends - Wall Street Journal |website=Careerjournal.com |date=2002-10-03 |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that potential employers no longer have to sort through massive stacks of paper.

===Infographic, video and website résumés===
As the Internet becomes more driven by multimedia, job-seekers have sought to take advantage of the trend by moving their résumés away from the traditional paper and email media.

[[Video resume|Video]], infographic, and even [[Vine (service)|Vine]] résumés have gained popularity, though mainly in the creative and media industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-resumes-that-got-worldwide-attention-194410148.html |title=10 Resumes That Got Worldwide Attention |last=Shontell |first=Alyson |date=27 February 2013  | website=finance.yahoo.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend has attracted criticism from [[human resources management]] professionals, who warn that this may be a passing fad and point out that multimedia-based résumés may be overlooked by recruiters whose [[workflow]] is designed only to accommodate a traditional résumé format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/05/18/recruiters-tell-us-do-resume-fads-really-work/ |title=Recruiters Tell Us: Do Résumé Fads Really Work? |date=18 May 2012  | website=forbes.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Résumé evaluation==
Many résumé development agencies offer résumé evaluation services wherein they evaluate the résumé and suggest any necessary changes. Candidates are free to either do those changes themselves or may take help of the agency itself. Some career fields include a special section listing the lifelong works of the author: for computer-related fields, the [[softography]]; for musicians and composers, the [[discography]]; for actors, a [[filmography]].

Keeping résumés online has become increasingly common for people in professions that benefit from the multimedia and rich detail that are offered by an HTML résumé, such as actors, photographers, graphic designers, developers, dancers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/cv/actorcv.htm |title=How to Write an Actor's/Singer's CV | website=Kent University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Job seekers are finding an ever-increasing demand to have an electronic version of their résumé available to employers and professionals who use [[Internet recruiting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/05/07/cb.e.resume/index.html?iref=nextin |title= An E-friendly Résumé in 5 Easy Steps |last=Presely |first=Eric |date=8 May 2008  | website=cnn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online résumé distribution services have emerged to allow job seekers to distribute their résumés to numerous employers of their choice through email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/workinglife/the-future-of-the-resume/2269763 |title= The Future of the Resume|last=Burdick |first=Cody |date=17 March 2016  | website=Tampa Bay Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Résumé as one part of a personal branding mix==
In some sectors, particularly in the [[Startup company|startup]] community, use of traditional résumé has seen a consistent decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/is-the-resume-dead/article18988834/ |title=Is The Resume Dead? |last=Lawrence |first=Daina |date=5 June 2014  | website=forbes.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While standalone résumés are still used to apply for jobs, job-seekers may also view their résumés as one of a number of assets which form their [[personal branding|personal brand]] and work together to strengthen their job application. In this scenario, résumés are generally used to provide a potential employer with factual information (e.g., achievements), while the social media platforms give insight into the job-seekers' motivations and personality in development.

'''''Star Wars: Tiny Death Star''''' was a business [[simulation video game]] developed by [[Disney Mobile]] and [[NimbleBit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/disney-lucasarts-to-launch-star-wars-tiny-death-star-with-tiny-tower-creator-nimblebit-1200694453/ |title='Tiny Tower' Turns to Dark Side with 'Star Wars: Tiny Death Star' |date=2013-10-05 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Disney Mobile]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Windows Phone]], and [[Windows 8]]/[[Windows RT|RT]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a521680/star-wars-game-tiny-death-star-announced-for-ios-android.html |title='Star Wars' game 'Tiny Death Star' announced for iOS and Android |date=2013-10-07 |accessdate=2013-10-12 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on NimbleBit's previous game, ''[[Tiny Tower]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/04/tiny-death-star-announced |title=Tiny Death Star Announced |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is set in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/10/04/nimblebit-and-disney-announce-tiny-death-star.aspx |title=NimbleBit And Disney Announce Tiny Death Star |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |publisher=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars: Tiny Death Star'' was announced by [[Disney Interactive Studios]] on October 4, 2013.  It was released in Australia and New Zealand for Android devices on October 11, 2013&lt;ref name="Android release" /&gt; and in Australia for iOS devices on October 15, 2013.&lt;ref name="iOS release" /&gt;  It was released worldwide on November 8, 2013 for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Windows RT devices.

The game was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store by Disney in October 2014.

==Gameplay==
The goal is to build and expand a [[Death Star]], while attracting virtual people known as ''galactic Bitizens'' to build and run virtual businesses within the Death Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mixnmojo.com/news/Star-Wars-Tiny-Death-Star-making-its-way-to-your-mobile-soon |title=Star Wars: Tiny Death Star making its way to your mobile soon |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |publisher=[[The International House of Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currency==
The main currency is ''Imperial Credits''. Credits are made by selling products on business levels or by trading ''Imperial Bux'' in for them. Imperial Bux are used in Tiny Death Star to complete construction and product orders instantly, unlock specific floors, unlock specific species, upgrade elevators, unlock costumes, instantly recruit Bitizens into a residential level, hire ''VIP''s and earn money more quickly. Imperial Bux can be purchased by going to the ''Get Bux'' option on the main menu. Using [[Tapjoy]] offers, it is also possible to earn free Imperial Bux by completing offers such as downloading and running apps or signing up for programs.

==Unlockables==
While playing Tiny Death Star, ''Bitizens'', Levels, and Scenes are unlocked in the album. Throughout gameplay, new species of bitzens are unlocked when they appear in the elevator or are found throughout the Death Star. These bitzens are sorted into the following categories: ''Bounty Hunters'', ''Droids'', ''Men of the Rebellion'', ''Ladies of the Rebellion'', ''Rebel Heroes'', ''Rebel Aliens'', ''Outer Rim'', ''Troops'', ''Rebel Forces'', ''The Force'', ''Cantina Crew'', ''Hutt's Henchmen'', ''Limited Edition'', ''Galactic Registry Series 1'' and ''The Deep Core''.

The levels that are built to make your Death Star larger are sorted into six categories: food, service, recreation, retail, residential and imperial. Residential levels are used to house bitzens which can then be put to work making credits in the business levels. The food, service, recreation, and retail levels are built as businesses used to make credits. Credits are used to build new levels. In the businesses, a maximum of three Bitizens which reside in one of the residential floors are assigned to work. They order in products. How long the products take to arrive depends on the Bitizen's skill level at the given job. Imperial levels are used to produce ''Imperial Items'' for missions. When these missions are completed, credits are awarded. Each of the categories of business levels currently have ten possible levels to unlock. As more updates arrive, new levels will be available to unlock.

Scenes are unlocked when the elevator is used to take a specific individual (or sometimes member of a species) to a specific level.

Scene Unlocking List:

* Bounty Hunters – Any bounty hunter

* The Cantina – Han, Greedo (not Hoth Han)

==VIPs==
Apart from just the ordinary Bitizens, there are also VIPs, who randomly appear in the elevator. Up to 5 VIPs can be stored in the lobby at any one time, and they can kept for any period of time. VIPs are used to improve the Death Star. They help attract customers to your levels, complete tasks faster, move levels, upgrade levels, or even fill an entire vacant residential floor with tenants.

The "Holiday Update" (version 1.0.1.4), released on December 17, 2013, featured 'Decorator Droids'. These limited edition VIPs decorate a floor with holiday/Christmas lights. Limited edition rewards were available to those who decorated enough floors. In early January 2014 this promotion expired (decorated floors were brought back to normal) and the Decorator Droids are no longer available.

==Bugs==
When the game was originally released, one major problem was discovered: the "Negative Bux" glitch. This glitch occurs when the player uses Imperial Bux to purchase a specific level (and not a random one, which is the norm, using Imperial Credits). The result is that the player winds up with a negative balance of Bux, otherwise impossible to achieve. The player then has to balance this account before he/she can begin to accumulate Bux and purchase other goods. To make this matter worse, if a player has bought Bux, with real money, they can lose the "in-game currency" to this glitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turi|first=Tim|title=The Empire Strikes Bux: How Tiny Death Star Robbed Me|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/11/22/the-empire-strikes-bux-how-tiny-death-star-robbed-me.aspx|work=gameinformer|publisher=gameinformer|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 17, 2013, this bug has been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Izlain|title=Tiny Death Star: The Bux Bug and more|url=http://gdub4.wordpress.com/2013/11/17/tiny-death-star-the-bux-bug-and-more/|work=wordpress.com|publisher=wordpress.com|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2014, some users are reporting a new bug, where their Galactic Registry 1 bitizens have changed into random people.&lt;ref&gt;http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/182606/tiny-death-star-assignments-and-the-galactic-registry-changes&lt;/ref&gt; The Besalisk species has disappeared from the album, and existing in-game besalisk bitizens are being erroneously replaced by a character of Lando Calrissian. Cornelius Evazan's appearance has become incorrect. Imperial assignments still do not operate after a certain point early in the game, making the imperial levels mostly pointless. All of the Salvage Droids' "Possible Salvage" screens show the same panoply of ewoks instead of the correct possibilities of the currently scanned areas.

In October 2014, Disney pulled the app from the App Store and Google Play. Co-developer Nimblebit was not given notice prior to the removal. As of December 11, 2015, it is unavailable on both the Windows Store and the App Store. Disney removed the game from all app stores because they wanted to take the Star Wars games in another direction. The developer, Nimblebit, was furious at the removal of the game, because it was a high source of revenue, despite the multitude of bugs that had plagued it since its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-07-disney-removes-tiny-death-star-without-telling-the-developer&lt;/ref&gt; 

If a user had previously downloaded the game (i.e.: via GooglePlay), said user can re-download the game, despite its being unavailable. Some features  (such as the Tapjoy Bux purchasing) are disabled, but players can still tend to their Bitizens.

[[Image:Technostructure.svg|thumb|Diagram, proposed by [[Henry Mintzberg]], showing the main parts of organisation, including technostructure]]
'''Technostructure''' is the group of technicians, analysts within an [[organisation]] (enterprise, administrative body) with considerable influence and control on its economy. The term was coined by the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' (1967). It usually refers to [[managerial]] [[capitalism]] where the managers and other company leading administrators, scientists, or lawyers retain more power and influence than the shareholders in the decisional and directional process.&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith, ''The New Industrial State'', p. 71 HMCO 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The power struggle between the technostructure and the shareholders was first evoked by [[Thorstein Veblen]] in "The Theory of the Leisure Class" (1899), questioning who, among the managers and the shareholders, should control the enterprise.  At the time and until the end of the 1980s, the shareholders, unable to effectively regroup and organise themselves, could not exert enough pressure to effectively counter the managerial decision-making process.  After the Second World War, the rapid augmentation of shareholders further diluted their collective power.  This was perceived, by Galbraith, as a divorce between the property of the capital and the direction of the enterprise.

==Goals of the technostructure==
Since the technostructure is composed of an [[hierarchical]] system of influential employees inside the enterprise, its primary goal is not to maximize their profits but rather survival, continuous growth and maximal size.  While it must maintain acceptable relations with their shareholders, [[hegemonic]] growth is more beneficial to the technostructure.

According to [[Henry Mintzberg]], technostructure's influence is based on system of expertise, but technostructure gains power to the extent to which it can develop system of bureaucratic control.&lt;ref name="HenryMintzberg_1983_134-137psl"&gt;[[Henry Mintzberg]], "Power In and Around Organizations", [[Prentice Hall]], 1983, p. 134-137 [http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=134841&amp;silo_library=GEN01]&lt;/ref&gt; Strong [[organisation's ideology]] decreases the need for bureaucratic control and technostructure.&lt;ref name="HenryMintzberg_1983_134-137psl"/&gt; Thus technostructure usually resists development and maintenance of organisational ideology.&lt;ref name="HenryMintzberg_1983_134-137psl"/&gt;

As the structures of control and adaptation that the technostructure designs are more necessary when something changes, technostructure is in favour of constant change.&lt;ref name="HenryMintzberg_1983_134-137psl"/&gt; That happens even if they are not useful for the organisation itself.&lt;ref name="HenryMintzberg_1983_134-137psl"/&gt; On the other hand, Mintzberg thinks that such changes tend to be cautious, as technostructure tries to standartise the work of all other parts of the organisation, and major changes make that harder.&lt;ref name="HenryMintzberg_1983_134-137psl"/&gt;

Among [[organisation's goals]] technostructure prefers the ones that are operational, measurable, as they make it easiest to demonstrate the usefulness of bureaucratic control.&lt;ref name="HenryMintzberg_1983_134-137psl"/&gt; Among those goals, technostructure prefers the ones related to efficiency, economical goals.&lt;ref name="HenryMintzberg_1983_134-137psl"/&gt;

==Decline of the technostructure==
The lack of control of the technostructure resulted in managerial abuse notably on its salaries during the economic crisis of the 1970s.  It prompted support for new economic [[ideologies]] like the [[Chicago school (economics)|School of Chicago]] under [[Milton Friedman]].  Furthermore, the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 forced a much greater transparency from businesses and possible opposition to their decisions.  In the 1980s, the rising and influential [[neoliberal]] ideology decried the ''divorce'' between the capital and the decisions.  Based on the belief of a new emerging economy, neoliberal economic theories were introduced at the end of the 1980s forcing managerial capitalism to yield to the shareholders.

==Results==
The prime objective of the neoliberal economic theories is the maximization of the profits in order to maximize stock value.  This, quite evidently, greatly differed from the objectives of the technostructure which caused massive restructuring in the 1990s.  In order to maximize profits, enterprises now had to take draconian measures to cut expenses and ensure profits for the shareholders.  This greatly encouraged the exportation of manual or simple tasks to foreign countries where labour is much less expensive and caused massive layoffs in developed countries.  Likewise, it reduced salaries and caused a decline in income of the working class. Paradoxically, the salaries of the managers increased and the constant demand for profits played an important role in the [[accounting scandals]] in 2002.

'''''The Big Book of Social Media: Case Studies, Stories, Perspectives''''', released in November 2010 by Yorkshire Publishing, is a compilation of [[non-fiction]] articles and chapters written by social media experts in their respective fields and edited by Robert Fine, organizer of the Cool Social Conferences World Tour and founder of Cool Blue Press, with a foreword by Sam Feist, political director for [[CNN]].

'''Viarco - Indústria de Lápis, Lda.''' is a Portuguese pencil manufacturer in [[São João da Madeira]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]].&lt;ref name="viarcohistoryPT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viarco.pt/versao01/versao_uk/main_uk.htm |title=VIARCO - Company's History |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work=VIARCO - Pencil Industry |publisher=Viarco - Indústria de Lápis, Lda |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116023714/http://viarco.pt/versao01/versao_uk/main_uk.htm |archivedate=November 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=9 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the oldest pencil manufacturers in [[Europe]].

== History ==

'''Origins'''

The origin of pencil manufacture in Portugal dates back to 1907. Counselor Figueiredo Faria and his French partner and engineer Jules Cacheux make the decision to build an industrial pencil-making unit called Vila Fé, Cacheux &amp; Cª, also known as Portugália

However, despite Portugália's success, its economic activity was greatly affected by Portugal's entry into World War I beyond the Great Depression from 1929 to 1931.

'''A new beginning'''

The history of this Portuguese company had its turning point in 1931. Manoel Vieira de Araújo, an experienced industrialist in the headwear area and a notable entrepreneur from São João da Madeira [1], with the aim of expanding the company '''Vi'''eira '''Ar'''aújo &amp; '''Co'''mopania, Lda, acquires the factory Portugália. Portugália was, to date, the only Portuguese pencil factory.

In 1936, the Viarco brand was registered, current name of the Portuguese company.

'''First decade'''

The management of the company was delivered to Antonio Vieira Araújo, son of Manoel Vieira Araújo. The objectives were to stimulate and renew this pencil-making industry.

Thus, the early years of the Viarco factory were dedicated to research, application of forms, renovation of facilities and improvement of production methods, in order to develop the manufacture of existing products as well as to extend the diversity of the manufacture of material.

In 1941, the factory facilities are moved from Vila do Conde, Porto to São João da Madeira, Aveiro. São João da Madeira was also the location of the headquarters of the company Vieira Araújo &amp; Cª, Lda. Many employees of the Vila do Conde factory also made the decision to move to the new location of the industry.

== Products ==
Viarco's factory manufactures various products ranging from [[office]] and [[school]] material to [[professional]] [[drawing]] and [[watercolour]]ing material. It also makes personalized pencils for [[companies]], [[museums]] and [[retail|shops]].

One of Viarco's most original products are its [[scented]] pencils, which include the collection ''Quintas e Jardins de Portugal'' ("Villas and gardens of Portugal"). Another example is Viarco's ''Art Graf'' collection.

In the [[foreign exchange market]] and [[international finance]], a '''world currency''', '''supranational currency''', or '''global currency''' is a [[currency]] that is transacted internationally, with no set borders.

==Historical and current world==

===Spanish dollar (17th – 18th centuries)===
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the use of silver [[Spanish dollar]]s or "pieces of eight" spread from the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish territories in the Americas]] westwards to [[Asia]] and eastwards to [[Europe]], forming the first worldwide currency.&lt;ref name="Woodcock2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray Woodcock|title=Globalization from Genesis to Geneva: A Confluence of Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_75TAjONToC|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4251-8853-5|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas J. Osborne|title=Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvA3jL4CFCMC|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=29 November 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-29217-4|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's political supremacy on the world stage, the importance of Spanish commercial routes across the [[Atlantic]] and the [[Pacific]], and the coin's quality and purity of silver helped it become internationally accepted for over two centuries. It was legal tender in [[Spain]]'s Pacific territories of the [[Philippines]], [[Micronesia]], [[Guam]] and the [[Caroline Islands]] and later in [[China]] and other [[Southeast Asian]] countries until the mid-19th century. In the [[Americas]] it was legal tender in all of [[Latin America|South and Central America]] (except [[Brazil]]) and in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]] until the mid-19th century. In Europe the Spanish dollar was legal tender in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in most of [[Italy]] including: [[Milan]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], Sicily, [[Sardinia]], the [[Franche-Comté]] ([[France]]), and in the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. It was also used in other European states including the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg]] territories.

===Gold standard (19th – 20th centuries)===
{{unsourced-section|date=April 2013}}
{{main|Gold standard}}
Prior to and during most of the 19th century, international trade was denominated in terms of currencies that represented weights of gold. Most national currencies at the time were in essence merely different ways of measuring gold weights (much as the yard and the meter both measure length and are related by a constant conversion factor). Hence some assert that gold was the world's first global currency. The emerging collapse of the international gold standard around the time of World War I had significant implications for global trade.

===Pound sterling===
Before 1944, the world reference currency was the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[pound sterling]]. The transition between pound sterling and United States dollar and its impact for central banks was described recently.&lt;ref&gt; "[http://cneh09.dal.ca/Schenk_CNEH.pdf The Retirement of Sterling as a Reserve Currency after 1945: Lessons for the US Dollar ?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709043223/http://cneh09.dal.ca/Schenk_CNEH.pdf |date=9 July 2011 }}", Catherine R. Schenk, Canadian Network for Economic History conference,10/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period following the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] of 1944, [[exchange rate]]s around the world were [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the [[United States dollar]], which could be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold. This reinforced the dominance of the US dollar as a global currency.

Since the collapse of the [[fixed exchange rate]] regime and the [[gold standard]] and the institution of [[floating exchange rate]]s following the [[Smithsonian Agreement]] in 1971, most currencies around the world have no longer been pegged to the United States dollar. However, as the United States has the world's largest economy, most international transactions continue to be conducted with the United States dollar, and it has remained the ''de facto'' world currency. According to [[Robert Gilpin]] in ''Global Political Economy: Understanding the International Economic Order'' (2001): "Somewhere between 40 and 60 percent of international financial transactions are denominated in dollars. For decades the dollar has also been the world's principal reserve currency; in 1996, the dollar accounted for approximately two-thirds of the world's foreign exchange reserves", as compared to about one-quarter held in euros (see [[Reserve Currency]]).

Some of the world's currencies are still pegged to the dollar. Some countries, such as Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama, have gone even further and eliminated their own currency (see [[dollarization]]) in favor of the United States dollar.

Only two serious challengers to the status of the United States dollar as a world currency have arisen. During the 1980s, the [[Japanese yen]] became increasingly used as an international currency,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/markets-forex-yen-idUST24254120080313|title=CHRONOLOGY – Milestones in the yen's history|last=|first=|date=13 March 2008|website=Reuters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507133100/https://www.reuters.com/article/markets-forex-yen-idUST24254120080313|archive-date=7 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but that usage diminished with the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Japanese recession]] in the 1990s. More recently, the euro has increasingly competed with the United States dollar in international finance.

===Euro===
The [[euro]] inherited its status as a major reserve currency from the [[German mark]] (DM) and its contribution to official reserves has increased as banks seek to diversify their reserves and trade in the [[eurozone]] expands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2006/wp06153.pdf |work=IMF Working Paper |department=Statistics Department |title=The Euro’s Challenge to the Dollar |first1=Ewe-Ghee |last=Lim |date=June 2006 |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]] |editor-first=Armida |editor-last=San Jose |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617EYHwjs?url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2006/wp06153.pdf |archivedate=22 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the dollar, some of the world's currencies are pegged against the euro. They are usually Eastern European currencies like the [[Bulgarian lev]], plus several west African currencies like the [[Cape Verdean escudo]] and the [[CFA franc]]. Other European countries, while not being EU members, have adopted the euro due to currency unions with member states, or by unilaterally superseding their own currencies: Andorra, Monaco, Kosovo, Montenegro, San Marino, and Vatican City.

{{As of|2006|12}}, the euro surpassed the dollar in the combined value of cash in circulation. The value of euro notes in circulation has risen to more than €610 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], equivalent to US$800&amp;nbsp;billion at the exchange rates at the time. A 2016 report by the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] shows that the world's energy, food and services trade are made 60% with US dollar and 40% by euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/18338034-95ec-11db-9976-0000779e2340.html|title=Subscribe to read|author=|date=|website=Financial Times|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817215700/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/18338034-95ec-11db-9976-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=17 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese renminbi ===
As a result of the rapid [[internationalization of the renminbi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,741303,00.html |title=China Plans Path to Economic Hegemony |first=Wieland |last=Wagner |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=26 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516051550/http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,741303,00.html |archivedate=16 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/7075 |title=The rise of the renminbi as international currency: Historical precedents |work=[[Voxeu.org]] |first=Jeffrey |last=Frankel |authorlink=Jeffrey Frankel |date=10 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519095844/http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node%2F7075 |archivedate=19 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2013 it was the world's 8th most widely traded currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RMB now 8th most traded currency in the world|url=http://www.swift.com/about_swift/shownews?param_dcr=news.data/en/swift_com/2013/PR_RMB_september.xml|publisher=[[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]]|accessdate=10 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105223715/http://www.swift.com/about_swift/shownews?param_dcr=news.data%2Fen%2Fswift_com%2F2013%2FPR_RMB_september.xml|archivedate=5 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of November, 2015, the Chinese renminbi was designated as one of the world's global currencies, and became one of the currency in the [[currency basket]] known as special drawing rights.

===Recent proposals (21st century)===
====Governmental====
On 16 March 2009, in connection with the [[2009 G-20 London summit|April 2009 G20 summit]], the [[Kremlin]] called for a supranational reserve currency as part of a reform of the [[global financial system]]. In a document containing proposals for the G20 meeting, it suggested that the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) (or an Ad Hoc Working Group of G20) should be instructed to carry out specific studies to review the following options:

* Enlargement (diversification) of the list of currencies used as reserve ones, based on agreed measures to promote the development of major regional financial centers. In this context, we should consider possible establishment of specific regional mechanisms which would contribute to reducing volatility of exchange rates of such reserve currencies.
* Introduction of a supra-national reserve currency to be issued by international financial institutions. It seems appropriate to consider the role of IMF in this process and to review the feasibility of and the need for measures to ensure the recognition of SDRs as a "supra-reserve" currency by the whole world community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/docs/2009/03/213995.shtml Russian Proposals to the London Summit (April 2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321062847/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/docs/2009/03/213995.shtml |date=21 March 2009 }} Kremlin website. 16 March 2009.

On 24 March 2009, [[Zhou Xiaochuan]], President of the [[People's Bank of China]], called for "creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency," believing it would "significantly reduce the risks of a future crisis and enhance crisis management capability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7961106.stm China presses G20 reform plans.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327130848/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7961106.stm |date=27 March 2009 }} BBC News, 24 March 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou suggested that the IMF's [[special drawing rights]] (a currency basket comprising dollars, euros, renminbi, yen, and [[Pound sterling|sterling]]) could serve as a super-sovereign reserve currency, not easily influenced by the policies of individual countries. [[Barack Obama|US President Obama]], however, rejected the suggestion stating that "the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j6YzcXlgBTn1fLXu1iFIFS3vIkNQ Obama rejects China's call for new global currency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530154313/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j6YzcXlgBTn1fLXu1iFIFS3vIkNQ |date=30 May 2013 }}.

At the G8 summit in July 2009, the Russian president expressed Russia's desire for a new supranational reserve currency by showing off a coin minted with the words "unity in diversity". The coin, an example of a future world currency, emphasized his call for creating a mix of regional currencies as a way to address the global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Pronina |first=Lyubov |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aeFVNYQpByU4 |title=Medvedev Shows Off Sample Coin of New ‘World Currency’ at G-8 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613163056/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |archivedate=13 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2009, at the Second [[Summit of South American-Arab Countries|South America-Arab League Summit]] in Qatar, Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]] proposed the creation of a petro-currency. It would be backed by the huge oil reserves of the oil producing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-03-31-petro-currency_N.htm|title=Chavez to seek Arab backing for 'petro-currency' – USATODAY.com|author=|date=|website=www.usatoday.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026005704/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-03-31-petro-currency_N.htm|archivedate=26 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single world currency==
{{seealso|Geary–Khamis dollar}}
An alternative definition of a world or global currency refers to a hypothetical single global currency or ''supercurrency'', as the proposed [[Terra (currency)|terra]] or the DEY (acronym for Dollar Euro Yen),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundthemidnightcry.com/life_church_of_lafayette_/2008/10/theres-a-new-dey-coming.html|title=“There’s A New ‘Dey’ Coming!” - Sound The Midnight Cry|author=|date=|website=www.soundthemidnightcry.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602235218/http://www.soundthemidnightcry.com/life_church_of_lafayette_/2008/10/theres-a-new-dey-coming.html|archivedate=2 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  produced and supported by a [[central bank]] which is used for ''all'' transactions around the world, regardless of the nationality of the entities (individuals, corporations, governments, or other organizations) involved in the transaction. No such official currency currently exists.

Advocates, notably [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]],&lt;ref name="singleglobalcurrency.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.singleglobalcurrency.org/related.html |title=related sites |publisher=Singleglobalcurrency.org |accessdate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804051634/http://www.singleglobalcurrency.org/related.html |archivedate=4 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a global currency often argue that such a currency would not suffer from inflation, which, in extreme cases, has had disastrous effects for economies. In addition, many&lt;ref name="singleglobalcurrency.org" /&gt; argue that a single global currency would make conducting international business more efficient and would encourage [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI).

There are many different variations of the idea, including a possibility that it would be administered by a global [[central bank]] that would define its own [[monetary standard]] or that it would be on the [[gold standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_05/wallenwein070805.html|title=A Single  Global Currency? – Gold Eagle|author=|date=|website=www.gold-eagle.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034811/http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_05/wallenwein070805.html|archivedate=24 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters often point to the euro as an example of a supranational currency successfully{{dubious|date=March 2014}} implemented by a union of nations with disparate languages, cultures, and economies.

A limited alternative would be a world reserve currency issued by the [[International Monetary Fund]], as an evolution of the existing [[special drawing rights]] and used as reserve assets by all national and regional central banks. On 26 March 2009, a UN panel of expert economists called for a new global currency reserve scheme to replace the current US dollar-based system. The panel's report pointed out that the "greatly expanded SDR (special drawing rights), with regular or cyclically adjusted emissions calibrated to the size of reserve accumulations, could contribute to global stability, economic strength and global equity."&lt;ref name="un_panel"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPdAL1QnNnYKQE69vdeq63KqSTng UN panel touts new global currency reserve system.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627191344/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPdAL1QnNnYKQE69vdeq63KqSTng |date=27 June 2013 }} AFP, 26 March 2009.

Another world currency was proposed  to use conceptual currency to aid the transaction between countries. The basic idea is to utilize the balance of trade to cancel out the currency actually needed to trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldcurrency.quora.com/World-currency-a-different-proposal-1|title=World currency, a different proposal – world currency – Quora|last=Zhong|first=Dale|date=|website=worldcurrency.quora.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309124620/https://worldcurrency.quora.com/World-currency-a-different-proposal-1|archive-date=9 March 2016|dead-url=no|access-date=2016-01-28|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the idea of a single world currency, some evidence suggests the world may evolve multiple global currencies that exchange on a singular market system. The rise of digital global currencies owned by privately held companies or groups such as [[Ven (currency)|Ven]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/fortune/1007/gallery.Alternate_Currency.fortune/4.html |title=The dollar alternatives&amp;nbsp;– Ven (4)&amp;nbsp;– FORTUNE |publisher=CNN |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206125920/http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/fortune/1007/gallery.Alternate_Currency.fortune/4.html |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that multiple global currencies may offer wider formats for trade as they gain strength and wider acceptance.

[[Blockchain]] offers the possibility that a decentralized system that works with little human intervention could eliminate squabbling over who would administer the world central bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-07-01/how-about-a-global-currency-|title=How About a Global Currency?|author=|date=1 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119020958/https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-07-01/how-about-a-global-currency-|archivedate=19 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==
===Limited additional benefit with extra cost===
Some economists argue that a single world currency is unnecessary, because the U.S. dollar is providing many of the benefits of a world currency while avoiding some of the costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/02-aug/p32forward.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205145243/http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/02-aug/p32forward.html |date=5 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the world does not form an [[optimum currency area]], then it would be economically inefficient for the world to share one currency.

===Economically incompatible nations===
In the present world, nations are not able to work together closely enough to be able to produce and support a common currency. There has to be a high level of trust between different countries before a true world currency could be created. A world currency might even undermine national sovereignty of smaller states.

===Wealth redistribution===
The interest rate set by the central bank indirectly determines the interest rate customers must pay on their bank loans. This interest rate affects the rate of interest among individuals, investments, and countries. Lending to the poor involves more risk than lending to the rich. As a result of the larger differences in wealth in different areas of the world, a central bank's ability to set interest rate to make the area prosper will be increasingly compromised, since it places wealthiest regions in conflict with the poorest regions in debt.

===Usury===
[[Usury]]&amp;nbsp;– the accumulation of interest on loan principal&amp;nbsp;– is prohibited by the texts of some major religions. In Christianity and Judaism, adherents are forbidden to charge interest to other adherents or to the poor ([[Leviticus]] 25:35–38; [[Deuteronomy]] 23:19). Islam forbids usury, known in Arabic as [[riba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/usury.htm |title=The facts about usury : Why Islam is against lending money at interest |publisher=Mustaqim.co.uk |accessdate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721203741/http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/usury.htm |archivedate=21 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some religious adherents who oppose the paying of interest are currently able to use banking facilities in their countries which regulate interest. An example of this is the [[Islamic banking]] system, which is characterized by a nation's central bank setting interest rates for most other transactions.{{fact|date=September 2012}}
