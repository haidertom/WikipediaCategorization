In [[futures studies]] and the [[history of technology]], '''accelerating change''' is a perceived increase in the rate of [[technological change]] throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., 2018. On the future: prospects for humanity. Princeton: Princeton University Press &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Early observations ==
In 1910 during the town planning conference of London [[Daniel Burnham]] noted that "But it is not merely in the number of facts or sorts of knowledge that progress lies: it is still more in the geometric ratio of sophistication, in the [[geometric growth|geometric widening]] of the sphere of knowledge, which every year is taking in a larger percentage of people as time goes on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on  "It is the argument with which I began, that a mighty change having come about in fifty years, and our pace of development having immensely accelerated, our sons and grandsons are going to demand and get results that would stagger us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Buckminster Fuller]] introduced the word [[ephemeralization]] to describe the trends of "doing more with less" in chemistry, health and other areas of [[industrial development]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Nine Chains to the Moon]]'', [[Southern Illinois University Press]] [1938] 1963 pp.&amp;nbsp;276–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, Fuller published a chart of the discoveries of the chemical elements over time to highlight the development of accelerating acceleration in human knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)]]'', http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/f1903.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] wrote in reference to a conversation with [[John von Neumann]]: {{quote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&lt;ref name="mathematical"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hbWcxTGsyU09HSTg/edit?pli=1 | last=Ulam|first=Stanislaw |title=Tribute to John von Neumann|publisher=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume= 64, nr 3, part 2|date=May 1958|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Moravec's ''Mind Children''==
In a series of published articles from 1974–1979, and then in his 1988 book ''Mind Children'', computer scientist and futurist [[Hans Moravec]] generalizes [[Moore's law]] to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moore's law describes an [[exponential growth]] pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| date=1998| volume=1| title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| archivedate=15 June 2006| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| title= The Age of Robots|date=June 1993| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060615055406/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| archivedate= 15 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| title=Robot Predictions Evolution| first=Hans| last=Moravec|date=April 2004| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616045535/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| archivedate= 16 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind'', published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving [[robot intelligence]], generalizing [[Moore's Law]] to technologies predating the [[integrated circuit]], and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, he speculates about a coming "mind fire"  of rapidly expanding [[superintelligence]] similar to the [[intelligence explosion|explosion of intelligence]] predicted by Vinge.

== James Burke's ''Connections'' ==
{{Main|Connections (TV series)}}

In his TV series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' (1978)&amp;mdash;and sequels ''Connections²'' (1994) and ''Connections³'' (1997)&amp;mdash;[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

Burke also explores three corollaries to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events we weren't even aware of at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly change itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

== Gerald Hawkins' ''Mindsteps'' ==

In his book "Mindsteps to the Cosmos" (HarperCollins, August 1983), [[Gerald Hawkins|Gerald S. Hawkins]] elucidated his notion of 'mindsteps', dramatic and irreversible changes to [[paradigms]] or world views. He identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these "new world views": the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, radio, TV, computer... "Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos." He noted: "The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration." Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two further, successively closer mindsteps in 2045 and 2051, until the limit of the series in 2053. His speculations ventured beyond the technological:

{{quote|The mindsteps... appear to have certain things in common - a new and unfolding human perspective, related inventions in the area of memes and communications, and a long formulative waiting period before the next mindstep comes along. None of the mindsteps can be said to have been truly anticipated, and most were resisted at the early stages. In looking to the future we may equally be caught unawares. We may have to grapple with the presently inconceivable, with mind-stretching discoveries and concepts.}}

==Vinge's exponentially accelerating change==
The mathematician [[Vernor Vinge]] popularized his ideas about exponentially accelerating technological change in the science fiction novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' (1986), set in a world of rapidly accelerating progress leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. His subsequent [[Hugo award]]-winning novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992) starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a [[superintelligence]] passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], almost [[omnipotent]] power unfathomable by mere humans. His already mentioned influential 1993 paper on the [[technological singularity]] compactly summarizes the basic ideas.

==Kurzweil's ''The Law of Accelerating Returns''{{anchor|The Law of Accelerating Returns|Law of Accelerating Returns}}==

In his 1999 book ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', [[Ray Kurzweil]] proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kurzweil, ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', Viking, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA630#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns ''The Law of Accelerating Returns'']. [[Ray Kurzweil]], March 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Kurzweil, after Moravec, argued for extending Moore's Law to describe [[exponential growth]] of diverse forms of [[technology|technological]] progress.  Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such [[paradigm shift]]s have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history." He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a [[technological singularity]] will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045. The essay begins:

{{quote|An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century—it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the Singularity—technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.}}

[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moore's Law expanded to other technologies]]
[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|right|200px|An updated version of Moore's Law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]
The Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of [[Moore's law]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many [[futurist]]s still use the term "Moore's law" to describe ideas like those put forth by Moravec, Kurzweil and others.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of [[evolution]], more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (i.e. intentionally design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, i.e. [[language]], numbers, written language, [[philosophy]], [[scientific method]], instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers, each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on his views in his books ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

==Criticisms==
Examples of large human "buy-ins" into technology include the [[computer revolution]], as well as massive government projects like the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. The foundation organizing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] believes [[aging research]] could be the subject of such a massive project if substantial progress is made in slowing or reversing [[cellular aging]] in mice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Both [[Theodore Modis]] and Jonathan Huebner have argued—each from different perspectives—that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Korotayev A.

In fact, "[[technological singularity]]" is just one of a few singularities detected through the analysis of a number of characteristics of the [[World Systems Theory|World System]] development, for example, with respect to the [[world population]], world GDP, and some other economic indices.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Johansen, A., and D.

&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] pattern of the world demographic, economic, cultural, urbanistic, and technological growth (observed for many centuries, if not millennia prior to the 1970s) could be accounted for by a rather simple mechanism, the nonlinear second-order [[positive feedback]], that was shown long ago to generate precisely the [[hyperbolic growth]], known also as the "blow-up regime" (implying just [[finite-time singularities]]). In our case this nonlinear second order positive feedback looks as follows: more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth – the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth grows faster – faster [[population growth]] – more people – more potential inventors  – faster technological growth, and so on. On the other hand, this research has shown that since the 1970s the World System  does not develop hyperbolically any more, its development diverges more and more from the blow-up regime, and at present it is moving "from singularity", rather than "toward singularity".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] calls the Singularity "[[Omega]]", referring to [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s [[Omega Point]] (1916). For Omega = 2040, he says the series Omega - 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; human lifetimes (n &lt; 10; one lifetime = 80 years) roughly matches the most important events in [[human history]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7953">'''The Al Baydha Project''', in rural, [[Hejaz|western Saudi Arabia]], is a [[land restoration]], poverty-alleviation, and heritage preservation program, based on principles of [[permaculture|permacultural]] and [[Hydrology (agriculture)|hydrological]] design.  Located roughly 50 kilometers (20 miles) south of [[Mecca]], in [[Makkah Province]], Al Baydha is an area characterized by the rocky, arid, [[foothills]] of the [[Hijaz Mountains]]. [[Bedouin]] tribes are the major residents of this region.&lt;ref&gt;https://permacultureglobal.org/projects/286-al-baydha-project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2010/11/18/permaculture-in-mecca/|title=Permaculture in Mecca - The Permaculture Research Institute|date=18 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2009, and led by permaculturist Neal Spackman&lt;ref&gt;http://permacultureglobal.org/users/1234-neal-spackman&lt;/ref&gt; and Co-Founder Mona Hamdy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_8EfVXP1KE|title=In Dialogue with: Mona Hamdy @ NOVUS 2016|first=|last=kharecom|date=23 January 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thnk.org/people-of-thnk/person/mona-hamdy/|title=Mona Hamdy - THNK School of Creative Leadership|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Al Baydha has begun to see practical and [[restoration ecology|ecological]] results ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it4ru0HvrfE shown here]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2011/01/14/permaculture-at-the-al-baydha-project-in-saudi-arabia-neal-spackman-video-1/|title=Permaculture at the Al-Baydha Project in Saudi Arabia - Neal Spackman, Video 1 - The Permaculture Research Institute|date=14 January 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notably, Al Baydha's emphasis is on creating an economy for the inhabitants of Al Baydha that is socially, culturally, environmentally, and economically sustainable. The project's main objective is to create financial and social independence for the inhabitants by training, educating and employing them in the infrastructure and capacity building activities undertaken by the Al Baydha Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wondros.com/5d/albaydha/&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Baydha's environmental goal is the reversal of desertification. This is accomplished largely via [[rainwater harvesting]], through utilization of rock [[terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] and [[gabion]]s (or small [[check dam]]s), as well as catchment of [[surface runoff|runoff]] into [[swale (landform)|swale]] lines.  These support [[afforestation]] of [[drought tolerance|drought-resistant]] trees, such as [[date palm]]s, in the [[natural landscape]].  Another focus of the program is on slowing down [[flash flood]]s in the highlands, and, over time, converting them into seasonal streams or [[wadi]]s, as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdlI-7HO2vI shown here].  In the long-term future, Al Baydha hopes to transform the region into a [[savanna|savanna ecosystem]], in part, by means of [[assisted natural regeneration]], [[conservation grazing]], and the effects of [[evapotranspiration]] and atmospheric [[moisture recycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2012/11/09/planting-days-are-here-al-baydha-saudi-arabia/|title=Planting Days Are Here!

In 2016, the Al Baydha Project received a commendation from HRH Prince [[Khaled Al Faisal]] for innovative work undertaken by the inhabitants of Al Baydha as a model of national excellence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qREss_eycV0|title=لقاء الامير خالد الفيصل في برنامج المختصر|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in humanitarianism, sustainability, and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbc.net/ar/programs/mbc-news/articles/%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88--%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%87---%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B0.html|title=الرئيسية - MBC.net|website=www.mbc.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Wadi Rum Consultancy|similar project]], overseen by permaculturist [[Geoff Lawton]] (who advised on the design of Al Baydha), has already achieved success in [[Wadi Rum]], in southern [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2014/02/01/desert-oasis-4-years-jordan/|title=From Desert to Oasis in 4 Years|date=1 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"''' is a common English-language proverb of Welsh origin. It espouses the [[Traditional knowledge|folk-wisdom]] that [[apple]] consumption (or consumption of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] in general) has identifiable health benefits.

==Origin==
First recorded in the 1860s, the proverb originated in [[Wales]], and was particularly prevalent in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The original wording of the saying was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread." The current phrasing, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", began usage at the end of the 19th century, &lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/history-behind-an-apple-a-day/2013/09/24/aac3e79c-1f0e-11e3-94a2-6c66b668ea55_story.html | title=History behind ‘An apple a day’ | work=Washington Post | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=5 December 2015 | author=Ely, Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An apple a day keeps the doctor away|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkif_tTGtk}}&lt;/ref&gt; early print examples found as early as 1899.&lt;ref name="CtryGtlmn"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Google Books Search Results|url=https://www.google.ru/search?tbs=sbd%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1910&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22an+apple+a+day%22|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background for the proverb was that at bedtime it was served either a fried apple filled with [[caraway]] seeds or a fresh apple with caraway seeds stuck in the apple.&lt;ref name="Borgen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Annemarta  Borgen |title=Urtehagen på Knatten |date=1973 |publisher=Gyldendal |isbn=8205060118 |pages=37-38 |url=https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007071701094;page=38 |language=Norwegian |chapter=Innenlandske ville kryddurter: Karve |quote=Opprinnelsen til ordspråket om at "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" er at ved sengetid ble det før servert enten et stekt eple fylt med karve eller et friskt gjennomstukket med karve. Eplet var der for at folk skulle få mest mulig karve i seg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Caraway was considered very healthy and the apple was a way to eat as much caraway as possible.&lt;ref name="Borgen"/&gt;

==Scientific evaluation==
A 2011 study found that consumption of apples and pears might prevent [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; A 2012 study found that apple consumption significantly lowered [[bad cholesterol]] levels in middle-aged adults.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; In 2013, the ''BMJ'' published a study as part of its humorous Christmas issue comparing the effects of prescribing everyone in the UK over age 50 either an apple or a [[statin]] a day. The study concluded that both interventions would be similarly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=A. D. M.|last2=Mizdrak|first2=A.|last3=Scarborough|first3=P.|title=A statin a day keeps the doctor away: comparative proverb assessment modelling study|journal=BMJ|date=17 December 2013|volume=347|issue=dec17 2|pages=f7267–f7267|doi=10.1136/bmj.f7267|lay-url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/18/255219148/an-apple-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away-and-statins-do-too}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2015 study looked directly at the relationship between apple consumption and physician visits and found no evidence that the proverb was true. The study did, however, find that people who ate an apple a day did use fewer prescription medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Bynum|first2=Julie P. W.|last3=Sirovich|first3=Brenda E.|title=Association Between Apple Consumption and Physician Visits|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|date=1 May 2015|volume=175|issue=5|pages=777|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.5466|lay-url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/does-an-apple-a-day-really-keep-the-doctor-away/|pmc=4420713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2011 study found that adding one ‘[[Golden Delicious]]’ apple to the daily diet of a small group of overweight men led to higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The results were attributed to the higher sugar and low-phenolic content of ‘Golden Delicious’ apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/04/gardens-truth-about-apples-james-wong | title=Gardens: the truth about apples | work=The Guardian | date=4 October 2015 | accessdate=16 April 2016 | author=James, Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">{{About|the property of two-dimensional objects|computer storage comparisons|Areal density (computer storage)|other uses|Density (disambiguation)}}

The '''areal density''' (also known as '''area density''', '''surface density''', '''superficial density''', or '''density thickness''') of a two-dimensional object is calculated as the [[mass]] per unit [[area]]. The [[SI]] derived unit is: [[kilogram]] per square metre (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In the paper and fabric industries, it is called [[grammage]] and is expressed in grams per square meter (gsm); for paper in particular, it may be expressed as pounds per [[paper ream|ream]] of standard sizes ("basis ream").

== Formulation ==
It can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_A = \frac {m} {A} &lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_A = \rho \cdot l&lt;/math&gt;

where,
:{|
|-
|''{{math|ρ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}}'' || = average area density
|-
|''{{math|m}}''             || = total mass of the object
|-
|''{{math|A}}''             || = total area of the object
|-
|''{{math|ρ}}''             || = average [[density]]
|-
|''{{math|l}}''             || = average thickness of the object
|}

== Column density ==
A special type of area density is called '''column (mass) density''' (also '''columnar mass density'''), denoted ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; or ''σ''. It is the [[mass]] of [[chemical substance|substance]] per unit [[area]] [[integral|integrated]] along a path;&lt;ref name="Boeker_vanGrondelle2000"&gt;
{{cite book
 |author1=Egbert Boeker |author2=Rienk van Grondelle | title=Environmental Physics 
 | edition=2nd
 | year=2000
 | publisher=Wiley
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is obtained integrating [[density|volumetric density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; over a column:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Visconti | first1 = Guido | title = Fundamentals of physics and chemistry of the atmosphere | year = 2001 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin  | isbn = 978-3-540-67420-7 | pages = 470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\int \rho \; \operatorname{d}s.&lt;/math&gt;

In general the integration path can be slant or oblique incidence (as in, for example, [[line of sight propagation]] in [[atmospheric physics]]). A common special case is a vertical path, from the bottom to the top of the medium:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int \rho \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth).

Columnar density &lt;math&gt;\rho_A&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to the vertically averaged volumetric density &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho} = \frac{\rho_A}{\Delta z},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta z = \int 1 \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;; notice that &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho_A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; have units of, for example, grams per cubic metre, grams per square metre, and metres, respectively.

=== Column number density ===
'''Column number density''' refers instead to a [[number density]] type of quantity: the number or count of a substance—rather than the mass—per unit area integrated along a path:
:&lt;math&gt;N = \int n \; \operatorname{d}s.&lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==

===Atmospheric physics===
It is a quantity commonly retrieved by [[remote sensing]] instruments, for instance the [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]] (TOMS) which retrieves ozone columns around the globe.  Columns are also returned by the [[differential absorption spectroscopy|differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS)]] method&lt;ref name="Sinreich_etal2008"&gt;

A closely related concept is that of ice or [[liquid water path]], which specifies the volume per unit area or depth instead of mass per unit area, thus the two are related:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\sigma}{\rho_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

Another closely related concept is [[optical depth]].

===Astronomy===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}

In Astronomy the column density is generally used to indicate the number of atoms or molecules per square cm (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) along the line of sight in a particular direction, as derived from observations of e.g. the 21-cm [[hydrogen line]] or from observations of a certain molecular species. Also the [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]] can be related to the column density of H or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Column+Density&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept of area density can be useful when analysing [[accretion disk]]s. In the case of a disk seen face-on, area density for a given area of the disk is defined as column density: that is, either as the [[mass]] of [[chemical substance|substance]] per unit [[area]] [[integral|integrated]] along the vertical path that goes through the disk [[Sightline|(line-of-sight)]], from the bottom to the top of the medium:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int \rho \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth), or as the number or count of a substance—rather than the mass—per unit area integrated along a path (column number density):

:&lt;math&gt;N = \int n \; \operatorname{d}z.&lt;/math&gt;

===Data storage media===
{{Main article|Areal density (computer storage)}}
Areal density is used to quantify and compare different types media used in data storage devices such as [[hard disk drives]], [[optical disc|optical disc drives]] and [[tape drives]].  The current unit of measure is typically gigabits per square inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/areal_density.html |title=Areal Density |publisher=Webopedia |accessdate= April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper===
{{main|grammage}}
The area density is often used to describe the thickness of paper; e.g., 80&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is very common.

===Fabric===
{{main|grammage}}
Fabric "weight" is often specified as mass per unit area, grams per square meter (gsm) or [[ounce]]s per square yard. It is also sometimes specified in ounces per yard in a standard width for the particular cloth. One gram per square meter equals 0.0295 ounces per square yard; one ounce per square yard equals 33.9 grams per square meter.

===Other===

It is also an important quantity for the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of radiation]]. 

When studying bodies falling through air, area density is important because resistance depends on area, and gravitational force is dependent on mass.

[[Bone density]] is often expressed in grams per square centimeter (g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) as measured by x-ray absorptiometry, as a proxy for the actual density.

The [[body mass index]] is expressed in units of kilograms per square meter, though the area figure is nominal, being simply the square of the height.

The [[total electron content]] in the ionosphere is a quantity of type columnar number density.

[[Snow water equivalent]] is a quantity of type columnar mass density.

'''Argus retinal prosthesis''', also known as a '''bionic eye''', is an electronic [[retinal implant]] manufactured by the [[United States|American]] company Second Sight Medical Products. It is used as a [[visual prosthesis]] to improve the vision of people with severe cases of [[retinitis pigmentosa]]. The Argus II version of the system was approved for marketing in the [[European Union]] in March 2011, and it received approval in the US in February 2013 under a [[humanitarian device exemption]].  The Argus II system costs about US$150,000, excluding the cost of the implantation surgery and training to learn to use the device.

==Medical use==
The Argus II is specifically designed to treat people with [[retinitis pigmentosa]].&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuang|first1=AT|last2=Margo|first2=CE|last3=Greenberg|first3=PB|title=Retinal implants: a systematic review|journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology|date=July 2014|volume=98|issue=7|pages=852–6|pmid=24403565|doi=10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-303708}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was approved with data from a single-arm [[clinical trial]] that enrolled thirty people with severe retinitis pigmentosa; the longest follow-up on a trial subject was 38.3 months.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt; People in the trial received the implant in only one eye and tests were conducted with the device switched on, or switched off as a control.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt; With the device switched on, about 23% of the subjects had improvements in their [[visual acuity|ability to see]]; all had been at 2.9 or higher on the [[LogMAR chart|LogMAR scale]] and improvements ranged from just under 2.9 to 1.6 LogMAR – the equivalent of 20/1262 reading ability.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|18}} 96% of the subjects were better able to identify a white square on a black computer screen; 57% were more able to determine the direction in which a white bar moved across a black computer screen. With the device switched on, about 60% were able to accurately walk to a door that was 20 feet away, as opposed to only 5% with the device switched off; 93% had no change in their perception of light.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|18}}

==Side effects==
Among the thirty subjects in the clinical trial, there were nine serious adverse events recorded, including lower than normal [[intraocular pressure]], erosion of the [[conjunctiva]], [[wound dehiscence|reopening of the surgical wound]], [[endophthalmitis|inflammation inside the eye]], and [[retinal detachments]].&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|19}}  There is also a risk of bacterial infection from the implanted cables that connect the implant to the signal processor.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;

==Surgical procedure==
The implantation procedure takes several hours, with the person receiving the implant under [[general anaesthesia]]. The surgeon [[Vitrectomy|removes the vitreous humor]] and any membranes on the retina where the implant will be placed. The implant is attached to the surface of the retina with a tack. The cables connecting the implant to the processor are run through the [[pars plana]], a region near where the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[sclera]] touch.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev&gt;[https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg519/evidence/insertion-of-an-epiretinal-prosthesis-for-retinitis-pigmentosa-overview2 "IPG519: Interventional procedure overview of insertion of an epiretinal prosthesis for retinitis pigmentosa"]. [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] Interventional Procedures Programme. Updated December 2014. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Device==
The Argus implant's primary external element is a [[digital camera]] mounted on eyeglass frames, which obtains images of the user's surroundings; signals from the camera are transmitted wirelessly to a computerised image processor. The processor is in turn connected by cables to the implant itself, which is surgically implanted on the surface of the person's retina and tacked into place. The implant consists of 60 [[electrode]]s, each 200 [[micron]]s in diameter.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/15/fda-clears-argus-ii-bionic-eye-for-sale-in-the-us-video/|title=FDA clears Argus II 'bionic eye' for sale in the US (video)|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=15 February 2013|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''assay''' is an investigative (analytic) procedure in [[laboratory medicine]], [[pharmacology]], [[environmental biology]] and [[molecular biology]] for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, amount, or functional activity of a target entity (the analyte).  The analyte can be a [[drug]], a [[Biochemistry|biochemical substance]], or a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] in an [[organism]] or organic [[Sample (material)|sample]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American heritage dictionary of the English language|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780618701735|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abate|first1=Frank|editor1-last=J. Jewell|editor1-first=Elizabeth|title=The new Oxford American dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195112276|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measured entity is generally called the '''analyte''', the '''measurand''' or the '''target''' of the assay. The assay usually aims to measure an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] of the analyte and express it in the relevant measurement unit (e.g. [[molarity]], [[density]], functional activity in enzyme international units, degree of some effect in comparison to a standard, etc.).

If the assay involves addition of [[exogenous]] reactants (the reagents), then their quantities are kept fixed (or in excess) so that the quantity (and quality) of the target is the only limiting factor for the reaction/assay process, and the difference in the assay outcome is used to deduce the unknown quality or quantity of the target in question. Some assays (''e.g.,'' biochemical assays) may be similar to or have overlap with [[Analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]] and [[titration]]. But generally, assays involve biological material or phenomena which tend to be intrinsically more complex either in composition or in behavior or both. Thus reading of an assay may be quite noisy and may involve greater difficulties in interpretation than an accurate chemical titration. On the other hand, older generation qualitative assays, especially bioassays, may be much more gross and less quantitative (''e.g.,'' counting death or dysfunction of an organism or cells in a population, or some descriptive change in some body part of a group of animals).

Assays have become a routine part of modern medical, environmental, pharmaceutical, forensic and many other businesses at various scales from industrial to curbside or field level.  Those assays that are very highly commercially demanded have been well investigated in research and development sectors of professional industries, undergone generations of development and sophistication, and become copyrighted [[Intellectual property|intellectual properties]] via highly competitive [[process patent]]ing. Such industrial scale assays as these are often done in well equipped [[Medical laboratory|laboratories]] and with automated organization of the procedure—from ordering an assay to pre-analytic sample processing (sample collection, necessary manipulations e.g. spinning for separation or other processes, aliquoting if necessary, storage, retrieval, pipetting/aspiration etc.).  Analytes are generally tested in high throughput [[AutoAnalyzer]]s, and the results are verified and automatically returned to ordering service providers and end users. These are made possible through use of advanced [[Laboratory informatics system]] that interfaces with multiple computer terminals with end users, central servers, the physical autoanalyser instruments, and other automata.

==Etymology==
According to Etymology Online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=assay|title=Online Etymology Dictionary - Assay |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2016|website= etymonline|publisher=Douglas Harper |access-date= 13 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the verb ''assay'', at least since the 13th century, meant "to try, endeavor, strive; test the quality of", from Anglo-French ''assaier'', from ''assai'' (n.), from Old French ''essai'' "trial", and the noun ''assay'' thus means "trial, test of quality, test of character", mid-14th century, from Anglo-French ''assai'' and the meaning "analysis" is from the late 14th century. For [[Metallurgical assay|assay of currency coins]], this literally meant analysis of the purity of the gold or silver or whatever precious component was used to represent the true value of the coin. This might have translated later (possibly after the 14th century) into a generalized meaning of analysis,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} e.g. of an important or principal component of a target inside a mixture such as an active ingredient of a drug inside the inert excipients in a pharmacological formulation which originally used to be measured by its actual action on an organism (e.g. lethal dose or inhibitory dose).

==General steps==
An assay (analysis) is never an isolated process and must be combined with pre- and post-analytic procedures. The information communication (e.g. request to perform an assay and further information processing) or specimen handling (e.g. collection, transport and processing) that are done until the beginning of an assay are the [[preanalytic]] steps. Similarly, after the assay, the result may be documented, verified and transmitted/communicated in steps that are called [[post-analytic]] steps. Like any multi-step [[information]] handling and [[Information transmission|transmission]] systems, variation and errors in the communicated final results of an assay involve corresponding parts in every such step; i.e. not only analytic variations and errors intrinsic to the assay itself but also variations and errors involved in preanalytic and post analytic steps. Since the assay itself (the analytic step) gets much attention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonini|first1=P|last2=Plebani|first2=M|last3=Ceriotti|first3=F|last4=Rubboli|first4=F|title=Errors in laboratory medicine.|journal=Clinical chemistry|date=May 2002|volume=48|issue=5|pages=691–8|pmid=11978595}}&lt;/ref&gt; steps that get less attention by the chain of users, i.e. the preanalytic and the post analytic steps, are often less stringently regulated and generally more prone to errors – e.g. preanalytic steps in medical laboratory assays may contribute to 32–75% of all lab errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammerling|first1=Julie A.|title=A Review of Medical Errors in Laboratory Diagnostics and Where We Are Today: Table 1|journal=Laboratory Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=43|issue=2|pages=41–44|doi=10.1309/LM6ER9WJR1IHQAUY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assays can be very diverse, but generally involve the following general steps: 
# '''Sample processing and manipulation''' in order to selectively present that target in a discernible or measurable form to a discrimination/identification/detection system. It might involve a simple centrifugal separation or washing or filtration or capture by some form of selective binding or it may even involve modifying the target e.g. [[epitope retrieval]] in immunological assays or cutting down the target into pieces e.g. in [[Mass Spectrometry]]. Generally there are multiple separate steps done before an assay and are called preanalytic processing. But some of the manipulations may be inseparable part of the assay itself and will not thus be considered pre-analytic.
# '''Target-specific DISCRIMINATION/IDENTIFICATION principle''': to discriminate from background (noise) of similar components and specifically identify a particular target component ("analyte") in a biological material by its specific attributes. (e.g. in a [[PCR]] assay a specific oligonucleotide primer identifies the target by [[base pairing]] based on the specific nucleotide sequence unique to the target).
# '''Signal (or target) AMPLIFICATION system''': The presence and quantity of that analyte is converted into a detectable signal generally involving some method of signal amplification, so that it can be easily discriminated from noise and measured - e.g. in a [[PCR]] assay among a mixture of DNA sequences only the specific target is amplified into millions of copies by a [[DNA polymerase]] enzyme so that it can be discerned as a more prominent component compared to any other potential components. Sometimes the concentration of the analyte is too large and in that case the assay may involve sample dilution or some sort of signal diminution system which is a negative amplification.
# '''Signal DETECTION (and interpretation) system''': A system of deciphering the amplified signal into an interpretable output that can be quantitative or qualitative. It can be visual or manual very crude methods or can be very sophisticated electronic digital or analog detectors.
#'''Signal enhancement and noise filtering''' may be done at any or all of the steps above. Since the more downstream a step/process during an assay, the higher the chance of carrying over noise from the previous process and amplifying it, multiple steps in a sophisticated assay might involve various means of signal-specific sharpening/enhancement arrangements and noise reduction or filtering arrangements. These may simply be in the form of a narrow [[band-pass]] optical filer, or a [[blocking reagent]] in a binding reaction that prevents nonspecific binding or a [[quencher|quenching]] reagent in a fluorescence detection system that prevents "autofluorescence" of background objects. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Assay types based on the nature of the assay process==
===Time and number of measurements taken===
Depending on whether an assay just looks at a single time point or timed readings taken at multiple time points, an assay may be:
#An '''end point assay''', in which a single measurement is performed after a fixed incubation period; or
#A '''kinetic assay''', in which measurements are performed multiple times over a fixed time interval. Kinetic assay results may be visualized numerically (for example, as a slope parameter representing the rate of signal change over time), or graphically (for example, as a plot of the signal measured at each time point). For kinetic assays, both the magnitude and shape of the measured response over time provide important information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK343428/ |title=Assay Guidance Manual [Internet] |last1=Sittampalam |first1= GS|date=2004 |website=ncbi.nlm.com |publisher=Eli Lilly &amp; Company and the [[National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences]] |access-date= 12 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of analytes detected===
Depending on how many targets or analytes are being measured:
#Usual assays are simple or ''single target assays'' which is usually the default unless it is called multiplex.
#[[Multiplex assay]]s are used to simultaneously measure the presence, concentration, activity, or quality of multiple analytes in a single test. The advent of ''multiplexing'' enabled rapid, efficient sample testing in many fields, including immunology, cytochemistry, genetics/genomics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biotek.com/resources/articles/multiplexed-assays-life-sciences.html |title=Multiplexed Assays in the Life Sciences |last1= Banks|first1= Peter |date=7 Jun 2010 |website= biotek.com|publisher=[[BioTek]] Instruments Inc |access-date= 13 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Result type===
Depending on the quality of the result produced, assays may be classified into:
# '''Qualitative assays''', i.e. assays which generally give just a pass or fail, or positive or negative or some such sort of only small number of qualitative gradation rather than an exact quantity.
#'''Semi-quantitative assays''', i.e. assays that give the read-out in an approximate fashion rather than an exact number for the quantity of the substance. Generally they have a few more gradations than just two outcomes, positive or negative, e.g. scoring on a scale of 1+ to 4+ as used for blood grouping tests based on RBC [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] in response to grouping reagents (antibody against blood group antigens).
# '''Quantitative assays''', i.e. assays that give accurate and exact numeric quantitative measure of the amount of a substance in a sample. An example of such an assay used in coagulation testing laboratories for the commonest inherited bleeding disease - [[Von Willebrand disease]] is [[Von Willebrand Factor|VWF]] antigen assay where the amount of VWF present in a blood sample is measured by an immunoassay.
# '''Functional assays''', i.e. an assay that tries to quantify functioning of an active substance rather than just its quantity. The functional counterpart of the [[Von Willebrand Factor|VWF]] antigen assay is [[Ristocetin]] Cofactor assay, which measures the functional activity of the VWF present in a patients plasma by adding exogenous [[Formaldehyde#Tissue fixative and embalming agent|formalin-fixed]] [[platelet]]s and gradually increasing quantities of drug named ristocetin while measuring agglutination of the fixed platelets. A similar assay but used for a different purpose is called [[Ristocetin Induced Platelet Aggregation]] or RIPA, which tests response of endogenous live platelets from a patient in response to Ristocetin (exogenous) &amp; VWF (usually endogenous).

===Sample type and method===
Depending on the general substrate on which the assay principle is applied:
#'''Bioassay''': when the response is biological activity of live objects. Examples include
##''in vivo'', whole organism (e.g. mouse or other subject injected with a drug)
##''ex vivo'' body part (e.g. leg of a frog)
##''ex vivo'' organ (e.g. heart of a dog)
##''ex vivo'' part of an organ (e.g. a segment of an intestine).
##tissue (e.g. limulus lysate)
##cell (e.g. platelets)
#'''[[Ligand binding assay]]''' when a ligand (usually a small molecule) binds a receptor (usually a large protein).
#'''[[Immunoassay]]''' when the response is an antigen antibody binding type reaction.

===Signal amplification===
Depending on the nature of the signal amplification system assays may be of numerous types, to name a few:
#'''[[Enzyme assay]]''': Enzymes may be tested by their highly repeating activity on a large number of substrates when loss of a substrate or the making of a product may have a measurable attribute like color or [[absorbance]] at a particular wavelength or light or [[Electrochemiluminescence]] or electrical/redox activity.
#Light detection systems that may use amplification e.g. by a [[photodiode]] or a [[photomultiplier tube]] or a cooled [[charge coupled device]].
#'''[[Radioisotope]]''' labeled substrates as used in [[radioimmunoassay]]s and equilibrium dialysis assays and can be detected by the amplification in [[Gamma counter]]s or [[X-ray plate]]s, or [[Photostimulated luminescence|phosphorimager]]
#'''[[Polymerase Chain Reaction]]''' Assays that amplify a DNA (or RNA) target rather than the signal
#'''Combination Methods''' Assays may utilize a combination of the above and other amplification methods to improve sensitivity. e.g. [[ELISA|Enzyme-linked immunoassay]] or EIA, [[enzyme linked immunosorbent assay]].

===Detection method or technology===
Depending on the nature of the Detection system assays can be based on:
#'''Colony forming''' or [[virtual colony count]]: e.g. by multiplying bacteria or proliferating cells.
#'''[[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]]''' / '''[[spectrophotometry]]''' When the absorbance of a specific wavelength of light while passing through a fixed path-length through a cuvette of liquid test sample is measured and the absorbance is compared with a blank and standards with graded amounts of the target compound. If the emitted light is of a specific visible wavelength it may be called '''[[colorimetry]]''', or it may involve specific wavelength of light e.g. by use of [[laser]] and emission of [[fluorescent]] signals of another specific wavelength which is detected via very specific wavelength optical filters.
#'''[[Transmittance]]''' of light may be used to measure e.g. clearing of opacity of a liquid created by suspended particles due to decrease in number of clumps during a platelet [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] reaction.
#'''[[Turbidimetry]]''' when the opacity of straight-transmitted light passing through a liquid sample is measured by detectors placed straight across the light source.
#'''[[Nephelometry]]''' where a measurement of the amount of light scattering that occurs when a beam of light is passed through the solution is used to determine size and/or concentration and/or size distribution of particles in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/nephelometry|title=Nephelometry |date=2016 |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |access-date=9 September 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Reflectometry]]''' When color of light reflected from a (usually dry) sample or reactant is assessed e.g. the automated readings of the strip urine dipstick assays.
#Viscoelastic measurements e.g. viscometry, elastography (e.g. [[thromboelastography]])
#Counting assays: e.g. optic [[Flow cytometry|Flow cytometric]] cell or particle counters, or [[Coulter principle|coulter]]/impedance principle based cell counters
#Imaging assays, that involve image analysis manually or by software:
##'''[[Cytometry]]''': When the size statistics of cells is assessed by an image processor.
#Electric detection e.g. involving [[amperometry]], [[Voltammetry]], [[coulometry]] may be used directly or indirectly for many types of quantitative measurements.
#Other physical property based assays may use
##[[Osmometer]]
##[[Viscometer]]
##[[Ion Selective electrode]]s

==Quality==
When multiple assays measure the same target their results and utility may or may not be comparable depending on the natures of the assay and their methodology, reliability etc. Such comparisons are possible through study of general quality attributes of the assays e.g. principles of measurement (including identification, amplification and detection), dynamic range of detection (usually the range of linearity of the ''standard curve''), [[analytic sensitivity]], [[functional sensitivity]], [[analytic specificity]], [[Positive predictive value|positive]], [[negative predictive value]]s, [[turn around time]] i.e. time taken to finish a whole cycle from the preanalytic steps till the end of the last post analytic step (report dispatch/transmission), [[throughput]] i.e. number of assays done per unit time (usually expressed as per hour) etc. Organizations or laboratories that perform Assays for professional purposes e.g. medical diagnosis and prognostics, environmental analysis, forensic proceeding, pharmaceutical research and development must undergo well regulated [[quality assurance]] procedures including [[method validation]], regular [[calibration]], [[analytical quality control]], [[proficiency testing]], test [[accreditation]], test [[licensing]] and must document appropriate certifications from the relevant regulating bodies in order to establish the reliability of their assays, especially to remain legally acceptable and accountable for the quality of the assay results and also to convince customers to use their assay commercially/professionally.

'''Astronomical spectroscopy''' is the study of [[astronomy]] using the techniques of [[spectroscopy]] to measure the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]], including visible light and radio, which [[radiant energy|radiates]] from [[star]]s and other celestial objects.  A '''stellar spectrum''' can reveal many properties of stars, such as their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance, luminosity, and relative motion using [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] measurements. Spectroscopy is also used to study the physical properties of many other types of celestial objects such as [[planet]]s, [[nebula]]e, [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]].

==Background==
[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|Electromagnetic transmittance, or opacity, of the Earth's atmosphere]]
Astronomical spectroscopy is used to measure three major bands of radiation: [[visible spectrum]], [[radio wave|radio]], and [[X-ray]].  While all spectroscopy looks at specific areas of the spectrum, different methods are required to acquire the signal depending on the frequency.  [[Ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) absorb light with wavelengths under 300&amp;nbsp;nm, meaning that X-ray and [[ultraviolet]] spectroscopy require the use of a satellite telescope or [[X-ray astronomy#Sounding rocket flights|rocket mounted detectors]].&lt;ref name=Foukal /&gt;{{rp|27}}  Radio signals have much longer wavelengths than optical signals, and require the use of [[Radio telescope#Types|antennas or radio dishes]]. [[Infrared]] light is absorbed by atmospheric water and carbon dioxide, so while the equipment is similar to that used in optical spectroscopy, satellites are required to record much of the infrared spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cool Cosmos - Infrared Astronomy|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical spectroscopy===
[[Image:Blazedgrating.jpg|thumb|Incident light reflects at the same angle (black lines), but a small portion of the light is refracted as coloured light (red and blue lines).]]
Physicists have been looking at the solar spectrum since [[Isaac Newton]] first used a simple prism to observe the refractive properties of light.&lt;ref name=Opticks /&gt; In the early 1800s [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] used his skills as a glass maker to create very pure prisms, which allowed him to observe 574 dark lines in a seemingly continuous spectrum.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer /&gt; Soon after this, he combined telescope and prism to observe the spectrum of [[Venus]], the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and various stars such as [[Betelgeuse]]; his company continued to manufacture and sell high-quality refracting telescopes based on his original designs until its closure in 1884.&lt;ref name=Hearnshaw /&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

The resolution of a prism is limited by its size; a larger prism will provide a more detailed spectrum, but the increase in mass makes it unsuitable for highly detailed work.&lt;ref name=Kitchin /&gt; This issue was resolved in the early 1900s with the development of high-quality reflection gratings by [[John Stanley Plaskett|J.S. Plaskett]] at the [[Dominion Observatory]] in Ottawa, Canada.&lt;ref name=Hearnshaw /&gt;{{rp|11}} Light striking a mirror will reflect at the same angle, however a small portion of the light will be refracted at a different angle; this is dependent upon the indices of refraction of the materials and the wavelength of the light.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt; By creating a [[blazed grating|"blazed" grating]] which utilizes a large number of parallel mirrors, the small portion of light can be focused and visualized. These new spectroscopes were more detailed than a prism, required less light, and could be focused on a specific region of the spectrum by tilting the grating.&lt;ref name=Kitchin /&gt;

The limitation to a blazed grating is the width of the mirrors, which can only be ground a finite amount before focus is lost; the maximum is around 1000 lines/mm. In order to overcome this limitation holographic gratings were developed.  Volume phase holographic gratings use a thin film of dichromated gelatin on a glass surface, which is subsequently exposed to a [[Interference (wave propagation)|wave pattern]] created by an [[interferometer]]. This wave pattern sets up a reflection pattern similar to the blazed gratings but utilizing [[Bragg's law|Bragg diffraction]], a process where the angle of reflection is dependent on the arrangement of the atoms in the gelatin. The holographic gratings can have up to 6000 lines/mm and can be up to twice as efficient in collecting light as blazed gratings. Because they are sealed between two sheets of glass, the holographic gratings are very versatile, potentially lasting decades before needing replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barden|first=S.C.|first2=J.A.|last2=Arns|first3=W.S.|last3=Colburn|title=Volume-phase holographic gratings and their potential for astronomical applications|journal=Proc.

Light [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersed]] by the grating or prism in a [[spectrograph]] can be recorded by a detector. Historically, [[photographic plate]]s were widely used to record spectra until electronic detectors were developed, and today optical spectrographs most often employ [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs). The wavelength scale of a spectrum can be [[Calibration|calibrated]] by observing the spectrum of [[emission line]]s of known wavelength from a [[gas-discharge lamp]]. The [[Spectral flux density|flux]] scale of a spectrum can be calibrated as a function of wavelength by comparison with an observation of a standard star with corrections for atmospheric absorption of light; this is known as [[spectrophotometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oke|first1=J.

===Radio spectroscopy&lt;!-- [[Radio spectroscopy]] redirects to this heading. --&gt;===
[[Radio astronomy]] was founded with the work of [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]] in the early 1930s, while working for [[Bell Labs]]. He built a radio antenna to look at potential sources of interference for transatlantic radio transmissions. One of the sources of noise discovered came not from Earth, but from the center of the [[Milky Way]], in the constellation [[Sagittarius A|Sagittarius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghigo|first=F|title=Karl Jansky|url=http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml|work=National Radio Astronomy Observatory|publisher=Associated Universities, Inc.|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, [[James Stanley Hey|JS Hey]] captured the sun's radio frequency using military radar receivers.&lt;ref name=Foukal /&gt;{{rp|26}} Radio spectroscopy started with the discovery of the [[Hydrogen line|21-centimeter H&amp;nbsp;I line]] in 1951.

[[astronomical interferometer|Radio interferometry]] was pioneered in 1946, when [[Joseph Lade Pawsey]], [[Ruby Payne-Scott]] and [[Lindsay McCready]] used a [[sea interferometry|single antenna atop a sea cliff]] to observe 200&amp;nbsp;MHz solar radiation. Two incident beams, one directly from the sun and the other reflected from the sea surface, generated the necessary interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pawsey|first=Joseph |last2=Payne-Scott|first2=Ruby |last3=McCready|first3=Lindsay |date=1946|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|title=Radio-Frequency Energy from the Sun|volume=157|pages=158–159|doi=10.1038/157158a0|issue=3980|bibcode = 1946Natur.157..158P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first multi-receiver interferometer was built in the same year by [[Martin Ryle]] and Vonberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryle|first=M. |last2=Vonberg|first2=D.

===Chemical properties===
Newton used a prism to split white light into a spectrum of color, and Fraunhofer's high-quality prisms allowed scientists to see dark lines of an unknown origin. In the 1850s, [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]] described the phenomena behind these dark lines. Hot solid objects produce light with a [[continuous spectrum]], hot gases emit light at specific wavelengths, and hot solid objects surrounded by cooler gases show a near-continuous spectrum with dark lines corresponding to the emission lines of the gases.&lt;ref name=Hearnshaw /&gt;{{rp|42–44}}&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; By comparing the [[absorption spectroscopy|absorption lines]] of the sun with [[Emission spectrum|emission spectra]] of known gases, the chemical composition of stars can be determined.

The major [[Fraunhofer lines]], and the elements with which they are associated, appear in the following table.  Designations from the early [[Balmer series|Balmer Series]] are shown in parentheses.

Not all of the elements in the sun were immediately identified.  Two examples are listed below.
*In 1868 [[Norman Lockyer]] and [[Pierre Janssen]] independently observed a line next to the sodium doublet (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which Lockyer determined to be a new element. He named it [[Helium]], but it wasn't until 1895 the element was found on Earth.&lt;ref name=Hearnshaw /&gt;{{rp|84–85}}
*In 1869 the astronomers [[Charles Augustus Young]] and [[William Harkness]] independently observed a novel green emission line in the Sun's [[corona]] during an eclipse. This "new" element was incorrectly named [[coronium]], as it was only found in the corona. It was not until the 1930s that [[Walter Grotrian]] and [[Bengt Edlén]] discovered that the spectral line at 530.3&amp;nbsp;nm was due to [[highly charged ion|highly ionized]] iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;13+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Morison /&gt; Other unusual lines in the coronal spectrum are also caused by highly charged ions, such as [[nickel]] and [[calcium]], the high ionization being due to the extreme temperature of the [[corona|solar corona]].&lt;ref name=Foukal /&gt;{{rp|87,297}}
To date more than 20 000 absorption lines have been listed for the [[Sun]] between 293.5 and 877.0&amp;nbsp;nm, yet only approximately 75% of these lines have been linked to elemental absorption.&lt;ref name=Foukal /&gt;{{rp|69}}

By analyzing the width of each spectral line in an emission spectrum, both the elements present in a star and their relative abundances can be determined.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;  Using this information stars can be categorized into [[Metallicity#Stellar populations|stellar populations]]; Population I stars are the youngest stars and have the highest metal content (our Sun is a Pop I star), while Population III stars are the oldest stars with a very low metal content.&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory, Stephen A.|author2=Michael Zeilik|title=Introductory astronomy &amp; astrophysics|date=1998|publisher=Saunders College Publ.|location=Fort Worth [u.a.]|isbn=0-03-006228-4|page=322|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PopIII&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pan|first=Liubin|author2=Scannapieco, Evan|author3= Scalo, Jon|title=MODELING THE POLLUTION OF PRISTINE GAS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1 October 2013|volume=775|issue=2|page=111|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/775/2/111|arxiv = 1306.4663 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...775..111P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature and size===
[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|Black body curves for various temperatures.]]
In 1860 [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] proposed the idea of a [[black body]], a material that emits electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths.&lt;ref name=Kirchhoff /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pradhan /&gt;  In 1894 [[Wilhelm Wien]] derived an expression relating the temperature (T) of a black body to its peak emission wavelength (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Massoud /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{max} T = b&lt;/math&gt;
''b'' is a [[proportionality constant|constant of proportionality]] called ''Wien's displacement constant'', equal to {{physconst|bwien|after=.}}  This equation is called [[Wien's displacement law|Wien's Law]]. By measuring the peak wavelength of a star, the surface temperature can be determined.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;  For example, if the peak wavelength of a star is 502&amp;nbsp;nm the corresponding temperature will be 5778 [[kelvin]]s.

The [[luminosity]] of a star is a measure of the [[radiant energy|electromagnetic energy]] output in a given amount of time.&lt;ref name=Australia /&gt;  Luminosity (L) can be related to the temperature (T) of a star by
:&lt;math&gt;L= 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt; ,

where R is the radius of the star and σ is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann]] constant, with a value of {{physconst|sigma|after=.}}  Thus, when both luminosity and temperature are known (via direct measurement and calculation) the radius of a star can be determined.

{{See also|Luminosity|Magnitude (astronomy)}}

==Galaxies==
The spectra of [[galaxy|galaxies]] look similar to stellar spectra, as they consist of the combined light of millions of stars.

Doppler shift studies of [[galaxy cluster]]s by [[Fritz Zwicky]] in 1937 found that most galaxies were moving much faster than seemed to be possible from what was known about the mass of the cluster. Zwicky hypothesized that there must be a great deal of non-luminous matter in the galaxy clusters, which became known as [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name=Zwicky /&gt; Since his discovery, astronomers have determined that a large portion of galaxies (and most of the universe) is made up of dark matter. In 2003, however, four galaxies (NGC 821, [[Messier 105|NGC 3379]], NGC 4494, and [[NGC 4697]]) were found to have little to no dark matter influencing the motion of the stars contained within them; the reason behind the lack of dark matter is unknown.&lt;ref name=Romanowsky /&gt;

In the 1950s, strong radio sources were found to be associated with very dim, very red objects.  When the first spectrum of one of these objects was taken there were absorption lines at wavelengths where none were expected.  It was soon realised that what was observed was a normal galactic spectrum, but highly red shifted.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wallace /&gt;  These were named ''quasi-stellar radio sources'', or [[quasars]], by  [[Hong-Yee Chiu]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=Chiu /&gt;  Quasars are now thought to be galaxies formed in the early years of our universe, with their extreme energy output powered by super-massive [[black hole]]s.&lt;ref name= Wallace /&gt;

The properties of a galaxy can also be determined by analyzing the stars found within them.  [[NGC 4550]], a galaxy in the Virgo Cluster, has a large portion of its stars rotating in the opposite direction as the other portion. It is believed that the galaxy is the combination of two smaller galaxies that were rotating in opposite directions to each other.&lt;ref name=Rubin /&gt; Bright stars in galaxies can also help determine the distance to a galaxy, which may be a more accurate method than [[parallax]] or [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]].&lt;ref name=Kudritzki /&gt;

==Interstellar medium==
The [[interstellar medium]] is matter that occupies the space between [[star systems]] in a galaxy. 99% of this matter is gaseous - [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and smaller quantities of other ionized elements such as [[oxygen]]. The other 1% is dust particles, thought to be mainly [[graphite]], [[silicate]]s, and ices.&lt;ref name=KitchinGas /&gt; Clouds of the dust and gas are referred to as [[nebula]]e.

There are three main types of nebula: [[dark nebula|absorption]], [[reflection nebula|reflection]], and [[emission nebula|emission]] nebulae. Absorption (or dark) nebulae are made of dust and gas in such quantities that they obscure the starlight behind them, making [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] difficult.  Reflection nebulae, as their name suggest, reflect the light of nearby stars. Their spectra are the same as the stars surrounding them, though the light is bluer; shorter wavelengths scatter better than longer wavelengths. Emission nebulae emit light at specific wavelengths depending on their chemical composition.&lt;ref name=KitchinGas /&gt;

===Gaseous emission nebulae===
In the early years of astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were puzzled by the spectrum of gaseous nebulae. In 1864 [[William Huggins]] noticed that many nebulae showed only emission lines rather than a full spectrum like stars. From the work of Kirchhoff, he concluded that nebulae must contain "enormous masses of luminous gas or vapour."&lt;ref name=Huggins /&gt; However, there were several emission lines that could not be linked to any terrestrial element, brightest among them lines at 495.9&amp;nbsp;nm and 500.7&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=Tennyson /&gt; These lines were attributed to a new element, [[nebulium]], until [[Ira Sprague Bowen|Ira Bowen]] determined in 1927 that the emission lines were from highly ionised oxygen (O&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Hirsh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowen /&gt; These emission lines could not be replicated in a laboratory because they are [[forbidden mechanism|forbidden lines]]; the low density of a nebula (one atom per cubic centimetre)&lt;ref name=KitchinGas /&gt; allows for [[Metastability|metastable]] ions to decay via forbidden line emission rather than collisions with other atoms.&lt;ref name=Tennyson /&gt;

Not all emission nebulae are found around or near stars where solar heating causes ionisation. The majority of gaseous emission nebulae are formed of neutral hydrogen. In the [[ground state]] neutral hydrogen has two possible [[spin (physics)|spin states]]: the [[electron]] has either the same spin or the opposite spin of the [[proton]]. When the atom transitions between these two states, it releases an emission or absorption line of 21&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=KitchinGas /&gt; This line is within the radio range and allows for very precise measurements:&lt;ref name=Tennyson /&gt;
*Velocity of the cloud can be measured via [[Astronomical spectroscopy#Doppler Shift|Doppler shift]]
*The intensity of the 21&amp;nbsp;cm line gives the density and number of atoms in the cloud
*The temperature of the cloud can be calculated
Using this information the shape of the Milky Way has been determined to be a [[spiral galaxy]], though the exact number and position of the spiral arms is the subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=Efremov /&gt;

===Complex molecules===
{{main|List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules}}
Dust and molecules in the interstellar medium not only obscures photometry, but also causes absorption lines in spectroscopy. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component electrons between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in radio, microwave, or infrared portions of the spectrum.&lt;ref name=Shu /&gt; The chemical reactions that form these molecules can happen in cold, diffuse clouds&lt;ref name=GoddardISM /&gt; or in the hot ejecta around a [[white dwarf]] star from a [[nova]] or [[supernova]].&lt;ref name=Buckyball /&gt; [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s such as [[acetylene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generally group together to form graphites or other sooty material,&lt;ref name=DustChemistry /&gt; but other [[organic compound|organic molecules]] such as [[acetone]] ((CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO)&lt;ref name=Acetone /&gt; and [[buckminsterfullerene]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;) have been discovered.&lt;ref name=Buckyball /&gt;

==Motion in the universe==
[[File:Redshift blueshift.svg|thumb|Redshift and blueshift]]
Stars and interstellar gas are bound by gravity to form galaxies, and groups of galaxies can be bound by gravity in [[galaxy clusters]].&lt;ref name=Hubble /&gt; With the exception of stars in the [[Milky Way]] and the galaxies in the [[Local Group]], almost all galaxies are moving away from us due to the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name=Morison /&gt;

===Doppler effect and redshift===
The motion of stellar objects can be determined by looking at their spectrum. Because of the [[Doppler effect]], objects moving towards us are [[blueshift]]ed, and objects moving away are [[redshift]]ed. The wavelength of redshifted light is longer, appearing redder than the source.  Conversely, the wavelength of blueshifted light is shorter, appearing bluer than the source light:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda-\lambda_0}{\lambda_0}=\frac{v_0}{c}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; is the emitted wavelength, &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the observed wavelength. Note that v&lt;0 corresponds to &amp;lambda;&lt;&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, a blueshifted wavelength. A redshifted absorption or emission line will appear more towards the red end of the spectrum than a stationary line. In 1913 [[Vesto Slipher]] determined the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] was blueshifted, meaning it was moving towards the Milky Way.  He recorded the spectra of 20 other galaxies &amp;mdash; all but 4 of which were redshifted &amp;mdash; and was able to calculate their velocities relative to the Earth. [[Edwin Hubble]] would later use this information, as well as his own observations, to define [[Hubble's law]]: The further a galaxy is from the Earth, the faster it is moving away from us.&lt;ref name=Morison /&gt;&lt;ref name=HubbleLaw /&gt; Hubble's law can be generalised to
:&lt;math&gt;v = H_0 d&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity (or Hubble Flow), &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hubble's law#Observed values|Hubble Constant]], and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from Earth.

Redshift (z) can be expressed by the following equations:&lt;ref name=redshift /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"
|+ '''Calculation of redshift, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;'''
! '''Based on wavelength''' !! '''Based on frequency'''
|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{obsv}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{emit}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{emit}}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;z = \frac{f_{\mathrm{emit}} - f_{\mathrm{obsv}}}{f_{\mathrm{obsv}}}&lt;/math&gt;
|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt;1+z = \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{obsv}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{emit}}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1+z = \frac{f_{\mathrm{emit}}}{f_{\mathrm{obsv}}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In these equations, frequency is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and wavelength by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The larger the value of z, the more redshifted the light and the farther away the object is from the Earth. As of January 2013, the largest galaxy redshift of z~12 was found using the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]], corresponding to an age of over 13 billion years (the universe is approximately 13.82 billion years old).&lt;ref name=Ellis /&gt;&lt;ref name=EllisRef /&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanckHubble /&gt;

The Doppler effect and Hubble's law can be combined to form the equation
&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{v_\text{Hubble}}{c}&lt;/math&gt;,
where c is the speed of light.

===Peculiar motion===
Objects that are gravitationally bound will rotate around a common center of mass. For stellar bodies, this motion is known as [[peculiar velocity]], and can alter the Hubble Flow.  Thus, an extra term for the peculiar motion needs to be added to Hubble's law:&lt;ref name=PeculiarMotion /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{total} = H_0 d + v_\mathrm{pec}&lt;/math&gt;
This motion can cause confusion when looking at a solar or galactic spectrum, because the expected redshift based on the simple Hubble law will be obscured by the peculiar motion.  For example, the shape and size of the [[Virgo Cluster]] has been a matter of great scientific scrutiny due to the very large peculiar velocities of the galaxies in the cluster.&lt;ref name=VirgoCluster /&gt;

===Binary stars===
[[File:Wiki Spect Binaries v2.gif|thumb|right|Two stars of different size orbiting the center of mass. The spectrum can be seen to split depending on the position and velocity of the stars.]]
Just as planets can be gravitationally bound to stars, pairs of stars can orbit each other. Some [[binary star]]s are visual binaries, meaning they can be observed orbiting each other through a telescope.  Some binary stars, however, are too close together to be [[angular resolution|resolved]].&lt;ref name=BinaryStars /&gt; These two stars, when viewed through a spectrometer, will show a composite spectrum: the spectrum of each star will be added together. This composite spectrum becomes easier to detect when the stars are of similar luminosity and of different [[Stellar classification|spectral class]].&lt;ref name=GrayCorbally /&gt;

[[Binary star#Spectroscopic binaries|Spectroscopic binaries]] can be also detected due to their [[radial velocity]]; as they orbit around each other one star may be moving towards the Earth whilst the other moves away, causing a Doppler shift in the composite spectrum. The [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] of the system determines the magnitude of the observed shift: if the observer is looking perpendicular to the orbital plane there will be no observed radial velocity.&lt;ref name=BinaryStars /&gt;&lt;ref name=GrayCorbally /&gt;  For example, if you look at a [[carousel]] from the side, you will see the animals moving toward and away from you, whereas if you look from directly above they will only be moving in the horizontal plane.

== Planets, asteroids, and comets==
[[Planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and [[comets]] all reflect light from their parent stars and emit their own light.  For cooler objects, including [[solar-system]] planets and asteroids, most of the emission is at infrared wavelengths we cannot see, but that are routinely measured with [[spectrometer]]s.  For objects surrounded by gas, such as comets and planets with atmospheres, further emission and absorption happens at specific wavelengths in the gas, imprinting the spectrum of the gas on that of the solid object.  In the case of worlds with thick atmospheres or complete cloud cover (such as the [[gas giants]], [[Venus]], and [[Saturn]]'s satellite [[Titan (moon)]]), the spectrum is mostly or completely due to the atmosphere alone.&lt;ref name=GoodyYung /&gt;

===Planets===
The reflected light of a planet contains absorption bands due to [[mineral]]s in the rocks present for rocky bodies, or due to the elements and molecules present in the atmosphere. To date over 3,500 [[exoplanets]] have been discovered.  These include so-called [[Hot Jupiter]]s, as well as Earth-like planets. Using spectroscopy, compounds such as alkali metals, water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane have all been discovered.&lt;ref name=Tessenyi /&gt;

===Asteroids===
Asteroids can be classified into three major types according to their spectra.  The original categories were created by Clark R. Chapman, David Morrison, and Ben Zellner in 1975, and further expanded by [[David J. Tholen]] in 1984. In what is now known as the [[Asteroid spectral types#Tholen classification|Tholen classification]], the [[C-type asteroid|C-types]] are made of carbonaceous material, [[S-type asteroid|S-types]] consist mainly of [[silicates]], and [[X-type asteroid|X-types]] are 'metallic'.  There are other classifications for unusual asteroids.  C- and S-type asteroids are the most common asteroids. In 2002 the Tholen classification was further "evolved" into the [[Asteroid spectral types#SMASS classification|SMASS classification]], expanding the number of categories from 14 to 26 to account for more precise spectroscopic analysis of the asteroids.&lt;ref name=Bus /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapman /&gt;

===Comets===
[[File:Spectrum of Comet Hyakutake.gif|thumb|300px|right|Optical spectrum of [[Comet Hyakutake]].]]
The spectra of comets consist of a reflected solar spectrum from the dusty clouds surrounding the comet, as well as emission lines from gaseous atoms and molecules excited to [[fluorescence]] by sunlight and/or chemical reactions. For example, the chemical composition of [[C/2012 S1|Comet ISON]]&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20140508" /&gt; was determined by spectroscopy due to the prominent emission lines of cyanogen (CN), as well as two- and three-carbon atoms (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=CIOC /&gt; Nearby comets can even be seen in X-ray as solar wind ions flying to the [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] are neutralized. The cometary X-ray spectra therefore reflect the state of the solar wind rather than that of the comet.&lt;ref name=Lisse /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11017">The '''bomb pulse''' is the sudden increase of [[carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] due to the hundreds of aboveground [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear bombs tests]] that started in 1945 and intensified between 1950 until 1963, when the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/radtown/fallout-nuclear-weapons-testing.html|title=Radioactive Fallout From Nuclear Weapons Testing|last=|first=|date=|website=USEPA|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hundreds of blasts were followed by a doubling of the concentration of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grimm|first=David|date=2008-09-12|title=The Mushroom Cloud's Silver Lining|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5895/1434|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5895|pages=1434–1437|doi=10.1126/science.321.5895.1434|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18787143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the concentration of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C has decreased towards the previous level. Carbon-14, the [[radioisotope]] of carbon-12, is naturally developed in trace amounts in the atmosphere and it can be detected in all living organisms. Carbon of all types is continually used to form the molecules of the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of organisms. Doubling of the concentration of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the atmosphere is reflected in the tissues and cells of all organisms that lived around the period of nuclear testing. This property has many applications in the fields of biology and forensics.

The New Zealand curve is representative for the Southern Hemisphere, the Austrian curve is representative for the Northern Hemisphere. Atmospheric nuclear weapon tests almost doubled the concentration of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.science.uu.nl/AMS/Radiocarbon.htm|title=Radiocarbon|website=web.science.uu.nl|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;|300x300px]]

== Background ==
The radioisotope carbon-14 is constantly formed from [[nitrogen-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N) in the higher atmosphere by incoming [[cosmic ray]]s which generate neutrons. These neutrons collide with &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N to produce &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C which then combines with oxygen to form &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This radioactive [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] spreads through the lower atmosphere and the oceans where it is absorbed by the plants and the animals that eat the plants. The radioisotope &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C thus becomes part of the [[biosphere]] so that all living organisms contain a certain amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Nuclear testing caused a rapid increase in atmospheric &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C (see figure), since the explosion of an atomic bomb also creates [[neutron]]s which collide again with &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and produce &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Since the ban on nuclear testing in 1963, atmospheric &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C is slowly decreasing at a pace of 1% annually. This continuous decrease permits scientists to determine among others the age of deceased people and allows them to study cell activity in tissues. By measuring the amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in a population of cells and comparing that to the amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the atmosphere during or after the bomb pulse, scientists can estimate when the cells were created and how often they've turned over since then.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Difference with classical radiocarbon dating ==
[[Radiocarbon dating]] has been used since 1946 to determine the age of organic material as old as 50,000 years. As the organism dies, the exchange of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C with the environment ceases and the incorporated &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C decays. Given the steady decay of radioisotopes (the [[half-life]] of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C is about 5,730 years), the amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C left in the dead organism can be used to calculate how long ago it died. Bomb pulse dating should be considered a special form of carbon dating. As discussed above and in the [[Radiolab]] episode, ''Elements'' (section 'Carbon'),&lt;ref name="Radiolab2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/elements|title=Elements – Radiolab|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in bomb pulse dating the slow absorption of atmospheric &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C by the biosphere, can be considered as a chronometer. Starting from the pulse around the years 1963 (see figure), atmospheric radiocarbon decreased with 1% a year. So in bomb pulse dating it is the amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the atmosphere that is decreasing and not the amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in a dead organisms, as is the case in classical radiocarbon dating. This decrease in atmospheric &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C can be measured in cells and tissues and has permitted scientists to determine the age of individual cells and of deceased people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LLNL2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cams.llnl.gov/cams-competencies/forensics/14c-bomb-pulse-forensics|title=14C "Bomb Pulse" Pulse Forensics|work=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These applications are very similar to the experiments conducted with [[pulse-chase analysis]] in which cellular processes are examined over time by exposing the cells to a labeled compound (pulse) and then to the same compound in an unlabeled form (chase). [[Radioactivity]] is a commonly used label in these experiments. An important difference between pulse-chase analysis and bomb-pulse dating is the absence of the chase in the latter.

Around the year 2030 the bomb pulse will die out. Every organism born after this period will not bear any bomb pulse traces and their cells cannot be timed. Radioactive pulses cannot be administered to people to study the turnover of their cells so the bomb pulse may be considered as a useful side effect of nuclear testing.&lt;ref name="Radiolab2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
The fact that cells and tissues reflect the doubling of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the atmosphere during and after nuclear testing, has been of great use for several biological studies, for forensics and even for the determination of the year in which certain wine was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoppi|first=U|last2=Skopec|first2=Z|last3=Skopec|first3=J|last4=Jones|first4=G|last5=Fink|first5=D|last6=Hua|first6=Q|last7=Jacobsen|first7=G|last8=Tuniz|first8=C|last9=Williams|first9=A|date=2004-08-01|title=Forensic applications of 14C bomb-pulse dating|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X04006688|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|series=Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Accelerator Mass Spectrometry|volume=223–224|pages=770–775|doi=10.1016/j.nimb.2004.04.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biology ===
Biological studies carried out by Kirsty Spalding demonstrated that [[Neuron|neuronal cells]] are essentially static and do not [[Neuroregeneration|regenerate]] during life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spalding|first=Kirsty L.|last2=Bhardwaj|first2=Ratan D.|last3=Buchholz|first3=Bruce A.|last4=Druid|first4=Henrik|last5=Frisén|first5=Jonas|date=2005-07-15|title=Retrospective birth dating of cells in humans|journal=Cell|volume=122|issue=1|pages=133–143|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.04.028|issn=0092-8674|pmid=16009139}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also showed that the number of fat cells is set during childhood and adolescence. Considering the amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C present in DNA she could establish that 10% of fat cells are renewed annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spalding|first=Kirsty L.|last2=Arner|first2=Erik|last3=Westermark|first3=Pål O.|last4=Bernard|first4=Samuel|last5=Buchholz|first5=Bruce A.|last6=Bergmann|first6=Olaf|last7=Blomqvist|first7=Lennart|last8=Hoffstedt|first8=Johan|last9=Näslund|first9=Erik|date=2008-06-05|title=Dynamics of fat cell turnover in humans|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7196/abs/nature06902.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=453|issue=7196|pages=783–787|doi=10.1038/nature06902|issn=0028-0836|pmid=18454136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bomb pulse has been used also to determine the age of [[Greenland shark]]s by measuring the incorporation of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the eye lens during development. After having determined the age and measured the length of sharks born around the bomb pulse, it was possible to create a mathematical model in which length and age of the sharks were correlated in order to deduce the age of the larger sharks. The study showed that the Greenland shark, with an age of 392 +/- 120 years, is the oldest known vertebrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Julius|last2=Hedeholm|first2=Rasmus B.|last3=Heinemeier|first3=Jan|last4=Bushnell|first4=Peter G.|last5=Christiansen|first5=Jørgen S.|last6=Olsen|first6=Jesper|last7=Ramsey|first7=Christopher Bronk|last8=Brill|first8=Richard W.|last9=Simon|first9=Malene|date=2016-08-12|title=Eye lens radiocarbon reveals centuries of longevity in the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus)|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6300/702|journal=Science|language=en|volume=353|issue=6300|pages=702–704|doi=10.1126/science.aaf1703|issn=0036-8075|pmid=27516602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forensics ===
At the moment of death, carbon uptake is ended. Considering that after the bomb pulse &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C was rapidly diminishing with a rate of 1% per year, it has been possible to establish the time of death of two women in a court case by examining tissues with a rapid turnover.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=First 14C results from archaeological and forensic studies at the Vienna environmental research accelerator|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2461733|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=40|issue=1|issn=0033-8222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important application has been the identification of victims of the Southeast Asian tsunami 2004 by examining their teeth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spalding|first=Kirsty L.|last2=Buchholz|first2=Bruce A.|last3=Bergman|first3=Lars-Eric|last4=Druid|first4=Henrik|last5=Frisén|first5=Jonas|date=2005-09-15|title=Forensics: Age written in teeth by nuclear tests|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7057/full/437333a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=437|issue=7057|pages=333–334|doi=10.1038/437333a|issn=0028-0836|pmid=16163340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
Atmospheric bomb &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C has been used to validate tree ring ages and to date recent trees that have no annual growth rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16177|title=Atmospheric Radiocarbon for the Period 1950–2010|date=2013-03-25|volume=55|language=en|doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.55.16177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chiller.jpg|thumb|right|[[York International]] water-cooled chiller]]
A '''chiller''' is a machine that removes heat from a liquid via a [[vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] or [[absorption refrigerator|absorption refrigeration cycle]]. This liquid can then be circulated through a [[heat exchanger]] to cool equipment, or another process stream (such as air or process water). As a necessary by product, refrigeration creates [[waste heat]] that must be exhausted to ambience, or for greater efficiency, recovered for heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Chilled water is used to [[Air conditioning|cool and dehumidify]] air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities. Water chillers can be water-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water-cooled systems can provide efficiency and [[Environmental issue|environmental impact]] advantages over air-cooled systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPDRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=water+chiller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA8u6Q0v7QAhUlw4MKHdU-BxQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20chiller&amp;f=false|title=HVAC Water Chillers and Cooling Towers: Fundamentals, Application, and Operation, Second Edition|last=III|first=Herbert W.

==Use in air conditioning==
[[File:Air Cooled Liquid Chiller.jpg|thumb|A liquid (glycol based) chiller with an air cooled condenser on the rooftop of a medium size commercial building.]]
In [[air conditioning]] systems, chilled water is typically distributed to heat exchangers, or '''coils''', in [[air handler]]s or other types of terminal devices which cool the air in their respective space(s). The water is then recirculated to the chiller to be recooled. These cooling coils transfer [[sensible heat]] and [[latent heat]] from the air to the chilled water, thus cooling and usually dehumidifying the air stream. A typical chiller for air conditioning applications is rated between 15 and 2000 [[Ton of refrigeration|tons]], and at least one manufacturer can produce chillers capable of up to 5,200 tons of cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TITAN Multistage Industrial Chillers (FORM 160.72-EG1)|publisher=York International|url=http://www.usair-eng.com/chillers/OMtitan.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilled water temperatures can range from {{convert|35|to|45|F|C}}, depending upon application requirements.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers {{cite web |url=http://www.ashrae.org/publications/page/158 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162917/http://ashrae.org/publications/page/158 |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the chillers for air conditioning systems are not operable or they are in need of repair or replacement, emergency chillers may be used to supply chilled water. Rental chillers are mounted on a [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] so that they can be quickly deployed to the site. Large chilled water [[hose]]s are used to connect between rental chillers and air conditioning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Request for Proposal #946 - Emergency Chillers Rentals|publisher=Montclair State University|url=http://www.montclair.edu/news/media/originals/Ad_Bid_946.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in industry==
In industrial application, chilled water or other liquid from the chiller is pumped through process or laboratory equipment.  Industrial chillers are used for controlled cooling of products, mechanisms and factory machinery in a wide range of industries.  They are often used in the plastic industries, injection and blow molding, metal working cutting oils, welding equipment, [[die-casting]] and machine tooling, chemical processing, pharmaceutical formulation, food and beverage processing, paper and cement processing, vacuum systems, X-ray diffraction, power supplies and power generation stations, analytical equipment, semiconductors, compressed air and gas cooling. They are also used to cool high-heat specialized items such as MRI machines and lasers, and in hospitals, hotels and campuses.

Chillers for industrial applications can be centralized, where a single chiller serves multiple cooling needs, or decentralized where each application or machine has its own chiller. Each approach has its advantages. It is also possible to have a combination of both centralized and decentralized chillers, especially if the cooling requirements are the same for some applications or points of use, but not all.

Decentralized chillers are usually small in size and cooling capacity, usually from {{convert|0.2|to|10|ST|LT t|3}}.  Centralized chillers generally have capacities ranging from ten tons to hundreds or thousands of tons.

Chilled water is used to [[Air conditioning|cool and dehumidify]] air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) facilities.  Water chillers can be water-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water-cooled chillers incorporate the use of [[cooling tower]]s which improve the chillers' thermodynamic effectiveness as compared to air-cooled chillers. This is due to heat rejection at or near the air's wet-bulb temperature rather than the higher, sometimes much higher, dry-bulb temperature. Evaporatively cooled chillers offer higher efficiencies than air-cooled chillers but lower than water-cooled chillers.

Water-cooled chillers are typically intended for indoor installation and operation, and are cooled by a separate condenser water loop and connected to outdoor cooling towers to expel heat to the atmosphere.

Air-cooled and evaporative cooled chillers are intended for outdoor installation and operation. Air-cooled machines are directly cooled by ambient air being mechanically circulated directly through the machine's condenser coil to expel heat to the atmosphere. Evaporative cooled machines are similar, except they implement a mist of water over the condenser coil to aid in condenser cooling, making the machine more efficient than a traditional air-cooled machine. No remote cooling tower is typically required with either of these types of packaged air-cooled or evaporatively cooled chillers.

Where available, cold water readily available in nearby water bodies might be used directly for cooling, replace or supplement cooling towers. The [[deep water source cooling]] system in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], is an example. It uses cold lake water to cool the chillers, which in turn are used to cool city buildings via a [[district cooling]] system. The return water is used to warm the city's drinking water supply, which is desirable in this cold climate. Whenever a chiller's heat rejection can be used for a productive purpose, in addition to the cooling function, very high thermal effectiveness is possible.

==Vapor-compression chiller technology==
A vapor compression chiller typically uses one of four types of compressor: [[Reciprocating compressor|Reciprocating]] compression, [[scroll compressor|scroll]] compression, [[rotary screw compressor|screw-driven]] compression, and [[centrifugal compressor|centrifugal]] compression are all mechanical machines that can be powered by [[electric motors]], [[steam turbine|steam]], or [[gas turbine]]s. They produce their cooling effect via the [[reverse-Rankine cycle]], also known as vapor-compression. With [[evaporative cooling]] heat rejection, their coefficients of performance (COPs) are very high; typically 4.0 or more.

::COP &lt;math&gt; = \frac{\text{Cooling power}}{\text{Input power}} &lt;/math&gt;

Current vapor-compression chiller technology is based on the "reverse-Rankine" cycle known as vapor-compression.
See the attached diagram which outlines the key components of the chiller system.
[[File:Water Cooled Chiller Diagram.png|thumb|Diagram showing the components of a water-cooled chiller]]
Key components of the chiller:

Refrigeration compressors are essentially a pump for refrigerant gas. The capacity of the compressor,
and hence the chiller cooling capacity, is measured in kilowatts input (kW), Horse power input (HP), or
volumetric flow (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h, ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h). The mechanism for compressing refrigerant gas differs between
compressors, and each has its own application. Common refrigeration compressors include
reciprocating, scroll, screw, or centrifugal. These can be powered by electric motors, steam turbines, or
gas turbines. Compressors can have an integrated motor from a specific manufacturer, or be open drive--allowing the connection to another type of mechanical connection. Compressors can also be either
Hermetic (welded closed) or semihermetic (bolted together).

In recent years, application of variable-speed drive (VSD) technology has increased efficiencies of vapor
compression chillers. The first VSD was applied to centrifugal compressor chillers in the late 1970s and
has become the norm as the cost of energy has increased. Now, VSDs are being applied to rotary screw
and scroll-technology compressors.

Condensers can be air-cooled, water-cooled, or evaporative. The condenser is a heat exchanger which
allows heat to migrate from the refrigerant gas to either water or air. Air cooled condenser are
manufactured from copper tubes (for the refrigerant flow) and aluminium fins (for the air flow). Each
condenser has a different material cost and they vary in terms of efficiency. With evaporative cooling
condensers, their coefficients-of-performance (COPs) are very high; typically 4.0 or more.

The expansion device or refrigerant metering device (RMD) restricts the flow of the liquid refrigerant
causing a pressure drop that vaporizes some of the refrigerant; this vaporization absorbs heat from nearby liquid refrigerant.
The RMD is located immediately prior to the evaporator so that the cold gas in the evaporator can absorb
heat from the water in the evaporator. There is a sensor for the RMD on the evaporator outlet side which
allows the RMD to regulate the refrigerant flow based on the chiller design requirement.

Evaporators can be plate type or shell and tube type. The evaporator is a heat exchanger which allows
the heat energy to migrate from the water stream into the refrigerant gas. During the state change of the remaining
liquid to gas, the refrigerant can absorb large amounts of heat without changing temperature.

==How absorption technology works==
The thermodynamic cycle of an [[absorption chiller]] is driven by a heat source; this heat is usually delivered to the chiller via steam, hot water, or combustion. Compared to electrically powered chillers, an absorption chiller has very low electrical power requirements - very rarely above 15&amp;nbsp;kW combined consumption for both the solution pump and the refrigerant pump.  However, its heat input requirements are large, and its COP is often 0.5 (single-effect) to 1.0 (double-effect). For the same tonnage capacity, an absorption chiller requires a much larger [[cooling tower]] than a vapor-compression chiller.  However, absorption chillers, from an energy-efficiency point of view, excel where cheap, low-grade heat or waste heat is readily available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.usf.edu/~hchen4/Cogeneration.htm|title=Converting Low-Grade Heat into Electrical Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In extremely sunny climates, [[solar energy]] has been used to operate [http://www.thermocold-hvacsystems.co.uk/absorption-chillers/ absorption chillers].

The single-effect absorption cycle uses water as the refrigerant and [[lithium bromide]] as the absorbent. It is the strong affinity that these two substances have for one another that makes the cycle work. The entire process occurs in almost a complete vacuum.

#'''Solution Pump''' : A dilute lithium bromide solution (63% concentration) is collected in the bottom of the absorber shell. From here, a hermetic solution pump moves the solution through a shell and tube heat exchanger for preheating.
#'''Generator''' : After exiting the heat exchanger, the dilute solution moves into the upper shell. The solution surrounds a bundle of tubes which carries either steam or hot water. The steam or hot water transfers heat into the pool of dilute lithium bromide solution. The solution boils, sending refrigerant vapor upward into the condenser and leaving behind concentrated lithium bromide. The concentrated lithium bromide solution moves down to the heat exchanger, where it is cooled by the weak solution being pumped up to the generator.
#'''Condenser''' : The refrigerant vapor migrates through mist eliminators to the condenser tube bundle. The refrigerant vapor condenses on the tubes. The heat is removed by the cooling water which moves through the inside of the tubes. As the refrigerant condenses, it collects in a trough at the bottom of the condenser.
#'''Evaporator''' : The refrigerant liquid moves from the condenser in the upper shell down to the evaporator in the lower shell and is sprayed over the evaporator tube bundle. Due to the extreme vacuum of the lower shell [6&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (0.8 kPa) absolute pressure], the refrigerant liquid boils at approximately {{convert|39|F|C}}, creating the refrigerant effect. (This vacuum is created by hygroscopic action - the strong affinity lithium bromide has for water - in the Absorber directly below.)
#'''Absorber''' : As the refrigerant vapor migrates to the absorber from the evaporator, the strong lithium bromide solution from the generator is sprayed over the top of the absorber tube bundle. The strong lithium bromide solution actually pulls the refrigerant vapor into solution, creating the extreme vacuum in the evaporator. The absorption of the refrigerant vapor into the lithium bromide solution also generates heat which is removed by the cooling water.  Now the dilute lithium bromide solution collects in the bottom of the lower shell, where it flows down to the solution pump. The chilling cycle is now completed and the process begins once again.&lt;ref name="matsu1"&gt;http://matsu.com.au/chiller-range/chiller-range-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial chiller technology===
Industrial chillers typically come as complete, packaged, closed-loop systems, including the chiller unit, [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], and pump station with recirculating pump, expansion valve, no-flow shutdown, internal cold water control. The internal tank helps maintain cold water temperature and prevents temperature spikes from occurring. Closed-loop industrial chillers recirculate a clean coolant or clean water with condition additives at a constant temperature and pressure to increase the stability and reproducibility of water-cooled machines and instruments. The water flows from the chiller to the application's point of use and back.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

If the water temperature differentials between inlet and outlet are high, then a large external water tank would be used to store the cold water. In this case the chilled water is not going directly from the chiller to the application, but goes to the external water tank which acts as a sort of "temperature buffer." The cold water tank is much larger than the internal water goes from the external tank to the application and the return hot water from the application goes back to the external tank, not to the chiller.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The less common open loop industrial chillers control the temperature of a liquid in an open tank or sump by constantly recirculating it. The liquid is drawn from the tank, pumped through the chiller and back to the tank. In industrial water chillers is the use of water cooling instead of air cooling. In this case the condenser does not cool the hot refrigerant with ambient air, but uses water that is cooled by a [[cooling tower]]. This development allows a reduction in energy requirements by more than 15% and also allows a significant reduction in the size of the chiller, due to the small surface area of the water-based condenser and the absence of fans. Additionally, the absence of fans allows for significantly reduced noise levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Most industrial chillers use refrigeration as the media for cooling, but some rely on simpler techniques such as air or water flowing over coils containing the coolant to regulate temperature.  Water is the most commonly used coolant within process chillers, although coolant mixtures (mostly water with a coolant additive to enhance heat dissipation) are frequently employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPDRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=water+chiller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA8u6Q0v7QAhUlw4MKHdU-BxQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q==%20additive&amp;f=false|title=HVAC Water Chillers and Cooling Towers: Fundamentals, Application, and Operation, Second Edition|last=III|first=Herbert W.

==Industrial chiller selection==
Important specifications to consider when searching for cumond industrial chillers include the total life cycle cost, the power source, chiller IP rating, chiller cooling capacity, evaporator capacity, evaporator material, evaporator type, condenser material, condenser capacity, ambient temperature, motor fan type, noise level, internal piping materials, number of compressors, type of compressor, number of fridge circuits, coolant requirements, fluid discharge temperature, and COP (the ratio between the cooling capacity in RT to the energy consumed by the whole chiller in KW). For medium to large chillers this should range from 3.5 to 7.0, with higher values meaning higher efficiency.  Chiller efficiency is often specified in kilowatts per [[Air conditioning#Energy|refrigeration ton]] (kW/RT).

Process pump specifications that are important to consider include the process flow, process pressure, pump material, elastomer and mechanical shaft seal material, motor voltage, motor electrical class, motor IP rating and pump rating. If the cold water temperature is lower than −5&amp;nbsp;°C, then a special pump needs to be used to be able to pump the high concentrations of ethylene glycol. Other important specifications include the internal water tank size and materials and full load current.

Control panel features that should be considered when selecting between industrial chillers include the local control panel, remote control panel, fault indicators, temperature indicators, and pressure indicators.

Additional features include emergency alarms, hot gas bypass, city water switchover, and casters.&lt;ref name="matsu1"/&gt;

Demountable chillers are also an option for deployment in remote areas and where the conditions may be hot and dusty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matsu.com.au/mining|title=Summit Matsu Chillers - Chillers for Mining  - Summit Matsu Chillers|work=Summit Matsu Chillers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigerants==
{{Main article|Refrigerant}}

A vapor-compression chiller uses a [[refrigerant]] internally as its working fluid.  Many refrigerants options are available; when selecting a chiller, the application cooling temperature requirements and refrigerant's cooling characteristics need to be matched.  Important parameters to consider are the operating temperatures and pressures.

There are several environmental factors that concern refrigerants, and also affect the future availability for chiller applications.  This is a key consideration in intermittent applications where a large chiller may last for 25 years or more. [[Ozone depletion potential]] (ODP) and [[global warming potential]] (GWP) of the refrigerant need to be considered. ODP and GWP data for some of the more common vapor-compression refrigerants (noting that many of these refrigerants are highly flammable and/or toxic):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''commissioned survey''' is a kind of archaeological and social survey performed in return for money or goods. Typically, these surveys were conducted in the pre [[Colony|colonial Era]], as part of Age of European Enlightenment to study territories before colonization. They would usually extend to significant and detailed efforts by trading companies to study institutions of indigenous communities as a precursor to colonial powers exerting colonial supremacy. An example would be when soldiers of [[East India Company]] were paid fees to study exotic lands, customs, cultures and literatures of the colonized world. The end product of a commissioned survey would usually be a report or book in a [[Languages of Europe|European language]], which could form a basis for [[Law|law making]] by colonial powers.

* [[John von Neumann]]'s 1945 paper, [[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]], which described an organization of logical elements;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC|last=Neumann|first=John|publisher=|year=1945|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
*[[Alan M. Turing|Alan Turing]]'s more detailed ''Proposed Electronic Calculator'' for the [[Automatic Computing Engine]], also 1945 and which cited [[John von Neumann]]'s paper.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in B. J. Copeland (Ed.), "Alan Turing's Automatic Computing Engine", OUP, 2005, pp. 369-454.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “architecture” in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson and [[Fred Brooks|Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.]], members of the Machine Organization department in IBM’s main research center in 1959. Johnson had the opportunity to write a proprietary research communication about the [[IBM 7030 Stretch|Stretch]], an IBM-developed [[supercomputer]] for [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (at the time known as Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory). To describe the level of detail for discussing the luxuriously embellished computer, he noted that his description of formats, instruction types, hardware parameters, and speed enhancements were at the level of “system architecture” – a term that seemed more useful than “machine organization.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/Stretch/pdfs/05-10/102634114.pdf|last1=Johnson|first1=Lyle|title=A Description of Stretch|page=1|year=1960|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Brooks, a Stretch designer, started Chapter 2 of a book (Planning a Computer System: Project Stretch, ed. W. Buchholz, 1962) by writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning a Computer System|last=Buchholz|first=Werner|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Computer architecture, like other architecture, is the art of determining the needs of the user of a structure and then designing to meet those needs as effectively as possible within economic and technological constraints.}}

Brooks went on to help develop the [[IBM System/360]] (now called the [[IBM zSeries]]) line of computers, in which “architecture” became a noun defining “what the user needs to know”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/system360/|title=System 360, From Computers to Computer Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=IBM100|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, computer users came to use the term in many less-explicit ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellige|first1=Hans Dieter|title=Geschichten der Informatik: Visionen, Paradigmen, Leitmotive|chapter=Die Genese von Wissenschaftskonzeptionen der Computerarchitektur:  Vom "system of organs" zum Schichtmodell des Designraums| pages=411-472|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest computer architectures were designed on paper and then directly built into the final hardware form.&lt;ref&gt;ACE underwent seven paper designs in one year, before a prototype was initiated in 1948. [B. J. Copeland (Ed.), "Alan Turing's Automatic Computing Engine", OUP, 2005, p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, computer architecture prototypes were physically built in the form of a [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) computer—such as the prototypes of the [[Motorola 6800#Development team|6800]] and the [[PA-RISC]]—tested, and tweaked, before committing to the final hardware form.
As of the 1990s, new computer architectures are typically "built", tested, and tweaked—inside some other computer architecture in a [[computer architecture simulator]]; or inside a FPGA as a [[soft microprocessor]]; or both—before committing to the final hardware form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/CDAintro.html|title=Organization of Computer Systems|last=Schmalz|first=|date=|website=UF CISE|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subcategories ==
The discipline of computer architecture has three main subcategories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|edition=Third|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Instruction set|Instruction Set Architecture]]'', or ISA.  The ISA defines the [[machine code]] that a [[computer processor|processor]] reads and acts upon as well as the [[word size]], [[addressing mode|memory address modes]], [[processor register]]s, and [[data type]].
# ''[[Microarchitecture]]'', or ''computer organization'' describes how a particular [[Central processing unit|processor]] will implement the ISA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Computer Science, Engineering, and Technology|last=Laplante|first=Phillip A.|year=2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-2691-5|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of a computer's [[CPU cache]] for instance, is an issue that generally has nothing to do with the ISA.
# ''[[Systems design|System Design]]'' includes all of the other hardware components within a computing system.  These include:
## Data processing other than the CPU, such as [[direct memory access]] (DMA)
## Other issues such as [[virtualization]], [[multiprocessing]], and [[software]] features.

There are other types of computer architecture. The following types are used in bigger companies like Intel, and count for 1% of all of computer architecture
* Macroarchitecture: [[architectural layer]]s more abstract than microarchitecture
* Assembly Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): A smart assembler may convert an abstract assembly language common to a group of machines into slightly different [[machine language]] for different [[implementation]]s
* Programmer Visible Macroarchitecture: higher level language tools such as [[compiler]]s may define a consistent interface or contract to programmers using them, abstracting differences between underlying ISA, UISA, and [[microarchitecture]]s. E.g. the [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] standards define different Programmer Visible Macroarchitecture.
* UISA (Microcode Instruction Set Architecture)—a group of machines with different hardware level microarchitectures may share a common microcode architecture, and hence a UISA.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
* Pin Architecture: The hardware functions that a [[microprocessor]] should provide to a hardware platform, e.g., the [[x86]] pins A20M, FERR/IGNNE or FLUSH. Also, messages that the processor should emit so that external [[CPU cache|caches]] can be invalidated (emptied). Pin architecture functions are more flexible than ISA functions because external hardware can adapt to new encodings, or change from a pin to a message. The term "architecture" fits, because the functions must be provided for compatible systems, even if the detailed method changes.

==Roles==

===Definition===
The purpose is to design a computer that maximizes performance while keeping power consumption in check, costs low relative to the amount of expected performance, and is also very reliable.
For this, many aspects are to be considered which includes instruction set design, functional organization, logic design, and implementation.
The implementation involves integrated circuit design, packaging, power, and cooling. Optimization of the design requires familiarity with compilers, operating systems to logic design, and packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis501-Fall11/lectures/00_intro.pdf|title=What is computer architecture?|last=Martin|first=Milo|date=|website=UPENN|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction set architecture===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main | Instruction set architecture}}
An instruction set architecture (ISA) is the interface between the computer's software and hardware and also can be viewed as the programmer's view of the machine. Computers do not understand [[high-level programming language]]s such as Java, C++, or most programming languages used. A processor only understands instructions encoded in some numerical fashion, usually as [[Binary numeral system|binary number]]s. Software tools, such as [[compiler]]s, translate those high level languages into instructions that the processor can understand.

Besides instructions, the ISA defines items in the computer that are available to a program&amp;mdash;e.g. [[data type]]s, [[Processor register|registers]], [[addressing mode]]s, and memory.  Instructions locate these available items with register indexes (or names) and memory addressing modes.

The ISA of a computer is usually described in a small instruction manual, which describes how the instructions are encoded. Also, it may define short (vaguely) mnemonic names for the instructions. The names can be recognized by a software development tool called an [[assembler (computer programming)|assembler]].  An assembler is a computer program that translates a human-readable form of the ISA into a computer-readable form.  [[Disassembler]]s are also widely available, usually in [[debugger]]s and software programs to isolate and correct malfunctions in binary computer programs.

ISAs vary in quality and completeness.  A good ISA compromises between programmer convenience (how easy the code is to understand), size of the code (how much code is required to do a specific action), cost of the computer to interpret the instructions (more complexity means more hardware needed to decode and execute the instructions), and speed of the computer (with more complex decoding hardware comes longer decode time).  Memory organization defines how instructions interact with the memory, and how memory interacts with itself.

During design [[Emulator|emulation]] software (emulators) can run programs written in a proposed instruction set. Modern emulators can measure size, cost, and speed to determine if a particular ISA is meeting its goals.

===Computer organization===
{{main | Microarchitecture}}
Computer organization helps optimize performance-based products. For example, software engineers need to know the processing power of processors. They may need to optimize software in order to gain the most performance for the lowest price. This can require quite detailed analysis of the computer's organization.  For example, in a SD card, the designers might need to arrange the card so that the most data can be processed in the fastest possible way.

Computer organization also helps plan the selection of a processor for a particular project. Multimedia projects may need very rapid data access, while virtual machines may need fast interrupts. Sometimes certain tasks need additional components as well.  For example, a computer capable of running a virtual machine needs [[virtual memory]] hardware so that the memory of different virtual computers can be kept separated. Computer organization and features also affect power consumption and processor cost.

===Implementation===
{{Main|Implementation}}
Once an instruction set and micro-architecture are designed, a practical machine must be developed. This design process is called the ''implementation''. Implementation is usually not considered architectural design, but rather hardware [[Engineering design process|design engineering]]. Implementation can be further broken down into several steps:
* '''Logic Implementation''' designs the circuits required at a logic gate level
* '''Circuit Implementation''' does [[transistor]]-level designs of basic elements (gates, multiplexers, latches etc.) as well as of some larger blocks ([[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s, caches etc.) that may be implemented at the log gate level, or even at the physical level if the design calls for it.
* '''Physical Implementation''' draws physical circuits.  The different circuit components are placed in a chip [[Floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplan]] or on a board and the wires connecting them are created.
* '''Design Validation''' tests the computer as a whole to see if it works in all situations and all timings.  Once the design validation process starts, the design at the logic level are tested using logic emulators. However, this is usually too slow to run realistic test.  So, after making corrections based on the first test, prototypes are constructed using Field-Programmable Gate-Arrays ([[FPGA]]s). Most hobby projects stop at this stage.  The final step is to test prototype integrated circuits.  Integrated circuits may require several redesigns to fix problems.

For [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, the entire implementation process is organized differently and is often referred to as [[CPU design]].

==Design goals==
The exact form of a computer system depends on the constraints and goals. Computer architectures usually trade off standards, power versus performance, cost, memory capacity, [[latency (engineering)|latency]] (latency is the amount of time that it takes for information from one node to travel to the source) and throughput. Sometimes other considerations, such as features, size, weight, reliability, and expandability are also factors.

The most common scheme does an in depth power analysis and figures out how to keep power consumption low, while maintaining adequate performance.

===Performance===
Modern computer performance is often described in IPC (instructions per [[Clock rate|cycle]]).  This measures the efficiency of the architecture at any clock frequency.  Since a faster rate can make a faster computer, this is a useful measurement. Older computers had IPC counts as low as 0.1 [[instructions per cycle]].  Simple modern processors easily reach near 1.  [[Superscalar]] processors may reach three to five IPC by executing several instructions per clock cycle.

Counting machine language instructions would be misleading because they can do varying amounts of work in different ISAs. The "instruction" in the standard measurements is not a count of the ISA's actual machine language instructions, but a unit of measurement, usually based on the speed of the [[VAX]] computer architecture.

Many people used to measure a computer's speed by the clock rate (usually in MHz or GHz). This refers to the cycles per second of the main clock of the CPU. However, this metric is somewhat misleading, as a machine with a higher clock rate may not necessarily have greater performance. As a result, manufacturers have moved away from clock speed as a measure of performance.

Other factors influence speed, such as the mix of [[functional unit]]s, [[computer bus|bus]] speeds, available memory, and the type and order of instructions in the programs.

There are two main types of speed: latency and throughput. Latency is the time between the start of a process and its completion. Throughput is the amount of work done per unit time.  [[Interrupt latency]] is the guaranteed maximum response time of the system to an electronic event (like when the disk drive finishes moving some data).

Performance is affected by a very wide range of design choices — for example, [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelining]] a processor usually makes latency worse, but makes throughput better. Computers that control machinery usually need low interrupt latencies. These computers operate in a [[real-time computing|real-time]] environment and fail if an operation is not completed in a specified amount of time. For example, computer-controlled anti-lock brakes must begin braking within a predictable, short time after the brake pedal is sensed or else failure of the brake will occur.

[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmark]]ing takes all these factors into account by measuring the time a computer takes to run through a series of test programs. Although benchmarking shows strengths, it shouldn't be how you choose a computer. Often the measured machines split on different measures. For example, one system might handle scientific applications quickly, while another might render video games more smoothly. Furthermore, designers may target and add special features to their products, through hardware or software, that permit a specific benchmark to execute quickly but don't offer similar advantages to general tasks.

===Power efficiency===
{{Main|Low-power electronics}}
Power efficiency is another important measurement in modern computers. A higher power efficiency can often be traded for lower speed or higher cost. The typical measurement when referring to power consumption in computer architecture is MIPS/W (millions of instructions per second per watt).

Modern circuits have less power required per transistor as the number of transistors per chip grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eacharya.inflibnet.ac.in/data-server/eacharya-documents/53e0c6cbe413016f23443704_INFIEP_33/192/ET/33-192-ET-V1-S1__ssed_unit_4_module_10_integrated_circuits_and_fabrication_e-text.pdf|title=Integrated circuits and fabrication|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because each transistor that is put in a new chip requires its own power supply and requires new pathways to be built to power it. However the number of transistors per chip is starting to increase at a slower rate. Therefore, power efficiency is starting to become as important, if not more important than fitting more and more transistors into a single chip. Recent processor designs have shown this emphasis as they put more focus on power efficiency rather than cramming as many transistors into a single chip as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/w/solution/mod_ap/8895/?CID=AFL-hq-mul-0813-11000170|title=Exynos 9 Series (8895)|last=|first=|date=|website=Samsung|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of embedded computers, power efficiency has long been an important goal next to throughput and latency.

===Shifts in market demand===
Increases in publicly released refresh rates have grown slowly over the past few years, with respect to vast leaps in power consumption reduction and miniaturization demand. This has led to a new demand for longer battery life and reductions in size due to the mobile technology being produced at a greater rate. This change in focus from greater refresh rates to power consumption and miniaturization can be shown by the significant reductions in power consumption, as much as 50%, that were  reported by Intel in their release of the [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|Haswell microarchitecture]]; where they dropped their power consumption benchmark from 30-40 watts down to 10-20 watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/white-paper/resources-xeon-measuring-processor-power-paper.pdf|title=Measuring Processor Power TDP vs ACP|last=|first=|date=April 2011|website=Intel|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing this to the processing speed increase of 3&amp;nbsp;GHz to 4&amp;nbsp;GHz (2002 to 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2012/3827-spring/advanced-arch-2011.pdf|title=History of Processor Performance|last=|first=|date=24 April 2012|website=cs.columbia.edu|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be seen that the focus in research and development are shifting away from refresh rates and moving towards consuming less power and taking up less space.

'''Computer security compromised by hardware failure''' is a branch of [[computer security]] applied to hardware.
The objective of computer security includes protection of information and property from theft, corruption, or [[natural disaster]], while allowing the information and property to remain accessible and productive to its intended users.&lt;ref name="ComSec1"&gt;[[Computer security]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such secret information could be retrieved by different ways. This article focus on the retrieval of data thanks to misused hardware or hardware failure. Hardware could be misused or exploited to get secret data. This article collects main types of attack that can be lead in a data thief.

Computer security can be comprised by devices, such as keyboards, monitors or printers (thanks to electromagnetic or acoustic emanation for example) or by components of the computer, such as the memory, the network card or the processor (thanks to time or temperature analysis for example).

== Devices ==

=== Monitor ===
The monitor is the main device used to access data on a computer.  It has been shown that monitors radiate or reflect data on their environment, potentially giving attackers access to information displayed on the monitor.

==== Electromagnetic emanations ====
Video display units radiate:
* narrowband harmonics of the digital clock signals ;
* broadband harmonics of the various 'random' digital signals such as the video signal.&lt;ref name="Eck1"&gt;[[#Eck1|Eck, 1985, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as compromising emanations or [[TEMPEST]] radiation, a code word for a U.S. government programme aimed at attacking the problem, the electromagnetic broadcast of data has been a significant concern in sensitive computer applications. Eavesdroppers can reconstruct video screen content from radio frequency emanations.&lt;ref name="Kuhn1"&gt;[[#Kuhn1|Kuhn,1998, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Each (radiated) harmonic of the video signal shows a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal. It is therefore possible to reconstruct the picture displayed on the video display unit from the radiated emission by means of a normal television receiver.&lt;ref name="Eck1"/&gt; If no preventive measures are taken, eavesdropping on a video display unit is possible at distances up to several hundreds of meters, using only a normal black-and-white TV receiver, a directional antenna and an antenna amplifier. It is even possible to pick up information from some types of video display units at a distance of over 1 kilometer. If more sophisticated receiving and decoding equipment is used, the maximum distance can be much greater.&lt;ref name="Eck2"&gt;[[#Eck1|Eck, 1985, p.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compromising reflections ====
What is displayed by the monitor is reflected on the environment. The time-varying diffuse reflections of the light emitted by a CRT monitor can be exploited to recover the original monitor image.&lt;ref name="[Back1]"&gt;[[#Back1|Backes, 2010, p.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an eavesdropping technique for spying at a distance on data that is displayed on an arbitrary computer screen, including the currently prevalent LCD monitors.

The technique exploits reflections of the screen’s optical emanations in various objects that one commonly finds in close proximity to the screen and uses those reflections to recover the original screen content. Such objects include eyeglasses, tea pots, spoons, plastic bottles, and even the eye of the user. This attack can be successfully mounted to spy on even small fonts using inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment (less than 1500 dollars) from a distance of up to 10 meters. Relying on more expensive equipment allowed to conduct this attack from over 30 meters away, demonstrating that similar attacks are feasible from the other side of the street or from a close-by building.&lt;ref name="[Back3]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many objects that may be found at a usual workplace can be exploited to retrieve information on a computer’s display by an outsider.&lt;ref name="[Back4]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly good results were obtained from reflections in a user’s eyeglasses or a tea pot located on the desk next to the screen. Reflections that stem from the eye of the user also provide good results. However, eyes are harder to spy on at a distance because they are fast-moving objects and require high exposure times. Using more expensive equipment with lower exposure times helps to remedy this problem.&lt;ref name="[Back5]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reflections gathered from curved surfaces on close-by objects indeed pose a substantial threat to the confidentiality of data displayed on the screen. Fully invalidating this threat without at the same time hiding the screen from the legitimate user seems difficult, without using curtains on the windows or similar forms of strong optical shielding. Most users, however, will not be aware of this risk and may not be willing to close the curtains on a nice day.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The reflection of an object, a computer display, in a curved mirror creates a virtual image that is located behind the reflecting surface. For a flat mirror this virtual image has the same size and is located behind the mirror at the same distance as the original object. For curved mirrors, however, the situation is more complex.&lt;ref name="[Back6]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Keyboard ===

==== Electromagnetic emanations ====
Computer keyboards are often used to transmit confidential data such as passwords. Since they contain electronic components, keyboards emit electromagnetic waves. These emanations could reveal sensitive information such as keystrokes.&lt;ref name="Vuag1"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Electromagnetic emanations have turned out to constitute a security threat to computer equipment.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt; The figure below presents how a keystroke is retrieved and what material is necessary.

[[File:Keyboard stroke retrieval.png|thumb|center|969px|alt=|Diagram presenting all material necessary to detect keystrokes]]

The approach is to acquire the raw signal directly from the antenna and to process the entire captured electromagnetic spectrum. Thanks to this method, four different kinds of compromising electromagnetic emanations have been detected, generated by '''wired and wireless''' keyboards. These emissions lead to a full or a partial recovery of the keystrokes. The best practical attack fully recovered 95% of the keystrokes of a PS/2 keyboard at a distance up to 20 meters, even through walls.&lt;ref name="Vuag1"/&gt; Because each keyboard has a specific fingerprint based on the clock frequency inconsistencies, it can determine the source keyboard of a compromising emanation, even if multiple keyboards from the same model are used at the same time.&lt;ref name="Vuag2"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The four different kinds way of compromising electromagnetic emanations are described below.

===== The Falling Edge Transition Technique =====
When a key is pressed, released or held down, the keyboard sends a packet of information known as a scan code to the computer.&lt;ref name="Vuag3"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol used to transmit these scan codes is a bidirectional serial communication, based on four wires: Vcc (5 volts), ground, data and clock.&lt;ref name="Vuag3"/&gt; Clock and data signals are identically generated. Hence, the compromising emanation detected is the combination of both signals. However, the edges of the data and the clock lines are not superposed. Thus, they can be easily separated to obtain independent signals.&lt;ref name="Vuag4"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.6]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The Generalized Transition Technique =====
The Falling Edge Transition attack is limited to a partial recovery of the keystrokes. This is a significant limitation.&lt;ref name="Vuag5"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.7]]&lt;/ref&gt; The GTT is a falling edge transition attack improved, which recover almost all keystrokes. Indeed, between two traces, there is exactly one data rising edge. If attackers are able to detect this transition, they can fully recover the keystrokes.&lt;ref name="Vuag5"/&gt;

===== The Modulation Technique =====
Harmonics compromising electromagnetic emissions come from unintentional emanations such as radiations emitted by the clock, non-linear elements, crosstalk, ground pollution, etc. Determining theoretically the reasons of these compromising radiations is a very complex task.&lt;ref name="Vuag6"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.8]]&lt;/ref&gt; These harmonics correspond to a carrier of approximately 4&amp;nbsp;MHz which is very likely the internal clock of the micro-controller inside the keyboard. These harmonics are correlated with both clock and data signals, which describe modulated signals (in amplitude and frequency) and the full state of both clock and data signals. This means that the scan code can be completely recovered from these harmonics.&lt;ref name="Vuag6"/&gt;

===== The Matrix Scan Technique =====
Keyboard manufacturers arrange the keys in a matrix. The keyboard controller, often an 8-bit processor, parses columns one-by-one and recovers the state of 8 keys at once. This matrix scan process can be described as 192 keys (some keys may not be used, for instance modern keyboards use 104/105 keys) arranged in 24 columns and 8 rows.&lt;ref name="Vuag7"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; These columns are continuously pulsed one-by-one for at least 3μs. Thus, these leads may act as an antenna and generate electromagnetic emanations. If an attacker is able to capture these emanations, he can easily recover the column of the pressed key. Even if this signal does not fully describe the pressed key, it still gives partial information on the transmitted scan code, i.e. the column number.&lt;ref name="Vuag7"/&gt;

Note that the matrix scan routine loops continuously. When no key is pressed, we still have a signal composed of multiple equidistant peaks. These emanations may be used to remotely detect the presence of powered computers. Concerning wireless keyboards, the wireless data burst transmission can be used as an electromagnetic trigger to detect exactly when a key is pressed, while the matrix scan emanations are used to determine the column it belongs to.&lt;ref name="Vuag7"/&gt;

==== Acoustic emanations ====
Attacks against emanations caused by human typing have attracted interest in recent years. In particular, works showed that keyboard acoustic emanations do leak information that can be exploited to reconstruct the typed text.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"&gt;[[#Ber1|Berger, 2006, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

PC keyboards, notebook keyboards are vulnerable to attacks based on differentiating the sound emanated by different keys.&lt;ref name="[Aso1]"&gt;[[#Aso1|Asonov, 2004, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; This attack takes as input an audio signal containing a recording of a single word typed by a single person on a keyboard, and a dictionary of words. It is assumed that the typed word is present in the dictionary. The aim of the attack is to reconstruct the original word from the signal.&lt;ref name="[Ber2]"&gt;[[#Ber1|Berger, 2006, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; This attack, taking as input a 10-minute sound recording of a user typing English text using a keyboard, and then recovering up to 96% of typed characters.&lt;ref name="[Zhu1]"&gt;[[#Zhu1|Zhuang, 2005, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is inexpensive because the other hardware required is a parabolic microphone and non-invasive because it does not require physical intrusion into the system. The attack employs a neural network to recognize the key being pressed.&lt;ref name="[Aso1]"/&gt; It combines signal processing and efficient data structures and algorithms, to successfully reconstruct single words of 7-13 characters from a recording of the clicks made when typing them on a keyboard.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt; The sound of clicks can differ slightly from key to key, because the keys are positioned at different positions on the keyboard plate, although the clicks of different keys sound similar to the human ear.&lt;ref name="[Aso1]"/&gt;

On average, there were only 0.5 incorrect recognitions per 20 clicks, which shows the exposure of keyboard to the eavesdropping using this attack.&lt;ref name="[Aso2]"&gt;[[#Aso1|Asonov, 2004, p.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The attack is very efficient, taking under 20 seconds per word on a standard PC. A 90% or better success rate of finding the correct word for words of 10 or more characters, and a success rate of 73% over all the words tested.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt; In practice, a human attacker can typically determine if text is random. An attacker can also identify occasions when the user types user names and passwords.&lt;ref name="[Zhu2]"&gt;[[#Zhu1|Zhuang, 2005, p.4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Short audio signals containing a single word, with seven or more characters long was considered. This means that the signal is only a few seconds long. Such short words are often chosen as a password.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt; The dominant factors affecting the attack's success are the word length, and more importantly, the number of repeated characters within the word.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt;

This is a procedure that makes it possible to efficiently uncover a word out of audio recordings of keyboard click sounds.&lt;ref name="[Ber3]"&gt;[[#Ber1|Berger, 2006, p.8]]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, extracting information out of an other type of emanations was demonstrated: acoustic emanations from mechanical devices such as dot-matrix printers.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt;

==== Video Eavesdropping on Keyboard ====
While extracting private information by watching somebody typing on a keyboard might seem to be an easy task, it becomes extremely challenging if it has to be automated. However, an automated tool is needed in the case of long-lasting surveillance procedures or long user activity, as a human being is able to reconstruct only a few characters per minute. The paper [[#Balz|"ClearShot: Eavesdropping on Keyboard Input from Video"]] presents a novel approach to automatically recovering the text being typed on a keyboard, based solely on a video of the user typing.&lt;ref name="Balz1"&gt;[[#Balz1|Balzarotti, 2008, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatically recognizing the keys being pressed by a user is a hard problem that requires sophisticated motion analysis. Experiments show that, for a human, reconstructing a few sentences requires lengthy hours of slow-motion analysis of the video.&lt;ref name="Balz2"&gt;[[#Balz1|Balzarotti, 2008, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The attacker might install a surveillance device in the room of the victim, might take control of an existing camera by exploiting a vulnerability in the camera’s control software, or might simply point a mobile phone with an integrated camera at the laptop’s keyboard when the victim is working in a public space.&lt;ref name="Balz2"/&gt;

Balzarotti's analysis is divided into two main phases (figure below).
The '''first phase''' analyzes the video recorded by the camera using computer vision techniques. For each frame of the video, the computer vision analysis computes the set of keys that were likely pressed, the set of keys that were certainly not pressed, and the position of space characters. Because the results of this phase of the analysis are noisy, '''a second phase''', called the text analysis, is required. The goal of this phase is to remove errors using both language and context-sensitive techniques. The result of this phase is the reconstructed text, where each word is represented by a list of possible candidates, ranked by likelihood.&lt;ref name="Balz2"/&gt;

[[File:ClearShot diagram.png|thumb|center|1048px|alt=|Diagram presenting steps to go through when detecting keystroke with video input]]

=== Printer ===

==== Acoustic emanations ====
With acoustic emanations, an attack that recovers what a dot-matrix printer processing English text is printing is possible. It is based on a record of the sound the printer makes, if the microphone is close enough to it. This attack recovers up to 72% of printed words, and up to 95% if knowledge about the text are done, with a microphone at a distance of 10&amp;nbsp;cm from the printer.&lt;ref name="[Back10]"&gt;[[#Back1|Backes, 2010, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After an upfront training phase ("a" in the picture below), the attack ("b" in the picture below) is fully automated and uses a combination of machine learning, audio processing, and speech recognition techniques, including spectrum features, Hidden Markov Models and linear classification.&lt;ref name="[Back1]"/&gt; The fundamental reason why the reconstruction of the printed text works is that, the emitted sound becomes louder if more needles strike the paper at a given time.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt; There is a correlation between the number of needles and the intensity of the acoustic emanation.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt;

A training phase was conducted where words from a dictionary are printed and characteristic sound features of these words are extracted and stored in a database. The trained characteristic features was used to recognize the printed English text.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt; But, this task is not trivial. Major challenges include :
# Identifying and extracting sound features that suitably capture the acoustic emanation of dot-matrix printers;
# Compensating for the blurred and overlapping features that are induced by the substantial decay time of the emanations;
# Identifying and eliminating wrongly recognized words to increase the overall percentage of correctly identified words (recognition rate).&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt;

[[File:Printer AccousticEmanation.png|thumb|center|988px|alt=|Diagram presenting phases when retrieving data from a printer]]

== Computer components ==

=== Network Interface Card ===

==== Timing attack ====
Timing attacks enable an attacker to extract secrets maintained in a security system by observing the time it takes the system to respond to various queries.&lt;ref name="[Brum1p1]"&gt;[[#Brum1|Brumley, 2003, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secure Shell|SSH]] is designed to provide a secure channel between two hosts. Despite the encryption and authentication mechanisms it uses, SSH has weaknesses. In interactive mode, every individual keystroke that a user types is sent to the remote machine in a separate IP packet immediately after the key is pressed, which leaks the inter-keystroke timing information of users’ typing. Below, the picture represents the command ''su'' processed through a SSH connection.
[[File:Ssh timingattack.png|500px|thumb|center||alt=|Network messages sent between the host and the client for the command 'su' – numbers are size of network packet in byte]]

A very simple statistical techniques suffice to reveal sensitive information such as the length of users’ passwords or even root passwords. By using advanced statistical techniques on timing information collected from the network, the eavesdropper can learn significant information about what users type in SSH sessions.&lt;ref name="[Song1p1]"&gt;[[#Song1|Song, 2001, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the time it takes the operating system to send out the packet after the keypress is in general negligible comparing to the interkeystroke timing, this also enables an eavesdropper to learn the precise interkeystroke timings of users’ typing from the arrival times of packets.&lt;ref name="[Song1p2]"&gt;[[#Song1|Song, 2001, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===

==== Physical chemistry ====
Data remanence problems not only affect obvious areas such as RAM and non-volatile memory cells but can also occur in other areas of the device through hot-carrier effects (which change the characteristics of the semiconductors in the device) and various other effects which are examined alongside the more obvious memory-cell remanence problems.&lt;ref name="Gut1"&gt;[[#Gut1|Gutmann, 2001, p. 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to analyse and recover data from these cells and from semiconductor devices in general long after it should (in theory) have vanished.&lt;ref name="Gut2"&gt;[[#Gut1|Gutmann, 2001, p. 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Electromigration, which means to physically move the atom to new locations (to physically alter the device itself) is another type of attack.&lt;ref name="Gut1" /&gt; It involves the relocation of metal atoms due to high current densities, a phenomenon in which atoms are carried along by an "electron wind" in the opposite direction to the conventional current, producing voids at the negative electrode and hillocks and whiskers at the positive electrode. Void formation leads to a local increase in current density and Joule heating (the interaction of electrons and metal ions to produce thermal energy), producing further electromigration effects. When the external stress is removed, the disturbed system tends to relax back to its original equilibrium state, resulting in a backflow which heals some of the electromigration damage. In the long term though, this can cause device failure, but in less extreme cases it simply serves to alter a device’s operating characteristics in noticeable ways.

For example, the excavations of voids leads to increased wiring resistance and the growth of whiskers leads to contact formation and current leakage.&lt;ref name="Gut10"&gt;[[#Gut1|Gutmann, 2001, p.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a conductor which exhibits whisker growth due to electromigration is shown in the figure below:

[[File:Whisker growth.jpg|thumb|center|969px|alt=|Whisker growth due to electromigration]]

One example which exhibits void formation (in this case severe enough to have led to complete failure) is shown in this figure:

[[File:Void formation.jpg|thumb|center|969px|alt=|Void formation due to electromigration]]

==== Temperature ====
Contrary to popular assumption, DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for several seconds after power is lost, even at room temperature and even if removed from a motherboard.&lt;ref name="Hald1p1"&gt;[[#Hald1|Halderman, 2008, p1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many products do cryptographic and other security-related computations using secret keys or other variables that the equipment’s operator must not be able to read out or alter. The usual solution is for the secret data to be kept in volatile memory inside a tamper-sensing enclosure. Security processors typically store secret key material in static RAM, from which power is removed if the device is tampered with. At temperatures below −20&amp;nbsp;°C, the contents of SRAM can be ‘frozen’. It is interesting to know the period of time for which a static RAM device will retain data once the power has been removed. Low temperatures can increase the data retention time of SRAM to many seconds or even minutes.&lt;ref name="Sko1p3"&gt;[[#Sko1|Skorobogatov, 2002, p.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Read/Write exploits thanks to FireWire ====
Maximillian Dornseif presented a technique in [[#Dorn1|these slides]], which let him take the control of an Apple computer thanks to an iPod. The attacks needed a first generic phase where the iPod software was modified so that it behaves as master on the FireWire bus. Then the iPod had full read/write access on the Apple Computer when the iPod was plugged into a FireWire port.&lt;ref name="Dorn1"&gt;[[#Dorn1|Dornseif, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; FireWire is used by : audio devices, printers, scanners, cameras, gps, etc. Generally, a device connected by FireWire has full access (read/write). Indeed, OHCI Standard (FireWire standard) reads :
{{cquote|Physical requests, including physical read, physical write and lock requests to some CSR registers (section 5.5), are handled directly by the Host Controller without assistance by system software.
|4=OHCI Standard}}

So, any device connected by FireWire can read and write data on the computer memory. For example, a device can :
* Grab the screen contents ;
* Just search the memory for strings such as login, passwords ;
* Scan for possible key material ;
* Search cryptographic keys stored in RAM ;
* Parse the whole physical memory to understand logical memory layout.
or
* Mess up the memory ;
* Change screen content ;
* Change UID/GID of a certain process ;
* Inject code into a process ;
* Inject an additional process.

=== Processor ===

==== Cache attack ====
To increase the computational power, processors are generally equipped with a [[CPU cache|cache memory]] which decreases the memory access latency. Below, the figure shows the hierarchy between the processor and the memory. First the processor looks for data in the cache L1, then L2, then in the memory.
[[File:Mem cache.jpg|500px|thumb|center||alt=|Processor cache hierarchy]]

When the data is not where the processor is looking for, it is called a cache-miss. Below, pictures show how the processor fetch data when there are two cache levels.
{|
| [[File:Processor cacheL1.png|300px|thumb|Data A is in the L1-Cache]]
| [[File:Processor cacheL2.png|300px|thumb|Data A is in the L2-Cache]]
| [[File:Processor cacheM.png|300px|thumb|Data A is in the memory]]
|}

Unfortunately caches contain only a small portion of the application data and can introduce additional latency to the memory transaction in the case of a miss. This involves also additional power consumption which is due to the activation of memory devices down in the memory hierarchy. The miss penalty has been already used to attack symmetric encryption algorithms, like DES.&lt;ref name="Bert1p1"&gt;[[#Bert1|Bertoni, 2005, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea proposed in this paper is to force a cache miss while the processor is executing the AES encryption algorithm on a known plain text.&lt;ref name="Bert1p3"&gt;[[#Bert1|Bertoni, 2005, p.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks allow an unprivileged process to attack other process running in parallel on the same processor, despite partitioning methods such as memory protection, sandboxing and virtualization.&lt;ref name="sha1p1"&gt;[[#Sha1|Shamir, 2005, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Timing attack ====
By carefully measuring the amount of time required to perform private key operations, attackers may be able to find fixed [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange|Diffie-Hellman exponents]], factor [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] keys, and break other cryptosystems. Against a vulnerable system, the attack is computationally inexpensive and often requires only known ciphertext.&lt;ref name="[Koch1p1]"&gt;[[#Koch1|Kocher, 1996, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The attack can be treated as a signal detection problem. The signal consists of the timing variation due to the target exponent bit, and noise results from measurement inaccuracies and timing variations due to unknown exponent bits. The properties of the signal and noise determine the number of timing measurements required to for the attack. Timing attacks can potentially be used against other cryptosystems, including symmetric functions.&lt;ref name="[Koch1p9]"&gt;[[#Koch1|Kocher, 1996, p.9]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Privilege escalation ====
{{See also|Hardware backdoor}}
A simple and generic processor backdoor can be used by attackers as a means to privilege escalation to get to privileges equivalent to those of any given running operating system.&lt;ref name="Dufl21"&gt;[[#Dufl2|Duflot, 2008, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a non-privileged process of one of the non-privileged invited domain running on top of a virtual machine monitor can get to privileges equivalent to those of the virtual machine monitor.&lt;ref name="Dufl21"/&gt;

Loïc Duflot studied Intel processors in the paper "[[#Dufl2|CPU bugs, CPU backdoors and consequences on security]]" ; he explains that the processor defines four different privilege rings numbered from 0 (most privileged) to 3 (least privileged). Kernel code is usually running in ring 0, whereas user-space code is generally running in ring 3. The use of some security-critical assembly language instructions is restricted to ring 0 code. In order to escalate privilege through the backdoor, the attacker must :&lt;ref name="Dufl22"&gt;[[#Dufl2|Duflot, 2008, p.5]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# activate the backdoor by placing the CPU in the desired state ;
# inject code and run it in ring 0 ;
# get back to ring 3 in order to return the system to a stable state. Indeed, when code is running in ring 0, system calls do not work : Leaving the system in ring 0 and running a random system call (exit() typically) is likely to crash the system.
The backdoors Loïc Duflot presents are simple as they only modify the behavior of three assembly language instructions and have very simple and specific activation conditions, so that they are very unlikely to be accidentally activated. [[#Waks1|Recent inventions]] have begun to target these types of processor-based escalation attacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1429">The '''Conductor Pipe''' is a large diameter pipe that is set into the ground to provide the initial stable structural foundation for a [[borehole]] or [[oil well]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/c/conductor_pipe.aspx Conductor Pipe - Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be referred to as a ''drive pipe'' because it is often ''driven'' into the ground with a [[pile driver]].

'''Conductor pipe''' is typically set, on petroleum wells, before any drilling operations are performed. It is usually set with special pile-driving or spudder rigs, though the [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] is sometimes used to save time and money.

In the [[offshore drilling]] industry, the conductor pipe is set in the seabed, and is a key structural foundation for the subsea [[wellhead]]. When drilling an offshore well, a [[marine riser]] is connected to the well, and this is subjected to large environmental forces such as current and waves which are transferred to the conductor. The forces can be large and also cyclical which can potentially cause fatigue damage to the conductor, especially in harsh environmental conditions. A Conductor tensioner unit (CTU) can be used in shallow water on [[jackup rig]] to withstand such damaging forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Cryptographic splitting''', also known as cryptographic bit splitting or cryptographic data splitting, is a technique for securing data over a computer network.  The technique involves encrypting data, splitting the encrypted data into smaller data units, distributing those smaller units to different storage locations, and then further encrypting the data at its new location.&lt;ref name=patent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7391865.html |title=United States Patent 7391865: Secure data parser method and system |publisher=freepatentsonline.com |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this process, the data is protected from security breaches, because even if an intruder is able to retrieve and decrypt one data unit, the information would be useless unless it can be combined with decrypted data units from the other locations.

==History==
The technology was filed for patent consideration in June 2003, and the patent was granted in June 2008.&lt;ref name=patent/&gt;

==Technology==
Cryptographic splitting utilizes a combination of different algorithms to provide the data protection. A block of data is first encrypted using the [[AES-256]] government encryption standard.  The encrypted bits are then split into different shares and then each share is [[Cryptographic hash function|hashed]] using the [[National Security Agency]]'s [[SHA-256]] algorithm.&lt;ref name=unisys&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/orig/sdc_archives/2009_presentations/wednesday/DavidDodgson_StorageSecurityUsingCryptographicSplitting-BU.pdf |title=Storage Security Using Cryptographic Splitting |first = David|last=Dodgson|publisher=snia.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
One application of cryptographic splitting is to provide security for [[cloud computing]].  The encrypted data subsets can be stored on different clouds, with the information required to restore the data being held on a [[private cloud]] for additional security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7019286/ |title=Enhanced security for multi-cloud storage using cryptographic data splitting with dynamic approach |publisher=ieee.org |date=2015-01-26 |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Security vendor [[Security First Corp]] uses this technology for its Secure Parser Extended (SPx) product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://security.cioreview.com/vendor/2016/security_first_corp. |title=Security First Corp.: SPx Technology|publisher=cioreview.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, technology services company [[Unisys]] gave a presentation about using cryptographic splitting with [[storage area networks]].  By splitting the data into different parts of the storage area network, this technique provided data redundancy in addition to security.&lt;ref name=unisys/&gt;

Computer giant [[IBM]] has written about using the technology as part of its Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2015/10/a-billion-reasons-you-want-to-encrypt-your-data/?S_TACT=C34409NW&amp;S_TACT=C34409NW&amp;S_TACT=C34409NW&amp;S_TACT=C34409NW |title=Cloud computing news: Security|publisher=ibm.com |date=2015-10-21 |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology has also been written about in the context of more effectively using sensitive corporate information, by entrusting different individuals within a company (trustees) with different parts of the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/86b6/e830cab3e251584ea8057db23b9efc78ba35.pdf |title=Advanced techniques for knowledge management and access to strategic information |last= Ogiela|first= Lidia|publisher=semanticscholar.org|date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7356">'''Cybernetic Serendipity''' was an exhibition of [[cybernetic art]] curated by [[Jasia Reichardt]], shown at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], London in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Gere]], ‘Minicomputer Experimentalism in the United Kingdom from the 1950s to 1980’ in [[Hannah Higgins]], &amp; [[Douglas Kahn]] (Eds.), Mainframe experimentalism: Early digital computing in the experimental arts. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press (2012), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and then touring the United States. Two stops in the US were the Corcoran Annex (Corcoran Gallery of Art), Washington, D.C., and the newly opened [[Exploratorium]]&lt;ref&gt;Acceptance speech for the AAM Distinguished Service Award - June 21, 1982, transcript, Frank Oppenheimer, Exploration and Discovery magazine, p9, San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; in San Francisco.

==Content==
One part of the exhibition was concerned with [[algorithm]]s and devices for generating music. Some exhibits were pamphlets describing the algorithms, whilst others showed [[musical notation]] produced by computers. Devices made musical effects and played tapes of sounds made by computers. [[Peter Zinovieff]] lent part of his studio equipment - visitors could sing or whistle a tune into a microphone and his equipment would improvise a piece of music based on the tune.

Another part described ''computer projects'' such as [[Gustav Metzger]]'s self-destructive ''Five screens with computer'', a design for a new hospital, a computer programmed structure, and dance choreography.

The machines and installations were a very noticeable part of the exhibition. [[Gordon Pask]] produced a collection of large mobiles with interacting parts that let the viewers join in the conversation. Many machines formed [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] environments or displayed moving images. [[Bruce Lacey]] contributed his radio-controlled robots and a light-sensitive owl. [[Nam June Paik]] was represented by ''Robot K-456'' and televisions with distorted images. [[Jean Tinguely]] provided two of his painting machines. [[Edward Ihnatowicz]]'s [[biomorphic]] hydraulic ear turned toward sounds and John Billingsley's ''Albert 1967'' turned to face light.  [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] presented his interactive cybernetic sculptures of vibrating stainless-steel rods, [[stroboscope|stroboscopic light]], and audio [[feedback control]].  Several artists exhibited machines that drew patterns that the visitor could take away, or involved visitors in games.  Cartoonist [[Rowland Emett]] designed the mechanical computer ''Forget-me-not'', which was commissioned by [[Honeywell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chrisbeetles.com/gallery/cartoon/honeywell-emett-forget-me-not-pheripheral-pachyderm-computer.html | title = THE HONEYWELL-EMETT 'FORGET-ME-NOT' (PHERIPHERAL PACHYDERM) COMPUTER | accessdate = 2013-11-18 | publisher = Chris Beetles Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another section explored the computer's ability to produce text - both essays and [[poetry]]. Different programs produced [http://www.in-vacua.com/cgi-bin/haiku.pl Haiku], children's stories, and [http://www.in-vacua.com/cgi-bin/mendoza.pl essays].

Computer generated movies were represented by [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]]'s ''permutations'' and a [[Bell Labs]] movie on their technology for producing movies. Some samples included images of [[teseract]]s rotating in four dimensions, a satellite orbiting the earth, and an animated [[data structure]].

[[Computer graphics]] were also represented, including pictures produced on [[cathode ray oscilloscope]]s and [[plotter|digital plotters]]. There was a variety of posters and graphics demonstrating the power of computers to do complex (and apparently random) calculations. Other graphics showed a simulated [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] and the iconic decreasing squares spiral that appeared on the exhibition's poster and book.  The [[Boeing Corporation]] exhibited their use of wireframe graphics.

[[Keith Albarn]] &amp; Partners contributed to the design of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monoskop.org/images/2/25/Reichardt_Jasia_ed_Cybernetic_Serendipidity_The_Computer_and_the_Arts.pdf Reichardt, J. ed 1968 ''a Studio International Special Issue'' London, Studio International p5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance==
''[[TIME]]'' magazine noted that there had been 40,000 visitors to the London exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838821,00.html | date = 1968-10-06 | accessdate = 2008-10-08 | publisher = TIME | title = Cybernetic Serendipity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports suggested visitor numbers were as high as 44,000 to 60,000. However, ICA did  not accurately count visitors.&lt;ref name=daDA&gt;{{cite web|title=compArt database Digital Art (University of Bremen, Germany)|url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/exhibition/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After-Effects==
The exhibition provided the energy for the formation of British [[Computer Arts Society]] which continued to explore the interaction between science, technology and art, and put on exhibitions (for example "Event One" at the [[Royal College of Art]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hosted/cache/archive/PAGE/PAGE%201%20April%201969.pdf | date = 1969-04-06 | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | publisher = BCS | title = PAGE 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). Several pieces were purchased by Exploratorium in 1971, some of which are on display to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2707">'''Dubovë e vogël''' (Albanian, determinate form: '''Dubova e Vogël'''), '''Malo Dubovo''' (Serbian), is a village of [[Istog]]/[[Istok]] municipality, in Western [[Kosovo]]. The village has an area of 243,23 ha.&lt;ref&gt;J. OSMANI, ''Vendbanimet e Kosovës: n°12 Burimi (Istogu)'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The toponym is of Slavic origin, from the word ''dub'' that means ''oak''.

Between the two world wars, seven families of [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] colonists as well as a [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Muslim]] family ([[Bosnians|Bosnian]]) settled in the village.&lt;ref name="Osmani"/&gt;

At the census of 1921, the village had a population of 121 inhabitants, at the one of 1948 it had 160 inhabitants, and 346 inhabitants in 1981 (among them: 310 [[Albanians]], or 89,5% of the total population; 30 [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], or 8,67% of the total population; 6 [[Muslims]], or 1,73% of the total population).&lt;ref name="Osmani"&gt;J. OSMANI, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The families currently inhabiting the village are:&lt;ref name="Osmani"/&gt;

- Bacaj ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Daci ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Demaj ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Hasaj ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Kelmendi ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Lajci ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Mehaj ([[Albanians|Albanian]])

- Sallka ([[Albanians|Albanian]] with [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] origins)

During [[Kosovo war]] the [[Albanians|Albanian]] and [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] population of the village had to leave and took refuge in [[Montenegro]], a part then left for [[Albania]].

[[Serbs|Serbian]] families left the village before the return of [[Albanians|Albanian]] refugees in 1999.

In 1999, during the [[Kosovo]] war, five people were killed in the village:&lt;ref&gt;http://hlc-rdc.org/index.php?lid=en&amp;show=kosovo&amp;action=search&amp;str_prezime=&amp;str_ime=&amp;str_ime_oca=&amp;str_date_of_birth=&amp;str_status=&amp;str_povreda=&amp;str_date_of_injury=&amp;str_mesto_povrede=Malo+Dubovo%2FDubov%C3%AB+e+Vog%C3%ABl&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ethiopic Collectio Monastica''''' is a book that includes some original sayings of the [[Desert Fathers]], and which is textually independent of the more well known ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''). It was first published by Victor Arras in 1963, based on two separate manuscripts that were likely based on Greek or Coptic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arras|first=Victor|title=Collectio monastica: Ethiopic text|year=1963|publisher=Secrétariat du CorpusSCO|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Collectio_monastica.html?id=D_A2cgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmless2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harmless, William  |year=2000 |title=Remembering Poemen Remembering: The Desert Fathers and the Spirituality of Memory |journal=Church History |publisher=American Society of Church History |volume=15 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66380509.html}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection consists of sixty-eight chapter of widely different lengths. Included in the book are collections of Desert Father sayings, most of which have no parallel in the ''Apophthegmata Patrum''. The original work appears to have been written by a 5th-century monk who either lived with the Desert Fathers at [[Scetis]], or knew the monks who lived there. He also appears to have known [[Abba Poemen]], because of several unique stories and sayings attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Harmless2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harmless, William |title=Desert Christians: an introduction to the literature of early monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=Appendix 8.5|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004|isbn=0-19-516222-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIM0pWejvBgC&amp;pg=PT504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geodetic control network''' (also '''geodetic network''', '''reference network''', '''control point network''', or '''control network''') is a network, often of [[triangle]]s, which are measured precisely by techniques of terrestrial [[surveying]] or by [[satellite geodesy]].

A geodetic control network consists of stable, identifiable points with published datum values derived from observations that tie the points together.&lt;ref&gt;
Rear Adm. John D. Bossler.
[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/tech_pub/1984-stds-specs-geodetic-control-networks.htm "Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Control Networks"].
1984.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classically, a control is divided into horizontal (X-Y) and vertical (Z) controls (components of the control), however with the advent of [[satellite navigation]] systems, [[GPS]] in particular, this division is becoming obsolete.

Many organizations contribute information to the geodetic control network.&lt;ref&gt;
Minnesota Geospatial Information Office.
[http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/MSDI/workgroups/geodetic.htm "MSDI Data: Geodetic Control"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher-order (high precision, usually millimeter-to-decimeter on a scale of continents) control points are normally defined in both space and time using global or space techniques, and are used for "lower-order" points to be tied into. The lower-order control points are normally used for [[engineering]], [[construction]] and [[navigation]]. The scientific discipline that deals with the establishing of coordinates of points in a high-order control network is called [[geodesy]], and the technical discipline that does the same for points in a low-order control network is called [[surveying]].

== Cartography ==
After a cartographer registers key points in a digital map to the real world coordinates of those points on the ground, the map is then said to be "in control". Having a base map and other data in geodetic control means that they will overlay correctly.

When map layers are not in control, it requires extra work to adjust them to line up, which introduces additional error.
Those real world coordinates are generally in some particular [[map projection]], unit, and [[geodetic datum]].&lt;ref&gt;
Minnesota Geospatial Information Office.
[http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/cadastral/iisac/plan2.html "Plan for GIS implementation"].
1997.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triangulation ==
{{main article|Triangulation}}
In "classical geodesy" (up to the sixties) control networks were established by [[triangulation]] using measurements of [[angle]]s and of some spare distances.  The precise orientation to the [[geographic north]] is achieved through methods of [[geodetic astronomy]]. The principal instruments used are [[theodolite]]s and [[tacheometer]]s, which nowadays are equipped with [[infrared]] distance measuring, [[data base]]s, communication systems and partly by satellite links.

== Trilateration ==
{{see also|Trilateration}}
[[Electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) was introduced around 1960, when the [[prototype]] instruments became small enough to be used in the field. Instead of using only sparse and much less accurate distance measurements some control networks was established or updated by using [[trilateration]] more accurate distance measurements than was previously possible and no angle measurements.

EDM increased network [[accuracy|accuracies]] up to 1:1 million (1&amp;nbsp;cm per 10&amp;nbsp;km; today at least 10 times better), and made surveying less costly.

== Satellite geodesy ==
{{main article|Satellite geodesy}}
The geodetic use of [[satellite]]s began around the same time. By using bright satellites like [[Echo satellite#Echo 1|Echo I]], [[Echo satellite#Echo 2|Echo II]] and [[Pageos]], global networks were determined, which later provided support for the theory of [[plate tectonics]].

Another important improvement was the introduction of [[radio]] and electronic satellites like [[GEOS (satellite)|Geos A]] and B (1965–70), of the [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] system ([[Doppler effect]]) 1967-1990 &amp;mdash; which was the predecessor of GPS - and of [[laser]] techniques like [[Lageos]] (USA) or [[Starlette]] (F). Despite the use of spacecraft, small networks for [[cadastral]] and [[Technology|technical]] projects are mainly measured terrestrially, but in many cases incorporated in national and global networks by satellite geodesy.

== Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) ==
{{see also|Satellite navigation}}
Nowadays, several hundred geodetic satellites are in orbit, supplemented by a large number of [[remote sensing]] satellites and [[navigation]] systems like [[GPS]] and [[Glonass]], which will be followed by the European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] satellites in 2020.

While these developments have made satellite-based geodetic network surveying more flexible and cost effective than its terrestrial equivalent, the continued existence of [[Benchmark (surveying)|fixed point]] networks is still needed for administrative and legal purposes on local and regional scales. Global geodetic networks cannot be defined to be fixed, since [[geodynamic]]s are continuously changing the position of all [[continent]]s by 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;cm per year. Therefore, modern global networks like [[ETRS89]] or [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] show not only [[coordinate]]s of their "fixed points", but also their annual [[velocity|velocities]].

In [[rocket]]ry, the '''Goddard problem''' is to optimize the [[altitude]] of a rocket, ascending vertically, and taking into account [[atmospheric drag]] and the [[gravitational field]].  This was first posed by [[Robert H. Goddard]] in his 1919 publication, "A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~cliff/aoe5244_99/week_13_a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0409855&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hand-waving''' (with various spellings) is a [[pejorative]] label for attempting to be seen as effective – in word, reasoning, or deed – while actually doing nothing effective or substantial.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=hand wave |work=Dictionary.com |date=2016 |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hand-waving}} Cites the ''[[Random House Dictionary]]'' and ''The Dictionary of American Slang'' 4th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is most often applied to [[debate]] techniques that involve [[fallacies]], misdirection and the glossing over of details.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF"&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=handwave |work=The New Hacker's Dictionary |edition=3rd |editor1-first=Eric S.|editor1-last=Raymond|editor1-link=Eric S.

The term can additionally be used in work situations, when attempts are made to display productivity or assure accountability without actually resulting in them. The term can also be used as a self-admission of, and suggestion to defer discussion about, an allegedly unimportant weakness in one's own argument's evidence, to forestall an opponent dwelling on it. In [[debate competition]], certain cases of this form of hand-waving may be explicitly permitted.

''Hand-waving'' is an [[idiom]]atic [[metaphor]], derived in part from the use of excessive [[gesticulation]], perceived as unproductive, distracting or nervous, in communication or other effort.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The term also evokes the [[sleight-of-hand]] distraction techniques of [[stage magic]],&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; and suggests that the speaker or writer seems to believe that if they, figuratively speaking, simply wave their hands, no one will notice or speak up about the holes in the reasoning.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; This implication of misleading intent has been reinforced by the pop-culture influence of the [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' franchise]], in which mystically powerful hand-waving is fictionally used for [[mind control]], and some uses of the term in public discourse are explicit ''Star Wars'' references.&lt;ref name="CBS_Bronco"&gt;An example in the sports press of "Jedi mind trick": [http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25449738/one-bronco-thinks-roethlisbergers-injury-is-a-jedi-mind-trick One Bronco thinks Roethlisberger's injury is a 'Jedi mind trick']&lt;nowiki /&gt;&amp;thinsp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual hand-waving motions may be used either by a speaker to indicate a desire to avoid going into details,&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt; or by critics to indicate that they believe the proponent of an argument is engaging in a verbal hand-wave inappropriately.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt;

== Spelling and history ==
The spelling of the [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] varies (both with regard to this idiom and the everyday human communication gesture of [[Wave (gesture)|waving]]). While ''hand-waving'' is the most common spelling of the unitary [[present participle]] and [[gerund]] in this usage, and ''hand-wave'' of the [[simple present]] verb, ''hand wave'' dominates as the [[Noun phrase|noun-phrase]] form. ''Handwaving'' and ''handwave'' may be preferred in some circles, and are well attested.&lt;ref name="note"&gt;Usage patterns are easily observable with Google and other search engines, which also reveal the difficulty of excluding false positives from various particular search terms.&lt;/ref&gt; "Hand waving" is mostly used otherwise, e.g. "she had one hand waving, the other on the rail", but is found in some dictionaries in this form.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt; A more arch, mock-antiquarian construction is ''waving of [the] hands''. [[Superlative]] constructions such as "vigorous hand-waving", "waved their hand[s] furiously", "lots of waving of hands", etc., are used to imply that the hand-waver lacks confidence in the information being conveyed, cannot convincingly express or defend the core of the argument being advanced. The descriptive epithet ''hand-waver'' has been applied to those engaging in hand-waving, but is not common.  The opposite of hand-waving is sometimes called '''nose-following''' in mathematics {{see below|In mathematics|short=y}}.

However it is spelled, the expression is also used the original literal meaning of gesturing in a greeting, departing, excited, or attention-seeking manner by waving the hands, as in "friendly were the hand-waving crowds ..." (— [[Sinclair Lewis]]),&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt; which dates to the mid-17th century as a hyphenated verb&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com UK"&gt;{{cite web |title=hand-wave |work=Oxford Dictionaries Online |edition=British and World English |date=2015 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url= https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/hand-wave |access-date=January 26, 2015}} This is an online edition of ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' with additional material.&lt;/ref&gt; and the early 19th century United States as a fully compounded verb.&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com US 1"&gt;{{cite web |title=handwave |work=Oxford Dictionaries Online |version=American English |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url= https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/handwave |access-date=January 26, 2015}} This is an online edition of the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear when the figurative usage arose. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' lists it as "extended use",&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com UK" /&gt; and it appears primarily in modern American dictionaries, some of which label it "informal".&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt;

==In debate, generally==
{{anchor|Debate|In debate}}Handwaving is frequently used in low-quality [[debate]], including [[political campaign]]ing and [[Political criticism|commentary]], issue-based [[advocacy]], [[advertising]] and [[public relations]], [[tabloid journalism]], [[Op-ed|opinion piece]]s, [[Internet meme]]s, and informal discussion and writing. If the opponent in a debate or commentator on an argument alleges hand-waving, it suggests the proponent of the argument, position or message has engaged in one or more [[Fallacy|fallacies of logic]],&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; usually [[Informal fallacy|informal]], and/or glossed over non-trivial details,&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; and is attempting to {{em|wave away}} challenges and deflect questions, as if swatting at flies.  The ''distraction'' inherent in the sense of the term has become a key part of the meaning.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; The fallacies in question vary, but often include one of the many variants of [[argument to emotion]], and in political discourse frequently involve unjustified assignment or transference of blame.  Hand-waving is not itself a fallacy; the proponent's argument may incidentally be correct despite their failure to properly support it.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt;  A tertiary meaning refers to use of poorly-reasoned arguments specifically to impress&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com US 2"&gt;{{cite web |title=hand-waving |work=Oxford Dictionaries Online |version=American English |date=2015 |url= https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/hand-waving |access-date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or persuade.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com US 2" /&gt;

''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' (a.k.a. ''[[Jargon File|The Jargon File]]'') observes:
{{quote|If someone starts a sentence with "Clearly..." or "Obviously..." or "It is self-evident that...", it is a good bet he is about to handwave (alternatively, use of these constructions in a sarcastic tone before a paraphrase of someone else's argument suggests that it is a handwave). The theory behind this term is that if you wave your hands at the right moment, the listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that what you have said is bogus [i.e., incorrect]. Failing that, if a listener does object, you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave of your hand.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt;}}

The implication that hand-waving is done with the specific intent to mislead has long been attached to the term, due to the use of literal waving of a hand – either natural-looking or showy, but never desperate – by [[Magic (illusion)|illusionists]] to distract audiences and [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirect]] their attention from the mechanisms of the [[sleight-of-hand]], [[Glossary of magic (illusion)#G|gimmicked]] props or other trick being used in the performance. This meaning has become reinforced in recent decades by the influence of ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and its sequels, in which the fictional [[Jedi mind trick]] involves a subtle hand wave with mystical powers – that only work on the weak-minded – to disguise reality and compel compliance.  Consequently, there is an implication in current usage that a hand-waver may be craftily intending to deceive, and has a low opinion of the intelligence of the opponent or (especially) an audience or the general public.  The labels "Jedi hand wave" and "Jedi mind trick" themselves are sometimes applied, in a tongue-in-cheek way, to this manipulation technique in public discourse;&lt;ref name="CBS_Bronco"/&gt; US Congressman [[Luke Messer]]'s use of it in reference to [[President Barack Obama]]'s 2016 [[State of the Union address]] generated headlines.&lt;ref name="Jedi 2"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35256156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fox59.com/2016/01/17/in-focus-rep-messer-calls-presidents-speech-jedi-mind-trick/&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unplanned debate or presentation, an off-the-cuff essay, or an informal discussion, the proponent may have little or no time for preparation. Participants in such exchanges may use the term in reference to their own arguments, in the same sense as an author admitting a minor plot flaw {{see below|In literary criticism|short=y}}. When the proponents use the term, they are conceding that they know an ancillary point of or intermediate step in their arguments is poorly supported; they are suggesting that such details aren't important and do not affect their key arguments or conclusions, and that the hand-waved details should be excluded from current consideration.  Examples include when they believe a statement is true but cannot prove it at that time, and when the sources upon which they are relying conflict in minor ways: "I'm hand-waving over the exact statistics here, but they all show at least a 20% increase, so let's move on".

In formal [[debate competition]], certain forms of hand-waving may sometimes be explicitly permitted. In [[policy debate]], the concept of ''[[Fiat (policy debate)|fiat]]'' allows a team to pursue a line a reasoning based on a scenario that is not presently true, if a judge is satisfied that the case has been that it could become true.

==In literary criticism==
{{anchor|Literary criticism}}
By extension, handwaving is used in [[Literary criticism|literary, film and other media criticism]] of [[speculative fiction]] to refer to a [[plot device]] (e.g., a scientific discovery, a political development, or rules governing the behavior of a fictional creature) that is left unexplained or sloppily explained because it is convenient to the story, with the implication that the writer is aware of the logical weakness but hopes the audience will not notice or will [[Suspension of disbelief|suspend disbelief]] regarding such a [[macguffin]], ''[[deus ex machina]]'', [[continuity error]] or [[plot hole]].

The fictional material "[[handwavium]]" (a.k.a. "unobtainium", among other humorous names) is sometimes referred to in situations where the plot requires access to a substance of great value and properties that cannot be explained by real-world science, but is convenient to solving, or central to creating, a problem for the characters in the story. Perhaps the best known example is the [[Melange (fictional drug)|spice melange]], a fictional drug with supernatural properties, in [[Frank Herbert]]'s far-future [[science-fantasy]] epic, ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]''.

''Hand-waving'' has come to be used in [[role-playing games]] to describe actions and conversations that are quickly glossed over, rather than acted out in full according to the rules. This may be done to keep from bogging down the play of the game with time-consuming but minor details.

==In mathematics (and formal logic, philosophy, theoretical science)==
{{anchor|Mathematics|In mathematics}}
In mathematics, and theory-dominated disciplines in which mathematics plays a major role, ''hand-waving'' refers to a reliance on heuristic, as opposed to rigorous, arguments. These may be useful in expository papers and seminar presentations, but fall short of the standard of proof needed to establish a result.

An accusation of mathematical hand-waving can be a professional attack, intended to denigrate the reliability of a speaker who has attempted to assert a proposition without being able to prove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Wiseman's answer to What do mathematicians mean by "hand-waving" and why is it important?|url=https://www.quora.com/What-do-mathematicians-mean-by-hand-waving-and-why-is-it-important/answer/Gus-Wiseman}}{{self-published inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical profession tends to be receptive to informed critiques from any listener, and a claimant to a new result is expected to be able to answer any such question with a logical argument, up to a full proof. Should a speaker apparently fail to give such an answer, anyone in the audience who can supply the needed demonstration may sometimes upstage the speaker. The objector in such a case might receive some measure credit for the theorem the hand-waver presented.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The opposite of hand-waving in mathematics and related fields is sometimes called '''nose-following''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Polycategories via pseudo-distributive laws|journal=Advances in Mathematics|volume=218|issue=3|pages=781|arxiv=math/0606735|last1=Garner|first1=Richard|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.aim.2008.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2016|reason=Implying what? This needs a contextual explanation, especially since this page also serves as the article for [[Nose-following]], which redirects here!}} meaning the unimaginative development of a narrow line of reasoning.

The rationale for this culture of hyper-critical scrutiny is suggested by a quote of [[G. H. Hardy]]: "[A mathematician's] subject is the most curious of all—there is none in which truth plays such odd pranks. It has the most elaborate and the most fascinating technique, and gives unrivalled openings for the display of sheer professional skill."&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Hardy (1940). "A Mathematician's Apology".&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied science and engineering==

Hand-waving arguments in [[engineering]] and other [[applied sciences]] often include [[Orders of magnitude|order-of-magnitude]] estimates and [[dimensional analysis]], especially in the use of [[Fermi problem]]s in physics and engineering education. However, competent, well-intentioned researchers and professors also rely on explicitly declared hand-waving when, given a limited time, a large result must be shown and minor technical details cannot be given much attention&amp;mdash;e.g., "it can be shown that {{var|z}} is an even number", as an intermediary step in reaching a conclusion.

[[Back-of-the-envelope calculation]]s are approximate ways to get an answer by over-simplification, and are comparable to hand-waving in this sense.

==In business==

''Hand-waving'' has been used to describe work-related situations where productivity is seemingly displayed but deliverables are not produced, especially intentional engagement in [[busy work]] or pretend-work, vague claims of overwork or complications, impenetrably [[buzzword]]-laden rationalizations for delays or otherwise poor performance, and plausible-sounding but weak excuse-making and attention-deflecting tactics.  In employment situations, as in political discourse, a hand-waving effort may seek to shift blame to other parties.

Another use is in reference to fiscal problems, such as an inability to adequately explain accounting discrepancies or an avoidance of accountability for missing funds.

{{Palestinians}}

'''Hebron Glass''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;زجاج الخليل&lt;/big&gt;}}, ''zajaj al-Khalili'' ) refers to [[glass]] produced in [[Hebron]] as part of a flourishing [[Palestinian art|art]] industry established in the city during [[History of Palestine#Roman Period 63 BCE–330 CE|Roman rule]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Spaulding&gt;Spaulding and Welch, 1994, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; Hebron's Old City still contains a quarter named the "Glass-Blower Quarter" and Hebron glass continues to serve as a tourist attraction for the city.

Traditionally, the glass was melted using local raw materials, including [[sand]] from neighbouring villages, [[sodium carbonate]] (from the [[Dead Sea]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dphjewelry.com/art-n0809-131.html |title=Hebron Beads |publisher=Dphjewelry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coloring additives such as [[iron oxide]] and [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]]. Nowadays, [[Glass recycling|recycled glass]] is often used instead. Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets of which have been preserved and passed down by a few [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city.&lt;ref name=HolyLand&gt;{{cite web|title=Vases|publisher=Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society|url=http://www.holyland-handicraft.org/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=53&amp;Itemid=1&amp;TreeId=48&amp;vmcchk=1&amp;Itemid=1|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; The products made include glass [[jewellery]], such as [[Glass beadmaking|beads]], bracelets, and rings,&lt;ref name=Beard&gt;Beard, 1862, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[stained glass]] windows, and glass lamps. However, due to the [[Middle East conflict#Arab-Israeli conflict|Palestinian-Israeli conflict]], glass production has suffered a decline.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

==History==
The glass industry in Hebron was established during [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE).&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt; As the ancient [[Phoenicia]]n glass industry shrank from the exposed cities along the eastern [[Mediterranean]] coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot, Chipiez and Armstrong, 1885, p.328.&lt;/ref&gt; Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit as part of the Drake Collection.&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt; Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the [[Cave of Machpelah]], which served as a [[Church (building)|church]] during the [[Crusades|Crusader]] era in Palestine.&lt;ref name=Comay&gt;Comay, 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning the [[Dome of the Rock]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt;

"Hebron’s medieval reputation in glassmaking is corroborated by some of the many Christian pilgrims who visited the city over the centuries. Between 1345 and 1350, Franciscan monk [[Niccolò da Poggibonsi]] noted that “they make great works of art in glass.” In the late 15th century, the German friar [[Felix Faber]] and his companions also stopped in this “exceeding ancient city,” and he described how “we came forth from our inn, and passed through the long street of the city, in which work-people of divers crafts dwelt, but more particularly workers in glass; for at this place glass is made, not clear glass, but black, and of the colors between dark and light.”&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Gail. 2013. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201301/hebron.s.glass.history.htm "Hebron's Glass History."] Saudi Aramco World. January/February 2013. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

While acknowledging that the production of glass in Palestine dates back to Roman period, Nazmi Ju'beh, director of ''RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation'', contends that the practices of today's glass industry in Hebron most likely emerged in the 13th century CE.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; This corresponds to what foreigners  observed, like [[Jacques de Vitry]] who around 1080 mentioned Acre and Tyre, (but not Hebron), as glass-producing cities,&lt;ref&gt;Vitry, 1896, p. [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028534422#page/n105/mode/2up 92-93]&lt;/ref&gt; while by 1483, when [[Felix Fabri]] visited the city, he described passing "through the long street of the city, in which work-people of divers crafts dwelt, but particularely  workers in glass; for at this place glass is made, not clear glass, but black, and of the colours between dark and light."&lt;ref&gt;Fabri, 1893, p. [https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti02paleuoft#page/411/mode/1up 411]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ju'beh notes that an alternate theory assigns today's techniques to the [[Venetian glass]] tradition and that still other researchers claim they were already extant at the time of the [[Crusades]] and were carried back to [[Europe]] from Hebron, possibly originating in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; 
[[File:Road to Hebron, Mar Saba, etc. Glass works.jpg|thumb|left|Glass Works, photo taken 1900-1920 by [[American Colony, Jerusalem]].]]
Glass produced by these factories were typically functional items including drinking and eating vessels, as well as olive oil and later [[petrol]]-based lamps, although the factories also produced jewellery and accessories.  [[Bedouins]] of the [[Negev]] (Naqab), the [[Arabian Desert]], and [[Sinai]] were the primary purchasers of jewellery, but large exports of expensive Hebron glass items were sent by guarded [[Camel train|camel caravans]] to [[Egypt]], Syria, and the [[Jordan|Transjordan]]. Marketing communities of Hebron glass were established in [[Al Karak|al-Karak]] (Crac) in southern [[Jordan]] and [[Cairo]] in Egypt by the 16th century.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

The glass industry was a principal employer and a generator of wealth for its owners.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; Well known for glass production throughout the [[Arab world]], [[Western culture|Western]] travellers to Palestine in the 18th and 19th century provided descriptions of the Hebron glass industry as well. For example, [[Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney|Volney]] in the 1780s, wrote that: "They make there great quantity of coloured rings, bracelets for the wrists and legs, and for the arm above the elbows, besides a variety of other trinkets, which are sent even to [[Constantinople]]."&lt;ref&gt;Volney, 1788, vol II, p. [https://archive.org/stream/travelsthroughs00volngoog#page/n343/mode/1up  325]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Jasper Seetzen]] noted during his travels in Palestine in 1807-09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron,&lt;ref&gt;Seetzen, 1855, vol. 3, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/ulrichjaspersee02seetgoog#page/n14/mode/1up 5]-6. Schölch, 1993, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; while later, in ''A New and Complete History of the Holy Bible as Contained in the Old and New Testaments'' (1844), Robert Sears writes, "The population of Hebron is considerable: the inhabitants manufacture glass lamps, which are exported to Egypt. Provisions are abundant, and there is a considerable number of shops."&lt;ref name=Sears&gt;Sears, 1844, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, the production declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware. However, the products of Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace, particularly by travelling [[Jew]]ish traders from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Delpuget, David: ''Les Juifs d´Alexandrie, de Jaffa et de Jérusalem en 1865'', Bordeaux, 1866, p. 26. Quoted in Schölch (1993); p.161, 162&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|World Fair of 1873 in Vienna]], Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron with four factories making 60,000 [[franc]]s per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Schölch (1993); p.161, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of glassblowing continues in the 21st century in three factories located outside of the traditional quarter of the Old City, north of Hebron and south of the neighboring town of [[Halhul]] which generally produce functional household souvenirs. Two of the factories are owned by the Natsheh family. These are displayed in large halls close to each of the factories.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

Hebron glass is an attraction for both domestic and foreign tourists. Today, however, due to ongoing export problems, the decline in tourism, and restrictions on [[Palestinian freedom of movement]] in the aftermath of the [[Second Intifada]], industry production has suffered. According to Nazmi al-Ju'bah, the director of ''RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation'', under these circumstances, the survival of the Hebron glass industry is in question.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Modern Hebron Glass Factory.jpg|thumb|left|Carefully moving molten glass as part of the modern production process]]

Hebron glass was traditionally produced using sand from the village of [[Bani Na'im]], east of Hebron, and [[sodium carbonate]] taken from the [[Dead Sea]]. Instead of sand, recycled glass is the primary raw material used to make Hebron glass today.&lt;ref name=IMEU&gt;{{cite web|title=Hebron glass: A centuries' old tradition|author=Nazmi al-Ju'bah|publisher=[[Institute for Middle East Understanding]] (Original in ''This Week in Palestine'')|date=January 25, 2008|url=http://imeu.net/news/article007701.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise production process is a trade secret maintained by the few Palestinian families who run the factories which continue to produce Hebron glass today,&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; passed through generations by [[apprenticeship|apprenticing]] children. As one master of the craft said, "You can learn to play the [['oud]] at any age, but unless you begin [glasswork] as a child, you will never become a master."&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the [[Glassblowing|blowing]] technique employed is the same as was used by the ancient [[Phoenicians]],&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a ''kammasha'' is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2DUHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thompson++holy+land#PRA5-PA584,M1 Thompson], 1861, p.584.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewellery==
[[File:Costumes, characters, etc. Native jewellery -i.e., jewelry- shop..jpg|thumb|The jewellery store shows [[evil eye]] beads and Hebron-made glass bracelets sold alongside the shopkeeper's main ware of silver or metal wire.&lt;ref name=Weirp192&gt;Weir, 1989, pp. 192, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Photo taken 1900-1920 by [[American Colony, Jerusalem]].]]

Glass beads for jewellery have traditionally been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (''owayneh'') were made for use as [[amulets]] since they were considered particularly effective against the [[evil eye|evil-eye]].&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weirp194&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 194. See also [http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=6-207&amp;cid=498&amp;did=959&amp;pageflip=2 Palestinian Jewellery]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Museum|Museum of Mankind]] collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate period]] or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a [[Hamsa]], representing the hand of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of the prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=Weirp201&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in [[Bayt Dajan]], a glass bracelet (''ghwayshat'') made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's [[Dowry|trousseau]].&lt;ref name=Weirp230&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebron trade beads===
In 1799, [[England|English]] traveller [[William George Browne]] mentioned the production of "Coarse glass beads...called Hersh and Munjir" in Palestine; The "Munjir" (''Mongur'') were large beads, while the Hersh (''Harish'') were smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, William G. (1799): ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria from the Years 1792 to 1796''. Cadell, Davis, Longman, and Rees, London. Page 303. As cited on [http://www.thebeadsite.com/MG4-1.htm Hebron as Beadmaker]&lt;/ref&gt; These Hebron glass beads were used for [[trade beads|trade]], and export primarily to [[Africa]] from the early to mid-19th century. Spread throughout [[West Africa]], in [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], they were grounded on the edges to make round beads fit together on a strand more suitably. There, they picked up the name "Kano Beads", although they were not originally produced in Kano. By the 1930s, their value had decreased; in 1937, [[A. J. Arkell]] recorded the beads being sold "for a song" by [[Sudan]]ese women to [[Hausa people|Hausa]] traders in [[Dafur]].&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, A. J. (1937) ''Hebron Beads in [[Darfur|Durfur]]'', Sudan Notes and Records 20(2):300-305, as cited on [http://www.thebeadsite.com/MG4-1.htm Hebron as Beadmaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20435">[[Materials science]] has shaped the development of civilizations since the dawn of mankind. Better materials for tools and weapons has allowed mankind to spread and conquer, and advancements in material processing like steel and aluminum production continue to impact society today. Historians have regarded materials as such an important aspect of civilizations such that entire periods of time have defined by the predominant material used ([[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], etc.). For most of recorded history, control of materials had been through alchemy or empirical means at best. The study and development of chemistry and physics assisted the study of materials, and eventually the interdisciplinary study of materials science emerged from the fusion of these studies.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf E.|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-26691-6|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''history of materials science''' is the study of how different materials were used and developed through the history of Earth and how those materials affected the culture of the peoples of the Earth.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Feuersteinaxt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Flint axe, about 31 cm long.]]

In many cases different cultures leave their materials as the only records which [[anthropologists]] can use to define the existence of such cultures.  The progressive use of more sophisticated materials allows archeologists to characterize and distinguish between peoples.  This is partially due to the major material of use in a culture and to its associated benefits and drawbacks.  [[Stone-Age]] cultures were limited by which rocks they could find locally and by which they could acquire by trading.  The use of [[flint]] around 300,000 BCE is sometimes{{when|date=October 2015}} considered the beginning of the use of [[ceramic]]s. The use of polished [[stone axe]]s marks a significant advance because a much wider variety of rocks could serve as tools.

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]]- or dagger-blade.]]

The innovation of smelting and casting metals in the [[Bronze Age]] started to change the way that cultures developed and interacted with each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Starting around 5500 BCE, early [[metalsmith|smith]]s began to re-shape [[native metal]]s of [[copper]] and [[gold]] - without the use of fire - for tools and weapons.  The heating of copper and its shaping with hammers began around 5000 BCE.  Melting and casting started around 4000 BCE.  [[Metallurgy]] had its dawn with the reduction of copper from its ore around 3500 BCE.  The first [[alloy]], [[bronze]] came into use around 3000 BCE. [[Iron]]-working came into prominence from about 1200 BCE.

In the 10th century BCE [[glass]] production began in [[ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd century BCE people in [[History of India|ancient India]] developed [[wootz steel]], the first [[crucible steel]]. In the 1st century BCE [[glassblowing]] techniques flourished in [[Phoenicia]]. In the 2nd century CE [[steel]]-making became widespread in [[Han Dynasty]] China. The 4th century CE saw the production of the [[Iron pillar of Delhi]], the oldest surviving example of corrosion-resistant steel.

==Antiquity==
[[File:Ac.pantheon1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]].]]

[[Wood]], [[bone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and [[earth]] are some of the materials which formed the structures of the [[Roman Empire]]. Certain structures were made possible by the character of the land upon which these structures are built; a volcanic peninsula with stone aggregates and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] containing [[crystal]]line material will produce material which weathers differently from soft, sedimentary rock and silt. That is one of the reasons that the [[concrete]] [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] of [[Rome]] could last for 1850 years, and  why the [[thatch]]ed [[farmhouse]]s of [[Holland]] sketched by [[Rembrandt]] have long since decayed.

After the [[thigh]][[bone]] [[dagger]]s of the early [[hunter-gatherer]]s were superseded by wood and stone axes, and then by [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] implements of the Roman civilization, more precious materials could then be sought, and gathered together. Thus the [[medieval]] goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] could seek and defend the gold which he had to turn into objects of desire for [[duke]]s and [[pope]]s. ''[[The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini]]'' contains one of the first descriptions of a metallurgical process.

==Stone Age==

The use of materials begins in the stone age. Typically materials such as bone, fibers, feathers, shells, animal skin, and clay were used for weapons, tools, jewelry, and shelter. The earliest tools were in the paleolithic age, called Oldowan. These were tools created from chipped rocks that would be used for scavenging purpose. As history carried on into the Mesolithic age, tools became more complex and symmetrical in design with sharper edges. Moving into the Neolithic age, agriculture began to develop as new was to form tools for farming were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Christian|title=Stone Age|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearing the end of the stone age, humans began using copper, gold, and silver as a material. Due to these metals softness, the general use was for ceremonial purposes and to create ornaments or decorations and did not replace other materials for use in tools. The simplicity of the tools used reflected on the simple understanding of the human species of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
The use of copper had become very apparent to civilizations, such as its properties of elasticity and plasticity that allow it to be hammered into useful shapes, along with its ability to be melted and pored into intricate shapes. Although the advantages of copper were many, the materials was to soft to find large scale usefulness. Through experimentation or by chance, additions to copper lead to increased hardness of a new metal alloy, called bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science: History, Properties, Application|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze was originally composed of copper and arsenic, forming arsenic bronze.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylecote|first1=R.F|title=History of Metallurgy, Second Edition|publisher=London: Manley Publishing, for the institute of metals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==

Proto-porcelain material has been discovered dating back to the Neolthic period, with shards of material found in archaeological sites from the Eastern Han period in China.  These wares are estimated to have been fired from 1260 to 1300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=He|title=Chinese ceramics : the new standard guide|date=1996|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-23727-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, [[porcelain]] was invented in [[Tang Dynasty]] China. Porcelain in china resulted in a methodical development of widely used kilns that increased the quality and quantity that procelain could be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/porcelain-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279-dynasties|title=Porcelain in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing]] of ceramics is invented by [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabic chemists]] and [[Islamic pottery|potters]] in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mason |first=Robert B. |title=New Looks at Old Pots: Results of Recent Multidisciplinary Studies of Glazed Ceramics from the Islamic World |journal=Muqarnas: Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture |year=1995 |volume=XII |isbn=978-9004103146 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]] were invented in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt; and [[lustreware]] appeared in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 86–87, ''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th century, [[Damascus steel]] is developed in the [[Middle East]]. In the 15th century, [[Johann Gutenberg]] develops [[type metal]] alloy and Angelo Barovier invents [[cristallo]], a clear soda-based glass.

==Early modern period==
In the 16th century, [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]] publishes his Pirotechnia, the first systematic book on [[metallurgy]], [[Georg Agricola]] writes De Re Metallica, an influential book on [[metallurgy]] and [[mining]], and glass [[lens (optics)|lens]] are developed in the [[Netherlands]] and used for the first time in [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s.

In the 17th century, [[Galileo]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' ([[strength of materials]] and [[kinematics]]) includes the first quantitative statements in the science of materials. In the 18th century, [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patents a process for the production of metallic [[zinc]] by [[distillation]] from [[calamine]] and charcoal, [[Bryan Higgins]] was issued a [[patent]] for hydraulic cement ([[stucco]]) for use as an exterior [[plaster]], and [[Alessandro Volta]] makes a copper/zinc [[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]].

In the 19th century, [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] invents the [[thermocouple]], Joseph Aspin invents [[Portland cement]], [[Charles Goodyear]] invents [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] invent [[silver]]-based [[photography|photographic]] processes, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] demonstrates color photography, and [[Charles Fritts]] makes the first [[solar cell]]s using [[selenium]] waffles.

Before the early 1800s, [[aluminum]] had not been produced as an isolated metal.  It wasn't until 1825 that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered how to create elemental aluminum via the reduction of aluminum chloride.  Since aluminum is a light element with good mechanical properties, it was widely sought to replace heavier less functional metals like silver and gold.  Napoleon III used aluminum plates and utensils for his honored guests, while the rest were given silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Tom|title=Aluminum: Common Metal, Uncommon Past|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/aluminum-common-metal-uncommon-past|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this process was still expensive and was still not able to produce the metal in large quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production of Aluminum: The Hall-Héroult Process|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/aluminumprocess.html|website=American Chemical Society|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886, American [[Charles Martin Hall]] and Frenchman [[Paul Héroult]] invented a process completely independent of each other to produce aluminum from aluminum oxide via electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Totten|first1=George E.|title=Handbook of aluminum|date=2003|publisher=Dekker|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-8247-0896-2|edition=10. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process would allow aluminum to be manufactured cheaper than ever before, and laid the groundwork for turning the element from a precious metal into an easily obtainable commodity.  Around the same time in 1888, [[Carl Josef Bayer]] was working in St Petersburg, Russia to develop a method to make pure alumina for the textile industry.  This process involved dissolving the aluminum oxide out of the bauxite mineral to produce gibbsite, which can then be purified back into raw alumina.  The [[Bayer process]] and the [[Hall-Héroult process]] are still used today to produce a majority of the world's alumina and aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayer's Process for Alumina Production: A Historical Production|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/num17-18/num17-18%20p15-19.pdf|website=scs.illinois.edu|publisher=Fathi Habashi, Laval University|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material Science as a Field of Study==
Most fields of studies have a founding father, such as Newton in physics and Lavoisier in chemistry. Materials science on the other hand has no central figure that set in motion materials studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=Bernedetta|title=Materials science and engineering: an artificial discipline about to explode|website=History of Recent Materials Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, wartime collaborations of multiple fields of study to produce technological advances became a structure to the future field of study that would become known as material science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Gregory|title=A Materials Science Timeline|website=Materials World Modules}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War in the 1950s, US President Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) made materials a priority when it realized that materials were the limiting factor for advances in space and military technology. The Department of defense signed a contract with 5 universities (Harvard, MIT, Brown, Stanford, and Chicago) providing over $13 million for material research. Several institutions departments changed titles from "metallurgy" to "metallurgy and materials science" in 1960's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Modern materials science==

In the early part of the 20th century, most engineering schools had a department of [[metallurgy]] and perhaps of [[ceramic]]s as well.  Much effort was expended on consideration of the [[austenite]]-[[martensite]]-[[cementite]] phases found in the iron-carbon [[phase diagram]] that underlies [[steel]] production.  The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects.  In the post-WWII era, the systematic study of [[polymer]]s advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view.  [[Northwestern University]] instituted the first materials science department in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matsci.northwestern.edu/about/index.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high temperature materials. He pioneered high temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute. Tressler's contribution to materials science is celebrated with a Penn State lecture named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matse.psu.edu/about-us/lectures-and-awards/tressler Richard E. Tressler lecture in Materials Science] from [[Penn State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Materials Research Society (MRS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org Materials Research Society]&lt;/ref&gt; has been instrumental in creating an identity and cohesion for this young field.  MRS was the brainchild of researchers at [[Penn State University]] and grew out of discussions initiated by Prof. [[Rustum Roy]] in 1970.  The first meeting of MRS was held in 1973.  As of 2006{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}, MRS has grown into an international society that sponsors a large number of annual meetings and has over 13,000 members.  MRS sponsors meetings that are subdivided into symposia on a large variety of topics as opposed to the more focused meetings typically sponsored by organizations like the [[American Physical Society]] or the [[IEEE]].  The fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of MRS meetings has had a strong influence on the direction of science, particularly in the popularity of the study of [[soft materials]], which are in the nexus of biology, chemistry, physics and mechanical and electrical engineering.
Because of the existence of integrative textbooks, [[materials research societies]] and university chairs in all parts of the world, BA, MA and PhD programs and other indicators of discipline formation, it is fair to call materials science (and engineering) a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;See Cahn (2001) and Hentschel (2011) for further references and detailed analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] created the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DoD Directive Establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/dod-establishes-arpa|website=www.darpa.mil|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) since 1996. In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Materials Research|last=Psaras|first=Peter A.|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA offered 4-year IDL contracts to universities, originally to [[Cornell University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Northwestern University]], eventually granting 9 more contracts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/Timeline/index.html|title=A Selected History of DARPA Innovation|last=|first=|date=|website=DARPA|access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the [[National Science Foundation]] took over the program in 1972&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the [[United States]]' research and development of materials science.

The '''International Centre for Tax and Development''' ('''ICTD''') is a research centre based at the [[Institute of Development Studies]], and funded by the UK's [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) and the [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]]. Founded in 2010 with close to £6 million in funding, its mission is to generate knowledge that will help developing countries to mobilise domestic resources efficiently, effectively, and equitably, and develop tax systems that promote good governance and pro-poor economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |year=2010 |title=Research for Development Project Record/ International Centre for Tax and Development |publisher=[[DFID]] |url=http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/60813 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714143321/http%3A//r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/60813/ |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title=Beyond Magic Bullets in Governance Reform |publisher= [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] |url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/11/04/beyond-magic-bullets-in-governance-reform }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards these ends, the ICTD fosters a network of social science researchers from developing countries to engage with taxation issues by funding research, building research capacity through courses and workshops, and collaborating with a range of partners including the [[African Tax Administration Forum]], the [[Institute for Security Studies]], and the [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title=International Centre for Tax and Development |publisher= [[Institute of Development Studies]] |url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/project/international-centre-for-tax-and-development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title=RRA urged to embrace best international taxation practices |publisher= The New Times |url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2015-07-28/191023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title=Tax incentives and exemptions not necessary to attract investment |publisher= Institute of Development Studies |url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/tax-incentives-and-exemptions-not-necessary-to-attract-investment}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also aims to disseminate its research evidence to policymakers through its publications and annual centre meetings in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title= $2.48 Billion is what Dar has lost through trade misinvoicing in a decade |publisher= Empire Voice |url=http://empirevoice.blogspot.co.ke/2014/12/248-billion-is-what-has-dar-lost.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title= How TZ loses $248m to miners |publisher= The Citizen |url=http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/How-TZ-loses--248m-to-miners/-/1840392/2549666/-/pvx74bz/-/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By sharing its research findings, the ICTD aims to widen the public debate on taxation and governance in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2012 |title= UK urged to support Zambia's tax-raising from multinationals |publisher= [[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/feb/29/uk-urged-support-zambia-tax-multinationals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= Africa:pumping up the tax volume |publisher= [[Public Finance (magazine)|Public Finance]] |url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/feature/2015/10/africa-pumping-tax-volume}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= Africa: Tax Targeting Won't Work and Could Undermine SDGs |publisher= [[AllAfrica.com]] |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201504161196.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= IDS: Taxes Help Spur Development |publisher= [[Voice of America]] |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/development-taxes-14jul14/2861000.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2013 |title= Africa's Tax Systems: Progress, but What's the Next Generation of Reforms? |publisher= [[World Bank]] |url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/africa-s-tax-systems-progress-what-next-generation-reforms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2012 |title= Zambia: Unequal Wealth Share Worries ICTD |publisher= AllAfrica.com |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201211141287.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title= What happens to people's willingness to pay tax when the richest dodge their responsibilities? |publisher= [[Phys.org]] |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-08-people-willingness-tax-richest-dodge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The ICTD's research aims to generate knowledge to help develop better tax systems in the developing world, particularly [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. To this end, the ICTD conducts and provides grants for research along the following themes:

* International Tax
* Local Government Tax
* Tax Administration and Reform
* Taxpayer Compliance and Perceptions
* Informal Sector Tax 
* Natural Resource Tax
* Taxation in Post-Conflict States
* Cross-National Tax Data and Econometrics

In order to facilitate better research on tax issues, the ICTD created the Government Revenue Dataset, the most complete and accurate cross-country dataset on government revenue, which importantly separates natural resource revenue from other revenue streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title= Global tax-comparison database launched to boost transparency |publisher= [[Public Finance (magazine)|Public Finance]] |url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/news/2014/09/global-tax-comparison-database-launched-boost-transparency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title= How can we better compare fiscal fundamentals? |publisher= [[Public Finance (magazine)|Public Finance]] |url=http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/opinion/2014/09/how-can-we-better-compare-fiscal-fundamentals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2014 |title= Bad Tax Data, Bad Tax Research?

==Publications==
ICTD has published and supported the publication of many working papers, policy briefings, journal articles, and books. In January 2015, a report written by the ICTD's CEO Mick Moore and ATAF's Nara Monkam was published about how property tax would benefit Africa, which was subsequently discussed by [[The Africa Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= Lagos proves Africa's Property Tax Potential|publisher= The Africa Report |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/Columns/lagos-proves-africas-property-tax-potential.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''L2 Syntactical Complexity Analyzer''' (L2SCA) developed by [[Xiaofei Lu]] at the [[Pennsylvania State University]], is a computational tool which produces [[language complexity|syntactic complexity]] indices of written English language texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aihaiyang.com/software/l2sca/|title=L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer|date=12 September 2018|publisher=Aihaiyang.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Coh-Metrix]], the L2SCA is one of the most extensively used computational tool to compute indices of [[second language writing]] development. The L2SCA is also widely utilised in the field of [[corpus linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789401786447|title=Computational Methods for Corpus Annotation and Analysis|date=12 September 2018|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The L2SCA is available in a single and a batch mode. The first provides the possibility of analyzing a single written text for 14 syntactic complexity indices. The latter allows the user to analyze 30 written texts simultaneously.

==Usage==
===Second language writing development===
The L2SCA has been used in numerous studies in the field of second language writing development to compute indices of syntactic complexity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1060374315000417|title=Diane Mazgutova &amp; Judit Kormos: Syntactic and lexical development in an intensive English for Academic Purposes programme|date=12 September 2018|publisher=[[Journal of Second Language Writing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/dujal.5.1.04loe|title=Junping Hou, Marjolijn Verspoor &amp; Hanneke Loerts: An exploratory study into the dynamics of Chinese L2 writing development|date=12 September 2018|publisher=Dutch Journal of Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/events/laelpgconference/papers/v08/Attila-M-Wind.pdf|title=Attila M. Wind: Second language writing development from a Dynamic Systems Theory perspective|date=12 September 2018|publisher=[[Lancaster University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corpus linguistics===
The L2SCA has also been used in various studies in the field of [[corpus linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1060374315000405|title=Lu &amp; Ai: Syntactic complexity in college-level English writing: Differences among writers with diverse L1 backgrounds|date=September 2015|publisher=[[Science direct]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-artslaw/corpus/conference-archives/2017/general/paper37.pdf|title=Nasseri: A Corpus-based Analysis of Syntactic Complexity measures in the Academic Writing of EFL, ESL, and Native English Master’s Students|date=12 September 2018|publisher=Birmingham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7141">The '''maximum theorem''' provides conditions for the [[continuous function|continuity]] of an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]] function and the set of its maximizers as a parameter changes. The statement was first proven by [[Claude Berge]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Ok, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem is primarily used in [[mathematical economics]].

==Statement of theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; be metric spaces, &lt;math&gt;f:X\times\Theta\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a function jointly continuous in its two arguments, and &lt;math&gt;C:\Theta\twoheadrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; be a compact-valued [[Multivalued function|correspondence]].

For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, let
: &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)=\max\{f(x,\theta)|x\in C(\theta)\}&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)=\mathrm{arg}\max\{f(x,\theta)|x\in C(\theta)\}=\{x\in C(\theta)\,|\,f(x,\theta)=f^*(\theta)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is continuous (i.e. both upper and lower [[hemicontinuity|hemicontinuous]]) at some &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, compact-valued, and upper hemicontinuous at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Interpretation==
The theorem is typically interpreted as providing conditions for a parametric optimization problem to have continuous solutions with regard to the parameter. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter space, &lt;math&gt;f(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the function to be maximized, and &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; gives the constraint set that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is maximized over. Then, &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the maximized value of the function and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points that maximize &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

The result is that if the elements of an optimization problem are sufficiently continuous, then some, but not all, of that continuity is preserved in the solutions.

==Proof==
The proof relies primarily on the sequential definitions of upper and lower [[hemicontinuity]].

Because &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is compact-valued and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, the [[extreme value theorem]] guarantees the constrained maximum of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty for all &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then, let &lt;math&gt;\theta_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence converging to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n \in C^*(\theta_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is upper hemicontinuous, there exists a convergent subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_{n_k}\to x \in C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. 

If it is shown that &lt;math&gt;x \in C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, then
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty} f^*(\theta_{n_k}) = \lim_{k \to \infty} f(x_{n_k},\theta_{n_k}) = f(x,\theta) = f^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
which would simultaneously prove the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; and the upper hemicontinuity of &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose to the contrary that &lt;math&gt;x \not\in C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. there exists an &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\in C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(\hat{x},\theta) &gt; f(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is lower hemicontinuous, there is a further subsequence of &lt;math&gt;n_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_{n_j} \in C(\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_{n_j} \to \hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;. By the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the contradiction hypothesis,
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} f(\hat{x}_{n_j},\theta_{n_j}) = f(\hat{x},\theta) &gt; f(x,\theta) = \lim_{j \to \infty} f(x_{n_j},\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt;.
But this implies that for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;f(\hat{x}_{n_j},\theta_{n_j}) &gt; f(x_{n_j},\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt;
which would mean &lt;math&gt;x_{n_j}&lt;/math&gt; is not a maximizer, a contradiction of &lt;math&gt;x_n \in C^*(\theta_n)&lt;/math&gt;. This establishes the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; and the upper hemicontinuity of &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Because &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta) \subset C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is compact, it is sufficient to show &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is closed-valued for it to be compact-valued. This can be done by contradiction using sequences similar to above.

==Variants and generalizations==
If in addition to the conditions above, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[quasiconcave]] in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is also convex-valued. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly quasiconcave in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is single-valued, and thus is a continuous function rather than a correspondence.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Concave function|concave]] and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Convex set|convex]] graph, then &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is concave and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued. Similarly to above, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly concave, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function.&lt;ref&gt;Sundaram, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to generalize Berge's theorem to non-compact set-valued correspondences if the objective function is K-inf-compact.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Zadoianchuk, Kasyanov, Theorem 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Consider a [[utility maximization problem]] where a consumer makes a choice from their budget set. Translating from the notation above to the standard consumer theory notation,
* &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{R}_+^l&lt;/math&gt; is the space of all bundles of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; commodities,
* &lt;math&gt;\Theta=\mathbb{R}_{++}^l \times \mathbb{R}_{++}&lt;/math&gt; represents the price vector of the commodities &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the consumer's wealth &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;f(x,\theta)=u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the consumer's [[utility function]], and
* &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)=B(p,w)=\{x \,|\, px \leq w\}&lt;/math&gt; is the consumer's [[budget set]].

Then, 
* &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)=v(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indirect utility function]] and
* &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)=x(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Marshallian demand]].

Proofs in [[general equilibrium theory]] often apply the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem|Brouwer]] or [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]]s to the consumer's demand, which require compactness and continuity, and the maximum theorem provides the sufficient conditions to do so.

'''Montagu Brownlow Parker, 5th Earl of Morley''' ([[:fr:Montagu Brownlow Parker|13 October 1878 – 28 April 1962]]) was a [[British people|British]] [[aristocrat]] and army officer, best known for being one of the first real-life "[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]".

Lord Morley's father was [[Albert Edmund Parker, 3rd Earl of Morley]].  He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and served as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in the [[Grenadier Guards]] in the [[Second Boer War]] between 1900 and 1902, where he was wounded.  He was [[Aide-de-camp]] to GOC Germiston District, South Africa in 1902 and to GOC Home District in 1903.  He fought in the [[World War I|First World War]] during which he was [[mentioned in dispatches]] and decorated with the [[Croix de Guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p8109.htm#i81082 The Peerage, entry for 5th Earl of Morley]&lt;/ref&gt;  He inherited the earldom and other titles in 1951 after the death of his older brother [[Edmund Parker, 4th Earl of Morley|Edmund Robert Parker, 4th Earl of Morley]].
 
Lord Morley led the "Parker Expedition", which carried out excavations searching for treasure from [[Solomon's Temple]] between 1909 and 1911. [[Neil Asher Silberman]] described the expedition as "Conceived in folly, but planned with cunning, the Parker Mission had come to Jerusalem with a single goal: to locate and unearth the fantastic treasure of Solomon’s Temple buried beneath the Temple Mount."&lt;ref name=Silberman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silberman|first1=Neil Parker|title=In Search of Solomon’s Lost Treasures|journal=Biblical Archaeology Review|date=July–August 1980|volume=6|issue=4|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=6&amp;Issue=4&amp;ArticleID=3|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Morley died at the age of 83 in 1962.  He was unmarried and was succeeded in the earldom and other titles by his younger brother's son [[John Parker, 6th Earl of Morley|John St Aubyn Parker, 6th Earl of Morley]].

==Hughes Vincent Map==

The first expedition map documented the location of tunnels and artifacts discovered in and on the bedrock in the areas around [[Warren's Shaft|Warrens Shaft]] on the eastern slopes of the mountain above the Spring Citadel over the [[Gihon Spring]]. In recent years many of the map elements were verified by archaeologists [[Ronny Reich]] and [[Eli Shukron]].

'''Natural language processing''' ('''NLP''') is a subfield of [[computer science]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], and [[artificial intelligence]] concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of [[natural language]] data.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve [[speech recognition]], [[natural language understanding]], and [[natural language generation]].

==History==

The [[history of natural language processing]] generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods.
In 1950, [[Alan Turing]] published an article titled "[[Intelligence]]" which proposed what is now called the [[Turing test]] as a criterion of intelligence.

The [[Georgetown-IBM experiment|Georgetown experiment]] in 1954 involved fully [[automatic translation]] of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hutchins, J.|year=2005|url=http://ahs.annaisd.org/common/pages/GalleryPhoto.aspx?photoId=11772950&amp;width=180&amp;height=180|title=The history of machine translation in a nutshell}}{{self-published source|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, real progress was much slower, and after the [[ALPAC|ALPAC report]] in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced.  Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first [[statistical machine translation]] systems were developed.

Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were [[SHRDLU]], a natural language system working in restricted "[[blocks world]]s" with restricted vocabularies, and [[ELIZA]], a simulation of a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian psychotherapist]], written by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] between 1964 and 1966.  Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the "patient" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to "My head hurts" with "Why do you say your head hurts?".

During the 1970s, many programmers began to write "conceptual [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]]", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, many [[chatterbots]] were written including [[PARRY]], [[Racter]], and [[Jabberwacky]].

Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of [[machine learning]] algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see [[Moore's law]]) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] theories of linguistics (e.g. [[transformational grammar]]), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of [[corpus linguistics]] that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.&lt;ref&gt;Chomskyan linguistics encourages the investigation of "[[corner case]]s" that stress the limits of its theoretical models (comparable to [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] phenomena in mathematics), typically created using [[thought experiment]]s, rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real-world data, as is the case in [[corpus linguistics]].  The creation and use of such [[text corpus|corpora]] of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for natural language processing.  In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called "[[poverty of the stimulus]]" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing.  As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.  However, [[Part of speech tagging|part-of-speech tagging]] introduced the use of [[hidden Markov models]] to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on [[statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to the features making up the input data. The [[cache language model]]s upon which many [[speech recognition]] systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.

Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of [[machine translation]], due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed.  These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual [[text corpus|textual corpora]] that had been produced by the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the [[European Union]] as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.  However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.

Recent research has increasingly focused on [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] and [[semi-supervised learning]] algorithms.  Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.  Generally, this task is much more difficult than [[supervised learning]], and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.  However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the [[World Wide Web]]), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough [[time complexity]] to be practical.

In the 2010s, [[representation learning]] and [[deep learning|deep neural network]]-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques&lt;ref name=goldberg:nnlp17&gt;Goldberg, Yoav (2016).

MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling,&lt;ref name=jozefowicz:lm16&gt;Rafal Jozefowicz, Oriol Vinyals, Mike Schuster, Noam Shazeer, and Yonghui Wu (2016). https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410 Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling&lt;/ref&gt;
parsing,&lt;ref name=choe:emnlp16&gt;Do Kook Choe and Eugene Charniak (EMNLP 2016). https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/D16-1257/d16-1257 Parsing as Language Modeling&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vinyals:nips15"&gt;Vinyals, Oriol, et al. (NIPS2015). https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5635-grammar-as-a-foreign-language.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Popular techniques include the use of [[word embedding]]s to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term ''[[neural machine translation]]'' (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that were used in [[statistical machine translation]] (SMT).

==Rule-based vs. statistical NLP==
In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by hand-coding a set of rules,&lt;ref name=winograd:shrdlu71&gt;Winograd, Terry (1971). Procedures as a Representation for Data in a Computer Program for Understanding Natural Language. http://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schank77&gt;Roger C. Schank and Robert P. Abelson (1977). Scripts, plans, goals, and understanding: An inquiry into human knowledge structures&lt;/ref&gt;, e.g. by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for [[stemming]].
However, this is rarely robust to natural language variation. 

Since the so-called "statistical revolution"&lt;ref name=johnson:eacl:ilcl09&gt;[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-0103 Mark Johnson. How the statistical revolution changes (computational) linguistics.] Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Workshop on the Interaction between Linguistics and Computational Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resnik:langlog11&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2946 Philip Resnik. Four revolutions.] Language Log, February 5, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;
in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on [[machine learning]].

The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using [[statistical inference]] to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large ''[[text corpus|corpora]]'' of typical real-world examples (a ''corpus'' (plural, "corpora") is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations).

Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks. These algorithms take as input a large set of "features" that are generated from the input data. Some of the earliest-used algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to the systems of hand-written rules that were then common. Increasingly, however, research has focused on [[statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to each input feature. Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.

Systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules:
*The learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus on the most common cases, whereas when writing rules by hand it is often not at all obvious where the effort should be directed.
*Automatic learning procedures can make use of statistical-inference algorithms to produce models that are robust to unfamiliar input (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and to erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted). Generally, handling such input gracefully with hand-written rules—or, more generally, creating systems of hand-written rules that make soft decisions—is extremely difficult, error-prone and time-consuming.
*Systems based on automatically learning the rules can be made more accurate simply by supplying more input data. However, systems based on hand-written rules can only be made more accurate by increasing the complexity of the rules, which is a much more difficult task.  In particular, there is a limit to the complexity of systems based on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable.  However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process.

==Major evaluations and tasks==
The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing.  Note that some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.

Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they are frequently subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.

===Syntax===
; [[Grammar induction]]&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Dan, and Christopher D. Manning. "[http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1945-natural-language-grammar-induction-using-a-constituent-context-model.pdf Natural language grammar induction using a constituent-context model]." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;: Generate a [[formal grammar]] that describes a language's syntax.
; [[Lemmatisation|Lemmatization]]: The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma.
; [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphological segmentation]]: Separate words into individual [[morpheme]]s and identify the class of the morphemes.  The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. the structure of words) of the language being considered. [[English language|English]] has fairly simple morphology, especially [[inflectional morphology]], and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. "open, opens, opened, opening") as separate words.  In languages such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Meitei language|Meitei]],&lt;ref&gt;Kishorjit, N., Vidya Raj RK., Nirmal Y., and Sivaji B. (2012) "[http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W12/W12-5008.pdf Manipuri Morpheme Identification]", Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing (SANLP), pages 95–108, COLING 2012, Mumbai, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a highly [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.
; [[Part-of-speech tagging]]: Given a sentence, determine the [[part of speech]] for each word.  Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple [[parts of speech]].  For example, "book" can be a [[noun]] ("the book on the table") or [[verb]] ("to book a flight"); "set" can be a [[noun]], [[verb]] or [[adjective]]; and "out" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.  Some languages have more such ambiguity than others.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}  Languages with little [[inflectional morphology]], such as [[English language|English]], are particularly prone to such ambiguity. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] is prone to such ambiguity because it is a [[tonal language]] during verbalization. Such inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning.
; [[Parsing]]: (see also: [[Stochastic grammar]]) Determine the [[parse tree]] (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence.  The [[grammar]] for [[natural language]]s is [[ambiguous]] and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses.  In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human). There are two primary types of parsing, Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing. Dependency Parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like Primary Objects and predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing focuses on building out the Parse Tree using a [[Probabilistic_context-free_grammar|Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar]] (PCFG). 
; [[Sentence breaking]] (also known as [[sentence boundary disambiguation]]): Given a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries.  Sentence boundaries are often marked by [[Full stop|period]]s or other [[punctuation mark]]s, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g. marking [[abbreviation]]s).
; [[Stemming]]
; [[Word segmentation]]:Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words.  For a language like [[English language|English]], this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces.  However, some written languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the [[vocabulary]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words in the language. Sometimes this process is also used in cases like Bag of Words (BOW) creation in data mining.
; [[Terminology extraction]]: The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.

===Semantics===
; [[Lexical semantics]]: What is the computational meaning of individual words in context?
; [[Machine translation]]: Automatically translate text from one human language to another.  This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed "[[AI-complete]]", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) in order to solve properly.
; [[Named entity recognition]] (NER): Given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization).  Note that, although [[capitalization]] can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient.  For example, the first word of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names. For example, [[German language|German]] capitalizes all [[noun]]s, regardless of whether they are names, and [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] do not capitalize names that serve as [[adjective]]s.
; [[Natural language generation]]: Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language.
; [[Natural language understanding]]: Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as [[first-order logic]] structures that are easier for [[computer]] programs to manipulate. Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as [[closed-world assumption]] (CWA) vs. [[open-world assumption]], or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.&lt;ref&gt;Yucong Duan, Christophe Cruz (2011), ''[http://www.ijimt.org/abstract/100-E00187.htm Formalizing Semantic of Natural Language through Conceptualization from Existence]''. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009135952/http://www.ijimt.org/abstract/100-E00187.htm |date=2011-10-09 }} International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology(2011) 2 (1), pp. 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR): Given an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.
; [[Question answering]]: Given a human-language question, determine its answer.  Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as "What is the capital of Canada?"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as "What is the meaning of life?"). Recent works have looked at even more complex questions.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Textual entailment|Recognizing Textual entailment]]: Given two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other's negation, or allows the other to be either true or false.&lt;ref name=rte:11&gt; PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE-7) https://tac.nist.gov//2011/RTE/ &lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Relationship extraction]]: Given a chunk of text, identify the relationships among named entities (e.g. who is married to whom).
; [[Sentiment analysis]] (see also [[multimodal sentiment analysis]]): Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine "polarity" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing.
; [[Topic segmentation]] and recognition: Given a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.
; [[Word sense disambiguation]]: Many words have more than one [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.  For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a dictionary or from an online resource such as [[WordNet]].

===Discourse===
; [[Automatic summarization]]: Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text.  Often used to provide summaries of text of a known type, such as articles in the financial section of a newspaper.
; [[Coreference|Coreference resolution]]: Given a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words ("mentions") refer to the same objects ("entities"). [[Anaphora resolution]] is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up [[pronoun]]s with the nouns or names to which they refer. The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called "bridging relationships" involving [[referring expression]]s. For example, in a sentence such as "He entered John's house through the front door", "the front door" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).
; [[Discourse analysis]]: This rubric includes a number of related tasks.  One task is identifying the [[discourse]] structure of connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast).  Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the [[speech act]]s in a chunk of text (e.g. yes-no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.).

===Speech===
; [[Speech recognition]]: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  This is the opposite of [[text to speech]] and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed "[[AI-complete]]" (see above).  In [[natural speech]] there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus [[speech segmentation]] is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below).  Note also that in most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed [[coarticulation]], so the conversion of the [[analog signal]] to discrete characters can be a very difficult process.
; [[Speech segmentation]]: Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separate it into words.  A subtask of [[speech recognition]] and typically grouped with it.
; [[Text-to-speech]]:Given a text, transform those units and produce a spoken representation. Text-to-speech can be used to aid the visually impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Yi|first=Chucai|title=Assistive Text Reading from Complex Background for Blind Persons|date=2012|work=Camera-Based Document Analysis and Recognition|pages=15–28|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-29364-1_2|isbn=9783642293634|last2=Tian|first2=Yingli|citeseerx=10.1.1.668.869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurohydrodynamics''' is a division of [[neurophysics]] that focuses on the [[hydrodynamics]] of the neurological system.  It applies physical principles and design concepts to neurophysics seeking to close the gap between [[fluid mechanics]] and [[neurosurgical]] and [[neurological]] [[medicine]].  It combines fluid mechanics principles with neuroscience to improve neurological disorder healthcare [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and [[therapy]].

Neurohydrodynamics investigates the role of intracranial fluid hydrodynamics (e.g. [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[cerebral blood flow]], and [[interstitial fluid]]) in the [[pathophysiology]] of neurological disorders such as [[hydrocephalus]], [[Chiari malformation]], [[syringomyelia]], [[pseudotumor cerebri]], cerebral [[vasospasm]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and cerebral [[aneurysm]].

Neurohydrodynamics is an emerging discipline within [[neurophysics]].  Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] specialization among already-established fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in neurohydrodynamics consists of [[clinical research]] and [[in vitro]] or [[computational modeling]], spanning a broad array of subfields. Prominent neurohydrodynamic applications include the development of [[cerebral shunt]]s, [[lumbar-peritoneal shunt]]s, [[intrathecal pump]]s, [[neural drug delivery systems]] and various diagnostic and therapeutic [[medical device]]s ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants.  Neurohydrodynamics relies heavily on [[neuroimaging]] modalities such as flow sensitized [[MRI]].

[[File:Sepia officinalis (aquarium).jpg|thumbnail|right|''Sepia officinalis'' (cuttlefish)]]
'''''Officinalis''''', or '''''officinale''''', is a [[Medieval Latin]] [[epithet]] denoting substances or [[organism]]s &amp;ndash; mainly [[plant]]s &amp;ndash; with uses in [[medicine]] and [[herbalism]]. It commonly occurs as a [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]] - the second term of a two-part botanical name. '''''Officinalis''''' is used to modify masculine and feminine nouns, while '''''officinale''''' is used for neuter nouns.

==Etymology==
The word ''officinalis'' literally means "of or belonging to an ''officina''", the storeroom of a monastery, where medicines and other necessaries were kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stearn, William T. |title=Botanical Latin |publisher=Timber Press (OR) |location= |year=2004 |page=456 |isbn=0-88192-627-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0hZvTFJUioC&amp;pg=PA456}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Officina'' was a contraction of ''opificina'', from ''opifex'' (gen. ''opificis'') "worker, maker, doer" (from ''opus'' "work") + -''fex'', -''ficis'', "one who does," from ''facere'' "do, perform".&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary, entry  [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=officinalis&amp;searchmode=none "officinalis"], accessed May 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Linnaeus]] invented the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system of nomenclature]], he gave the specific name "officinalis", in the 1735 (1st Edition) of his [[Systema Naturae]], to plants (and  sometimes animals) with an established medicinal, culinary, or other use.&lt;ref&gt;Pearn J.,"On 'officinalis' the names of plants as one enduring history of therapeutic medicine.

Within the work of the Austrian psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957), '''orgastic potency''' is the ability to experience an [[orgasm]] with specific [[psychosomatic]] characteristics and, among others, requiring the ability to love.&lt;ref&gt;"Reich's account of the ideal sexual act is remarkable both for its explicitness, which must have required courage in the pre-Kinsey, pre-Masters and Johnson era in which it was written, and for its omission of the word 'love'. And yet it is clear that it is love that he is talking about. Orgastic potency as formulated by Reich is the capacity to love body and soul, psychosomatically."{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 33.
*Mah, Kenneth and Yitzchak M. Binik (2001) "The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends," ''Clinical Psychology Review'' '''21'''(6): 823-56: Reich's model takes a unisex, "integrated biopsychological perspective."
*Corrington, Robert S. (2003) ''Wilhelm Reich: Psychoanalyist and Radical Naturalist'', New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, p. 88.: "The coda to the entire argument of ''Genitality'' was sounded in two striking sentences: 'Satisfied genital object love is thus [the justified aim] of our therapeutic efforts.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

For Reich, "orgastic impotence", or failure to attain orgastic potency (not to be confused with [[anorgasmia]], the inability to reach orgasm) always resulted in [[neurosis]], because during orgasm that person could not discharge all [[libido]] (which Reich regarded as a biological energy). According to Reich, "not a single neurotic individual possesses orgastic potency."&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Yiannis. ''Freud and Society''. Routledge, 1983, [https://books.google.com/books?id=suI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 p. 178].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich coined the term ''orgastic impotence'' in 1924 and described the concept in his 1927 book ''[[Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis|Die Funktion des Orgasmus]]'', the manuscript of which he presented to [[Sigmund Freud]] on the latter's 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 91-2, 100, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Reich regarded his work as complementing Freud's original theory of anxiety neurosis, Freud was ambivalent in his reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud's view was that there was no single cause of neurosis.&lt;ref name=Freudletter&gt;[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ipl.089.0174a "Letter from Freud to Lou Andreas-Salomé, May 9, 1928"], The International Psycho-Analytical Library, 89:174-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich continued to use the concept as an indicator of a person's health in his later therapeutic methods, such as [[vegetotherapy]].&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243"/&gt; During the period 1933–1937, he attempted to ground his orgasm theory in physiology, both theoretically and experimentally.&lt;ref name="Boadella 1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 102, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich developed his orgasm theory between 1921 and 1924 and it formed the basis for all his later contributions, including the theory of [[Character Analysis|character analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The starting point of Reich's orgasm theory was his clinical observation of genital disturbance in all neurotics,&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 86-105.&lt;/ref&gt; which he presented in November 1923, in the paper "Über Genitalität vom Standpunkt der psychoanalytischen Prognose und Therapie" ("Genitality from the viewpoint of psycho-analytic prognosis and therapy"). That presentation was met with a chilling silence, much hostility, and was partially discredited because Reich could not adequately define normal sexual health. In response, and after a further year of research, Reich introduced the concept "orgastic potency" at the 1924 Psycho-analytic Congress, Salzburg in the paper "Die therapeutische Bedeutung des Genitallibidos" ("Further Remarks on the Therapeutic Significance of Genital Libido").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his own patients' love lives, Reich examined through interviews and case records those of 200 patients seen at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Polyclinic. Reich was impressed by the depth and frequency of genital disturbances he observed. One example was a patient who had reported having a normal sex life, but on closer interviewing by Reich revealed not experiencing orgasm during intercourse and having thoughts of murdering her partner following the act. Such observations made Reich very suspicious of superficial reports about sexual experience.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/&gt; His analysis of these cases led Reich to conclude that genital disturbance was present in all neuroses and correlated in severity to the severity of the neurosis, and that all patients who improved in therapy and remained symptom-free achieved a gratifying genital sex life.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"&gt;{{harvnb|Raknes|1944}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This led Reich to establish criteria for satisfactory sexual intercourse. Based on interviews with people who appeared to have satisfactory sex lives, he described the sex act as being optimally satisfactory only if it follows a specific pattern.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt; Orgastic potency is Reich's term for the ability to have this maximally fulfilling type of sexual experience, which in the Reichian view is limited to those who are free from neuroses and appears to be shared by all people free of neuroses.&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt;

==Definition ==
Reich's precise definition for the phrase "orgastic potency" changed over time as he changed his understanding of the phenomenon. He first described it in detail in his 1927 book ''Die Funktion Des Orgasmus.'' In the 1980 English translation of the book, ''Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neuroses'', he defined orgastic potency as "the ability to achieve full resolution of existing sexual need-tension".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1980}}: 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1940 book ''Die Entdeckung des Orgons Erster Teil: Die Function des Orgasmus'', published in English in 1942 as ''The Discovery of the Orgone, Volume 1: The Function of the Orgasm'', he defined it as "the capacity to surrender to the flow of biological energy, free of any inhibitions; the capacity to discharge completely the dammed-up sexual excitation through involuntary, pleasurable convulsions of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 102. Note: the original reads "damned-up" but this is probably a typo.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last published definition of orgastic potency, which is part of his 1960 published ''Selected Writings'', is "the capacity for complete surrender to the involuntary convulsion of the organism and complete discharge of the excitation at the acme of the genital embrace."&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 10"/&gt;

Reich related orgastic potency and orgastic impotence to a, respectively, healthy and unhealthy sexual experience for the adult.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Boadella|1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 17-8.&lt;/ref&gt; He described that the healthy experience has specific biological and psychological characteristics; is identical for men and women;&lt;ref&gt;Reich's model takes a unisex, "integrated biopsychological perspective."

The difference between the presence and absence of orgastic potency in the sexual encounter, as described by Reich, is summarised by Boadella as follows:&lt;ref name="harvnb|Boadella|1985"/&gt;

== Orgasm theory ==
Reich was strongly influenced by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s distinction between psychoneuroses and actual neuroses, the latter being considered of a physiological origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the related [[libido]] as the energy of an unconscious sexual instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Reich emphasised the libido theory exactly when it was being discarded by psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud observed that one group of patients suffering from neurosis had sexual disturbances&amp;mdash;practising [[coitus interruptus]], conflicts related to [[masturbation]] or [[sexual abstinence]]&amp;mdash;and were cured when these disturbances were removed. Hence, Freud reasoned that sexual maladaption caused the active damming-up of "sexual stuff"&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt; and defined "actual neurosis" as [[anxiety]] based on dammed-up [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kovel|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, those with [[Psychoneurosis|psychoneuroses]] had conflicts related to the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]: repressed impulses, desires and memories, and repressed unresolved conflicts and childhood [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]s.&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt; Freud abandoned this view in the 1920s and postulated the never popularly accepted [[death instinct]] to explain the destructive behaviour that was earlier attributed to frustrated libido.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 34, 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich distinguished between complete release of accumulated sexual tensions in orgasm, resulting in the restoration of energy equilibrium, and orgastic impotence, in which the release of energy is incomplete.&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Neurotic Sexuality."&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, he argued that the inability of psychoneurotics to wholly discharge sexual energy caused a damming up of energy (or sexual stasis), leaving them in a vicious circle: the actual neurosis physiologically provided the energy for the psychoneurosis, while the psychoneurosis provided a psychological mechanism to maintain the actual neurosis.&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Reich defined neurosis as the sum total of all chronic and automatic inhibitions of natural sexual excitations&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/&gt; and which results in an outer rigidity and inner anxiety fuelling harshness, brutality, sexual sadism, restriction, mechanisation, confinement to routines and becoming filled with compulsions or phobias as well as loneliness, helplessness, craving for authority, fear of responsibility and mystical longing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 3, 10 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; Orgastic potency enables the individual to receive satisfaction in the sex act, whereas those lacking in it are forever seeking it, and are therefore likely to be more sexually needy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 12 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich's view of the relationship between actual and psychoneuroses has not found its way into psychoanalytic thinking. However, it has the advantage of connecting psychopathology with physiology and, according to [[Charles Rycroft]], this makes Reich the only psychoanalyst to provide any explanation as to why childhood pathogenic experiences (causing neuroses in classical psychoanalysis) do not disappear when neurotics leave their childhood environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rycroft|1971}}: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurrence in Reich's work==
Reich expanded on the concept throughout his career. In his 1942 scientific autobiography ''The Discovery of Orgone, Vol. 1: The Function of the Orgasm'', Reich provided the following summary of his findings regarding orgastic potency: it is an outcome of [[health]], he argued, because full orgastic potency can only come about if a person is psychologically free of neurosis (pleasure [[anxiety]] absent), physically free from "body armor" (chronic [[Muscle contraction|muscular contraction]] absent), socially free from [[Compulsive behavior|compulsive]] morality and duty as imposed by [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and mechanistic ways of life, and has the natural ability to love.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, Reich held that the vast majority of people do not meet these criteria and thus lack orgastic potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Konia|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reich retained the idea of a sexual energy and the concept orgastic potency as central elements in [[sex-economy]], a general Reichian theory of health dealing with an organism's energy household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raknes|1944}}: "Lead."&lt;/ref&gt; Reich progressively called this energy libido, sexual energy, emotional energy, bioelectric energy, biophysical energy and, finally, [[orgone]] ("life") energy. In terms of this theory, an individual lacking in orgastic potency is unable to fully discharge energy in orgasm, and thus remains in a constant state of tension, both physical rigidity and mental anxiety, which constitutes neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 2, 10 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character and muscular armor ===
In Reichian psychology, the individual lacking orgastic potency is seen to have developed a neurotic [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] "armor" that blocks the experience of pleasure. This is differentiated between the functionally identical "character armor" and "muscular armor."&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1961}}: 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Reichian character analysis is the concept of "character resistance" or "character defence", by which a person's character&amp;mdash;what the patient did rather than what he or she said&amp;mdash;was seen as his or her primary defence mechanism. Character attributes include posture, expression, and way of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reich defined character armor as "[t]he sum total of typical character attitudes which an individual develops as a blocking against his emotional excitations, resulting in rigidity of the body, lack of emotional contact, and 'deadness'."&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 10"/&gt;

===Genital and neurotic character===
Reich used the terms "genital character" and "neurotic character" respectively to distinguish between characters with and without orgastic potency. Real characters of actual people are considered to be somewhere on a continuum between the two. The genital character is the non-neurotic character structure, which is free from armor and, therefore, has the capacity of natural-self regulation on the basis of orgastic potency.&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 9-12"&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1961}}: 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The genital character is able to fully focus on a task or object, has a natural yearning for continued human contact that finds expression in work and social life, feels a healthy sympathy for fellow human beings in sorrow and happiness, and experiences life as a fulfilment and unfolding of his or her natural tendencies and struggle to achieve objectives. His or her sex life attains full bloom in a context of heterosexual intercourse with full surrender, without identifying the partner either consciously or unconsciously with a parent, without wishing to torment or to be tormented, without accepting celibacy except for strongly convincing reasons, and without looking for another partner so long as his or her affection for the partner is reciprocated.&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt;

The neurotic character operates under a principle of compulsive moral regulation due to chronic energy stasis.&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 9-12"/&gt; The neurotic character's work and life is permeated by struggle to suppress original and even more basic urges or tendencies. The various forms of neurotic character correspond to the equally many ways of suppressing such urges or tendencies that the human being in question considers to be dangerous or is ashamed of. A feeling of inferiority may sometimes lead to a striving for power and honor; work is directed by such desires or by duty, rather than by a striving for joy and happiness. His or her sex life is disturbed by impulses derived from pregenital wishes, so strong that they prevent the experience of full release during orgasm, or else genital wishes are so suppressed by prohibitions and a guilty conscience that they either inhibit a full release during orgasm or prevent the establishment of an adult sex life.&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt; Sexual discharge will leave him or her empty, unsatisfied, and not fully at peace,&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/&gt; resulting in sensations of emptiness and a feeling of inferiority, a widespread phenomenon termed [[post-coital tristesse]].&lt;ref name="Raknes 1944"/&gt;

Reich argued that if repression occurred, this energy, in the form of stored emotions or [[affect (psychology)|affect]]s, was held back by [[Muscle contraction|muscular contraction]] or armor, which restricts and immobilises the body and becomes the [[Somatopsychic|somatic]] core of neuroses, making full orgastic discharge impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 2 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; Reich defined muscular armor as: "The sum total of the muscular attitudes (chronic muscular spasms) which an individual develops as a block against the breakthrough of emotions and organ sensations, in particular anxiety, rage, and sexual excitation."&lt;ref name="Reich 1961 9-12"/&gt; Muscular armor prevents the sexual climax from being experienced throughout the body.&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Orgiastic"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Orgiastic Potency" {{sic}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, forms of armoring are pulling back the [[pelvis]] or tightening the [[thigh]] and [[buttock]] muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|2008}}: "Sexuality and Armoring."&lt;/ref&gt; Reich regarded the ego as playing an active part in the act of perception, since whereas some people perceive the gentle stroking of an [[erogenous zone]] as pleasurable, for others it is merely a tactile sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Resolving armor ====
{{Main|Vegetotherapy}} {{Further|Body psychotherapy|Neo-Reichian massage|Bioenergetic analysis|Gestalt therapy|Primal therapy}}
Dissolving character and muscular rigidifications or armorings is the basic principle of Reichian [[vegetotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1999}}: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This dissolution softens movement, eases breathing, and can also bring back the repressed memory of the childhood situation that caused the repression, Reich wrote.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 238-41, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The two goals of vegetotherapy are the attainment of orgastic potency during sexual intercourse and of the "orgasm reflex" during therapy. The orgasm reflex may be observed as waves of pleasure moving through the body, a series of spontaneous, involuntary movements,&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 238-41, 243"/&gt; and signifies that the person is free of body armoring, entailing the ability to give and receive love in all its forms.&lt;ref name="Daniels 2008 Neurotic"/&gt;

=== Implications for society ===

==== Prevention through social reform ====
''The Invasion of Compulsory Sex-Morality'', written in 1931, was Reich's first step in approaching the answer to the problem of mass neuroses in society, followed by ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' and ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf|The Sexual Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary sociological issues with which Reich dealt included in particular the following three:
# How to prevent neurosis through correct upbringing and education.
# How to prevent sex-negative attitudes in society through sexual reform.
# How to prevent authoritarian repression through general social reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Negative social effects ====
Reich coined the term "emotional plague" to refer to a special group dynamic when the destructive, pathological impulses of a group of neurotic characters become mutually reinforcing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 215.&lt;/ref&gt;
“Emotional” refers to the element of social irrationalism in people. “Plague” refers to the contagious, infectious nature and the difficulty of resisting it. Thus, whereas the neurotic character struggles with feelings of guilt in order to suppress destructive drives (e.g. a torture fantasy), people with the emotional plague unconsciously provide each other with a social alibi to act out these suppressed drives. That is, they adopt a group ideology that rationalises acting on irrational, secondary drives. An example would be the [[Salem witch trials]] in which dissident Christians were tortured and executed by their own group.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Bio-electric experiments===
In 1934, Reich expanded his orgasm theory in the essay "Der Orgasmus als Elektro-physiologische Entladung" ("The Orgasm as an Electrophysiological Discharge").&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 103-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Through clinical observations in his sex-counseling centers, Reich concluded that conceiving of the orgasm as only mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience gratification and others do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1982}}: 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, based on the work of [[Friedrich Kraus]] and others, Reich proposed that the orgasm is a bio-electric discharge, and is part of what Reich termed the orgasm formula:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
mechanical tension &gt; bioelectric charge &gt; bioelectric discharge &gt; mechanical relaxation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Secondly, in 1934 Reich published the paper "Der Urgegensatz des Vegetatives Lebens" ("Sexuality and Anxiety: The Basic Antithesis of Vegetative Life"). The paper is a literature study in which Reich explored "the physiology of the ''autonomic nervous system'', the ''chemistry'' of anxiety, the ''electro-physiology'' of the body fluids and the ''hydro-mechanics'' of plasma movements in protozoa."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 103-4, italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt; In conclusion, Reich proposed a functional psychosomatic antithesis between the [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] nervous systems, captured respectively as pleasure or movement "towards the world", and anxiety or movement "away from the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reich|1982}}: 68-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The corollary is the idea that bioelectric energy displayed an antithetic function: if it flows outward to the skin surface, causing a build-up of charge at the skin, it is experienced as [[pleasure]]; in contrast, if it flows inward, away from the skin surface, resulting in a lowering of charge at the skin, then it is experienced as an increase in central tension or [[anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 6-7 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, in 1937 Reich published ''Experimentelle Ergebnisse über die elektrische Funktion von Sexualitat und Angst'' (''The Bioelectrical Function of Sexuality and Anxiety'') in which he thought he experimentally verified the existence of what he first termed the "libidinal economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 131, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The report summarised two years of research into the reaction of the skin to states of pleasure and anxiety. His findings included the following: normal skin has a constant, basic electrical charge of 40 milivolts that does not change with mood states; erogenous zones have a wandering potential that can at times be much higher (200 milivolts) or lower, depending on the mood states; change in potential does not depend on the mechanical nature of the stimulus, but on changes in the subject's sensation or emotion; and, erogenous zones can have mechanical tension (be tumescent) without changes in levels of the charge, e.g. as in the case of a 'cold erection'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 131-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orgone energy===
A common misconception about Reich's later developed [[orgone energy accumulator]] is that he claimed it could provide orgastic potency to those sitting inside the device. Reich maintained the opposite: "The orgone accumulator, as has been clearly stated in the relevant publications (''The Cancer Biopathy'', etc.), cannot provide orgastic potency."&lt;ref&gt;Reich, W. (1950, April) ''Orgone Energy Bulletin'' '''2'''(2), quoted in [http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org/update_11_11.html November 2011 Update From The Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust and The Wilhelm Reich Museum], Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust (accessed 26 January 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in ''The Orgone Energy Accumulator, its Scientific and Medical Use'', Reich wrote: ”Neuroses cannot be cured with physical [[orgone]] energy."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Gardner, Martin (1957) ''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science'', Courier Dover Publications: 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic and psychoanalytic reception===
According to [[Myron Sharaf]], Reich's view that the capacity to unite tender and sensuous feelings is important for a healthy love relationship was not a new concept. Freud had noted this as early as 1912. However, Sharaf states that the involuntary physical aspects of the full genital discharge in Reich's work were new.&lt;ref name="Sharaf 1994 86-105"/&gt; He called the concept orgastic potency and the manner in which Reich "connected a series of psychological, social, and biological findings with the presence or absence of this function" unique to Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources--&gt;When Reich first introduced the orgasm theory at the psychoanalytic congress in Salzburg he was congratulated by [[Karl Abraham]] for successfully formulating the economic element of neurosis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, Reich's presentation of the orgasm theory came exactly when psychoanalysis was moving away from the original Freudian instinct theory based on psychic energy. In his 1926 book ''Inhibitions, Symptoms, Anxiety'' Freud completely abandoned his earlier position and wrote: "Anxiety never arises from repressed libido."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1948}}: 54, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud was ambivalent in his reception. When Reich presented him the manuscript of ''Die Funktion des Orgasmus'' in May 1926, Freud replied, "That thick?" Later that year he wrote to Reich that the book was "valuable, rich in observation and thought,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freud|1942}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; but in May 1928 wrote to [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]]: "We have here a Dr. Reich, a worthy but impetuous young man, passionately devoted to his hobby-horse, who now salutes in the genital orgasm the antidote to every neurosis. Perhaps he might learn from your analysis of K. to feel some respect for the complicated nature of the psyche."&lt;ref name=Freudletter/&gt;

Sharaf writes that the theory was immediately unpopular within psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharaf|1994}}: 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Federn]] (1871–1950), Reich's training assistant, and [[Hermann Nunberg]] (1884–1970) were particularly opposed to it. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The German psychiatrist [[Arthur Kronfeld]] (1886–1941) wrote a positive review of ''Die Funktion des Orgasmus'' in 1927: "In this extremely valuable and instructive work the author has really succeeded in broadening as well as deepening Freud's theory of sex and of the neuroses. He broadens it by clarifying for the first time the significance of the genital orgasm for the development and the whole structure of the neuroses; he deepens it by giving Freud's theory of the actual neuroses an exact psychological and physiological meaning. I do not hesitate to consider this work of Reich's the most valuable contribution since Freud's ''[[The Ego and the Id]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kronfeld|1927}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent Freudian to make clinical use of the concept orgastic potency was Edward Hitschmann, the Director of the Psychoanalytic Polyclinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 21.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

&lt;!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources--&gt;Two further reactions to Reich's work in the psychoanalytic movement were either completely ignoring it or using the concept as if it was commonly accepted, but without referring to Reich as the source. As a result, the theme orgastic potency survived but became divorced from the concepts in which Reich embedded it. For example, in ''Clinical Psychology'' Charles Berg uses Reich's sex economic theory of anxiety as his own without attributing it to Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Erikson]] was another psychoanalytic writer who partially adopted Reich's concept without acknowledgement. In his bestselling ''[[Childhood and Society]]'', Erikson wrote: "Genitality, then, consists in the unobstructed capacity to develop an orgastic potency so free of pregenital interferences that the genital libido . . . is expressed in heterosexual mutuality . . . and with a convulsion-like discharge of tension from the whole body."&lt;ref&gt;Erikson quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 23-5.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

&lt;!--needs academic/psychoanalytic sources--&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], in the classic textbook ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neuroses'', uses aspects of Reich's orgasm theory but disguised that they were Reich's contribution, and furthermore he hid the conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement that were explicit in Reich's work. A major entry mainly based on Fenichel's work appeared in the 1953, 1970 ''Psychiatric Dictionary'' by L. Hinsie and R. Campbell: "''Impotence'', orgastic: The incapacity for achieving the orgasm or acme of satisfaction in the sexual act. Many neurotics cannot achieve adequate discharge of their sexual energy through the sexual act. . . . According to Fenichel, an important concomitant of orgastic impotence is that these patients are incapable of love."&lt;ref&gt;Hinsie and Campbell quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

{{As of|2012|09}}, there are no peer-reviewed articles in the [[PubMed]] database that discuss the concept of orgastic potency or Reich's orgasm theory.&lt;ref&gt;PubMed (2012) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=reich%20AND%20orgas* "Orgastic Potency"]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--needs a secondary source: Reich's experimental investigating regarding the biological grounding of the orgasm theory, published as ''The Bioelectrical Investigations of Sexuality and Anxiety'', were reproduced in 2010 at the University of Vienna.

===Reichian legacy===
The two colleagues of Reich who build most on Reich's orgasm theory and orgastic potency are Philipson and Lowen. They emphasised the importance of human relationship in orgastic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tage Philipson, in his 1952 book ''Kaerlighedslivet: Natur Eller Unnatur'', studied natural and unnatural love-life. He wrote that "in healthy people sexuality and love will always be associated together. Sex will come from the heart and return to the heart. . . . the fully healthy person must be the person with completely free love feelings. . . . When this is the case other feelings will also be able to stream through the entire organism: hate, sorrow, anxiety, etc., and the orgasm, as the highest point of sexuality, will also be able to affect the entire organism."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philipson|1952}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Lowen]] in his 1966 book ''Love and Orgasm'' distinguishes between achieving orgasm in the Kinsey meaning of sexual performance, and the entering into a love relationship as a whole human, similar to Reich. Like Reich, Lowen considers the latter to be the expression of health, not a means to it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Theodore Wolfe, an American pioneer in psychosomatic medicine and later colleague of Reich, thought that anxiety was the cause of both neuroses and psychosomatic distortions. When reading Reich's ''Der Funktion des Orgasmus'' he found in it what he called the key to understanding the dynamics of this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Reich's sexual theories Elsworth Baker, a psychiatrist and colleague of Reich, wrote that in particular Reich's sexual theories were commonly misinterpreted and misunderstood. While Reich was portrayed as advocating "a wild frantic promiscuity" to seek "mystical, ecstatic orgasm" that could cure all neuroses and physical ills, Baker continues, Reich in fact found that the healthy person needs less sexual activity and that the orgasm has a function to maintain health only for the healthy person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1986}}: 1, 12 (in pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing definitions of orgasm==
The concepts of the sexual acme used in the famous 1948 and 1953 [[Kinsey report]]s and the 1966 research by [[Masters and Johnson]] were different from the one used by Reich. Reich directly related orgastic potency with the total response system, the personality, contact-ability, total psychosomatic health of a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Kinsey and Masters and Johnson restricted their conclusions to phenomena that all sexual climaxes had in common.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kinsey defined the male orgasm as "all cases of ejaculation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kinsey|1948}}: 59-60, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and the female orgasm as "the sudden and abrupt release . . . from sexual tension, [excluding] the satisfaction that may result from sexual experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kinsey|1953}}:628, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kinsey focusses on the physiology, anatomy and technique involved in inducing a discharge of tension. Therefore, Kinsey's usage of the term orgasm covers behaviour that in the Reichian typology ranges from orgastic potency to orgastic impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 26-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, examples of physiological distinctions Reich made but which were not pursued by Kinsey and Masters and Johnson include the difference between local and total bodily responses, and between voluntary and involuntary movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mature orgasm
{{See also|Orgasm#Clitoral and vaginal categories}}
In 1905, Freud developed the psychoanalytic distinction between clitoral and vaginal orgasm, with only the latter being identified with [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual maturity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction has since been challenged among others on physiological grounds. For example, Masters and Johnson wrote: "Are clitoral and vaginal orgasms truly separate and anatomic entities? From a biological point of view the answer to this question is an unequivocal NO."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Masters|1963}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Boadella|1985}}: 28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a clinically  grounded qualitative distinction between psychosexual maturity and immaturity was only introduced with Reich's concept orgastic potency vs. orgastic impotence (instead of vaginal vs. clitoral).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; As Masters and Johnson focussed on phenomena shared by all sexual climaxes - ranging from what Reich categorised as orgastic potency to impotence - their finding has no direct relevance to or implications for Reich's distinction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

'''The Pirbright Institute''' (formerly the '''Institute for Animal Health''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Surrey]], England, dedicated to the study of [[infectious disease]]s of [[livestock|farm animals]]. It forms part of the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government's]] [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC). The Institute employs scientists, vets, PhD students and operations staff.

==History==
It began in 1914 to test cows for [[tuberculosis]]. More buildings were added in 1925. Compton was established by the [[Agricultural Research Council]] in 1937. Pirbright became a research institute in 1939 and Compton in 1942. The Houghton Poultry Research Station at [[Houghton, Cambridgeshire]] was established in 1948. In 1963 Pirbright became the Animal Virus Research Institute and Compton became the Institute for Research on Animal Diseases. The Neuropathogenesis Unit (NPU) was established in Edinburgh in 1981. This became part of the [[Roslin Institute]] in 2007.

In 1987, Compton, Houghton and Pirbright became the Institute for Animal Health, being funded by BBSRC. Houghton closed in 1992, operations at Compton are being rapidly wound down with the site due to close in 2015.

The [[Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research]] was sited at Compton until October 2005.

Significant investment (over £170 million) is taking place at Pirbright with the development of new world class laboratory and animal facilities. The Institute has been known as "The Pirbright Institute" since October 2012.

==Directors of note==

*Dr [[John Burns Brooksby]] 1964 until 1980&lt;ref&gt;http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiogmem/53/77.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The work previously carried out at Compton has either moved out to the university sector, ended or has been transferred to the Pirbright Site. The Compton site currently carries out work on [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] (commonplace) animal diseases including some Avian Viruses and a small amount of Bovine Immunology whilst Pirbright works on exotic (unusual) [[animal diseases]] (usually caused by virus outbreaks). Pirbright has National and International Reference Laboratories of diseases.

===Funding===
25% of its income comes from a core grant from the BBSRC of around £11m.  Around 50% comes from research grants from related government organisations, such as DEFRA, or industry and charities (such as the [[Wellcome Trust]]). The remaining 25% comes from direct payments for work carried out.

==Function==
The Pirbright Institute carries out research, diagnostics and surveillance [[Animal virology|viruses]] carried by animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), African swine fever, bluetongue, lumpy skin disease and avian and swine flu  [[Livestock|farm animal]]s.  Understanding of viruses comes from [[molecular biology]].

It carries out surveillance activities on farm animal health and disease movement in the UK.

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki
 |accessdate=2018-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/classics/resources/poetics/poettran.htm
 |title=Aristotle's Poetics, adapted from the translation by S.H. Butcher
 |accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

{{this|Political Communications Principles|the academic journal|Political Communication (journal)}}

'''Political communication(s)''' is a subfield of [[communication]] and [[political science]] that is concerned with how [[information flow|information spread]]s and [[social influence|influences]] [[politics]] and [[policy maker]]s, the [[news media]] and [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Political%20Communications%20encyclopedia2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], the amount of data to analyze has exploded, and researchers are shifting to computational methods to study the dynamics of political communication. In recent years, [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and [[Social network analysis|network analysis]] have become key tools in the subfield. It deals with the production, dissemination, procession and effects of information, both through [[mass media]] and [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonally]], within a political context. This includes the study of the media, the analysis of [[political speech|speeches by politicians]] and those that are trying to influence the [[political process]], and formal and informal conversations among members of the public, among other aspects. The media acts as bridge between government and public. Political communication can be defined as the connection concerning politics and citizens and the interaction modes that connect these groups to each other. Whether the relationship is formed by the modes of persuasion, Pathos, Ethos or Logos. 

== Defining the concept ==

The study and practice of political communication focuses on the ways and means of expression of a political nature. Robert E. Denton and Gary C. Woodward, two important contributors to the field, in  ''Political Communication in America'' characterize it as the ways and intentions of message senders to influence the political environment. This includes public discussion (e.g. political speeches, news media coverage, and ordinary citizens' talk) that considers who has authority to sanction, the allocation of public resources, who has authority to make decision, as well as social meaning like what makes someone American. In their words "the crucial factor that makes communication 'political' is not the source of a message, but its content and purpose." &lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denton R.E., Woodward G.C.|title=Political Communication in America|publisher=New York: Praeger|year=1998|pages=11|isbn=978-0275957834}}&lt;/ref&gt; David L. Swanson and Dan Nimmo, also key members of this sub-discipline, define political communication as "the strategic use of communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs, and action on political matters." &lt;ref name="b"&gt;Swanson, D. &amp; Nimmo D. "New Directions in Political Communication: A Resource Book." Thousand Oaks: Sage, 1990, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize the strategic nature of political communication, highlighting the role of [[persuasion]] in [[political discourse]]. Brian McNair provides a similar definition when he writes that political communication is "purposeful communication about politics." For McNair this means that this not only covers [[Words|verbal]] or [[written]] statements, but also [[visual]] representations such as dress, make-up, hairstyle or logo design. With other words, it also includes all those aspects that develop a "political identity" or "image".&lt;ref name="c"&gt;McNair B. ''An Introduction to Political Communication'', London: Routledge, 2003, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on the relationship between political communication and contemporary agenda-building, Vian Bakir defines Strategic Political Communication (SPC) as comprising 'political communication that is [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] in intent, that utilises [[social science|social scientific]] techniques and heuristic devices to understand human [[motivation]], [[human behavior]] and the media environment, to inform effectively what should be communicated – encompassing its detail and overall direction – and what should be withheld, with the aim of taking into account and influencing [[public opinion]], and creating [[strategic alliance]]s and an enabling environment for government policies – both at home and abroad'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bakir, V.|title=Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles|publisher=Farnham: Ashgate|year=2013|pages=3|isbn=9781472402554}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are many academic departments and schools around the world that specialize in political communication. These programs are housed in programs of communication, [[political journalism|journalism]] and [[political science]], among others. The study of political communication is clearly [[interdisciplinary]].

== Contemporary examples of strategic political communication ==
The ''[[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]’s torture-for-intelligence policy'', initiated soon after [[9/11]], was kept secret for several years, as remains the level of complicity of many other nation-states' governments. While this secret policy was gradually revealed from 2004 onwards, initiated by the [[Abu Ghraib]] torture photos, the Bush administration engaged in SPC to publicly reframe and protect its secret policy. SPC included ''[[silencing]]'' and ''persuasive'' discursive activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse|Discursive]] activity aimed at generating ''silences'' comprised [[plea bargain]]s that silenced detainees, censoring Guantánamo detainees’ descriptions of their own torture in pre–trial hearings, deals with journalists to censor or withhold information that affected national security, weeding out personal sousveillance of torture online, suppression of visual [[sousveillance]] of torture while [[courts–martial]] and criminal investigations proceeded; destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogations; and withholding key information from intelligence oversight committees. These position those in the know as part of an elite force policing the public sphere to keep the wider public and their representatives ignorant of unpalatable but necessary official practices, relegating the likely emotional and/or moral public dissent towards such practices as unaffordable niceties. 
* ''[[Persuasive]]'' [[discourse|discursive]] activity included the propagation and repetition of a few key messages consistently over time, with the aim of misdirecting [[public attention]] from the silence–generating activities. Key Bush Administration messages were that detainees were evil, dangerous [[war on terror|terrorists]]; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. Key British Administration messages were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. Key messages common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair Administrations). These key messages were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including [[press conference]]s and media interviews, authorised [[News leak|leak]]s, real–time reporting, official investigations and [[public inquiries]]) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once–secret documents. The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth–telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of key messages and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full [[accountability]] is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that [[justice]] has been served, all–the–while being constant targets of manipulation.

==Fields and areas of study==

The field of political communication is focused on 4 main areas:

* [[Election campaigns]] - Political communications involved in campaigning for elections.
* [[Government operations]] - This role is usually fulfilled by a [[Ministry of Communications]], [[Information Technology]] or similar political entity. Such an entity is in charge of maintaining communication legislation and would be responsible for setting [[telecommunications]] policy and regulations as well as issuing broadcasting licenses, comments [[press releases]], etc...
*[[Content (media)|Media content]] - The interaction between politics, media content and the public.
*[[Communication|Communication processes]] - How people communication about about politics.

According to [[James Chesebro]], there are five critical approaches to contemporary Political communications:
# [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] - i.e. power relationships
# [[Symbol|Iconic]] - symbols are important
# [[Ritual]]istic - Redundant and superficial nature of political acts - manipulation of symbols.
# [[Leadership|Confirmation]] - political aspects looked at as people we endorse
# [[Narrative|Dramatistic]] - politics is symbolically constructed. (Kenneth Burke)

==Role of social media==
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run. With more [[digital native]] citizens coming into the [[voting]] population, social media is the platform on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the voters. In a [[digital age]], social media will be more important than traditional media to the politicians.

Taking Australia as an example below: 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU&lt;/ref&gt; around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media. (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With almost half of Australian voting population active on social media, political parties are adapting quickly to influence and connect with their voters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesocialsavior.com/benefits-of-social-media-for-business/&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media experience relies heavily on the user themselves due to the platforms' algorithms which tailor consumer experience for each user. This results in each person seeing more like-minded news due to the increase in digital social behavior. Additionally, social media has changed politics because it has given politicians a direct medium to give their constituents information and the people to speak directly to the politicians. This informal nature can lead to informational mistakes because it is not being subjected to the same "[[Fact checking|fact-checking]] processes as institutional journalism." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=d2NCDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=political+communication+in+media+society&amp;ots=ofCknFEU1v&amp;sig=UHjO4A3LY9_GEVss0uKJvsJgeJM#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20communication%20in%20media%20society&amp;f=false|title=Mass Media and American Politics|last=Graber|first=Doris A.|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|date=2017-07-20|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781506340227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media creates greater opportunity for political persuasion due to the high number of citizens that regularly engage and build followings on social media. The more that a person engages on social media, the more influential they believe themselves to be, resulting in more people considering themselves to be politically persuasive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Brian E.|last2=Ardèvol-Abreu|first2=Alberto|last3=Gil de Zúñiga|first3=Homero|date=2015-12-31|title=Online Influence?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="744">'''Pulsatile secretion''' is a [[biochemistry|biochemical]] phenomenon in which a [[chemical]], such as a [[hormone]], is [[secretion|secreted]] in a burst-like or episodic manner rather than constantly. Examples of hormones that are secreted pulsatilely include [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) and [[growth hormone]] (GH). Pulsatile secretion can be critical to hormone function, as evidenced by the case of [[GnRH agonist]]s, which cause functional inhibition of the receptor for GnRH due to profound [[downregulation]] in response to constant stimulation.

'''Pyrolysis''' is the [[thermal]] [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/P/P04961.html |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology |accessdate=2018-01-10 |year=2009 |page=1824 |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the change of [[chemical composition]] and is irreversible. The word is coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived [[morpheme|element]]s ''pyro'' "fire" and ''[[lysis]]'' "separating".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used to the treatment of [[organic compound|organic]] materials. It is one of the processes involved in [[charring]] wood.&lt;ref name=inno&gt;[http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html ''Burning of wood''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209095142/http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html |date=2010-02-09 }}, InnoFireWood's website. Accessed on 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in carbon, [[char]]. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly [[carbon]] as the residue, is called [[carbonization]].

The process is used heavily in the [[chemical industry]], for example, to produce [[ethylene]], many forms of [[carbon]], and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, to produce [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]].  Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert [[biomass]] into [[syngas]] and [[biochar]],  waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

==Process terminology and mechanism==
Special cases of pyrolysis include [[dry distillation]], [[destructive distillation]], [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], and [[thermal depolymerization]].  It generally involves the breaking of chemical bonds in molecules to give smaller molecules; but may also leave residues with larger molecular mass.  The phenomenon involves exceeding the [[decomposition temperature]] of the material.

Pyrolysis differs from other processes like [[combustion]] and [[hydrolysis]] in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).&lt;ref&gt;Cory A. Kramer, Reza Loloee, Indrek S. Wichman and Ruby N. Ghosh, 2009, [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 Time Resolved Measurements of Pyrolysis Products From Thermoplastic Poly-Methyl-Methacrylate (PMMA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106220719/http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 |date=2014-11-06 }} ''ASME 2009 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition''&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, it is often not practical to achieve completely O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- or water-free conditions, especially as pyrolysis is often conducted on complex mixtures.  The term has also been applied to the decomposition of organic material in the presence of [[superheated water]] or steam ([[hydrous pyrolysis]]), for example, in the [[Cracking (chemistry)|steam cracking]] of oil. Pyrolysis has been assumed to take place during [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]], the conversion of [[kerogen|buried organic matter]] to [[fossil fuels]]. 

Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a [[vacuum]] to decrease the [[boiling point]] of the byproducts and avoid adverse chemical reactions. An example is the process of [[flash vacuum pyrolysis]] used in [[organic synthesis]].

Volatile pyrolysis byproducts can be [[Chemical analysis|analyzed]] through separation by [[gas chromatography]] and identification by [[mass spectrometry]], a process known as [[pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry|Py-GC-MS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Goodacre, R.; Kell, D. B.|title=Pyrolysis mass spectrometry and its applications in biotechnology|journal=Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.|year=1996|volume=7||pages= 20-28|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(96)80090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Peacock, P. M.; McEwen, C.

== Occurrence and uses ==
===Ethylene===
Pyrolysis is used to produce [[ethylene]], the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (&gt;110 million tons/year in 2005).  In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around 600 °C in the presence of steam, i.e. [[steam cracking]].  The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze ([[ethylene glycol]]), PVC (via [[vinyl chloride]]), and many polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.&lt;ref name=UllmannEthylene&gt;{{cite book |first1=Heinz |last1=Zimmermann |first2=Roland |last2=Walz |chapter=Ethylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars ===
Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures.  Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.

High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert [[coal]] into [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[metallurgy]], especially [[steelmaking]].  Volatile products are often useful, including [[benzene]] and [[pyridine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Ludwig Briesemeister, Andreas Geißler, Stefan Halama, Stephan Herrmann, Ulrich Kleinhans, Markus Steibel, Markus Ulbrich, Alan W. Scaroni, M. Rashid Khan, Semih Eser, Ljubisa R. Radovic|title=Coal Pyrolysis|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim| doi=10.1002/14356007.a07_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.
[[File:CoalPyrolysisProducts.png|thumb|290px|Typical organic products obtained by pyrolysis of coal (X = CH, N).]]
The coke-making or "coking" process consists of heating the material in "coking ovens" to very high temperatures (up to {{convert|900|C|F|disp=or|sigfig=2}}) so that those molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25–30% of it by weight.

The original [[xylem|vascular structure]] of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as [[nutshell]]s or [[peach]] [[endocarp|stone]]s, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called [[activated carbon]], which is used as an [[adsorption|adsorbent]] for a wide range of chemical substances.

[[Biochar]] is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires.  They are a key component of the [[terra preta]] soils associated with ancient [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] communities of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref name="lehmann1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota than the typical red soil of the region.  Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through [[biochar]], the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste.

[[Carbon fiber]]s are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable [[polymer]], and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from {{convert|1500|-|3000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}).  The first carbon fibers were made from [[rayon]], but [[polyacrylonitrile]] has become the most common starting material.  For their first workable [[electric lamp]]s, [[Joseph Wilson Swan]] and [[Thomas Edison]] used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of [[cotton]] yarns and [[bamboo]] splinters, respectively.

Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of [[pyrolytic carbon]]. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to {{convert|1000|-|2000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}. Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including [[artificial heart valve]]s.&lt;ref name="ratner"&gt;Ratner, Buddy D. (2004). Pyrolytic carbon.

Retrieved on 2009-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Crops studied as biomass feedstock for pyrolysis include native North American prairie grasses such as [[Panicum virgatum|''switchgrass'']] and bred versions of other grasses such as [[Miscanthus giganteus|''Miscantheus giganteus'']]. Other sources of [[organic matter]] as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge and distillers grain.&lt;ref name=bestEnergiesBestPyrol&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher efficiency is sometimes achieved by '''flash pyrolysis''', in which finely divided feedstock is quickly heated to between {{convert|350|and|500|°C|F|sigfig=2}} for less than two seconds. 

The low quality of oils produced through pyrolysis can be improved by physical and chemical processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|pages=6765–6794|doi=10.3390/en8076765}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might drive up production costs, but may make sense economically as circumstances change. 

There is also the possibility of integrating with other processes such as [[mechanical biological treatment]] and [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A. T. &amp; Morris, J. M.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by [[hydrous pyrolysis]].

=== Semiconductors ===
The process of [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials.  The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Silicon chips are produced by the pyrolysis of silane:
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Si  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Gallium arsenide]], another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of [[trimethylgallium]] and [[arsine]].

=== Recycling===
{{See also|Thermal Depolymerisation}}
Pyrolysis can also be used to treat plastic waste.  The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste.  In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Walter |last1=Kaminsky |title=Plastics, Recycling |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2000 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.J.

==Fine chemical synthesis==
Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory.  

The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) at ca. 200 °C.  Products include the clusters  [[pentaborane]] and [[decaborane]].  These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but also re[[condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} gives Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

==History==
Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into [[charcoal]] since ancient times. Many important chemical substances, such as [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfuric acid]], were first obtained by this process. In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood.  The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authors=E. Fiedler, G. Grossmann, D. B. Kersebohm, G.

'''Round-trip engineering''' ('''RTE''') is a functionality of [[software development tools]] that synchronizes two or more related software artifacts, such as, source code, models, configuration files, and even documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gentle|first1=Anne|title=Conversation and Community: The Social Web for Documentation|date=2012|publisher=XML Press|isbn=978-1937434106|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for round-trip engineering arises when the same information is present in multiple artifacts and therefore an inconsistency may occur if not all artifacts are consistently updated to reflect a given change. For example, some piece of information was added to/changed in only one artifact and, as a result, it became missing in/inconsistent with the other artifacts.

Round-trip engineering is closely related to traditional [[software engineering]] disciplines: forward engineering (creating software from specifications), [[reverse engineering]] (creating specifications from existing software), and [[Reengineering (software)|reengineering]] (understanding existing software and modifying it). Round-trip engineering is often wrongly defined as simply supporting both forward and reverse engineering. In fact, the key characteristic of round-trip engineering that distinguishes it from forward and reverse engineering is the ability to synchronize ''existing'' artifacts that evolved ''concurrently'' by ''incrementally'' updating each artifact to reflect changes made to the other artifacts. Furthermore, forward engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the specification is present and reverse engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the software is present. Many reengineering activities can also be understood as RTE when the software is updated to reflect changes made to the previously reverse engineered specification.

Another characteristic of round-trip engineering is ''automatic'' update of the artifacts in response to ''automatically'' detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of the artifacts). The automatic update can be either ''instantaneous'' or ''on-demand''. In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of the artifacts may concurrently evolve the artifacts (even in a distributed setting) and at some point choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.

Round trip engineering supports an iterative development process. After you have synchronized your model with revised code, you are still free to choose the best way to work – make further modifications to the code or make changes to your model. You can synchronize in either direction at any time and you can repeat the cycle as many times as necessary.

==Examples of round-trip engineering==
Perhaps the most common form of round-trip engineering is synchronization between UML ([[Unified Modeling Language]]) models and the corresponding source code. Many commercial tools and research prototypes support this form of RTE; a 2007 book lists [[Rational Rose]], [[Borland Together]], [[ESS-Model]], [[BlueJ]], and [[Fujaba]] among those capable, with Fujaba said to be capable to also identify [[design pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Diehl2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Diehl|title=Software Visualization: Visualizing the Structure, Behaviour, and Evolution of Software|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-46505-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, UML class diagrams are supported to some degree; however, certain UML concepts, such as ''associations'' and ''containment'' do not have straightforward representations in many programming languages which limits the usability of the created code and accuracy of code analysis (e.g., containment is hard to recognize in the code). A 2005 book on [[Visual Studio]] notes for instance that a common problem in RTE tools is that the model reversed is not the same as the original one, unless the tools are helped by laborious annotations.&lt;ref name="FilevLoton2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Filev|author2=Tony Loton|author3=Kevin McNeish |author4=Ben Schoellmann |author5=John Slater |author6=Chaur G. Wu|title=Professional UML Using Visual Studio .Net|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-7645-5875-7|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral parts of UML impose even more challenges for RTE.

A more tractable form of round-trip engineering is implemented in the context of framework [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), whereby a model describing the usage of a framework API by an application is synchronized with that application's code. In this setting, the API ''prescribes'' all correct ways the framework can be used in applications, which allows precise and complete detection of API usages in the code as well as creation of useful code implementing correct API usages. Two prominent RTE implementations in this category are [[framework-specific modeling language]]s and [[Spring Roo]].

Round-trip engineering is critical for maintaining consistency among multiple models and between the models and the code in [[Object Management Group]]'s (OMG) [[Model-driven architecture]]. OMG proposed the [[QVT]] (query/view/transformation) standard to handle model transformations required for MDA. To date, a few implementations of the standard have been created. (Need to present practical experiences with MDA in relation to RTE).

==Examples in software engineering==
Round-trip engineering based on [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) needs three basic compoments for software development:{{fact|date=January 2018}}

* Source Code Editor;
* UML Editor for the Attributes and Methods;
* Visualisation of UML structure.

An example of basic round-trip engineering is accessible as a web-based Open Source tool is:{{fact|date=January 2018}}

* ''JavaScript Class Creator''&lt;ref&gt;[https://niebert.github.io/JavascriptClassCreator/ JavaScript Class Creator], [[GitHub]].&lt;/ref&gt; allows integrated round-trip engineering for JavaScript Classes. [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] Diagrams are generated with a diagram library JointJS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/clientIO/joint JointJS], [[GitHub]].&lt;/ref&gt; Editing of Javascript Source Code is realized with the editor ACE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ace.c9.io ACE].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2828">The '''secondary cell wall''' is a structure found in many [[plant cell]]s, located between the [[primary cell wall]] and the [[plasma membrane]]. The cell starts producing the secondary cell wall after the primary cell wall is complete and the cell has stopped expanding.&lt;ref name=BMBoP&gt;Buchanan, Gruissem, Jones, ''Biochemistry &amp; molecular biology of plants'', 1st edition, American Society of Plant Physiology, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary cell walls provide additional protection to cells and rigidity and strength to the larger plant.  These walls are constructed of layered sheaths of cellulose microfibrils, wherein the fibers are in parallel within each layer.  The inclusion of [[lignin]] makes the secondary cell wall less flexible and less permeable to water than the primary cell wall.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;Raven, P. H., R. F. Evert, et al. (1999). Biology of plants. New York, W.H. Freeman : Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to making the walls more resistant to degradation, the hydrophobic nature of lignin within these tissues is essential for containing water within the vascular tissues that carry it throughout the plant.

The secondary cell wall consists primarily of [[cellulose]], along with other [[polysaccharides]], [[lignin]], and [[glycoprotein]]. It sometimes consists of three distinct layers - S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - where the direction of the [[cellulose|cellulose microfibrils]] differs between the layers.&lt;ref name="BMBoP"/&gt;

[[File:Plant cell showing primary and secondary wall by CarolineDahl.jpg|thumb|Plant cell overview, showing secondary cell wall.]]

The secondary cell wall has different ratios of constituents compared to the [[primary wall]]. An example of this is that secondary wall in wood contain polysaccharides called [[xylan]], whereas the primary wall contains the polysaccharide [[xyloglucan]].  
The cellulose fraction in secondary walls is also higher.&lt;ref name=Taiz&gt;Taiz, L. and E. Zeiger (2006). Plant physiology. Sunderland, Mass., Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pectin]]s may also be absent from the secondary wall, and unlike primary walls, no  [[Protein#Structural_proteins|structural proteins]] or [[enzymes]] have been identified.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;  Because of the low permeability through the secondary cell wall, cellular transport is carried out through openings in the wall called [[pit (botany)|pits]].

[[Wood]] consists mostly of secondary cell wall, and holds the plant up against gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece, ''Biology'', 7th edition, Pearson/Benjamin Cummings, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some secondary cell walls store nutrients, such as those in the [[cotyledon]]s and the [[endosperm]]. These contain little cellulose, and mostly other [[polysaccharides]].&lt;ref name="BMBoP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3242">The '''Sono arsenic filter''' was invented in 2006 by [[Abul Hussam]], who is a chemistry professor at [[George Mason University]] (GMU) in [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Virginia]]. It was developed to deal with the problem of [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]].&lt;ref name="HussamMunir2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hussam|first1=Abul|last2=Munir|first2=Abul K. M.|title=A simple and effective arsenic filter based on composite iron matrix: Development and deployment studies for groundwater of Bangladesh|journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part A|volume=42|issue=12|year=2007|pages=1869–1878|doi=10.1080/10934520701567122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[water filter|filter]] is now in use in Hussam's native [[Bangladesh]].

==Development==
Farmers had been drinking fresh [[groundwater]] from wells, whereas previously they had had to use ponds and mudholes which were contaminated with bacteria and viruses. However, the wells were also contaminated with naturally occurring high concentrations of poisonous [[arsenic]], causing skin ailments and cancers. Awareness of the problem developed through the 1990s.

Allan Smith, an [[epidemiologist]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], observed that the arsenic problem affects millions of people worldwide:
{{quote|You can't see it or taste or smell it. The idea that crystal-clear drinking water would end up causing lung disease in 20 or 30 years is a little weird. It's unbelievable to people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}}}

Hussam developed his filter after years of testing hundreds of prototypes. The final version contains 20 pounds of shards of porous [[iron]], which bonds chemically with arsenic. It also includes charcoal, sand and bits of brick. It filters nearly all of the arsenic from the well water.

==Awards==
Hussam was awarded the 2007 [[Grainger challenge]] Prize for [[Sustainability]] by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name=nationalacademies&gt;[[National Academies]] [http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02012007 Press Release], accessed 5 Feb 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hussam plans to use 70% of the $1 million engineering prize to distribute filters to needy communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.com/sci.html?id=833&amp;ref=rss Professor wins $1 million for arsenic filter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206142405/http://www.enn.com/sci.html?id=833 |date=2007-02-06 }}, Associated Press, 2/3/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Indian scholar and musical theorist [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), in his ''Chanda Sutra'', used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.

In the notation of Indian [[rāga]], a solfege-like system called [[swara|sargam]] is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadja, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] fifth rather than an [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes'). Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-"flat") (thus, komal Re is a half-step higher than Sa). Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (teevra-"sharp") (thus, tivra Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, ma, Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the achala swar, and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar. Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar.

A tactical decision game is a [[decision game]] that puts students in the role of the commander of a tactical unit who is faced with a challenging problem.  While most tactical decision games depict problems faced by the commanders of military units, &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The tactical decision game is known by a variety of names.  These include ''map problem'', ''tactical problem'', ''one-step [[Military simulation|war game]]'', and ''tactical decision exercise''.

Like other types of decision games, tactical decision games may either be historical or fictional.  If the scenario is based entirely upon a reliable historical narrative, a tactical decision game is also a ''decision-forcing case''.  (Such an exercise may also be called an ''historical map problem''.)  However, if any of the elements in the scenario of a tactical decision game is fictional, then the exercise is a kind of ''fictional decision game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Tactical Decision Games Before 1800==

In Chapter 14 of ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] tells the story of the Greek general [[Philopoemon]], who made extensive use of tactical decision games.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Philopoemon, Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: “If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to re-treat, how ought we to set about it? If they should retreat, how ought we to pursue?” And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could deal with.”

==Tactical Decision Games in Prussia and Germany==

[[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], who served as chief of the [[Prussian General Staff]] from 1857 to 1888, made extensive use of tactical decision games to train his subordinates and inform contingency planning.  Called "tactical assignments" (''taktische Aufgaben''), these problems employed fictional scenarios in which ideal units were employed on actual terrain.  Some of these games were gathered into a book, ''Moltkes taktische Aufgaben aus den Jahren 1858 bis 1882'', which was published in 1892 as the second volume of a multi-volume set of Moltke's collected works.  Two years later, an English translation of this book came out under the title ''Moltke's Tactical Problems from 1858 to 1882''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sharp contrast to Moltke's tactical decision games, which had no direct connection to actual engagements, those published by [[Julius von Verdy du Vernois]] often made explicit use of real-world events.  The problems contained in the first volume of Verdy's ''Kriegsgeschichtliche Studien nach der applikatorischen Methode'' (''Military Historical Studies by means of the Applicatory Method'') were all based on incidents of the battle that took place between Austrian and Italian forces on 24 June 1866. However, in an attempt to make the games more useful to German officers, he replaced the actual (Austrian and Italian) formations engaged in the battle with an imaginary German infantry division, thereby converting what would have been decision-forcing cases into fictional decision games.  (Originally published in 1876, this work was later translated into English as ''A Tactical Study Based on the Battle of [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custozza]]''.)

In his earlier (and more famous) work, the four volume ''Studien über Truppen-Führung''), Verdy also used historical events as the starting point for his games.  However, in addition to fictionalizing orders of battle, he also changed the outcomes of particular engagements.  (The word [[Truppenführung | ''Truppen-Führung'']], which is often translated as "troop leading" or "the leading of troops",  refers to the art of handling of combined arms formations:  infantry divisions, cavalry divisions, and army corps.)

==Tactical Decision Games in the United States Armed Forces==

In 1975, the Simulation Center of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States) | 9th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] published a training package for junior leaders called ''What Now, Lieutenant?''.  Designed to be used in conjunction with a war game of the same name, this package consisted of scenarios that described situations faced by the commanders of battalions, companies, and platoons.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| year=1975 
| title=What Now, Lieutenant?
| publisher=9th Infantry Division, Fort Lewis, Washington   
| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, the [[United States Marine Corps Training and Education Command |Education Center]] of the United States [[Marine Corps Combat Development Command|Marine Corps Development and Education Command]] used this package as the starting point for a series of three "instructional pamphlets": ''Tactical Problems for Battalion Commanders'', ''Tactical Problems for Platoon Leaders/Company Commanders'', and ''Tactical Problems for Squad Leaders''.  In addition to twelve problems taken from ''What Now, Lieutenant?'', the ''Tactical Problems ...'' series contained sixteen games that were written expressly for the series by Chief Warrant Officer Bryan N. Lavender, USMC.

Like the scenarios in ''What Now, Lieutenant?'', the games in the ''Tactical Problems ...'' series were based them on descriptions of actual engagements that took place between 1914 and 1953.  Some of these were first-hand accounts written by [[S.L.A. Marshall]], [[Erwin Rommel]],and [[Friedrich von Mellenthin]].  Others were secondary works composed by military historians.) Regardless of the actual events that inspired them, all of the problems were modified to reflect the organization and equipment of the 1980s.  Thus, none of these historically-inspired games can be classified as [[case method | decision-forcing cases]].)

'''''The Road to Oxiana''''' is a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] by [[Robert Byron]], first published in 1937. It is considered by many modern travel writers to be the first example of great travel writing. The word "[[Oxiana]]" in the title refers to the region along [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan's]] northern border.

The book is an account of Byron's ten-month journey to the [[Middle East]] in 1933–34, initially in the company of [[Christopher Sykes (author)|Christopher Sykes]]. It is in the form of a diary with the first entry "[[Venice]], 20 August 1933" after which Byron travelled by ship to the island of [[Cyprus]] and then on to the then countries of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Persia]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The journey ended in [[Peshawar]], India (now part of [[Pakistan]]) on 19 June 1934, from where he returned to England.

The primary purpose of the journey was to visit the region's [[Architecture|architectural]] treasures of which Byron had an extensive knowledge, as evidenced by his observations along the way. For example, he says of the [[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque|Mosque of Sheikh Lutfullah]], now listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]:

{{cquote|''I have never encountered splendour of this kind before. Other interiors came into my mind as I stood there, to compare it with: Versailles, or the porcelain rooms at Schönbrunn, or the Doge's Palace, or St Peter's. All are rich; but none so rich. Their richness is three-dimensional; it is attended by all the effort of shadow: In the Mosque of Sheikh Lutfullah, it is a richness of light and surface, of pattern and colour only. The architectural form is unimportant. It is not smothered, as in rococo; it is simply the instrument of a spectacle, as earth is the instrument of a garden. And then I suddenly thought of that unfortunate species, modern interior decorators, who imagine they can make a restaurant, or a cinema, or a plutocrat's drawing-room look rich if given money enough for gold leaf and looking-glass. They little know what amateurs they are. Nor, alas, do their clients.''&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Robert; ''The Road to Oxiana'', Pimlico Edition, 2004; p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Byron interacted with the locals and negotiated transport, including motor vehicles, horses and asses to carry him on his journey. He encountered heat, cold, hunger and thirst and suffered the inconvenience of bugs, [[flea]]s, [[lice]] and physical illness.

Writer [[Paul Fussell]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;Fussell, Paul, ''Abroad: British Literary Traveling Between The Wars'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; that ''The Road to Oxiana'' is to the travel book what "''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is to the [[novel]] between the wars, and what ''[[The Waste Land]]'' is to [[poetry]]."

Travel writer [[Bruce Chatwin]] in his introduction to the book has described it as "a sacred text, beyond criticism," &lt;ref&gt;Byron, Robert; ''The Road to Oxiana'', Pimlico Edition, 2004; Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; and carried his copy since he was fifteen years old, "spineless and floodstained" after four journeys through [[central Asia]].

'''The Science Network (TSN)''' is a non-profit virtual forum dedicated to science and its impact on society. Initially conceived in 2003 by [[Roger Bingham]] and [[Terry Sejnowski]] as a cable science network,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/12/61423?currentPage=1 Wired: Are You Ready for Some Science?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/11/candle-in-the-dark/ Michael Shermer.com, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; TSN would soon become a global digital platform. TSN currently offers free access to over 1100 videos&lt;ref name="search" /&gt; of lectures from scientific meetings and long form one-on-one conversations with prominent scientists and communicators of science, including [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[V.S. Ramachandran]], [[Helen S. Mayberg]], and [[Barbara Landau]], on topics including education, aging, neuroscience, and stem cells.&lt;ref name="search"&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/search?q=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 TSN Search]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its mission, TSN has also sponsored and co-sponsored scientific forums, such as the landmark Symposium and Town Hall meeting, ''Stem cells: science, ethics and politics at the crossroads'', held at the Salk Institute in 2004 &lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/stem-cells-science-ethics-and-politics-at-the-crossroads Stem Cells: Science, Ethics and Politics at the Crossroads]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salk.edu/insidesalk/pdf/InsideSalkNov04.pdf Inside Salk 11 04]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Beyond Belief'' conference series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programgroup/beyond-belief ''Beyond Belief'' conference series]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Beyond Belief'' Conference Series==

TSN's signature series ''Beyond Belief'' was conceived to bring together a community of scientists, philosophers, scholars from the humanities, and social commentators. Speakers at these meetings have included [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Harry Kroto]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], and [[Stuart Kauffman]]. So far, the following three ''Beyond Belief'' conferences were organized:

===2006: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival===
''[[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]]'',  the first of The Science Network's annual Beyond Belief symposia, held from November 5 to November 7, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival ''Beyond Belief: Science, Reason, Religion &amp; Survival'']&lt;/ref&gt; was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "a free-for-all on science and religion," which seemed at times like "the founding convention for a political party built on a single plank: in a world dangerously charged with ideology, science needs to take on an evangelical role, vying with religion as teller of the greatest story ever told." According to participant [[Melvin Konner]], however, the event came to resemble a "den of vipers” debating the issue, "Should we bash religion with a crowbar or only with a baseball bat?”&lt;ref name = "nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/science/21belief.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/T/Tyson,%20Neil%20DeGrasse&amp;_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all ''A Free-for-All on Science and Religion," George Johnson, New York Times, Section F, Page 1, November 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Scientist]] summed up the topics to be discussed as a list of three questions:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225780.142-beyond-belief-in-place-of-god.html Michael Brooks and Helen Phillips, New Scientist, November 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Can [[science]] help us create a new rational narrative as poetic and powerful as those that have traditionally sustained societies?
* Can we treat [[religion]] as a natural phenomenon?
* Can we be good without [[God]]? And if not God, then what?

Speakers included physicists [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], biologist [[Joan Roughgarden]], and astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]].&lt;ref name = "nyt"/&gt;

===2007: Enlightenment 2.0===
''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'' was the second annual symposium and was held from 31 October to 2 November 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-enlightenment-2-0 ''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'']&lt;/ref&gt;  at the Frederic de Hoffmann Auditorium of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

===2008: Candles in the Dark===
''Beyond Belief: Candles in the Dark'' was the third annual Beyond Belief symposium. This event was organized by The Science Network and held from 3 October to 6 October 2008 in La Jolla, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-candles-in-the-dark|title=2008 Official Website|work=The Science Network|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowler]] have used the same phrase as a label for the period within the [[history of evolutionary thought]] from the 1880s to around 1920, when alternatives to [[natural selection]] were developed and explored—as many biologists considered natural selection to have been a wrong guess on [[Charles Darwin]]'s part, or at least as of relatively minor importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|pp=216–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative term, '''the interphase of Darwinism''', has been proposed to avoid the largely incorrect implication that the putative eclipse was preceded by a period of vigorous Darwinian research.&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt;

While there had been [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|multiple explanations of evolution]] including [[vitalism]], [[catastrophism]], and [[structuralism]] through the 19th century, four major alternatives to natural selection were in play at the turn of the 20th century:

* Theistic evolution was the belief that God directly guided evolution.{{efn|This should not be confused with a more recent use of the term [[theistic evolution]], which refers to a theological belief in the compatibility of science and religion.}}
* [[Neo-Lamarckism]] was the idea that evolution was driven by the inheritance of characteristics acquired during the life of the organism.
* [[Orthogenesis]] was the belief that organisms were affected by internal forces or laws of development that drove evolution in particular directions
* [[Mutationism]] was the idea that evolution was largely the product of mutations that created new forms or species in a single step.

Theistic evolution largely disappeared from the scientific literature by the end of the 19th century as direct appeals to supernatural causes came to be seen as unscientific. The other alternatives had significant followings well into the 20th century; mainstream biology largely abandoned them only when developments in [[genetics]] made them seem increasingly untenable, and when the development of [[population genetics]] and the modern synthesis demonstrated the explanatory power of [[natural selection]]. [[Ernst Mayr]] wrote that as late as 1930 most textbooks still emphasized such non-Darwinian mechanisms.&lt;ref name="MayrX"&gt;{{Harv|Mayr|Provine|1998|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

Evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles within a few years after the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', but acceptance of [[natural selection]] as its driving mechanism was much less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six objections were raised to the theory in the 19th century:&lt;ref name=Bowler23&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blending Inheritance.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Blending inheritance leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] pointed out, makes evolution by natural selection impossible.]]

# The [[fossil record]] was discontinuous, suggesting gaps in evolution.&lt;ref name=Bowler23/&gt;
# The physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] calculated in 1862 that the [[age of the earth|earth would have cooled]] in 100 million years or less from its formation, too little time for evolution.{{efn|Years later, the discovery of [[radioactivity]] provided for a continual source of heat within the earth, and an age in billions of years, supporting Darwin's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Bowler23/&gt;

Both Darwin and his close supporter [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]{{efn|Huxley was known as "Darwin's Bulldog".}} freely admitted, too, that selection might not be the whole explanation; Darwin was prepared to accept a measure of Lamarckism, while Huxley was comfortable with both [[saltationism|sudden (mutational) change]] and directed (orthogenetic) evolution.&lt;ref name=Bowler28&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, criticism of natural selection had reached the point that in 1903 the German botanist, {{ill |Eberhard Dennert |de}}, wrote that "We are now standing at the death bed of Darwinism", and in 1907 the [[Stanford University]] entomologist [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg]], who supported natural selection, asserted that "... the fair truth is that the Darwinian selection theory, considered with regard to its claimed capacity to be an independently sufficient mechanical explanation of descent, stands today seriously discredited in the biological world." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Endersby|2007|pp=143,453}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, however, that there were problems preventing the widespread acceptance of any of the alternatives, as large mutations seemed too uncommon, and there was no experimental evidence of mechanisms that could support either Lamarckism or orthogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst Mayr wrote that a survey of evolutionary literature and biology textbooks showed that as late as 1930 the belief that natural selection was the most important factor in evolution was a minority viewpoint, with only a few population geneticists being strict selectionists.&lt;ref name="MayrX"/&gt;

===Motivation for alternatives===
{{further |Alternatives to evolution by natural selection}}

[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|[[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection]] included directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), sometimes invoking divine control directly or indirectly.]]

A variety of different factors motivated people to propose other evolutionary mechanisms as [[alternatives to natural selection]], some of them dating back before Darwin's ''Origin of Species''. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it was immoral, and left little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these scientists and philosophers, like [[St. George Jackson Mivart]] and [[Charles Lyell]], who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|pp=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Herbert Spencer]], the botanist [[George Henslow]] (son of Darwin's mentor [[John Stevens Henslow]] also a botanist), and [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, [[Orthogenesis|followed orderly patterns]] that natural selection could not explain.&lt;ref name="Bowler196-250"/&gt;

Another factor was the rise of a new faction of biologists at the end of the 19th century, typified by the geneticists [[Hugo DeVries]] and [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], who wanted to recast biology as an experimental laboratory science. They distrusted the work of naturalists like Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], dependent on field observations of variation, adaptation, and [[biogeography]], considering these overly anecdotal. Instead they focused on topics like [[physiology]], and [[genetics]] that could be easily investigated with [[controlled experiment]]s in the laboratory, and discounted natural selection and the degree to which organisms were adapted to their environment, which could not easily be tested experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Endersby|2007|pp=143–147,182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Darwinist theories during the eclipse==
===Theistic evolution===
&lt;!--sure we'd like a main article here, but it's NOT [[Theistic evolution]] which is about 20th century beliefs, not 19th century theory--&gt;
[[File:Jean Louis Agassiz 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Agassiz]] (here in 1870, with drawings of [[Radiata]]) believed in a sequence of creations in which humanity was the goal of a divine plan.]]

British science developed in the early 19th century on a basis of [[natural theology]] which saw the [[adaptation]] of fixed species as evidence that they had been specially created to a [[teleological argument|purposeful divine design]]. The philosophical concepts of [[German idealism]] inspired concepts of an ordered plan of harmonious creation, which [[Richard Owen]] reconciled with natural theology as a pattern of [[Homology (biology)|homology]] showing evidence of design. Similarly, [[Louis Agassiz]] saw the [[recapitulation theory]] as symbolising a pattern of the sequence of creations in which humanity was the goal of a divine plan. In 1844 ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'' adapted Agassiz's concept into theistic evolutionism. Its anonymous author [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] proposed a "law" of divinely ordered progressive development, with [[transmutation of species]] as an extension of recapitulation theory. This popularised the idea, but it was strongly condemned by the scientific establishment. Agassiz remained forcefully opposed to evolution, and after he moved to America in 1846 his idealist argument from design of orderly development became very influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 Owen cautiously proposed that this development could be a real expression of a continuing creative law, but distanced himself from transmutationists. Two years later in his review of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' Owen attacked Darwin while at the same time openly supporting evolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Secord|2001|pp=424, 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressing belief in a pattern of transmutation by law-like means. This idealist argument from design was taken up by other naturalists such as [[George Jackson Mivart]], and the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] who rejected natural selection altogether in favor of laws of development that guided evolution down preordained paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=46, 49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Darwin's supporters accepted evolution on the basis that it could be reconciled with design. In particular, [[Asa Gray]] considered natural selection to be the main mechanism of evolution and sought to reconcile it with natural theology. He proposed that natural selection could be a mechanism in which the [[problem of evil]] of suffering produced the greater good of adaptation, but conceded that this had difficulties and suggested that God might influence the variations on which natural selection acted to guide evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=203–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Darwin and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] such pervasive supernatural influence was beyond scientific investigation, and [[George Frederick Wright]], an ordained minister who was Gray's colleague in developing theistic evolution, emphasised the need to look for secondary or known causes rather than invoking supernatural explanations: "If we cease to observe this rule there is an end to all science and all sound science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[secular]] version of this [[methodological naturalism]] was welcomed by a younger generation of scientists who sought to investigate natural causes of organic change, and rejected theistic evolution in science. By 1872 Darwinism in its broader sense of the fact of evolution was accepted as a starting point. Around 1890 only a few older men held onto the idea of design in science, and it had completely disappeared from mainstream scientific discussions by 1900. There was still unease about the implications of natural selection, and those seeking a purpose or direction in evolution turned to [[Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] or [[orthogenesis]] as providing natural explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=26–27, 44–45, 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Lamarckism===
{{main|Lamarckism}}
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|left|thumb|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] had originally proposed a theory on the [[transmutation of species]] that was largely based on a progressive drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also believed, as did many others at the time, that characteristics acquired during the course of an organism's life could be inherited by the next generation, and he saw this as a secondary evolutionary mechanism that produced adaptation to the environment. Typically, such characteristics included changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]. It was this mechanism of evolutionary adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that much later came to be known as [[Lamarckism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, [[Charles Darwin]] always included what he called ''Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection'' in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.&lt;ref name=toos&gt;{{Harv|Darwin |1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blind insects in Packard's Mammoth Cave and its Inhabitants 1872.jpg|thumb|[[Alpheus Spring Packard]]'s 1872 book ''Mammoth Cave and its Inhabitants'' used the example of cave beetles (''[[Anophthalmus]]'' and ''[[Ptomaphagus|Adelops]]'') that had become blind to argue for [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]] through inherited disuse of organs.]]

In the late 19th century the term [[neo-Lamarckism]] came to be associated with the position of [[naturalists]] who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], the [[United States|American]] [[paleontologist]]s [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], and the American [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Packard]]. They considered Lamarckism to be more progressive and thus philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of natural selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. The idea of linear progress was an important part of Haeckel's [[recapitulation theory]] of evolution, which held that the [[embryo]]logical development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Cope and Hyatt looked for, and thought they found, patterns of linear progression in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="Bowler236"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson125_129"&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Packard|first1=Alpheus Spring |last2=Putnam|first2=Frederic Ward|authorlink1=Alpheus Spring Packard|title=The Mammoth Cave and its Inhabitants |publisher=Salem Naturalists' Agency |date=1872 |page=12|url=https://archive.org/details/mammothcaveandi01putngoog |oclc=04356215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packard also wrote a book about Lamarck and his writings.&lt;ref name="Bowler236"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quammen217"/&gt;

Many American proponents of neo-Lamarckism were strongly influenced by [[Louis Agassiz]] and a number of them, including Hyatt and Packard, were his students. Agassiz had an idealistic view of nature, connected with [[natural theology]], that emphasized the importance of order and pattern. Agassiz never accepted evolution; his followers did, but they continued his program of searching for orderly patterns in nature, which they considered to be consistent with divine providence, and preferred evolutionary mechanisms like neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis that would be likely to produce them.&lt;ref name="Bowler236"&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=236–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quammen217"&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|pp=217–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the botanist [[George Henslow]], the son of  Darwin's mentor [[John Stevens Henslow]], was an important advocate of neo-Lamarckism. He studied how environmental stress affected the development of plants, and he wrote that the variations induced by such environmental factors could largely explain evolution. The historian of science [[Peter J. Bowler]] writes that, as was typical of many 19th century Lamarckians, Henslow did not appear to understand the need to demonstrate that such environmentally induced variations would be inherited by descendants that developed in the absence of the environmental factors that produced them, but merely assumed that they would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polarising the argument: Weismann's germ plasm====
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory stated that the hereditary material is confined to the [[gonad]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop afresh]] in each generation from the germ plasm, so changes to the body acquired during a lifetime cannot affect the next generation, as [[neo-Lamarckism]] required.]]
{{main|Germ plasm}}

Critics of neo-Lamarckism pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The experimental work of the German biologist [[August Weismann]] resulted in the [[germ plasm]] theory of inheritance. This led him to declare that inheritance of acquired characteristics was impossible, since the [[Weismann barrier]] would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation. This effectively polarised the argument between the Darwinians and the neo-Lamarckians, as it forced people to choose whether to agree or disagree with Weismann and hence with evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|1983|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Weismann's criticism, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Larson125_129"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=253–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baldwin effect====
{{main|Baldwin effect}}

As a consequence of the debate over the viability of neo-Lamarckism, in 1896 [[James Mark Baldwin]], [[Henry Fairfield Osborne]] and [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] all independently proposed a mechanism where new learned behaviors could cause the evolution of new instincts and physical traits through natural selection without resort to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. They proposed that if individuals in a species benefited from learning a particular new behavior, the ability to learn that behavior could be favored by natural selection, and the end result would be the evolution of new instincts and eventually new physical adaptations. This became known as the [[Baldwin effect]] and it has remained a topic of debate and research in evolutionary biology ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=243, 367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthogenesis===
[[File:Titanothere Osborn.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]'s 1918 book ''Origin and Evolution of Life'' claimed the evolution of [[Titanothere]] horns was an example of an [[Orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] trend in evolution.]]
{{main |Orthogenesis}}

Orthogenesis was the theory that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion in a particular direction. The term was popularized by [[Theodor Eimer]], a German [[zoologist]], in his 1898 book ''On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation''. He had studied the coloration of butterflies, and believed he had discovered non-adaptive features which could not be explained by natural selection. Eimer also believed in Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics, but he felt that internal laws of growth determine which characteristics would be acquired and guided the long term direction of evolution down certain paths.&lt;ref name="Quammen221"&gt;{{Harv|Quammen|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthogenesis had a significant following in the 19th century, its proponents including the Russian biologist [[Leo S. Berg]], and the American [[paleontologist]] [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthogenesis was particularly popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed patterns of gradual and constant unidirectional change. Those who accepted this idea, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed). They did believe that orthogenetic trends were non-adaptive; in fact they felt that in some cases they led to developments that were detrimental to the organism, such as the large antlers of the [[Irish elk]] that they believed led to the animal's extinction.&lt;ref name="Quammen221"/&gt;

Support for orthogenesis began to decline during the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1940s, when it became apparent that orthogenesis could not explain the complex branching patterns of evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the [[fossil record]] by paleontologists. A few biologists however hung on to the idea of orthogenesis as late as the 1950s, claiming that the processes of [[macroevolution]], the long term trends in evolution, were distinct from the processes of [[microevolution]].&lt;ref name="Bowler196-250"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson105-129"/&gt;

===Mutationism===
{{Main |Mutationism}}
[[File:Hugo de Vries (1848-1935), by Thérèse Schwartze (1851-1918).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of [[Hugo de Vries]], making a painting of an [[Oenothera|evening primrose]], the plant which had apparently produced new forms by large mutations in his experiments, by [[Thérèse Schwartze]], 1918]]

[[Mutationism]] was the idea that new forms and species arose in a single step as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]] a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1901 mutation theory of evolution held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. Its originator was the Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries. De Vries looked for evidence of mutation extensive enough to produce a new species in a single generation and thought he found it with his work breeding the evening primrose of the genus ''[[Oenothera]]'', which he started in 1886. The plants that de Vries worked with seemed to be constantly producing new varieties with striking variations in form and color, some of which appeared to be new species because plants of the new generation could only be crossed with one another, not with their parents. DeVries himself allowed a role for natural selection in determining which new species would survive, but some geneticists influenced by his work, including Morgan, felt that natural selection was not necessary at all. De Vries's ideas were influential in the first two decades of the 20th century, as some biologists felt that mutation theory could explain the sudden emergence of new forms in the fossil record; research on ''Oenothera'' spread across the world. However, critics including many field naturalists wondered why no other organism seemed to show the same kind of rapid mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Endersby|2007|pp=148–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan was a supporter of de Vries's mutation theory and was hoping to gather evidence in favor of it when he started working with the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' in his lab in 1907. However, it was a researcher in that lab, [[Hermann Joseph Muller]], who determined in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed while breeding ''Oenothera'' were the result of [[polyploid]] hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Endersby|2007|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramsey |first1=Justin |last2=Ramsey |first2=Tara S. |title=Ecological studies of polyploidy in the 100 years following its discovery |journal=Phil.

The work in Morgan's lab with ''Drosophila'' also undermined the concept of orthogenesis by demonstrating the random nature of mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp=269–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the eclipse==
[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], including competition for resources, [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance. This ended the eclipse of Darwinism.]]
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

During the period 1916–1932, the discipline of [[population genetics]] developed largely through the work of the geneticists [[Ronald Fisher]], [[J.B.S. Haldane]], and [[Sewall Wright]]. Their work recognized that the vast majority of [[mutation]]s produced small effects that served to increase the genetic variability of a population rather than creating new species in a single step as the mutationists assumed. They were able to produce statistical models of population genetics that included Darwin's concept of [[natural selection]] as the driving force of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mayr|Provine|1998|pp=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in [[genetics]] persuaded field naturalists such as [[Bernhard Rensch]] and [[Ernst Mayr]] to abandon neo-Lamarckian ideas about evolution in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mayr|Provine|1998| pp=124–127, 296}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1930s, Mayr and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] had synthesized the ideas of population genetics with the knowledge of field naturalists about the amount of genetic diversity in wild populations, and the importance of genetically distinct subpopulations (especially when isolated from one another by geographical barriers) to create the early 20th century [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mayr|Provine|1998|pp=xii–xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 [[George Gaylord Simpson]] integrated [[paleontology]] into the synthesis by statistically analyzing the fossil record to show that it was consistent with the branching non-directional form of evolution predicted by the modern synthesis, and in particular that the linear trends cited by earlier paleontologists in support of Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not stand up to careful analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr wrote that by the end of the synthesis natural selection together with chance mechanisms like [[genetic drift]] had become the universal explanation for evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="MayrX"/&gt;

==Historiography==

The concept of eclipse suggests that Darwinian research paused, implying in turn that there had been a preceding period of vigorously Darwinian activity among biologists. However, historians of science such as Mark Largent have argued that while biologists broadly accepted the extensive evidence for evolution presented in ''The Origin of Species'', there was less enthusiasm for natural selection as a mechanism. Biologists instead looked for alternative explanations more in keeping with their worldviews, which included the beliefs that evolution must be directed and that it constituted a form of progress. Further, the idea of a dark eclipse period was convenient to scientists such as Julian Huxley, who wished to paint the modern synthesis as a bright new achievement, and accordingly to depict the preceding period as dark and confused. Huxley's 1942 book ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]'' therefore, argued Largent, suggested that the so-called modern synthesis began after a long period of eclipse lasting until the 1930s, in which Mendelians, neo-Lamarckians, mutationists, and Weismannians, not to mention experimental embryologists and [[Haeckel]]ian [[Recapitulation theory|recapitulationists]] fought running battles with each other.&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt; The idea of an eclipse also allowed Huxley to step aside from what was to him the inconvenient association of evolution with aspects such as [[social Darwinism]], [[eugenics]], [[imperialism]], and [[militarism]].&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt; Accounts such as [[Michael Ruse]]'s very large&lt;!--Size (600 pages plus) matters here, as Ruse was certainly not trying to save space.--&gt;&lt;ref name=Largent/&gt; book ''Monad to Man''&lt;ref name=Ruse1996&gt;{{Harv|Ruse|1996|}}&lt;/ref&gt; ignored, claimed Largent, almost all the early 20th century American evolutionary biologists. Largent has suggested as an alternative to eclipse a biological metaphor, the interphase of Darwinism, [[interphase]] being an apparently quiet period in the cycle of [[cell division]] and growth.&lt;ref name=Largent&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Largent |title=The So-Called Eclipse of Darwinism |journal=Descended from Darwin: Insights into the History of Evolutionary Studies, 1900–1970 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=2009 |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/cain/projects/descended_from_darwin/pdfs/cain-and-ruse_01-largent.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These commonly used descriptive terms do not necessarily use the official or current names for features; and often these concepts of places don't have clear, rigid boundaries. For example, sometimes the same name may refer to more than one feature, and sometimes people in a locality use more than one name for the same feature. When people refer to geographical regions in a vernacular form they are commonly referred to as imprecise regions. Regions can include large areas of a country such as the American Midwest, the British Midlands, the Swiss Alps, the south east of England and southern California; or smaller areas such as Silicon Valley in northern California. Commonly used descriptions of areas of cities such as a city's downtown district, New York's Upper East Side, London's square mile or the Latin Quarter of Paris can also be viewed as imprecise regions.

==Vernacular region==
Beyond "vernacular geography," a "vernacular region" is a distinctive area where the inhabitants collectively consider themselves interconnected by a shared history, mutual interests, and a common identity. Such regions are "intellectual inventions" and a form of shorthand to identify things, people, and places. Vernacular regions reflect a "sense of place," but rarely coincide with established jurisdictional borders.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"&gt;[Scheetz, George H.] "Whence Siouxland?" ''Book Remarks'' [Sioux City Public Library], May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of vernacular regions in the United States include Tidewater, also known as [[Hampton Roads]], [[Siouxland]], and the [[Tri-Cities, Illinois|Tri-City area]] of Batavia, Geneva, and St. Charles, Illinois. Another can be the American South, since it can be non-officially considered as the confederate states of the U.S. Civil war, where the climate is warm and has limited snow, or by being below a certain latitude.

==Research==
The [[World Wide Web]] is a major source of geographical information submitted by non-specialists. The British [[Ordnance Survey]] is sponsoring research at the Universities of Cardiff and Sheffield,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the aim of which is to study the use of vernacular geography, and to investigate how information mined from the Web can be used to generate an approximate spatial boundary for an imprecise region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4512/1/CEUS2006.pdf|title=Geo-tagging for imprecise regions of different sizes|author=Pasley, R.C., Clough, P. and Sanderson, M.|year=2007|work=Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Geographical Information Retrieval. Workshop On Geographic Information Retrieval, November 09, 2007, Lisbon, Portugal.|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The existing technology for accessing geographical data is not well adapted to the unstructured, largely text-based resources of the Web. Spatial information on the Web can be categorized geographically according to the textual content, but a major problem for GIS developers wanting to use this resource is the vague and imprecise nature of place names that are commonly employed within web documents.

In pursuit of delineating vernacular regions, trigger phrases are used by the researchers to capture regular linguistic patterns, which identify relationships between geographic locations. For example, the trigger phrase ''“X is located in Y”'' can be ''"Birmingham is located in *"'' or ''"* is located in Birmingham"''. The completed trigger phrase is then submitted to a search engine. For each search, up to 100 results are retrieved. Duplicate results are then removed based on the URL, and snippet text and the search result is used to find candidate region members.

From these results, geo-references are extracted and assigned spatial coordinates. A bounding box is then applied and the bounding box is used to find coordinates of other regions and points, apparently lying outside the candidate region. Thus it is possible to compute a boundary for the imprecise region using the points inside and outside.

=== Public participation tool ===
Cardiff University launched a web questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; together with mapping tools to capture people's perception of Vernacular Geography in Great Britain.

== History ==
Vernon Malone College and Career Academy is named after former educator, politician, and school administrator, [[Vernon Malone]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/wake-ed-blog/article10284485.html|title=Wake County names new high school after Vernon Malone|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone was consequential in merging Wake County Public Schools and Raleigh schools, ending [[racial segregation]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/article200805494.html|title=Leader in merger of Wake County and Raleigh schools, Roy Tilley, dies|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing the name for the college and career academy, the Wake County [[board of education]] unanimously passed a resolution signifying their support for the school to be named after Malone, who had formerly served as the first Chairman for Wake County Public Schools following the merger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The inaugural principal when the school opened in 2014, was Dr. Ashlie Thompson.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article10067285.html|title=New Wake County technical high school short on students|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcpss.net/Page/266|title=Superintendent / Area Superintendents|website=www.wcpss.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since left the position and now serves as an Area Superintendent for Wake County Public Schools in the district that Vernon Malone College and Career Academy is in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Woman on top''', also called the '''cowgirl''' or '''riding''' position, is a group of [[sex position]]s in which a man lies on his back or sits, a woman straddles him facing either forward or back, and the man [[sexual penetration|inserts]] his erect [[Human penis|penis]] into the woman's [[vagina]] or [[Human anus|anus]].&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;[http://healthguide.howstuffworks.com/sexual-positions-dictionary2.htm "Discovery Health Sexual Positions"]. ''healthguide.howstuffworks.com''. Retrieved 2010-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cowgirl name derives from the image of the receiving partner "riding" the partner as a [[cowgirl]] rides a bucking horse. It is one of a number of receptive-partner-superior sexual positions, another being the [[#Reverse cowgirl position|reverse cowgirl]] position. It is fairly simple to achieve and maintain and pleasures both partners. This position is also used as a precursor to the [[lateral coital position]] described by [[Masters and Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Little Brown and Company|edition=1st|year=June 1970|isbn=0-316-54985-1|title=Human Sexual Inadequacy|last=Masters|first=Johnson|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position is commonly cited as one of the more popular sex positions, especially by women, because of its ability to adequately stimulate the [[clitoris]]. In this position, the woman is usually the active partner during the sexual activity.

==Cowgirl position==
In the cowgirl position, the man lies on his back or sits, with the woman straddling him across his pelvis facing forward, either in a [[kneeling]] or [[squatting position|squatting]] position. The woman will align her [[vagina]] with the man's erect [[penis]], and lower herself onto the penis with either the man or the woman guiding the penis into the woman's vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]].&lt;ref name="discovery" /&gt; With the erect penis inside the woman, the woman can glide up and down the man's penis,&lt;ref name="Kar"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Nilamadhab Kar, Gopal Chandra Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=108–109| isbn = 8180614050|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=everydayhealth&gt;[http://www.everydayhealth.com/sexual-health/sexual-positions.aspx "Sex Positions For Better Sex"]. Retrieved 2010-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; controlling the rhythm and pace of vaginal stimulation and the extent and duration of penetration.&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt; The woman is free to change her position ranging from leaning back to stretching out on her partner's chest to rocking from side to side or in a circular motion. Each of those changes would alter the angle and depth of penetration and which part of the vaginal area and sex organs are stimulated. The man's hands are free to reach and touch the woman's breasts, clitoris, buttocks, face etc.,&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="everydayhealth"/&gt; and the partners can maintain eye contact. With the woman in the sitting or leaning back positions, the man may also [[Stimulation of nipples|stimulate her nipples]] and [[clitoral stimulation|clitoris]] with his fingers, or suck on her nipples if she inclines towards him or he raises his torso towards her.

In this position a woman can continue with the up and down motion after the man has achieved orgasm until she reaches orgasm. Afterwards, she may collapse onto the man's chest, with her vagina being very sensitive to further stimulation. On the other hand, if the woman reaches orgasm before the man, the woman may raise her pelvis to enable the man to actively thrust upwards&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; or the couple may change to a position which enables the man to continue thrusting, such as the [[missionary position]].

A woman may also engage in [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]] (penetrating a man with a [[strap-on dildo]]) while being on top.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esquire.com/uk/life/sex-relationships/news/a11943/a-guide-to-pegging/ Why All Men Should Try Pegging]. Esquire. Retrieved 2018-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse missionary position==
[[File:PeterJohannNepomukGeigerEroticWatercolor06.jpg|thumb|Depiction of reverse missionary position by [[Johann Nepomuk Geiger]] (1840)]]
When the woman lies on her partner's chest, a better description is the '''reverse missionary position'''. Stretching out with her legs on the man&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; puts more pressure on the woman's [[mons pubis]] and clitoris. If the man separates his legs, the woman can put her legs between his.&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; In this position she can increase the tightness on the man's penis by pressing her thighs together, or the man may press the woman's thighs together. This increases vaginal friction but she can still control the pace and rhythm of her thrusts. As most women approach orgasm, they experience acute [[vaginal contraction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochvíl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |journal=Československá psychiatrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also increases the man's sexual stimulation by increasing tightness on his penis.

==Reverse cowgirl position==
[[File:Michael Zichy-love1.jpg|thumb|Depiction of reverse cowgirl position by [[Mihály Zichy]] (around 1911)]]
In the '''reverse cowgirl''' position, the woman straddles the man facing the man's feet in a [[kneeling]] or [[squatting position|squatting]] position. After either she or the man has guided the penis into the woman's vagina, the woman can keep her torso upright, or she can lean forward or back to lie on the man's chest or move sideways at will. The man's legs can be flat on the bed or arched. The woman also has control over the pace, rhythm, depth and duration of penetration. By changing her position and thrusts, the woman can change the level of stimulation for the man, while simultaneously stimulating her clitoris or an area termed "the [[G-spot]]." When planting her feet instead of kneeling, still facing away from her partner, the position is known as Reverse Asian Cowgirl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexinfo101.com/reverseasiancowgirl.shtml Reverse Asian Cowgirl Sex Position] Sexinfo101.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantage==
An advantage of the woman on top positions is that the man's weight is not on the woman. The woman on top positions are ideal during pregnancy as there is no pressure on the woman's abdomen, and it is easy for her to control the depth and speed of penetration. It is also useful if the man is recovering from a serious illness or surgery or if the woman has recently given birth.&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;

==Comparison to the cowboy position==
The '''cowboy position''' is the equivalent for sex wherein the man is being penetrated; in the [[LGBT community]], the major difference is that it is usually anal sex in which the [[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|bottom]] straddles the [[Top, bottom and versatile#Top|top]], who otherwise assumes the same role as the male does in the cowgirl position.&lt;ref&gt; [http://vadamagazine.com/features/vada-that/vada-guide-anal-sex-men The Vada Guide to Anal Sex for Men] Vada Magazine. Retrieved 2018-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sharing many of the same advantages as the cowgirl variant, the position is often cited as being advantageous for bottoms who are new to anal sex, as it allows the receiving partner to lower himself on to the other's penis at his own pace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/11/gay-sex-positions/ Pink News Explainer: The Best Gay Sex Positions] Pink News.
