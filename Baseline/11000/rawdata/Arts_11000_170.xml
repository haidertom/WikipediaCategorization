'''''A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas''''' (1952) is a two-volume index, published as volumes 2 and 3 of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]’s collection ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]''. Compiled by [[Mortimer Adler]], an American philosopher, under the guidance of [[Robert Hutchins]], president of the [[University of Chicago]], the volumes were billed as a collection of the 102 great ideas of the [[western canon]]. The term “syntopicon” was coined specifically for this undertaking, meaning “a collection of topics.”&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes catalogued what Adler and his team deemed to be the fundamental ideas contained in the works of the Great Books of the Western World, which stretched chronologically from [[Homer]] to [[Freud]]. The ''Syntopicon'' lists, under each idea, where every occurrence of the concept can be located in the collection’s famous works.

==History==
The ''Syntopicon'' was created to set the Great Books collection apart from previously published sets (such as [[Harvard Classics]]). Robert Hutchins, at the time, in addition to being the president of the University of Chicago, also served as Chairman of the Board of Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Hutchins and Adler were recruited by the encyclopedia’s publisher for a “special idea”&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J. S. (1983). The romance of commerce and culture: Capitalism, modernism, and the Chicago-Aspen crusade for reform. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which would increase the collection’s marketability.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Anne H. "The Philosophy of General Education and Its Contradictions: the Influence of Hutchins." The Journal of General Education 50 (2001): 165–191&lt;/ref&gt;

With this mission, Adler undertook a project that would consume over a decade of his life: identifying and indexing the western world’s Great Ideas. In the end, the ''Syntopicon'' would require over 400,000 man-hours of reading&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library&lt;/ref&gt; and cost over two million dollars.&lt;ref name="Mortimer, Adler J 1950"&gt;Mortimer, Adler J. Letter to J. Loy Maloney. 11 Apr. 1950. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; Britannica publisher Senator [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]] joked at the Great Books presentation dinner that “the Syntopicon is said to be the most expensive two volumes editorially in all publishing history. How Hutchins and Adler achieved that unique distinction, the publisher is still trying to figure out. ([[Clifton Fadiman]]) assured me some day the story will be told. I’d like it whenever I can get it.”&lt;ref&gt;Benton, William. "Great Books of the Western World." Encyclopædia Britannica. Presentation Dinner. Waldorf Astoria, New York City. 15 Apr. 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of cataloging each appearance of one of the “Great Ideas” in all 431 works by 71 authors in the collection was so arduous that the ''Syntopicon'' nearly did not make it to print. Before it even came time to print, the budget had topped a million dollars and there was not even “a penny for paper” left.&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. Untitled Letter, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler persevered, however, having spent the previous eight years of his life on the project. He single-handedly raised funds by selling more expensive “Founders Editions” of the sets, and disobeyed the order to fire his entire staff. There were times, during the process when he admitted: “the question was could we sell the plates for junk! Could we dispose of the plates as old metal?”&lt;ref name="Adler" /&gt;

Adler felt, through it all, that he was creating something completely new. The ''Syntopicon'', he felt, would be revolutionary, its release on par with such events as the creation of the first dictionary. It would do for ideas what previous reference books had done for words and facts. He worked with a team of over 100 readers who met twice a week for years to discuss the readings and the ideas within them. Among his editorial team was a young [[Saul Bellow]].

In the end, he produced two volumes, which listed the 102 Great Ideas of the western world, from Angel to World. The set was released with much fanfare, including an honorary gifting of the first two editions to U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Elizabeth II]]. An internal memo from Encyclopædia Britannica, regarding a release party, reads:

“The projected sequences of events is: (1) Mr. Hutchins kicks off the conference with a discussion of the Great Books movement, and the university’s and Britannica’s interest in the set; (2) Mr. Adler tells in detail of the contents of the set and the significance of the Syntopicon; (3) Cocktails.”&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, James. Letter to C. Scott Fletcher. 12 Apr. 1950. Encyclopædia Britannica Inter Office Correspondence. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
In addition to being a “special idea” that would set Great Books of the Western World apart, the ''Syntopicon'' serves four other purposes, outlined in its preface. The ''Syntopicon'' can serve as a reference book, as a book to be read, as an “instrument of liberal education,” and as “an instrument of discovery and research.”&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. "Syntopicon I Preface." Great Books of the Western World. 1st ed. 54 vols. Chicago, IL: Encyclopædia Britannica, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all, however, the ''Syntopicon'' was created to unite the western world’s canon. It was created to solve what Adler saw as a fundamental problem, that “different authors say the same thing in different ways, or use the same words to say quite different things.”&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.&lt;/ref&gt; By cataloging the things the great authors were saying in a more scientific manner, Adler hoped to show the underlying unity that ultimately existed in the collected works.

For Hutchins, a chief proponent of classical education, the creation of the ''Syntopicon'' held even greater implications. Hutchins felt that the ideas being discussed and cross-listed in the ''Syntopicon'' might be "powerful enough to save the world from self-destruction."&lt;ref&gt;"There are Only 102 Great Ideas." Look. Jan. 1948: 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The ''Syntopicon'' consists of 102 chapters on the 102 Great Ideas. Each chapter is broken down into five distinct sections: the introduction, an outline of topics, references, cross-references, and additional readings. Adler penned all 102 introductions himself, giving a brief essay on the idea and its connection with the western canon. The outline of topics broke each idea down further, into as many as 15 sub-ideas. For instance, the first idea “Angel” is broken down into “Inferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion,” “the philosophical consideration of pure intelligences, spiritual substances, supra-human persons” and seven other subtopics.&lt;ref&gt;"Syntopicon I." Great Books of the Western World. 1st ed. 54 vols. Chicago, IL: Encyclopædia Britannica, 1952. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; After this is the references section (for instance, “inferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion” can be found in Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Milton, Bacon, Locke, Hegel, Goethe and more). Cross-references follow, where similar ideas are listed. Last is the additional readings, in which one could seek out more on the subject of “Angel.”

The list of 102 ideas is broken between the two volumes, as follows:

Volume I: [[Angel]], [[Animal]], [[Aristocracy]], [[Art]], [[Astronomy]], [[Beauty]], [[Being]], [[Cause]], [[Chance (philosophy)|Chance]], [[wikt:change|Change]], [[Citizen]], [[Constitution]], [[Courage]], [[convention (norm)|Custom and Convention]], [[Definition]], [[Democracy]], [[Interpersonal attraction|Desire]], [[Dialectic]], [[Duty]], [[Education]], [[Classical element|Element]], [[Emotion]], [[Eternity]], [[Evolution]], [[Experience]], [[Family]], [[destiny|Fate]], [[wikt:Form|Form]], [[God]], [[wikt:good|Good]] and [[Evil]], [[Government]], [[Habituation|Habit]], [[Happiness]], [[History]], [[Honor]], [[Hypothesis]], [[Idea]], [[Immortality]], [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]], [[Infinity]], [[Judgment]], [[Justice]], [[Knowledge]], [[Labour (economics)|Labor]], [[Language]], [[Law]], [[Liberty]], [[Life]] and [[Death]], [[Logic]], and [[Love]].

Volume II: [[Man]], [[Mathematics]], [[Matter]], [[Mechanics]], [[Medicine]], [[Memory]] and [[Imagination]], [[Metaphysics]], [[Mind]], [[Monarchy]], [[Nature]], [[Metaphysical necessity|Necessity]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|Contingency]], [[Oligarchy]], [[1 (number)|One]] and [[wikt:many|Many]], [[Opinion]], [[wikt:opposition|Opposition]],&lt;ref&gt;that which deals with the quality of sets of words that are opposite&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophy]], [[Physics]], [[Pleasure]] and [[Pain]], [[Poetry]], [[Principle]], [[Progress (history)|Progress]], [[Prophecy]], [[Prudence]], [[Punishment]], [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]], [[Quantity]], [[Reasoning]], [[Property (philosophy)|Relation]],&lt;ref&gt;that which deals with what is "relative" to another object&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religion]], [[Revolution]], [[Rhetoric]], [[Identity (philosophy)|Same]] and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], [[Science]], [[Sense]], [[Sign (linguistics)|Sign]] and [[Symbol]], [[Sin]], [[Slavery]], [[Soul (spirit)|Soul]], [[Space]], [[Sovereign State|State]], [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]], [[Theology]], [[Time]], [[Truth]], [[Tyranny]] and [[Despotism]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|Universal]] and [[Particular]], [[Virtue]] and [[Vice]], [[War]] and [[Peace]], [[Wealth]], [[Will (philosophy)|Will]], [[Wisdom]], and [[World]].

==Reactions==
The release of the ''Syntopicon'' and the Great Books of the Western World was covered in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and local papers across the United States.

Full page ads for ''Time'' magazine appeared in newspapers across the country, saying “What and Why is a Syntopicon?”&lt;ref&gt;"TIME Magazine." Advertisement. ''Chicago Daily News'' 20 Apr. 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Time published an article about the new, pivotal piece of reference material, and Adler wrote them back in thanks, saying that “I think the piece is both thoroughly accurate and very lively, which, considering the subject matter, is quite a feat.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mortimer, Adler J. Letter to Bruce Barton. 22 Apr. 1950. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Look (American magazine)|''Look'']] magazine ran a feature on the ''Syntopicon'', displaying behind-the-scene photos of the index’s staff at work. In one picture, editor Joe Roddy is shown weighing the number of entries about love on a scale. “Discussions of love by great authors,” the caption reads, “outweigh sin and eternity.”&lt;ref&gt;"There are Only 102 Great Ideas." Look Jan. 1948: 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the extensive press coverage and cross-country speeches, however, sales of the ''Syntopicon'' and the Great Books of the Western World were slow. Experienced encyclopedia salesmen had to be brought in to move the product, despite Hutchins’ dislike of this solution.

The ''Syntopicon'''s list was "arbitrary", as even Adler admitted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The press and others also found problems with the ''Syntopicon'', and despite Adler’s predictions (“we predict that, as dictionaries are indispensable in the realm of words, and encyclopaedias in the realm of facts, so the Syntopicon will become indispensable in the realm of ideas”&lt;ref name="Mortimer, Adler J 1950"/&gt; ) the ''Syntopicon'' has fallen into relative obscurity. At the time of its release, ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' declared: “Its defects are on the surface. One is the implication that great books are concerned only with ideas which can be logically analyzed—whereas many masterpieces of literature live in realms partially or wholly outside the realm of logic. Another is the conception that the chief purpose of reading a book is to crack its shell and reach its kernel—the form itself being unimportant decoration.”&lt;ref&gt;Highet, Gilbert. "The Great Ideas of the Western World." Rev. of Great Books of the Western World, by Mortimer J. Adler. ''New York Times Book Review'' 14 Sept. 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent books==
In a succeeding book, Adler expressed his regret that the [[civil rights]] concept of [[social equality|Equality]] had not been selected. He attempted to rectify the omission with ''Six Great Ideas: [[Truth]]–[[Good and evil|Goodness]]–[[Beauty]]–[[Liberty]]–[[egalitarianism|Equality]]–[[Justice]]'' (1981).

Adler attempted another index, in one volume, the ''[[Propædia]]'' for the fifteenth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. A traditional two-volume alphabetical index has since been produced for the more recent versions of the fifteenth edition, in addition to ''Propædia''.

[[File:The Agony in the Garden William Blake.jpg|thumb|400px|''The Agony in the Garden'', 1799–1800. [[Tempera]] on tinned iron, 27 cm × 38 cm]]
'''''The Agony in the Garden''''' is a small painting by [[William Blake]], completed as part of his 1799–1800 series of Bible illustrations commissioned by his patron and friend Thomas Butts. The work illustrates a passage from the [[Gospel of Luke]] which describes [[Agony in the Garden|Christ's turmoil]] in the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]] before his arrest and Crucifixion following [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]'s betrayal.&lt;ref name="h64"&gt;Hamlyn et al, 64&lt;/ref&gt; In Blake's painting a brilliantly coloured and majestic angel breaks through the surrounding darkness and descends from a cloud to aid and physically support Jesus in his hour of agony.&lt;ref name="r123"&gt;Raine, 123&lt;/ref&gt; The work is dominated by vertical lines, formed both from the trees and from the two arms of the angel. Two inner lines converge on Christ's palms, evoking the nails driven through him during his crucifixion. 

''The Agony in the Garden'' was bequeathed by  Blake collector Graham Robertson to the National Trust in 1948. It was acquired by the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-the-agony-in-the-garden-n05894 ''The Agony in the Garden'' c. 1799–1800]. [[Tate Britain]], London. Retrieved 14 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Between 1799 and 1803, Blake produced over 150 biblical illustrations for Thomas Butts. Around 50 were complete for the 1799–1880 series, of which around 30 are extant. They are all around the same size; all but two are significantly larger than the average 28cm x 38cm. Only the present work is on tinned steel; the majority of the others are painted on canvas. The works, all minutely detailed and richly coloured, involve complex and innovative arrangement and design.&lt;ref name="T112"&gt;Townsend et al, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The text accompanying ''The Agony in the Garden'' reads: "And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground."&lt;ref name="h64" /&gt; The painting shows Christ kneeling in the garden with his arms outstretched and leaning backwards as if about to faint. He is held at the waist by an angel descending from a multi-coloured cloud. The angel supports Christ as he leans back, crying out in agony.&lt;ref name="r123" /&gt; Both the angel and cloud are composed by a dominant impasted white, and lined with brilliant varieties of red, blue, yellow and green pigments. Three vaguely described, almost ghostly, disciples kneel in the dark trees to either side. 

[[File:Nativity by Blake.jpg|thumb|''Nativity'', 1790-1800. Tempera on copper. [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].]]
Art historian [[Anthony Blunt]] linked this work to Blake's ''Nativity'' and ''Procession to Calvary'', and contended that they provide insight to Blake's mindset at the time. The artist had earlier been preoccupied with the nature of evil and the duality of human nature, but seemingly emerged and found hope through the ideal of salvation through Christ. According to Blunt, Blake conveys this through the motif of a bright light shining into the darkness of mankind. In the present work this is perhaps expressed through the angel appearing in brilliantly illuminated colours from the darkness and foreboding of the trees.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Geoffrey. "'The Art of William Blake' by Anthony Blunt". ''Criticism'', Volume 2, No. 3, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is built up from a number of layers of paint above the underlying priming. In some cases the layers are separated by films of binding glue. The foreground is built from a chalk ground above the priming, which gives added texture, and is especially evident around the areas of the tress and scrubs.&lt;ref name="T120"&gt;Townsend et al, 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material==
[[File:Eve Tempted by the Serpent William Blake.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Eve Tempted by the Serpent''. Tempera on Copper. Another work from the series painted on metal, in this case copperplate.]]
The painting is unique in Blake's oeuvre in that the [[tempera]] is painted on tinned iron. Most of the works in the series were painted onto canvas, with three on copper and only the present work on tinned iron. It has been suggested that this plate may originally have formed the lid of a box, possibly a paint box.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, 103&lt;/ref&gt; The work is further unique in that he employed cherry gum in his mixture, utilising a blend more commonly associated with earlier, medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]], but which delivers a smoother and more durable effect.&lt;ref name="t120"&gt;Townsend et al, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In employing tinned iron Blake was likely experimenting with methods of etching or painting on metal, perhaps following the examples of [[Lucas van Leyden]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s work on [[Intaglio printing|copperplate]].&lt;ref name="t30"&gt;Townsend et al, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; The surface was prepared with oil and lead before the application of the paint, although red lead pigment was applied directly onto the tin around the area of the angel's lower back and waist. Unfortunately this pigment is not well bound to the surface and has suffered damage and loss of paint.&lt;ref name="m87"&gt;Mulhallen, 87&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some areas of colour were retouched by restorers around 1850 following dulling and loss of paint. This is most obvious with the bright greens to either side of Christ. However, the additions are barely noticeable as the restorers employed pigments prepared in a similar matter to the originals.&lt;ref name="t157"&gt;Townsend et al, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
''The Agony in the Garden'' is in very poor condition. This is mainly due to a built up of material following corrosion of the iron.&lt;ref name="t30" /&gt; This material has gathered between the painting's metal surface and priming, resulting in the delamination and displacement of pigment.&lt;ref name="t155"&gt;Townsend et al, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Blake sealed his metal support with red paint bound with a gum mixture and animal glue, which was at the time thought of as a corrosion inhibitor. But these surfaces offered little protection against the decay of the paint layers, and in fact contributed to the displacement of pigment.&lt;ref name="t119"&gt;Townsend et al, 119&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a damaged signature "WBinv" in white paint at the lower right, although it is undated.&lt;ref name="t118"&gt;Townsend et al, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The mural was commissioned in 1929 by [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], director of [[The New School for Social Research]] in New York City, for the school's boardroom. Benton was not offered any payment beyond material costs. Instead, he saw the work as an opportunity to make a name for himself and thereby get more commissions in the future. The subjects were based on Benton's extensive travels in the United States. Benton said about the work: "Every detail of every picture is a thing I myself have seen and known. Every head is a real person drawn from life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Theroux|first=Paul|date=December 2014|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/story-behind-thomas-hart-bentons-incredible-masterwork-1-180953405/|title=The Story Behind Thomas Hart Benton's Incredible Masterwork|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|accessdate=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural was painted with egg [[tempera]] on linen canvases.&lt;ref name="met1" /&gt;

==Provenance==
The mural was acquired by [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company]] in 1984. After two years of renovation it was installed at AXA's headquarters at [[AXA Equitable Center|787 Seventh Avenue]] in New York City. In 1996 AXA moved to 1290 Avenue of the Americas and installed the mural in the building's lobby. In January 2012 the mural was renovated again, and in December 2012 it was donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bent/hd_bent.htm|title=Thomas Hart Benton's ''America Today'' Mural|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6425">'''Arnait Video Productions''' (Women's Video Workshop of [[Igloolik]]) is a [[Women's cinema|women's filmmaking]] collective that aims to value the voices of [[Inuit]] women in debates of interest to all Canadians.&lt;ref name="isuma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isuma.tv/arnaitvideo/arnait-history|title=Arnait History &amp;#124; IsumaTV|publisher=isuma.tv|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnait is related to [[Isuma]] Productions.{{vague|date=January 2015}}

==History==
Arnait was founded in 1991 by [[Marie-Hélène Cousineau]], [[Madeline Ivalu]], [[Susan Avingaq]], Carol Kunuk and [[Atuat Akkitirq]].&lt;ref name="arnaitvideo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnaitvideo.ca/our-team.html|title=Our Team - Arnait Video Productions|publisher=arnaitvideo.ca|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally named ''Arnait Ikajurtigiit'' ([[Inuktitut]]: Women helping each other), and focuses on documenting women's experience and community in [[Nunavut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=Pamela R.|title=Historical dictionary of the Inuit|date=2013|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham |isbn=9780810879126|page=33|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Avingaq describes Arnait as: "a women's video workshop [that] can help people communicate with each other. That can be useful. It can make them understand. A long time ago, just with words and language, people believed stories and legends, they saw pictures in their imagination. Our stories are useful and unforgettable".&lt;ref name="WilsonStewart2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pamela Wilson|author2=Michelle Stewart|title=Global Indigenous Media: Cultures, Poetics, and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8pzHPos4U0C&amp;pg=PA75|date=6 August 2008|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8869-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
As with Isuma, Arnait's work spans interviews, short ethnographic videos on traditional activities, television series, feature documentaries and narrative feature films.&lt;ref name="arnaitvideo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnaitvideo.ca/projects.html|title=Projects - Arnait Video Productions|publisher=arnaitvideo.ca|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first narrative feature ''[[Before Tomorrow]]'' was adapted by Danish writer [[Jørn Riel]] from the novel ''For morgendagen''. It premiered in Igloolik in 2008 in front of the community involved in its making. It received nine [[Genie Awards|Canadian Genie Award]] nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Art Direction, Costumes, Sound, Original Song, and four [[Jutra Awards]]: Best Picture, Director, Costumes, Music.&lt;ref name="isuma2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isuma.tv/beforetomorrow|title=Before Tomorrow &amp;#124; IsumaTV|publisher=isuma.tv|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Uvanga]]'' premiered at the [[Festival du Nouveau Cinéma]] in September 2013, toured internationally to film festivals including the [[Berlinale]], and had a theatrical release in Canada in summer 2014.&lt;ref name="canada-berlin2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada-berlin2014.ca/producers.php?id=3361 |title=Marie-Hélène Cousineau &amp;ndash; Arnait Video Productions &amp;ndash; Producers &amp;ndash; Telefilm Canada |author=Telefilm Canada |publisher=canada-berlin2014.ca |accessdate=2014-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810231547/http://www.canada-berlin2014.ca/producers.php?id=3361 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Arnait started production on ''[[Sol (film)|Sol]]'', a documentary prompted by the supposed suicide &lt;!-- the whole point of the documentary is that it seems implausible he would have been capable of killing himself as claimed, and there may be some other explanation, pending an inquest --&gt;of 26-year-old musician Solomon Uyarasuk in a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] jail cell.&lt;ref name="rcinet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2014/04/24/nunavut-filmmakers-turn-the-lens-on-suicide/|title=Eye on the Arctic   &amp;raquo; Nunavut filmmakers turn the lens on suicide|publisher=rcinet.ca|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nunatsiaqonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674nunavut_coroner_to_hold_inquest_into_igloolik_mans_jail_cell_death/|title=www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674nunavut_coroner_to_hold_inquest_into_igloolik_mans_jail_cell_death/|publisher=nunatsiaqonline.ca|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film subsequently won the Grand Prize for Best Canadian Feature at the [[Rencontres internationales du documentaire de Montréal|RIDM Montreal International Documentary Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ridm.qc.ca/en/news/latest-news/1513/prize-winners-of-the-17th-edition |title=Award Winners of the 17th Edition |publisher=RIDM — Montreal International Documentary Festival |date=2014-11-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115004350/http://www.ridm.qc.ca/en/news/latest-news/1513/prize-winners-of-the-17th-edition |archivedate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included in the list of "Canada's Top Ten" feature films of 2014, selected by a panel of filmmakers and industry professionals organized by TIFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=TIFF Tips Its Toque to the Best in Canadian Filmmaking: Cronenberg, Dolan, and Gunnarson Among Directors Recognized |date=1 December 2014   |url=http://media.tiff.net.s3.amazonaws.com/content/pdf/14th_Annual_Canadas_Top_Ten_Film_Festival_2014.pdf   |publisher=TIFF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Toronto Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2014/12/01/tiffs_top_ten_film_festival_spotlight_on_canadian_film.html |date=1 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 |author=Linda Barnard |title=TIFF's Top Ten Film Festival: Spotlight on Canadian film  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In the summer of 1999, graphic designer Lance Kagey was introduced to the art of letterpress printing through a visit to a British Columbia studio and through a program at Seattle's [[School of Visual Concepts]]. Kagey purchased a circa-1950's Challenge proof press&lt;ref name="strange"&gt;[http://www.cityartstacoma.com/issues/CAT017/CAT017_articles.html      This Strange Thing of Ours: Witty and spiritual, scofflaw yet civic-minded. Beautiful Angle is a tangle of contradictions, all coated with wheatpaste]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, City Arts (Tacoma), Sep/Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; through eBay for $50. After paying more than 12 times that amount in shipping and after months of self-education and experimentation, Kagey and [[copywriter]] and author Tom Llewellyn began producing posters. 

The first poster, Swirl, was distributed on October 31, 2002, the anniversary of the posting of [[The Ninety-Five Theses]] by [[Martin Luther]].  Beautiful Angle has used a variety of printing techniques, including split fountain color process, a two color double run, and a [[brayer]] over a printed image.&lt;ref name="march"/&gt;  A typical press run is 100 posters, of which 80 are posted around the downtown area of Tacoma, and the remainder are sold.&lt;ref name="strange"/&gt;  Beautiful Angle has a "strange, contradictory relationship with the city";&lt;ref name="strange"/&gt; even though the posters are posted perhaps illegally, the group has won a [[Chamber of Commerce]] award of merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacomachamber.org/page.asp?view=3346 Recognizing New Tacoma Award Winners]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, May 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Beautiful Angle has also worked with other artists such as [[Art Chantry]].

Beautiful Angle has been featured in Felt and Wire, a leading graphic design blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.feltandwire.com/2009/04/02/beautiful-angle-phile/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230143402/http://www.feltandwire.com/2009/04/02/beautiful-angle-phile/ |archive-date=2010-12-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the subject of a City Arts Magazine cover story,&lt;ref name="strange"/&gt; as well as feature stories in the leading Tacoma newspaper, [[The News Tribune]], as well as in the [[Weekly Volcano]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklyvolcano.com/2009-03-29/cover/253/ A Love Letter To Tacoma: The images and words of Beautiful Angle], by Jessica Corey-Butler, Weekly Volcano, Mar 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toby Room]], and many local and arts-related blogs. The City of Tacoma's outreach website, cityofdestiny.com, now links to the project. Gallery shows have been held at Handforth Gallery, [[School of Visual Concepts]], Jazzbones, Pike Street Press, Fulcrum Gallery and Blackwater Cafe. A nearly complete collection of posters is always on display at King's Books in Tacoma.

In 2006, The Washington State Historical Society awarded a grant to Beautiful Angle for a series of posters for their "History in the Making" exhibit.

In 2008, The Washington State Historical Society commissioned Beautiful Angle for a series of posters to promote their exhibit, "Tacoma's Civil Rights Struggle."

In August 2009, a Beautiful Angle retrospective was included in the annual TypeCon exhibition, under the direction of the [[Society of Typographic Aficionados]], shown in [[Seattle]], Washington and [[Brighton]], England. In November 2009, the City of Tacoma Arts Commission awarded Beautiful Angle their Amocat Award.

In 2011, Beautiful Angle received a City of Tacoma arts grant to produce The Tacoma Folio, a limited edition, 30-page book of posters, each around the theme of Tacoma's own mythology.

In 2014, Beautiful Angle received a second City of Tacoma arts grant to produce a limited edition poster for Art at Work Month.

== Plot ==
In [[New York City]], Richie ([[Shawn Christensen]]), a downtrodden young man whose girlfriend, Vista (Isabelle McNally), recently disappeared, discovers the corpse of a girl who died from a heroin overdose while he is cleaning bathroom stalls at a nightclub. The club owner, Bill ([[Ron Perlman]]), arranges for her body to be removed without notifying the authorities.

At his apartment, Richie attempts suicide by cutting one of his wrists in a bathtub, when he receives a call from his estranged sister, Maggie ([[Emmy Rossum]]), asking him to look after her eleven-year-old daughter, Sophia ([[Fátima Ptacek]]). Richie goes to her school, where she recites "[[Because I could not stop for Death]]" by [[Emily Dickinson]] in both English and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Richie takes her to her apartment before heading home, where he attempts suicide by drug overdose. Richie hallucinates a drug dealer calling him on the phone, threatening him by saying he is in the building. Sophia calls, however, and informs Richie that her mother has not returned home.

Richie arrives at the lobby of Maggie's apartment, where he discovers that the drugs he took were Zolafren, intended for [[menopause]]. Outside Maggie's apartment, a suspicious-looking woman asks Richie about his sister's whereabouts. After entering, Maggie calls the apartment, indicating to Richie that she is in central booking and upon hearing of the woman, orders Richie to sneak Sophia out of the building.

Richie takes Sophia to a bowling alley where he works. Richie calls central booking, who inform him that his sister was arrested and is awaiting arraignment at 4:30 AM. The owner of the bowling alley, Gideon ([[Paul Wesley]]), has Richie brought to the office. Gideon informs him that his girlfriend has been missing for a day, with her last whereabouts being at Bill's nightclub, and produces a photograph, which Richie recognizes as being of the dead woman he saw the night before. Richie denies knowledge of her whereabouts. He calls Bill, who tells him to come in at 1:30 AM to discuss the situation.

As a favor to Richie, Gideon allows Maggie the use of his lawyer, Bruce Warham ([[Richard Schiff]]), who informs Maggie that in the public's eyes, she is a mistress, due to her having sexual relations to a married man, despite having been assaulted.

Richie tells Sophia about flip books he made growing up about a character called "Sophia". He brings Sophia to his former apartment in a downtrodden part of town, where he retrieves some flip books and calms his panicked niece by presenting the premise of a girl who dies in intricate ways, but comes back by the next installment. He then collapses from blood loss, but refuses to go to a hospital, due to promising Maggie to keep Sophia safe.

After Sophia tells him the cruel things her estranged father, Darren ([[Fran Kranz]]), says to her, Richie assaults him at his work. Richie and Sophia visit Bill, who divulges that Gideon's girlfriend had been resisting his advances and in retaliation, he gave her heroin. Richie returns to Maggie's apartment, where he returns Sophia home. Sophia tells him that his constant love letters to Vista would work if he told her he loves her.

Having reached an epiphany, Richie confronts Gideon, telling him what happened to his girlfriend. Gideon and his armed thugs abduct Richie, then drop him off alongside the road, before speeding off to deal with Bill. Richie re-encounters the blonde woman, who is revealed to be the wife of Maggie's lover. Richie makes his rendezvous with a released Maggie and escorts her to her apartment.

Maggie tells Richie that she does not want him to stay in her daughter's life, fearing him to be a "false idol". Richie tells her how much he looked up to her when they were younger and how much he still looks up to her now. He returns to his bathtub and prepares to kill himself, when Maggie calls him, inviting him over for dinner. Richie writes a much shorter letter to Vista, stating that he loves and misses her, before looking up and seeing an image of her sitting across from him.

There are fourteen known Byzantine manuscripts of the [[Book of Job]] dating from the 9th to 14th centuries, as well as a post-Byzantine codex [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] with cycle of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]]. The quantity of Job illustrations survived in the fifteen manuscripts exceeds 1800 pictures. The total is aggregated considerably by single images of Job in other manuscripts, frescoes and carvings.

== Introduction ==

The theological core of the work and its content have been much discussed since the pre-Christian age, especially the problem of human misfortune and in particular the misfortune of the righteous in relation to the prevailing concept of divine justice. In that it uses as departure point the literary framework of the story of Job, a devout, wealthy and respected man, who, with God’s permission, was struck by Satan with the greatest misfortunes. Being a king, according to the Septuagint, Job was the model of the God-fearing, wise and philanthropic ruler who was also enjoying a peaceful life in the bosom of his large family and among his friends. It was precisely this deep piety and the divine favour which incited the envy of Satan who - not without much effort - eventually succeeded in obtaining God’s consent to put Job to the test. Thus, in a rapid sequence of calamities, Job is robbed of all his possessions, his herds, his servants, his house and all his ten children. At the very last, smitten himself with the horrible disease of leprosy and abandoned by all, including his wife, he leaves the city and dwells on a dunghill. In spite of all these reversals of fate Job remains steadfast not only to his faith in God, but also to the conviction that this sudden reversal of the divine will cannot be the consequence of his own sins, since he does not believe that such exist. Finally, after many years of trial, God again reverses the just man’s fate, restoring to him twofold all his worldly goods and giving him a new family.

== The Septuagint and related Job versions ==

===Septuagint===
The oldest translation of the Bible in Greek is known as [[Septuagint]]. Tradition propagated by the so-called [[Letter of Aristeas]] ascribes it in its entirety to a group of seventy Jewish scholars working at the order of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] who ruled Egypt from 285 to 246 BCE. Modern research, however, indicates that the letter is a late-2nd-century BCE forgery and the account is mostly legendary. In actuality, the translation was probably carried out in stages between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC and was the work of Greek-speaking Jews of the Diaspora.[1] The only indication for dating the translation of the Book of Job in that chronological framework is an excerpt from a Hellenistic–Judaic work (ʺΠερί Ἰουδαίωνʺ) by the above-mentioned Alexandrian historian [[Aristeas of Marmora|Aristeas]].[2] This excerpt, which was incorporated by Alexander Polyhistor in his compilation and thus was preserved by Eusebius,[3] contains a brief biography of Job. The striking similarity between this and appendices contained in most Greek manuscripts of the Book of Job (in addition to that, the excerpt – according to the prevailing view – presupposes the Greek translation of the Septuagint), leads to the conclusion that the Book of Job in the Greek translation was known to a writer (Aristeas) before the time of Alexander Polyhistor, that is, about the middle of the 2nd century BC.[4] Furthermore, this date conforms to and confirms the general impression given by the Greek text that it is genuinely Hellenistic, created by and familiar to circles relatively alien to a solely Judaic way of thinking. The character of the Septuagint text mentioned above, which undertakes to give the genealogy of Job and to identify his three friends, is not the only significant deviation-addition peculiar to the Greek edition. The text of the Book of Job shows so many extensive and essential differences from the Hebrew original, that one must infer either deliberate modification of the prototype, at least to a certain extent, by the Greek translator or the use of a prototype unknown today.[5] The most striking peculiarity is the extensive omissions noted and commented on quite early. According to Origen (AD 184-254), the Greek text of the Septuagint was shorter by one sixth than the Hebrew,[6] whereas St. Jerome testifies to a difference of over one fourth.[7] To these omissions, which at present are estimated to total about 187 verses, must be added the abbreviations as well as the padding of frequently free translation, amounting to a paraphrase of the prototype, which all show not only that there was a tendency to abbreviate the prototype but also that the translator apparently does not seem to have troubled himself extensively with the most difficult passages. The passages constituting a plain transcript into Greek of the Hebrew prototype are particularly notable in this respect.[8] Aside from the translator’s obvious difficulties with the text, recent studies indicate that the proven deviations were deliberate rather than a consequence merely of the translator’s inadequacy.[9] Examined in this light, the Septuagint text seems to express a particular theological tendency, evident in “emendations” of a dogmatic nature, which subsequently permeates the entire Book of Job. The main lines of this new theological approach to the “problem of Job” may be summarized as follows: In the first place, by presenting the devil as the main author of Job’s misfortune, God is generally portrayed much milder than in the Hebrew original. Secondly, there is the tendency in the speeches to moderate the intensity of Job’s polemic on God’s will and conception of justice. Thus the Job of the Septuagint translation is not at all like the Job of the Hebrew prototype. This is so, not only because his speeches in the Septuagint are less provocative in tone, but also because a new element of patient submission and humility, unknown in the prototype, has been introduced here for the first time. These modifications which will turn out to be the chief characteristics of the hero of the story as presented in the Testament of Job will also be the basic element of the mediaeval Christian tradition in which Job appears as a big sufferer –the very model of patience and justice. The friends’ speeches have been similarly “emended”. Those of Elihu especially seem to have experienced more serious alterations. The main consequences of all these changes is that Job’s standpoint is not clearly discerned from that of his friends, and, therefore, the problem itself is no longer as prominently outlined as in the prototype. The development of this dogmatic expunging culminates in the Testament of Job, where the atrophied dialogue does not preserve even a trace of the philosophical-theological analysis of the problem provided in the original poem. The Testament of Job is therefore thought by several scholars to be based entirely on the Greek translation.[10] Before concluding this brief survey of the textual problems, the remaining Greek translations must also be mentioned, since they were taken into account by the Church Fathers in their commentaries on the Book of Job and could, therefore, have a bearing on the iconography.

===Independent translations===
The earliest independent Greek translations of the Bible, which were also taken into account by Origen in his edition of the Hexapla, originated firstly in the opposition of Judaic theology to the Greek translation of the Septuagint after it had been officially accepted by the Christian Church and, secondly, with the intention to replace the Septuagint with a translation based on the unofficial standardized Hebrew text. These were the translations by Akylas, Theodotion, and Symmachus, the first of which dated about AD 130, and the other two in the 2nd and 3rd centuries respectively. Akylas is the only one of the three translators to be referred to in all sources as a Jew. According to Eusebius, Symmachus was a Christian, whereas Theodotion is referred to in some sources as a Jew and in others as a Christian.[11] Unfortunately, all three works have only come down to us fragmentary, and they differ significantly from one another in regard to the accuracy in rendering the Hebrew text and in the handling of the Greek language. Akylas’ translation is an attempt to reproduce with the greatest accuracy the details of the Hebrew text. Thus the general characteristic of his version is a bold literalness, which made it acceptable to Jews. This is also true of Symmachus, but with the difference that his effort is combined with excellent Greek. Finally, Theodotion’s translation, characterized by a painstaking accuracy in the use of the Greek language combined with careful study of the Hebrew text, has found great response among Christians. It actually seems to be a revision of the translation of the Septuagint, based on the new revised edition of the Hebrew Scriptures. For this reason Origen draws almost exclusively on it to fill the lacunae in the translation of the Septuagint.

===The Testament of Job===

The earliest and most important text, especially with regard to the illustration of the Book of Job in this category, is the pseudepigraphical Testament of Job, which has survived in its oldest version in Greek, in the Slavonic translation derived from Greek and, in its latest form, from the Syrian and Arabic variants.[12] The earliest mention of the Testament of Job is in the decree of Pope Gelasius, promulgated about AD 496, in which it is condemned as apocryphal: “Liber qui appellatur Testamentum Job apocryphus”.[13]
Literally, it belongs to the “testaments”, an apocryphal body of writings which were compiled to preserve the teachings and the histories of great, usually Biblical, figures whose names they bear.[14] Within this group the Testament of Job is, in its general complexion, more related to the Testament of The Twelve Patriarchs, while, like the Testament of Moses, it is characterized by a close adherence to the Bible text. Each constitute a haggadic commentary upon a canonical book – in other words, a midrash.[15]

The Greek manuscripts are: Paris. gr. 2658 of the 11th century; Messina, San Salvatore 29, of the year 1307 AD; Rome, Vat.gr. 1238, of the 13th century; Paris, gr. 938 of the 16th century, which is a transcript of Paris. gr. 2658. Of the Slavonic version there are three manuscripts in Belgrade, Moscow and Săfarik (S. Novakovič, Apokrifna priča o Jovu, in Starine 10 (1878),157-170; G. Polvika, Apokrifna priča o Jovu, loc. cit. 24 (1891), 135-155). The Greek text was first published by Cardinal Angelo Mai(in Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio, VII, Rome 1833, 180-191) from the Vatican manuscript. This text was reprinted along with an English translation and a valuable introduction by Kohler. See Kohler, Testament, 264-338. The same year M.R. James printed the text of the Paris manuscript also with a very useful introduction (James, Testament). A critical edition of the text, based on the manuscripts Paris. gr. 2658, Messina and Vatican, is presented by S.P. Brock (The Testament of Job, Edited with an Introduction and Critical Notes – Pseudepigrapha Veteris Testament Greece, II, Leiden 1966). Our references to the Testament text are also from this work. Cf. also R. Kraft et al., The Testament of Job, Society of Biblical Literature, Text and Translations,5,Pseudepigrapha series, 4, Missoula (MT) 1974 and R. Splittlev, The Testament of Job. Introduction, Translation and Notes (HarvardUniversity Dissertation), Cambridge (MA) 1971. Excerpts of Mai’s text are reprinted by S. Baring-Gould in Legends of the Patriarchs, New York 1872, 245-251. There are also several translations: the oldest, in French by Migne, in Dictionnaire desApocryphes, vol. II, Paris 1858, 403 is based on Mai’s edition, while that of M. Philonenko (Le Testament deJob, in Semitica,Cahiers publies par l’Institut des Etudes Semitiques de l’Universite de Paris, XVIII, Paris1968), also in French, follows Brock’s edition,while the German, by P. Riessler (Altjüdisches Schrifttum ausserhalb der Bibel, Augsburg 1928, 1104–1134) follows the edition ofJames. For a more recent translation, see L. Wills, Ancient Jewish Novels, New York 2002.

Chapter I (1)
1 There was a certain man in the land of Ausis, whose name was Job; and than man was true, blameless, righteous, and godly, abstaining from everything evil.
&lt;br /&gt;
2 And he had seven sons and three daughters.
&lt;br /&gt;
3 And his cattle consisted of seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses in the pastures, and a very great household, and he had a great husbandry on the earth; and that man was most noble of the men of the east.

13 And it came to pass on a certain day, that Job’s sons and his daughters were drinking wine in the house of their elder brother.
&lt;br /&gt;
14 And, behold, there came a messenger to Job, and said to him, The yokes of oxen were ploughing, and the she-asses were feeding near them; 
&lt;br /&gt;
15 and the spoilers came and took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I having escaped alone am come to tell thee.

17 While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, The horsemen formed three companies against us, and surrounded the camels, and took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I only escaped, and am come to tell thee.
&lt;br /&gt;
18 While he is yet speaking, another messenger comes, saying to Job, While thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking with their elder brother, 
&lt;br /&gt;
19 suddenly a great wind came on from the desert, and caught the four corners of the house, and the house fell upon thy children, and they are dead; and I have escaped alone, and am come to tell thee

Chapter II (2)
7 So the devil went out from the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from his feet to his head.

9 And when much time had passed, his wife said to him, How long wilt thou hold out, saying, Behold, I wait yet a little while, expecting the hope of my deliverance? for, behold, thy memorial is abolished from the earth, even thy sons and daughters, the pangs and pains of my womb which I bore in vain with sorrows; and thou thyself sittest down to spend the nights in the open air among the corruption of worms, and I am a wanderer and a servant from place to place and house to house, waiting for the setting of the sun, that I may rest from my labours and my pangs which now beset me: but say some word against the Lord, and die. 
&lt;br /&gt;
10 But he looked on her, and said to her, Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women. If we have received good things of the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things? 
In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned not at all with his lips before God.

12 And when they saw him from a distance they did not know him; and they cried with a loud voice, and wept, and rent every one his garment, and sprinkled dust upon their heads,
&lt;br /&gt;
13 and they sat down beside him seven days and seven nights, and no one of them spoke; for they saw that his affliction was dreadful and very great.

Chapter IV (4)
1 Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite answered and said,

10 The strength of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the exulting cry of serpents are quenched.
&lt;br /&gt;
11 The old lion has perished for want of food, and the lions’ whelps have forsaken one another.

Chapter IX (9)

8 Who alone has stretched out the heavens, and walks on the sea as on firm ground

13 For if he has turned away his anger, the whales under heaven have stooped under him.

Chapter XVI (16)

10 In his anger he has cast me down; he has gnashed his teeth upon me: the weapons of his robbers have fallen upon me.
&lt;br /&gt;
11 He has attacked me with the keen glances of his eyes; with his sharp spear he has smitten me down upon my knees; and they have run upon me with one accord. 
&lt;br /&gt;
12 For the Lord has delivered me into the hands of unrighteous men, and thrown me upon the ungodly.
&lt;br /&gt;
13 When I was at peace he distracted me: he took me by the hair of the head, and plucked it out: he set me up as a mark.
&lt;br /&gt;
14 They surrounded me with spears, aiming at my reins: without sparing me they poured out my gall upon the ground

Chapter XX (20)
26 And let all darkness wait for him: a fire that burns not out shall consume him; and let a stranger plague his house.
&lt;br /&gt;
27 And let the heaven reveal his iniquities, and the earth rise up against him

Chapter XXVI (26)
13 And the barriers of heaven fear him, and by a command he has slain the apostate dragon

Chapter XXIX (29)
1 And Job continued and said in his parable,

Chapter XXXVIII (38)
1 And after Elius had ceased from speaking, the Lord spoke to Job through the whirlwind and clouds, saying,

36 And who has given to women skill in weaving, or knowledge of embroidery

Chapter XXXIX (39)
5 And who is he that sent forth the wild ass free? and who loosed his bands?
&lt;br /&gt;
6 whereas I made his habitation the wilderness, and the salt land his coverts.

26 And does the hawk remain steady by thy wisdom, having spread out her wings unmoved, looking toward the region of the south?
&lt;br /&gt;
27 And does the eagle rise at thy command, and the vulture remain sitting over his nest,. 
&lt;br /&gt;
28 on a crag of a rock, and in a secret place?
&lt;br /&gt;
29 Thence he seeks food, his eyes observe from far. 
&lt;br /&gt;
30 And his young ones roll themselves in blood, and wherever the carcasses may be, immediately they are found.

Chapter XL (40)
16 He lies under trees of every kind, by the papyrus, and reed, and bulrush. 
&lt;br /&gt;
17 And the great trees make a shadow over him with their branches, and so do the bushes of the field.

20 But wilt thou catch the serpent with a hook, and put a halter about his nose? 
&lt;br /&gt;
21 Or wilt thou fasten a ring in his nostril, and bore his lip with a clasp?

24 And wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or bind him as a sparrow for a child?

Chapter XLI (41)
5 Who will open the doors of his face? terror is round about his teeth

22 He makes the deep boil like a brazen caldron; and he regards the sea as a pot of ointment, 
&lt;br /&gt;
23 and the lowest part of the deep as a captive: he reckons the deep as his range. 
&lt;br /&gt;
24 There is nothing upon the earth like to him, formed to be sported with by my angels. 
&lt;br /&gt;
25 He beholds every high thing: and he is king of all that are in the waters.

Chapter XLII (42)
8 Now then take seven bullocks, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and he shall offer a burnt-offering for you. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will only accept him: for but his sake, I would have destroyed you, for ye have not spoken the truth against my servant Job.
&lt;br /&gt;
9 So Eliphaz the Thaemanite, and Baldad the Sauchite, and Sophar the Minaean, went and did as the Lord commanded them: and he pardoned their sin for the sake of Job.

11 And all his brethren and his sisters heard all that had happened to him, and they came to him, and so did all that had known him from the first: and they ate and drank with him, and comforted him, and wondered at all that the Lord had brought upon him: and each one gave him a lamb, and four drachms’ weight of gold, even of unstamped gold.

17 And Job died, an old man and full of days: and it is written that he will rise again with those whom the Lord raises up.

==History==
{{see also|Global spread of the printing press}}

In 1477 [[William Caxton]] in [[Westminster]] printed ''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers|The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophres]],'' considered "the first [[Colophon (publishing)|dated]] book printed in England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/printing/ |title=Printing in England from William Caxton to Christopher Barker: an Exhibition, November 1976 - April 1977 |publisher= [[University of Glasgow]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the book in the United Kingdom has been studied from a variety of cultural, economic, political, and social angles. The learned [[Bibliographical Society]] first met in 1892. In recent years influential scholars include [[Frederic Sutherland Ferguson]], [[Philip Gaskell]], [[Ronald Brunlees McKerrow]], and [[Alfred W. Pollard]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1664">'''CINOA''' (''Confédération Internationale des Négociants en Oeuvres d'Art'', or International Confederation of Art and Antique Dealers' Associations) is a [[Brussels]]-based international federation, founded in 1935, of [[antique]] and [[art]] dealers, representing five thousand dealers from thirty-two art and antique associations in twenty-two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia &amp; CIS, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the USA.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Membership is limited to associations which require their members to adhere to extremely strict quality and expertise standards. Dealers who are affiliated with CINOA through their art and antique trade associations often display the CINOA logo as support of the CINOA charter and guidelines.

The stated goals of CINOA are to:
* Encourage high ethical standards within the trade

'''''Canyon''''' is a 1959 painting by American artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-1010/abstract-exp-nyschool/ny-school/a/robert-rauschenberg-canyon|title=Robert Rauschenberg, Canyon|last=Folland|first=Tom|publisher=Khan Academy|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/works/165011|title=Canyon|date=21 December 2013|publisher=MOMA|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is one of his most celebrated and best known works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2005/robert-rauschenberg|title=Exhibition Overview|date=20 December 2005|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of his [[combine painting|combine paintings]], which incorporated elements of sculpture into canvas-based pieces. ''Canyon'' features a taxidermied eagle, a pillow, and other elements. 

''Canyon'' was subject to an ownership controversy after the death of its owner, [[Ileana Sonnabend]], which ultimately resulted in its donation to [[MoMA]].

==Materials==
Between 1954 and 1965, Rauschenberg created "combine paintings" which involved affixing sculptural elements to more typical canvases. Elements such as photographic images, clothing and newspaper clippings could be attached either by paint, with string, or by other means. Other examples of such paintings are ''[[Reservoir (Rauschenberg)|Reservoir]]'' and ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]''.

''Canyon'' features a taxidermied [[bald eagle]], a pillow attached with string, a paint tube, and various textiles. The eagle was given to Rauschenberg by [[Sari Dienes]], and formerly belonged to a [[Rough Rider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/01/24/diving-into-rauschenbergs-canyon|title=Diving into Rauschenberg’s Canyon|last=Kim|first=Hannah|date=24 January 2014|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324705104578151561581708972|title=The Illegal Eagle and a Baldly Grasping IRS|last=Gibson|first=Eric|date=2 December 2012|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership history==
The painting was originally owned by Ileana Sonnabend, an art dealer, until her death. She was a friend of Rauschenberg, and considered the piece to be one of her favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/arts/design/moma-gains-treasure-that-metropolitan-museum-of-art-also-coveted.html|title=MoMA Gains Treasure That Met Also Coveted|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|date=28 November 2012|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnabend's heirs were forced to donate the piece after the [[IRS]] established the piece's value at $65 million and charged the Sonnabends $29 million in taxes. However, due to the bald eagle attached to the canvas, sale of the painting is a felony; as such, the estate's appraisers had placed a value of $0 on the painting, so forcing the heirs to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/28/robert-rauschenbergs-canyon_n_2203680.html|title=Robert Rauschenberg's 'Canyon' Donated To MoMA (PHOTO)|last=Brooks|first=Katherine|date=28 November 2012|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before its donation to MoMA, the piece was displayed on and off at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], due to an earlier conflict between Sonnabend and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] over the piece, which forced Sonnabend to allow ''Canyon'' to be displayed publicly in order to keep it in her possession. Although MoMA ultimately won out, the Met also attempted to persuade Sonnabend's family to donate the piece to their institution.

''Canyon'' has been part of MoMA's permanent collection since 2012. After the work was accessioned, a show celebrating both it and Sonnabend titled ''Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New'' was held at MoMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/arts/design/ileana-sonnabend-ambassador-for-the-new-at-moma.html?_r=0|title=A Legendary Dealer’s Eagle Eye|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=19 December 2013|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The painting is featured in [[Eugene Lim|Eugene Lim's]] 2017 novel ''[[Dear Cyborgs]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16676">The '''celluloid ceiling''' is a [[metaphor]] for the underrepresentation of women in hiring and employment in [[Hollywood]]. The term reflects the metaphor of the "[[glass ceiling]]," which describes an invisible barrier that keeps a given demographic (typically women, although the term can apply to any [[protected group]]) from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy. [[Celluloid]] refers to the material used to make the [[film stock]] that was once used to make motion pictures. The term is usually applied to behind the screen workers only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1309&amp;context=jpur|title=A Sturdy Glass Ceiling:Representation of Women on Screen and Behind the Scenes of Hollywood’s Top 100 Films Throughout the Years|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=Fall 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Celluloid Ceiling'' Report ==
The celluloid ceiling is also the title of a series of reports created by Dr. Martha Lauzen at the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at [[San Diego State University]]. These reports have been compiled since 1998 to track employment statistics for women in Hollywood. The reports focus on behind the screen creative positions, also called above-the-line positions. These include: director, writer, producer, executive producer, editors, and cinematographers. As of 2018 the Center has yet to cultivate statistics on below-the-line (craft) positions. ''The Celluloid Ceiling'' reports have been produced since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/about-us/|title=About Us – Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017_Celluloid_Ceiling_Report.pdf The 2017 Celluloid Ceiling Report]'' tracked employment statistics for top 100, 250, and 500 grossing non-reissue Hollywood films. The delineation of top 100 films and top 500 films are recent additions to the Center's data collection; the most complete historical data for comparison is from the top 250 category. For the top 250 films the report found that women account for 18% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers employed. This breaks down as:

* 25% of producers
* 19% of executive producers
* 16% of editors
* 11% of writers
* 11% of directors
* 4% of cinematographers&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/research/|title=Research – Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistically, these numbers show that "only 1% of films employed 10 or more women in the above roles. In contrast, 70% of films employed 10 or more men."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Media and Social Change Initiative at the University of Southern California’s [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]] also reported on the state of women and minorities in the film industry in front of and behind the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-measure-women-film-annenberg/|title=The Herculean Effort Taken By One Group To Show Hollywood Is Sexist|date=2014-10-03|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their report, however, focuses mainly on gender representation on screen.[https://annenberg.usc.edu/sites/default/files/MDSCI_Gender_Inequality_in_600_films.pdf]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/inequality-women-race-sexual-orientation-movies?mbid=social_twitter|title=New Report Uncovers Staggering Inequality for Anyone Not Young, White, Straight, and Male in Hollywood|last=Robinson|first=Joanna|work=HWD|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working Conditions ==
While employment for women working behind the screen in Hollywood is statistically low, reports of hostile and discriminatory working conditions have been widely circulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/shit-people-say-to-women-directors-interview|title=Sexism in Hollywood May be Rampant, but Now There’s at Least a Place to Talk About It|last=Beggs|first=Scott|work=HWD|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/the-women-of-hollywood-speak-out.html|title=The Women of Hollywood Speak Out|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|date=2015-11-20|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/530140/transparent-creator-jill-soloway-on-the-all-out-attack-on-female-filmmakers|title=‘Transparent’ Creator Jill Soloway on the “All-Out Attack on Female Filmmakers”|date=2015-07-28|work=Flavorwire|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/24/arts/hollywood-diversity-inclusion.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=1|title=What It’s Really Like to Work in Hollywood (*If you’re not a straight white man.)|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the media company EPIX produced twelve short documentary films with leading directors and producers, both men and woman, articulating the many prejudices, stereotypes, and myths that face women working in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCV1Q2BIN2RRVd4ZGsw3JHNVPf1ooenx|title=The 4%: Film's Gender Problem - YouTube|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website ''[http://shitpeoplesaytowomendirectors.tumblr.com/ S*hit People Say to Women Directors (&amp; Other Women in Film)]'' has become a repository of stories describing the regularized harassment women in the film industry face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/04/shit-people-say-women-directors-blog-hollywood-sexism|title=Shit People Say to Women Directors blog spotlights Hollywood's blatant sexism|last=Moylan|first=Brian|date=2015-05-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intersection of harassment and working conditions was explicitly manifest during Hollywood's [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement, when multiple women described being harassed or abused by men during job interviews or while working in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/jeremy-piven-groping-entourage-set-cbs-wisdom-of-the-crowd-1202198720/|title=CBS “Looking Into” Jeremy Piven Sexual Assault Allegations By ‘Entourage’ Actress, HBO Also Responds|last=Andreeva|first=Dominic Patten,Nellie|date=2017-10-31|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-brett-ratner-allegations-20171101-htmlstory.html|title=Six women accuse filmmaker Brett Ratner of sexual harassment or misconduct|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tarantino-weinstein.html|title=Tarantino on Weinstein: ‘I Knew Enough to Do More Than I Did’|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html|title=Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories|title=From Aggressive Overtures to Sexual Assault: Harvey Weinstein’s Accusers Tell Their Stories|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ACLU/EEOC Investigation ==
Based on "A large body of statistical evidence reveals dramatic disparities in the hiring of women directors in film and television,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/05/read-the-aclus-letter-to-the-eeoc-citing-employment-discrimination-against-women-directors-203573/#!|title=Read: The ACLU’s Letter to the EEOC Citing Employment Discrimination Against Women Directors|last=Kang|first=Inkoo|date=2015-05-27|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California|American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Southern California]] and the Women's Rights Project of [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU National]] sent letters to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs asking that each entity open an investigation to the discrimination in hiring and underemployment of women directors in film and television. The fifteen page [https://www.aclusocal.org/filmequality letters], sent in May 2015, explicated five foundational roadblocks facing women directors:

*"studios’, networks’, and producers’ intentional and discriminatory failure to recruit, consider, and hire qualified women directors
*use of discriminatory recruiting and screening practices that have the effect of shutting women out, such as word-of-mouth recruiting and use of short lists on which women are under-represented;
*reliance on, and perpetuation of, sex stereotyping in hiring and evaluation of women;
*ineffective programs within the industry to increase hiring of women and people of color that do not lead to women getting directing jobs;
*lack of enforcement of internal industry agreements to increase the hiring of women and people of color."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/05/read-the-aclus-letter-to-the-eeoc-citing-employment-discrimination-against-women-directors-203573/#!|title=Read: The ACLU’s Letter to the EEOC Citing Employment Discrimination Against Women Directors|last=Kang|first=Inkoo|date=2015-05-27|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 the EECO began "contacting female directors to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-women-directors-discrimination-investigation-20151002-story.html|title=The Hollywood gender discrimination investigation is on: EEOC contacts women directors|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 it was reported that the EEOC was in discussions with all major Hollywood studios to resolve systemic discrimination of women directors in hiring and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/hollywood-studios-female-directors-eeoc-investigation-1201912590/|title=EEOC: Major Studios Failed To Hire Female Directors; Lawsuit Looms|last=Robb|first=David|date=2017-02-15|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the EEOC investigation concerned women directors, changes in hiring and employment practices can impact women in Hollywood across positions.

== Advocacy to End the Celluloid Ceiling ==
A number of organizations have taken actions to highlight the contributions of women directors and advocate for their hiring. [[Vulture.com|Vulture]] released an [http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/100-women-directors-hollywood-should-be-hiring.html expansive list of 100  working women directors] available for hire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/100-women-directors-hollywood-should-be-hiring.html|title=100 Women Directors Hollywood Should Be Hiring|date=2015-11-02|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular blog [https://cinema-fanatic.com/ Cinema Fanatic] chronicled the process of spending a year watching only films directed or co-directed by women, while challenging others to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cinema-fanatic.com/a-year-with-women/|title=A Year With Women|date=2015-01-10|work=the diary of a film history fanatic|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign took off on Twitter with the #AYearWithWomen and helped to start critical dialogue and increase awareness around a much wider-variety of women directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/07/female-directors-pick-their-favorite-films-made-by-women-186320/|title=Female Directors Pick Their Favorite Films Made by Women|last=Lattanzio|first=Ryan|date=2015-07-09|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;A similar campaign is currently promoted by [[Women in Film Los Angeles]]. Called #52FilmsByWomen, the group asks the public to pledge to watch a film directed by women every week for one year; they currently have over 13,000 commitment pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womeninfilm.org/52-films/|title=52 Films By Women  –  Women In Film|website=womeninfilm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Film Los Angeles has also partnered with the [[Sundance Institute]] "launched Female Filmmakers Initiative to foster gender parity for women behind the camera."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womeninfilm.org/ffi/#allies|title=Female Filmmakers Intitiative  –  Women In Film|website=womeninfilm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint effort funds research on women's directorial hiring in Hollywood, resources for funding, and maintains an extensive list of allied organizations.

[[Film Fatales]]--a nationwide network of women directors dedicated to collaboration, support, and advocacy--released a highly publicized list of film directed by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/female-film-directors-put-together-a-list-of-must-see-movies-made-by-women|title=Female Film Directors Put Together a List of Must-See Movies Made By Women|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film Fatales also works with film festivals to help them expand their roster of women-directed entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/movies/the-film-fatales-collective-trains-a-lens-on-gender-inequality.html?_r=2|title=The Film Fatales Collective Trains a Lens on Gender Inequality|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-profit [[Alliance of Women Directors]], whose mission revolves around education, support and advocacy for women directors in the entertainment industry, provides events, workshops, networking, and [https://www.allianceofwomendirectors.org/career-advancement/in-house-shadowing/ in-house shadowing] programs for women directors.

'''Clay Figure Zhang''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|泥|人|張}}|s={{linktext|泥|人|张}}|p=Nírén Zhāng}}) is a famous [[folk art]] in [[Tianjin]], China. It was created by '''Zhang Mingshan''' ({{zh|t=張明山}}; 1826–1906) during the [[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang reign]] (1821–50) of the [[Qing dynasty]].

==Production Procedure==
Clay Figure Zhang is made of ripe [[clay]] which is pure puddle with little sand through the process of weathering, slurrying, filtrating, evaporating and adding cotton to rub up. It has the characteristics of viscosity. The side materials include wood, vine, lead, paper, flowers and so on. After completely drying, the clay figure is put into stove for firing. The temperature is up to 700 degree Celsius or so. After coming out of stove, the clay figure is polished and painted. It takes about 30 days or so to finish a piece of work.

==Artistic Attractiveness==
The images of Clay Figure Zhang vary from palace maids in costume, historic figures, religious figures, and modern figures to local customs. It is usually displayed indoor, on the shelf for example, because of its small size (usually 20&amp;nbsp;cm high). Therefore, it is also called shelf sculpture. Clay Figure Zhang has vivid realistic characteristics, and can portray the figures' personality and posture, pursue dissection structure, reasonable exaggeration, suitable acceptance and rejection, special applying to give attention to both shape and spirit and have great originality.

==Modern Development==
The Clay Figure Zhang Workshop, established in 1958, is engaged in the research of painted sculpture. It has 46 staff members, 5 creation rooms and 3 shops. Many of its art works have been awarded and are collected by domestic and abroad Art Gallery. In 2006, Clay Figure Zhang was listed as first grade national legacy of China.

{{main|Copyright}}
[[Copyright]] protection is available to the creators of a range of works including literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works. Recognition of [[fictional characters]] as works eligible for copyright protection has come about with the understanding that characters can be separated from the original works they were embodied in and acquire a new life by featuring in subsequent works.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goldstein, ''Copyright: Principles, Law And Practice'' (OUP 1989)158.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
{{main|Copyright law of the United States}}

In the United States, in order to avail of copyright protection, a work must be [[Threshold of originality|original]] that is, it must involve an element of creativity,&lt;ref&gt;F''eist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Services Co.'', 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991). &lt;/ref&gt;  and must be fixed in a tangible medium.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 102. &lt;/ref&gt;  Further, there can be no copyright in mere ideas and facts, but only in the unique expression of the same.&lt;ref&gt;''Mannion v. Coors Brewing Co''., 377 F.Supp.2d 444 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). &lt;/ref&gt;  [[Copyright Act of 1976|US Copyright Statute of 1976]] does not explicitly mention fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and their copyrightability is a product of common law. Historically, the Courts granted copyright protection to characters as parts of larger protected work and not as independent creations. They were regarded as ‘components in a copyrighted works’ and eligible for protection as thus. &lt;ref&gt;''Walt Disney Prods. v. Air Pirates'', 581 F.2d 751, 754 (9th Cir. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of characters as independent works distinct to the plot in which they were embodied came about only in 1930 in the case of [[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.|Nichols v Universal Pictures]].  &lt;ref&gt;45 F.2d 119, 121, 7 USPQ 84 (2d Cir. 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;
Following this, the American judiciary has evolved two main tests to determine whether a character in a work can be eligible for copyright protection.

=== Well-delineated test ===

In ''Nichols'', the Ninth Circuit Court denied protection to the plaintiff’s characters on the grounds that they were not “distinctly delineated”, but poorly developed. The plaintiff's characters of the Jewish gentleman and the poor Irish catholic girl he loved were regarded to be no more than mere ‘prototypes’. Justice Hand held that the less developed the character, the less the copyrightability of the same. Copyright protection shall therefore be enjoyed by a character provided it is well delineated. By applying this test, copyright protection was held to subsist in the character of [[Tarzan]] because it was found to be “sufficiently delineated.” &lt;ref&gt;''Burroughs v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.'', 683 F.2d 610 (2d Cir. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the character of [[Superman]] was held to found to be well delineated by virtue of embodying original literary expressions and incidents, and therefore deserving of copyright.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics, Inc. v. Burns Publications'', 111 F.2d 432; 434 (2d Cir. 1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this approach, a three-step test is required to be followed. Firstly, the character must possess physical and conceptual attributes. Secondly, the character must be “sufficiently delineated” to be identified as the same character across multiple occasions. He must therefore show consistent traits.  Lastly, the character must be “especially distinctive” and “contain some unique elements of expression.&lt;ref&gt;''Halicki Films, LLC v. Sanderson Sales &amp; Mktg.'', 547 F.3d 1213, 1224 (9th Cir.2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The consistency of a character's traits and attributes is considered as the key factor for  whether the character qualifies for copyright protection. &lt;ref&gt;''DC Comics v. Towle'', 989 F. Supp. 2d 948 (C.D. Cal. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Story being told test ===

The other approach propounded by the Ninth Circuit Court as laid down in ''Warner Bros. v. Columbia Broadcast Systems'' &lt;ref&gt;216 F.2d 945, 950 (9th Cir. 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; is that a character can avail of copyright protection only if it “constitutes the story being told”. In this case, the character in question- Sam Spade of the [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|Maltese Falcon]] detective novel was held to be a “mere vehicle” for carrying the story forward, and thus no copyright protection was afforded to it. Also known as the ''Sam Spade Test'', this approach does not allow for copyrightability if the character is a “mere chessman in the game of storytelling.”&lt;br /&gt;

On the other hand, if the character is central to the story, then it will be copyrightable. In the case of ''Universal City Studios v. Kamar Industries''&lt;ref&gt;217 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1162 (S.D. Tex. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; this test was applied to hold that E.T was a distinctive character around whom the story in the movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T the Extra Terrestrial]]'' revolved. Therefore, the copyright in E.T was held to be enjoyed by Universal Studios, and the defendants were held liable for a violation of the Studios’ copyright by the manufacturing and sale of goods under the title ‘E.T Home Phones’.

The American judiciary has followed both these tests. There have also been a number of instances where the Court has used both the tests in its analysis. For instance, in ''[[Anderson v. Stallone|Anderson v Stallone]]'',&lt;ref&gt;11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  it was held that the character [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] played by movie star [[Sylvester Stallone|Sylvestor Stallone]] in the eponymous movie franchise had come to be identified with certain physical traits and mannerisms that qualified as a well delineated character. Further, this ‘highly developed’ character was held to constitute the story being told. Similarly, the character of [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] was awarded copyright protection on the grounds of being both sufficiently delineated as well as central to the story being told. &lt;ref&gt;''Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer v. American Honda'', 900 F. Supp. 1287 (C.D. Cal. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the character had been played by multiple actors was not held to be relevant since the characteristics associated with Bond had remain consistent across sixteen films.

=== Visual and literary characters ===

Copyright protection is available to both characters that have been solely described in writing, as well as characters depicted in a visual or graphic form.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Schreyer, 'An Overview Of Legal Protection For Fictional Characters', 6 CYBARIS IP L. Rev. Vol. 51 (2015) available at http://open.mitchellhamline.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&amp;context=cybaris&lt;/ref&gt;  What is required is that the character in question possesses original or a set of distinctive traits, and visual representation is not an essential. If the literary character is not depicted in a visual form, and has only been described in writing in a few lines, then the character cannot enjoy copyright.&lt;ref&gt;''Olson v. Nat’l Broad. Co''., 855 F. 2d 1446, 1452–53 (9th Cir. 1988). &lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, where the characters, like [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson]] are found to be distinctive enough, they are held to be subject matter of copyright, even if they are merely in written form.&lt;ref&gt;''Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate Ltd''., 755 F.3d 496, 503 (7th Cir. 2014). &lt;/ref&gt;  Copyright protection may be granted to comic characters where the physical and conceptual characteristics find unique expression in graphic from.&lt;ref&gt;''Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates'', F.2d 751 (9th Cir. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;

=== Components of character’s identity ===

Copyright protection may also be afforded to the individual components of a character’s identity. For instance, copyrightability was granted to the glove worn by the protagonist in the movie ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' on the grounds that it helped identify the character, and therefore enjoyed a distinct protection separate from the character.&lt;ref&gt;''New Line Cinema v. Russ Berrie'', 161 F. Supp. 2d 293, 302 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). &lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the superhero [[Batman]]’s car the [[Batmobile]] was held to be protectable by copyright on account of the fact that firstly it had a set of distinctive traits, and secondly these traits could be separated from the utilitarian functions of the car and be represented in pictorial, sculptural and graphic form.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Comics'' Supra 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stock characters ===

The ''[[Scènes à faire|scenes a faire]]'' doctrine holds that those scenes or aspects that are indispensable to the story or are standard expressions cannot be copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;''Alexander v. Haley'', 460 F.Supp 40 (S.D.N.Y. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  This limitation also applies to fictional characters.&lt;ref&gt;''Gaiman v. McFarlane'', 360 F.3d 644, 659 (7th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, stock characters or archetypical and hackneyed elements are disqualified from protection by virtue of the fact that they are not unique in their expression.  &lt;ref&gt; ''Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.'', 268 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Copyright infringement|Infringement]] ===

In cases of copyright infringement of a fictional character, a two-step test developed by the American Courts has to be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Spahn, 'The Legal Protection of Fictional Characters', 9 U. MIAMI ENT. &amp; SPORTS L. REV. 331 (1992) available at: http://repository.law.miami.edu/umeslr/vol9/iss2/6. &lt;/ref&gt;  Firstly, it must be established that the character in question is capable of being copyrighted. Secondly, it must be demonstrated that there has been an infringement of this unique expression. &lt;ref&gt;''Zambito v. Paramount Pictures'', 613 F.Supp. 1107, 1111-12 (E.D.N.Y. 1985), aff'd, 788 F.2d 2 (2d Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The delineation test and the story being told tests as explained above are used to determine the copyrightability of the character, and the Court must check whether the same is precluded from being afforded protection by virtue of applicability of the scenes a faire doctrine. Following this, the actual infringement is to be decided by comparing the original and allegedly infringing work for “[[Substantial similarity|substantial similarities]]” in appearance, as well as in personality traits. &lt;ref&gt;''United Artists v. Ford Motor Co''., 483 F. Supp. 89, 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Other sources of protection ===

Protection of fictional characters may also be derived from certain alternative sources in American law.&lt;br /&gt;

'''[[United States trademark law|Trademark Law:]]''' Trademark rights may be enjoyed in a fictional character and can be enforced as such. To determine the infringement of the trademark it must be shown that the fictional character has acquired a “secondary meaning”, and that there is a likelihood of confusion to be caused to the public by the defendant’s mark which is deceptively similar to the original.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal City Studios v. Nintendo Co''., 746 F.2d 112, 115 (2d Cir. 1984). &lt;/ref&gt;  Characters such as [[Mickey Mouse]] have been held to have acquired such a secondary meaning and protected under trademark law.&lt;ref&gt; ''Walt Disney'' Supra 18&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''[[Personality rights#U.S. states that recognize rights of publicity|Right to Publicity]]:''' This right traces its origins in the tort of [[Privacy law|privacy]] and is the right to prevent others from commercially exploiting one’s name and likeness. The portrayal of the [[Marx Brothers|Marx brothers]] as characters in a play was held to be an infringement of their right to publicity.&lt;ref&gt;''Groucho Marx Prods. v. Day and Night Co''., 523 F.Supp. 485, 492-3 (S.D.N.Y.), rev'd on other grounds, 689 F.2d 278, 287 (2d Cir. 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''[[Trademark dilution|Dilution:]]''' Yet another remedy with its roots in trademark law is that of dilution. Under the [[Trademark dilution|doctrine of dilution]], the plaintiff can seek relief for whittling away of the value of character. This doctrine has been applied for protection of fictional characters including that of Superman. In ''DC Comics v. Unlimited Monkey Business'', &lt;ref&gt;598 F.Supp. 110 (N.D. Ga. 1984). &lt;/ref&gt; the defendants’ costumes were found to present a likelihood of dilution of the plaintiff’s trademark in the [[Superman in film|Superman]] character. &lt;br /&gt;

'''[[Misappropriation]]:''' In order to argue for misappropriation of fictional characters, the plaintiff must demonstrate that firstly, there has been an investment of substantial amount of time and effort by him, secondly, the defendant has appropriated the product of such investment, and thirdly, such appropriation has caused loss to the plaintiff. &lt;ref&gt; ''Spahn'' Supra 24 &lt;/ref&gt; The action of taking the plaintiff’s news bulletins and selling to its competitors was held to be a case of misappropriation.&lt;ref&gt;''International News Service v. Associated Press,'' 248 U.S. 215 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
{{main|Copyright law of India}}

Section 13 of the [[Copyright law of India|Indian Copyright Act, 1957]] allows for copyright in original literary, artistic, musical and dramatic works, as well as in sound recordings and cinematography films. The statute  does not recognise fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and protection for the same is derived from judge-made law. &lt;br /&gt;

The first instance where this issue was brought into light was in the case of ''Malayala Manorama v VT Thomas''. &lt;ref&gt;AIR 1989 Ker 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kerala High Court held that the defendant owned the copyright in his cartoon characters that he had created before entering into the plaintiff’s employment. &lt;br /&gt;

Subsequently, the Delhi High Court in ''Raja Pocket Books v Radha Pocket Books''&lt;ref&gt;1997 (40) DRJ 791. &lt;/ref&gt; found that the plaintiff’s copyright in his comic character the herpetologist ‘Nagraj’ had been infringed by the defendant’s character ‘Nagesh’ based on the semantic and phonetic similarities in their respective characters’ names, as well as in their visual representations and conceptual characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;
 
However, the Court in ''VT Thomas'' did not discuss independent copyright in characters as this case was concerned with the issue of ownership of copyright. &lt;ref&gt;Shan Kohli, 'Can Literary Characters Be Copyrighted?: Criticism Of The “Story Being Told” Test And The Indian Status –II' SPICY IP (April 14 2016) available at https://spicyip.com/2016/04/can-literary-characters-be-copyrighted-a-reformulation-of-the-especially-distinctive-test-ii.html. &lt;/ref&gt; Further, the comparative analysis in ''Raja Pocket Books'' to arrive at a conclusion of infringement was undertaken by the Court without firstly stating that copyright subsisted in the plaintiff’s character.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Therefore, in India, it can be implied that copyright protection is available to fictional characters, but the judiciary is yet to lay down any criteria for availing this protection.&lt;ref&gt;Inika Charles, 'Copyright-ing Fictional Characters: Bombay HC Permits Release of ‘Rangoon’'SPICY IP (March 6 2017) https://spicyip.com/2017/03/copyright-ing-fictional-characters-bombay-hc-permits-release-of-rangoon.html. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
 
=== Alternate protection ===

In India, recourse can be had to [[Indian trademark law|trademark law]] which recognises that fictional characters enjoy goodwill, and provides relief for cases of ‘character merchandising’. Character merchandising has been defined as involving the exploitation of fictional characters by licensing these fictional characters in the case of ''Star India Private'' ''Limited vs Leo Burnett (India) Private Ltd''.&lt;ref&gt;2003 (2) BomCR 655. &lt;/ref&gt;  A prerequisite for character merchandising is that the character to be merchandised must have gained some public recognition, independently of the original product in which it appears. In this case, the characters in the plaintiff’s were found not have acquired an independent recognition as a commodity, and therefore the suit for character merchandising by the defendants failed.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5220">'''Design by committee''' is a disparaging term for a project that has many designers involved but no unifying plan or vision.

==Usage==
The term is used to refer to suboptimal traits that such a process may produce as a result of having to compromise between the requirements and viewpoints of the participants, particularly in the presence of poor leadership or poor technical knowledge, such as needless complexity, internal inconsistency, logical flaws, banality, and the lack of a unifying vision.  This democratic design process is in contrast to autocratic design, or [[design by dictator]], where the project leader decides on the design. The difference is that in an autocratic style, members of the organizations are not included and the final outcome is the responsibility of the leader.

The term is especially common in technical [[parlance]]; it legitimizes the need and general acceptance of a unique [[systems architect]] and stresses the need for technical quality over political feasibility. The proverb "[[wikt:too many cooks spoil the broth|too many cooks spoil the broth]]" expresses the same idea.

The term is commonly used in [[information and communications technology]], especially when referring to the design of languages and technical standards, as demonstrated by [[USENET]] archives.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://groups.google.co.uk/groups/search?safe=off&amp;q=%22design+by+committee%22&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=1&amp;as_maxm=1&amp;as_maxy=1993 Occurrences of "Design by committee" in Google Groups USENET archives, 1981–1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a technical decision said to be a typical result of design by committee is the [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) cell size of 53 bytes. The choice of 53 bytes was political rather than technical.&lt;ref&gt;D. Stevenson, "Electropolitical Correctness and High-Speed Networking, or, Why ATM is like a Nose", [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Asynchronous-Transfer-Networks-Yannis-Viniotis/dp/0306444860 Proceedings of TriCom '93], April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[ITU-T|CCITT]] was standardizing ATM, parties from the United States wanted a 64-byte payload. Parties from Europe wanted 32-byte payloads. Most of the European parties eventually came around to the arguments made by the Americans, but France and a few others held out for a shorter cell length of 32 bytes. A 53-byte size (48 bytes plus 5 byte header) was the compromise chosen.

The term is also common in other fields of design such as graphic design, architecture or industrial design. In automotive design, this process is often blamed for unpopular or poorly designed cars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/10/AR2005061002188.html Biggest Automaker Needs Big Changes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example described as naming by community was a school near [[Liverpool]] formed by the merger of several other schools: it was officially named the "Knowsley Park Centre for Learning, Serving Prescot, Whiston and the Wider Community" in 2009, listing as a compromise all the schools and communities merged into it.&lt;ref name="Knowsley school to have one of “longest names in the world”"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Ben|title=Knowsley school to have one of “longest names in the world”|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/knowsley-school-one-longest-names-3455658|website=[[Liverpool Echo]]|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name lasted seven years before its headmistress, who called the name "so embarrassing"&lt;ref name="Can a new drive change the fortunes of schools in one of Britain’s most deprived areas?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boffey|first1=Daniel|title=Can a new drive change the fortunes of schools in one of Britain’s most deprived areas?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/13/education-schools-liverpool-knowsley|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cut it to simply "[[Prescot School]]".&lt;ref name="The making of an education catastrophe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cobain|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Cobain|title=The making of an education catastrophe – schools in Knowsley were dubbed 'wacky warehouses'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/29/knowsley-education-catastrophe-a-levels-merseyside|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowsley’s schools letters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lessons to be learned from Knowsley’s schools (letters)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/06/lessons-to-be-learned-from-knowsleys-schools|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aphorisms==
One maxim is that ''a camel is a horse designed by committee''; this phrase has appeared in use in the United States as early as the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Downtown''' is the central business district for [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[California]]. Located in the heart of the city, Downtown Bakersfield is easily accessible from all its other parts. It is also reemerging as the center of Bakersfield’s arts, culture and entertainment sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/growth/x1029066010/A-new-energy-brewing-downtown 'A new energy' brewing downtown]. The Bakersfield Californian.  February 18, 2010.  Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown contains several of the cities major theaters, sporting complexes, museums, and historical landmarks.

What is considered to be “downtown” Bakersfield varies. In order to define Downtown Bakersfield, it is important to first define the Central Bakersfield region. Starting from the north and traveling clockwise, Central Bakersfield is bounded by the Kern River, Union Avenue, [[California State Route 58|State Route 58]], and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]]. Most people (including the Downtown Business Association) define downtown Bakersfield as the region bordered by 24th Street (SR 178), Union Avenue (SR 204), California Avenue, and "F" Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/dtba/CathyFlyerMapNEWtrolley.pdf Downtown Dining] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719121407/http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/dtba/CathyFlyerMapNEWtrolley.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}. Downtown Bakersfield Business Association. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other people extend the boundaries east to State Route 99 and north to Golden State Avenue (SR 204). Some people consider all of Central Bakersfield to be “downtown Bakersfield.”

Unlike most cities of similar size, Bakersfield does not have a towering skyline. There are few tall buildings in Downtown Bakersfield, such as the Bank of America Building (10 stories), the Bakersfield Marriott Hotel (9 stories), and The Padre Hotel (8 stories). The shops and cafes that line the Downtown streets feature a variety of dining and shopping opportunities. Visitors to Downtown Bakersfield can find souvenirs, antiques, local art work, and even natural baby products. Notable attractions in Downtown Bakersfield include the Rabobank Arena, the McMurtrey Aquatic Center, the Bakersfield Museum of Art, the historic Fox Theater, the exquisitely renovated The Padre Hotel, and a nightlife district centered on 19th Street and Wall Street Alley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakersfieldcarealestate.biz/Small_Town_Feel_In_A_Big_City.asp|title=About Downtown Bakersfield|work=numerous sources|accessdate=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727185106/http://www.bakersfieldcarealestate.biz/Small_Town_Feel_In_A_Big_City.asp|archivedate=2013-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Districts==
Bakersfield has always had some districts located downtown. Recently, as part of a redevelopment effort, others are being created.

===Arts District===
{{main|Arts District, Bakersfield}}

[[File:2009-0726-CA-Bakersfield-ThePadre.jpg|thumb|right|The Padre Hotel building, renovated and reopened in 2010, has been a longtime landmark in Downtown Bakersfield.]]
'''The Arts District''' is one of the newer districts to be defined in Downtown Bakersfield. It is roughly bordered by 21st Street, Chester Avenue, 17th Street, and "G" Street. Theaters in the district include the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield)|Fox Theater]] (20th St. and H St), Stars Theater (Chester Ave. and 20th St) and Spotlight Theater (19th St. and H St). In addition, several art galleries are located around the intersection of 19th Street and Eye Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/artscouncil/ArtsCultureMap.pdf Arts and Culture District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719121521/http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/artscouncil/ArtsCultureMap.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}. The Arts Council of Kern. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts District is also home to the historic The [[Padre Hotel]], which has been remodeled and reopened as a boutique hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepadrehotel.com/ Home Page]. The Padre Hotel. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The district has also begun holding [[First Friday (public event)|First Friday]] which showcases galleries and allows for street vendors on the first Friday of every month in support of local artists.

===Civic Center===
{{main|Civic Center, Bakersfield}}
'''Civic Center''' is the center of government for both the [[Bakersfield, California|City of Bakersfield]] and the [[Kern County, California|County of Kern]]. It is roughly bordered by Truxtun Ave, Q St, BNSF railroad yard, and H St. Major government buildings include [[Bakersfield City Hall]], County of Kern Administrative Building, [[Kern County Hall of Records|hall of records]], Superior Court, and Municipal Court.

Although structures representing the center of government, such as City Hall and the Court House are located there, growth has resulted in many services being moved to other places throughout the city. Also, many state and federal services are also placed in locations outside of the Civic Center.

Civic Center has also become one of Bakersfield’s sport centers. Civic Center also houses the [[Rabobank Theater and Convention Center]] (formerly known as the Civic Auditorium). This is the largest theater and convention facility in the city. It is also conveniently located next to the Marriott Convention Hotel. The [[Rabobank Arena]] (formerly known as the Centennial Garden), is a large indoor multipurpose arena.&lt;ref&gt;Alten, Jennifer.

Bakersfield Ice Sports. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education District===
{{main|Education District, Bakersfield}}
'''Education District''' is the center of education institutions that are located Downtown. Currently five institutions have a campus or a satellite campus in the district. The Education District is roughly bordered by 24th St, Q St, 20th St and Chester Ave.

===Mill Creek===
{{main|Mill Creek, Bakersfield}}
'''Mill Creek''' is another one of Downtown’s newer districts, and is still being developed. When fully completed, Mill Creek will consist of a mixture of both low and high density residential, commercial and retail. The redevelopment area is defined to be Golden State Avenue, Union Avenue, California Avenue, and "Q" Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfieldcity.us/cityhighlights/state_of_city_2008/2008_powerpoint_presentations/dkunz-millcreek.pdf Mill Creek, A Downtown Master Plan]. City of Bakersfield. Page 2. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Running through the center of Mill Creek is the [[Mill Creek (Bakersfield)|Mill Creek Linear Park]]. This runs along the manmade Kern Island Canal, which has been redesigned to have the look of a natural river.

A major attraction in the area is the [[Bakersfield Museum of Art]]. The [[Beale Memorial Library]], which is the headquarters for the Kern County Library System, is also located in the Mill Creek. Another important structure is the [[Bakersfield (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station]], which is Bakersfield’s rail link to the [[San Joaquin Valley]].

==Other Neighborhoods and Districts==
The following are neighborhoods and districts which are near to Downtown Bakersfield. Some people consider them to be a part of Downtown.

===Buck Owens Boulevard===
[[File:Bakersfield CA - sign.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bakersfield Sign]].]]
Formerly named Pierce Road, Buck Owens Boulevard was renamed in 1998 in honor of long-time Bakersfield resident and [[country music]] legend [[Buck Owens]], who died in 2006.&lt;ref name="About Buck Owens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck.html|title=About Buck Owens|work=Buck Owen's Crystal Palace|accessdate=4 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707215828/http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck.html|archivedate=7 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buck Owens Boulevard runs north/south, parallel to Highway 99, between Rosedale Highway/24th Street in Bakersfield, and Airport Drive in [[Oildale, California|Oildale]]. Buck Owens Boulevard is located near [[Beach Park (Bakersfield)|Beach Park]] and is the heart of Bakersfield's Country Music scene.&lt;ref name="About Buck Owens"/&gt; The main attractions in the area are the original [[Bakersfield Sign]] (formerly located at intersection of California and Union Ave.) and the [[Buck Owens Crystal Palace]] a unique museum, store, concert hall, and restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buck Owens' Crystal Palace |url=http://www.buckowens.com/index2.html |accessdate=9 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023011142/http://www.buckowens.com/index2.html |archivedate=23 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westchester===
The '''Westchester''' neighborhood is just west of Downtown Bakersfield, although some people consider it to be part of Downtown. Westchester is bounded by the [[Kern River]], "F" Street, BNSF Railroad Yard and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]] (or Oak Street).&lt;ref&gt;Waldner, Erin [http://www.bakersfield.com/entertainment/local/x726008486/Living-in-Westchester Living in Westchester]. The Bakersfield Californian. September 26, 2006. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Westchester is a mostly residential neighborhood. The neighborhood is known for large shady trees and historic homes built between the 1900s and 1960s. Main points of interest include the [[Kern County Museum]] (with the [[Beale Memorial Clock Tower]]), and [[Sam Lynn Ballpark]].

=== Oleander-Sunset ===

The '''Oleander-Sunset''' [[Suburb]]s  is located in [[List_of_neighborhoods_in_Bakersfield#Central_Bakersfield_.28Downtown.29|central Bakersfield]] and sits on the southern end of downtown Bakersfield. The ''Oleander-Sunset Area'', consist of two neighborhoods the '''''Lowell Community''''' and the '''''Oleander Community''.'''

The Oleander neighborhood is original bounded by:  California Avenue, H Street, Freeway 58, and Oak Street. Traditionally, the Lowell neighborhood Community is bounded by California Avenue, Union Avenue, State Route 58, and H Street.

==Transportation==
{{further|Transportation in Kern County}}
[[File:2009-0726-CA-Bakersfield-GarcesCircle.jpg|thumb|right|Garces Circle.]]
Being located in the heart of Bakersfield, getting to and from Downtown is relatively easy. [[California State Route 178|State route 178 freeway]] ends at the eastern edge, and provides connection to the northeast. [[California State Route 99|State route 99]] is approximately 1/2 miles west, and provides north/south connection to the rest of the city. Golden State Ave ([[California State Route 204|state route 204]]), as a freeway ends at the north edge of downtown, and provides access to the northwest.

Downtown also is the primary hub for all modes of intracity and intercity transportation, except air travel. [[Golden Empire Transit]] (GET) provides transportation to Greater Bakersfield from the downtown transit center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getbus.org/maps Maps]. Golden Empire Transit. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kern Regional Transit]] provides intercity transportation from GET downtown transit center or Amtrak station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.kern.ca.us/roads/kernregionaltransit.asp Kern Regional Transit Schedule]. Kern County Roads. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amtrak]] provides rail connection to the San Joaquin Valley north of Bakersfield, and several bus routes to points west, south and east of the city (with tickets that travel by train at least once).&lt;ref&gt;''San Joaquin Timetable''. Amtrak. Effective date: October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although traveling to downtown is relatively easy by car, traveling through it is more difficult. Since SR 178 freeway and Golden State Avenue (SR 204 freeway) stop at the edge of Downtown, cars must travel on surface streets to connect to additional freeways. This has created heavy traffic on major connecting arterial roads, especially on 23rd Street and 24th Street, which are one-way in each direction. This is especially a problem for cars traveling from the northeast to the southwest, since 23rd/24th St. is the most direct route between those two points.

{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}

'''Fan art''' is artwork created by [[Fan (person)|fan]]s of a work of [[fiction]] and derived from a series [[Character (arts)|character]] or other aspect of that work. As [[fan labor]], fan art refers to artworks that are neither created nor (normally) commissioned or endorsed by the creators of the work from which the fan art derives.

A different, older meaning of the term is used in [[science fiction fandom]], where fan art traditionally describes ''original'' (rather than derivative) artwork related to [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]], created by fan artists, and appearing in low- or non-paying publications such as [[semiprozine]]s or [[science fiction fanzine|fanzine]]s, and in the art shows of [[science fiction conventions]]. The [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|Best Fan Artist]] has been given each year since 1967 for artists who create such works. Like the term [[fan fiction]] (although to a lesser extent), this traditional meaning is now sometimes confused with the more recent usage described above.

==Forms==

Fan art can take many forms. In addition to traditional paintings and drawings, fan artists may also create web banners, avatars, graphic designs or web-based animations, as well as photo collages, posters, artistic representations of quotes from a work or artistic representations of characters in new contexts or in contexts that are in keeping with the original series.

The broad availability of [[digital image processing]] and the Internet has greatly increased the scope and potential reach of fan art. U.S. TV producer [[Bryan Konietzko]] wrote in 2013:
:"I remember back in the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender|Avatar]]'' days [2005–2008]… the typical fanart we would get would be a charming, childish crayon drawing stuffed in an envelope. Nowadays on ''[[The Legend of Korra|Korra]]'', I take a skewed screenshot with my phone, post it, and shortly thereafter someone un-skews it, crops it, separates the character levels, clones the background, “[[Ken Burns effect|Ken Burns]]” it with a multilevel slide, animates the characters blinking and talking, tints it, and makes a [[Animated GIF|GIF]] out of it, that I then see on the same phone with which I took the original picture. Times they are a-changin’…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Konietzko|first=Bryan|title=I remember back in the Avatar days…|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/46687253373/i-remember-back-in-the-avatar-days-the-typical|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Due to the nature of fan art, there are many debated facets of the topic. One of the most prominent controversies surrounding fan art is its validity as art at all. Some people in the art community believe that since fan art is based on someone else's original content, it doesn't deserve to be considered "art." Their definition of [[art]] entails that it must be an expression of the artist, and artwork that is derived from already-existing content cannot fulfill this. A counter-argument to this statement is that fan artists add their own individual style to the art they create. Although the concept may derive from someone else's work, the content equally as individualistic and expressive as any other form of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fanlore.org/wiki/Fanart|title=Fanart - Fanlore|publisher=[[Fanlore]]|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Copyright ==
{{see also|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2010}}

===United States===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
The legal status of derivative fan made art in America may be tricky due to the vagaries of the United States [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]. Generally, the right to reproduce and display pieces of artwork is controlled by the original author or artist under [[17 U.S.C.]] § 106. Fan art using settings and characters from a previously created work could be considered a [[derivative work]], which would place control of the copyright with the owner of that original work. Display and distribution of fan art that would be considered a derivative work would be unlawful.

However, American copyright law allows for the production, display and distribution of derivative works if they fall under a [[fair use]] exemption, 17 U.S.C. § 107. A court would look at all relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether a particular use qualifies as fair use; a multi-pronged rubric for this decision involves evaluating the amount and substantiality of the original appropriated, the transformative nature of the derivative work, whether the derivative work was done for educational or noncommercial use, and the economic effect that the derivative work imposes on the copyright holder's ability to make and exploit their own derivative works. None of these factors is alone dispositive.

American courts also typically grant broad protection to [[parody]], and some fan art may fall into this category. This has not explicitly been adjudicated with respect to fan art, however. Moreover, while parody is typically afforded protection under § 107, a court must engage in a fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry for each work.

The '''Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization''' is a document signed in 2004 by a number of non-profit organizations, scientists, academics and other individuals urging the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) to focus on the needs of developing countries with respect to [[intellectual property]] legislation.

The authors and signatories believe that the "world is facing a crisis in the governance of [[knowledge]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]", in particular due to unequal access to vital [[medicine]]s and [[education]], anticompetitive [[economics|economic]] practices, concentration of [[ownership]], technological measures such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), the fair compensation of authors and creators, and the locking up of the [[public domain]] by [[private property|private]] interests.

The Declaration criticises WIPO for embracing "a culture of creating and expanding monopoly privileges, often without regard to consequences", and calls for the organization to shift its focus from intellectual property as an end in and of itself, to a means for benefiting [[All humanity|humanity]]. In particular, it calls for a moratorium on the now-common practice of harmonizing intellectual property legislation throughout the [[developing world]] to the laws as they exist in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].

In 2009 this resulted into the [[World_Intellectual_Property_Organization#Development_agenda|WIPO Development Agenda]], which incorporated some of the proposals.

&lt;!--Basic introduction; name, dates, why he was notable--&gt;
''' Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine'''  {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CH|KBE}} (14 May 1853 &amp;ndash; 31 August 1931), usually known as '''Hall Caine''', was a British novelist, dramatist, short story writer, poet and critic of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Caine's popularity during his lifetime was unprecedented. Writing fifteen novels on subjects of [[adultery]], divorce, [[domestic violence]], [[illegitimacy]], [[infanticide]], [[religious bigotry]] and [[women's rights]] he became an international literary celebrity, selling ten million books. Caine was the most highly paid novelist of his day. ''The Eternal City'' is the first novel to sell over a million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his books, Caine is the author of more than a dozen plays and was one of the most commercially successful dramatists of his time; many were [[West End theatre|West End]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions. Caine adapted seven of his novels for the stage. He collaborated with leading actors and managers, including [[Wilson Barrett]], [[Viola Allen]], [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], [[Louis Napoleon Parker]], [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]], [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]], and [[Arthur Collins (theatre manager)|Arthur Collins]]. Most of Caine's novels were adapted into [[Silent film|silent]] [[black and white]] films. [[A. E. Coleby]]'s 1923 18,454 feet, nineteen-reel film ''[[The Prodigal Son (1923 film)|The Prodigal Son]]'' became the longest commercially made [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Robertson|1985|p=35.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1929 film ''[[The Manxman]]'', is Hitchcock's last silent film.

&lt;!--Early life --&gt;
Born in [[Runcorn]] to a [[Manx people|Manx]] father and [[Cumbrian]] mother, Caine was raised in [[Liverpool]]. After spending four years in school, Caine was trained as an architectural draughtsman. While growing up he spent childhood holidays with relatives in the [[Isle of Man]]. At seventeen he spent a year there as schoolmaster in [[Maughold]]. Afterwards he returned to Liverpool and began a career in journalism, becoming a leader-writer on the ''Liverpool Mercury''. As a lecturer and theatre critic he developed a circle of eminent literary friends that he was influenced by. Caine moved to London at [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s suggestion and lived with the poet, acting as secretary and companion during the last years of Rossetti's life.  Following the publication of his ''Recollections of Rossetti'' in 1882, Caine began his career as a writer spanning four decades.

&lt;!--Politics --&gt;
Caine established his [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] in the Isle of Man in 1895, where he sat from 1901 to 1908 in the Manx [[House of Keys]], the lower house of its legislature. Caine was elected President of the Manx National Reform League in 1903 and chair of the Keys' Committee that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform. In 1929
Caine was granted the Freedom of the Borough of [[Douglas, Isle of Man]]. Caine visited Russia in 1892 on behalf of the persecuted [[Jews]]. In 1895 Caine travelled in the United States and Canada, where he represented the [[Society of Authors]]  conducting successful negotiations and obtaining important international copyright concessions from the Dominion Parliament.

&lt;!--Reception and legacy--&gt;
During the [[Great War]] (1914–1918) Caine wrote many patriotic articles and edited ''King Albert's Book'', the proceeds of which went to help Belgian refugees. In 1917, Caine was created an [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Officer of the Order of Leopold]] by [[King Albert I]] of Belgium. Caine cancelled many literary contracts in America to devote all his time and energy to the British war effort. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister [[Lloyd George]] for services as an Allied propagandist in the United States, [[King George V]] made him a [[Knight of the British Empire]] in 1918 and a [[Companion of Honour]] in 1922. Aged 78 Caine died in his home at [[Greeba Castle]] on the Isle of Man.

==Early life and influences==

===Early days===
[[File:Birthplace-of-Hall-Caine.jpg|thumbnail|Hall Caine's birthplace, 29 Bridgewater Street, Runcorn]]
Thomas Henry Hall Caine was born on 14 May 1853 at 29 Bridgewater Street, [[Runcorn]], [[Cheshire]], England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Runcorn Urban District Council|title=Council meeting minutes|date=7 September 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=house group=nb/&gt; the eldest of six children of John Caine (1825–1904) and his wife Sarah Caine (née Hall, (1828–1912)). Sarah was born in [[Whitehaven]], Cumbria, and descended from an old [[Quaker]] family of Ralph Halls, china manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunday Times Pert WA|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57751027|date=16 February 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biographical Sketch|publisher=Shefield Weekly Telegraph|date=28 May 1887|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOTL.uk {{!}} Whitehaven Pottery – History, Cumbria|url=https://wotl.uk/whitehaven-pottery/|website=WOTL.uk|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After living for many years in Cumbria the Hall family moved to Liverpool where Sarah, a seamstress, met and married John. As her husband was a member of the [[Anglican Church]] and not a Quaker she lost her connection with the [[Society of Friends]]. Throughout her life she retained the [[Testimony of simplicity|Quaker simplicity of life and dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manx Quarterly, #12|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57751027|date=June 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Caine, a [[blacksmith]], came from the [[Isle of Man]]. In the absence of work he emigrated to [[Liverpool]], where he trained as a [[Smith (metalwork)|shipsmith]]. At the time of Caine's birth, he was working temporarily in [[Port of Runcorn|Runcorn docks]]. Within a few months the family were back in [[Liverpool]], where Caine spent his childhood and youth. They rented rooms at 14 Rhyl Street, [[Toxteth]], convenient for [[Liverpool Docks]] and within a small [[Manx people|Manx]] expat community. By 1858 they had moved to number 21.  Early in 1862 they moved to 5 Brougham Street where Caine attended Windsor Street Wesleyan School, and in January 1865 the family moved round the corner to 2 Coburg Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=15–16.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brougham group=nb/&gt;

During his childhood Caine was occasionally sent to stay with his grandmother, Isabella, and uncle, William, a butcher-farmer, in their thatched cottage at [[Ballaugh]] on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=3–29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandmother nicknamed him 'Hommy-Beg', [[Manx language|Manx]] for 'Little Tommy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island has a long history of [[folklore]] and superstition, passed from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|1891|pp=1–18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing this tradition Grandmother Caine passed on her knowledge of local myths and legends to her grandson, telling him countless stories of fairies, witches, witch-doctors and the evil eye while they were sat by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|pp=21–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Caine was nine he lost two of his young sisters within a year. Five year old Sarah developed [[Hydrocephalus|hydrocephaly]] after a fever. Fourteen month old Emma died in [[convulsion]]s brought on by [[whooping cough]] she caught from him and his brother John. Caine was to be sent to the Isle of Man to recover from his illness and grief. He was put on a boat to [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] by his father, with a label pinned on his coat and assurances that his uncle would meet him. A fierce storm occurred preventing the ferry from reaching land. Caine was rescued by a large rowing boat. He would later draw on this experience when writing the scene in [[The Bondman (novel)|The Bondman]] in which Stephen Orry is cast ashore there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=17–18.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caine family belonged to the Baptist Church in Myrtle Street, Liverpool, presided over by the charismatic [[Hugh Stowell Brown]], a Manxman and brother of poet [[Thomas Edward Brown]]. Brown's public lectures and work among the poor made him a household name in Liverpool. Caine participated in the literary and debating society Brown had established. While Caine was very young he became well known and highly regarded by the people of south Liverpool. There he was in great demand as a speaker, having the ability to engage an audience from his first word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|pp=26–27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studying the works of the [[Lake Poets|Lake School of Poets]], and the best writers of the eighteenth century, Caine combined this knowledge with his own ideas of perfection, and went on to develop his level of eloquence to [[Public speaking|oratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the age of ten Caine was educated at Hope Street Unitarian Higher Grade School in Caledonia Street, Liverpool, becoming head boy in his last year there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=18–19.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D – K|url=http://www.liverpool-schools.co.uk/html/d_-_k.html|website=www.liverpool-schools.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this he attended St. James's School and for several years afterwards continued his education attending evening classes at Queen's College, [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys|Liverpool Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Author of The Christian |work= Liverpool Mercury|date=9 October 1899|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent many hours on his own avidly reading books, notably at [[Liverpool Central Library|Liverpool's Free Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine also experienced what he described as the ‘scribbling itch’ for writing. He produced essays, poems, novels and overview histories with little thought of them being published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=35.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with all 19th century towns Liverpool was unsanitary. In 1832 there had been a cholera epidemic. As panic and fear of this new and misunderstood disease spread, eight major riots had broken out on the streets along with several smaller uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burrell|first1=Sean|last2=Gill|first2=Geoffrey|title=The Liverpool Cholera Epidemic of 1832 and Anatomical Dissection—Medical Mistrust and Civil Unrest|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|date=1 October 2005|volume=60|issue=4|pages=478–498|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jri061|url=http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/4/478.abstract|language=en|issn=0022-5045}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 a second epidemic occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A walk through the Cholera Districts of Liverpool|url=http://www.old-merseytimes.co.uk/Cholera.html|work=www.old-merseytimes.co.uk|publisher=Liverpool Journal|date=24 November 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Caine was thirteen the third outbreak of cholera occurred in July 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The cholera and the burial of cholera victims, 1866|url=http://www.old-merseytimes.co.uk/choleraburial1866.html|via=www.old-merseytimes.co.uk|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=20 August 1866}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memories of that time were to stay with him, the deaths, the large volume of funerals and prayer meetings in open spaces that were happening all around him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apprentice and schoolmaster===
At fifteen, after leaving school, he was apprenticed to John Murray, an architect and [[Surveying|surveyor]] in Lord Street, Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was a distant relative of [[William Ewart Gladstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 December [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|1868, the day of the general election]] when Gladstone was to be elected as Prime Minister, Caine was running to offices in Union Court, belonging to Gladstone's brother, with telegrams announcing the results of the contests all over the country. Caine was breaking the news of great majorities before Gladstone had time to open his telegrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine was to meet Gladstone on another occasion when he was on Gladstone's estate at [[Seaforth, Merseyside]]. The surveyor-in-chief had not appeared one morning and a fifteen year old Caine took his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=34.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine had left a lasting impression on Gladstone, as two years later Caine had a letter from Gladstone's brother saying the Prime Minister wished to appoint him steward of the Lancashire Gladstone estates. Caine declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caine's maternal grandparents had lived with the rest of his family while they were growing up in Liverpool. His grandfather, Ralph Hall, died in January 1870, when Caine was seventeen.  In the same year of his life Caine was reunited with William Tirebuck, a friend from his school days, when the business of their masters brought them together. United in their interest in literature, they made a juvenile attempt to establish a monthly manuscript magazine, assisted by Tirebuck's sister. Tirebuck was editor, printer, publisher and postman; Caine was principal author.  One of the magazine's contributors inherited a small fortune which he invested. About ten thousand copies were printed, followed by a delayed issue no.2. After this venture Tirebuck returned to his position as junior clerk in a merchant's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tirebuck|1903|pp=x – xiii.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=36–38.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ramsey St. Maughold Church Isle of Man England.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The centre of Maughold Village, Isle of Man]]

Suffering from what he would describe as "the first hint of one of the nervous attacks which even then beset me", and later as "the first serious manifestation of the nervous attacks which have pursued me through my life",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=38.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine quit his job with Murray and, arriving unannounced, went to live with his uncle and aunt, James and Catherine Teare in [[Maughold (parish)|Maughold]] on the Isle of Man.

Teare was the local [[schoolmaster]], and as Caine was to learn, ill with tuberculosis.  Caine became his assistant teaching in the schoolhouse. Finding their accommodation in part of the schoolhouse was crowded Caine camped in a nearby ''tholtan'', a half-ruined cottage.  Using his stonemason skills, taught to him by his grandfather Hall, he restored and lived in the cottage.  On the stone lintel above the door he carved the name Phoenix Cottage and the date 8 January 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=21.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=38–39.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by Teare, after he had written to reassure Caine's parents that he might one day be able to make a living as a writer, Caine wrote anonymous articles for a local newspaper on a wide range of religious and economic questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=38–39.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ruskin]] had started his [[Guild of St George]] and began expressing his ideas in his new monthly series, ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'', written as a result of his feelings regarding the acute poverty and misery in Great Britain at the time. Rumours of undergraduates, following Ruskin's ideas, digging the ground outside [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], reached Caine. He was inspired by Ruskin to begin writing denunciations of the [[social system]] and of the accepted interpretation of the [[Western Christianity|Christian faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=39.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine was to become 'an eager pupil and admirer' of Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later became a frequent visitor to Ruskin's [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] home, [[Brantwood]].

Following the death of James Teare in December 1871, Caine carved a headstone for the grave.  After officially taking his place as schoolmaster, he also performed the extra unpaid services his uncle had provided, "such as the making of wills for farmers round about, the drafting of agreement and leases, the writing of messages to banks protesting against crushing interest, and occasionally the inditing of love letters for young farm hands to their girls in service on farms that were far away". Later he would draw on this material to use in his writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=40.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 1872, he had a letter from Murray his master, the architect, which said "Why are you wasting your life over there? Come back to your proper work at once." Caine was on his way back to Liverpool within a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=43.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalist and theatre critic===
In April 1872, at the age of eighteen, Caine was back home in Liverpool where he set about applying his knowledge, gained working in the drawing office, into articles on architectural subjects, and subsequently published in the Builder and Building News. These were Caine's first works published for a national audience. The articles caught Ruskin's attention and he wrote words of encouragement to Caine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=44–46.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to be published, he offered his services, without payment, as a theatre critic to a number of Liverpool newspapers, which were accepted. He used the pseudonym ‘Julian’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=43.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Henry Irving played Hamlet, his intention to play the part differently to any other actor was known to Caine and he contributed many articles on the subject to various papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=34.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of Shakespeare and the Bible from his earliest years were his ‘chief mental food’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=36.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had become more absorbed by literary studies he was not content with reading Shakespeare's plays, so he was reading all of the most notable playwrights of the Elizabethan age and "he began to make acquaintance with the dramatists’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=36.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 1872 Caine wrote his first play.  The Charter was an adaptation of [[Charles Kingsley]]'s novel [[Alton Locke]], but as an unknown writer he could not get it staged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Waller |2006|p=753.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Partly from the failure of faith in myself as a draughtsman and partly from a desire to be moving on"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=48.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine left his employment with Murray and joined the office of Richard Owen and later Wainwright and Son. For a few years he was general assistant to a builder, James Bromley who became his friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Christian|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=9 October 1899|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with William Tirebuck and George Rose, his friends from school days,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=31.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine applied himself to establishing Liverpool branches of the Shakespeare Society, and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=50.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called their own organisation Notes and Queries Society and held their meetings at the prominent [[Liverpool Royal Institution|Royal Institution]], Colquitt Street. Caine was president of the society and their meetings were reported in the Liverpool newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Local News|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=5 February 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘Notes’ were often provided by [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tirebuck|1903|p=xv.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 1874 [[Henry Irving]] wrote to Caine agreeing to his request to use his portrait in ''Stray Leaves'' a new monthly magazine he was launching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stoker|1906|p=115.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=44.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as critic of the Liverpool ''Town Crier'', Caine attended the first night of ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], on 31 October 1874, with Irving in the title role. Caine was enthralled by Irving's performance and after his enthusiastic review was published in the newspaper, he was asked to reprint it as a broad-sheet pamphlet, as it was of such a high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stoker|1906|p=115.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caine's first short story ''Max Wieland'' was published in the ''Liverpool Critic'' around 1874. A year later Caine became dramatic critic of the ''Spectator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Day to Day in Liverpool|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|date=14 May 1918|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine's long narrative poem, ''Geraldine'', appeared in print in March 1876. It was a completion of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] unfinished poem ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=44.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=44.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caine family had moved into a larger house in 1873, at 59 South Chester Street, [[Toxteth]], where Caine shared a bedroom with his younger brother John, a shipping clerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=32.}}&lt;/ref&gt; John contracted [[tuberculosis]] which he passed to his brother. By 1875 Caine had permanent lodgings in [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], spending weekends there "for the sake of his health".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=52.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine became increasingly unwell from the beginning of January 1877. In April the same year John, died from [[tuberculosis]], aged 21. Dangerously ill, Caine was terrified of suffering the same fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=55.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recovered, but the disease left him with permanent lung damage, and throughout his life he had attacks of [[bronchitis]]. In his 1913 novel ''The Woman Thou Gavest Me'', he describes Mary O’Neil dying of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=353.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The shadow of a crime by Hall Caine.jpg|thumb|right|1895 Poster advertising ''The Shadow of a Crime''.]]
[[Manchester City Council|Manchester Corporation]] had covertly been buying land for building the proposed [[Thirlmere Aqueduct]], intended to supply water to the city. When discovered, it outraged the local community. [[Thirlmere]], close to the centre of the Lake District, in an area, not only celebrated in the poetry of early conservationist [[William Wordsworth]] and fellow Lake poets, but also used as a summer residence by writers, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritvo|2009|pp=12, 102.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to damming the lake at [[Thirlmere]] to form a reservoir, the first environmental group, Thirlmere Defence Association was formed in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritvo|2009|pp=1–6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was supported by the national press, Wordsworth's son and John Ruskin. Caine, incensed at what he perceived as a threat to his beloved Cumbria, joined the movement, initiating a Parliamentary petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=62.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirlmere was to be the setting for his novel ''The Shadow of a Crime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to his lecture ''The Supernatural in Shakespeare'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notes and Queries. Professor Dowden on the study of Shakespere|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=10 July 1878|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; given in July 1878, in a meeting chaired by [[Edward Dowden|Professor Edward Dowden]], [[Matthew Arnold]] wrote him a long letter of praise. He was also praised by [[John Keats|Keats]]'s biographer, [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Lord Houghton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=58.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lecture appeared in ''Colburn's New Monthly Magazine'' in August 1879,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Magazines For September|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=3 September 1879|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving presided at a meeting of the Liverpool Notes and Queries Society in September 1878.  At Irving's invitation, he travelled to London to attend Irving's first night at the Lyceum Theatre under his own management, presenting his new production of ''Hamlet'' with [[Ellen Terry]] as ''[[Ophelia]]'' on 30 December. It was at this time that Caine was introduced to Irving's business manager, [[Bram Stoker]], who was to become one of his closest friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foulkes|2008|p=55.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoker was subsequently to dedicate his famous novel ''[[Dracula]]'' to Caine, under the [[nickname]] 'Hommy-Beg'.

In 1879 Caine edited a booklet of the papers presented to the Notes and Queries Society by [[William Morris]], [[Samuel Huggins]] and [[J. J. Stevenson|John J. Stevenson]] on the progress of public and professional thought on the treatment of ancient buildings which was described as "‘well worth reading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Literary Notices,|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=22 February 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Restoration of Ancient Buildings. Papers by William Morris, Samuel Huggins, J. J. Stevenson, etc., edited by T. H. Hall Caine. Royal Institution, Liverpool. 1877. Crown 8vo. 50 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1879 [[National Association for the Promotion of Social Science|Social Science Congress]] held in [[Manchester Town Hall]], Caine read his paper ''A New Phase of the Question of Architectural Restoration''. He spoke of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]], its purpose, actions and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Social Science Congress|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=7 October 1879|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine had joined the society the previous year and remained a member for the rest of his life. One of the society's founders was [[William Morris]].

===Friendship with Francis Tumblety===
As a young man of 21 Caine encountered the self-proclaimed ‘Great American Doctor’, [[Francis Tumblety]], aged 43, after he set up at 177 Duke Street, Liverpool, offering herbal cure-all [[elixir]]s and [[Patent medicine]]s to the public, which he claimed were secrets of the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]].  Tumblety posed at various times in his life as a surgeon, an officer in the federal army, and a gentleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Curtis Jr.|2001|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He always followed his name with "M.D." and used the title ‘Doctor’, without the supporting qualifications for which he was fined in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=93.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1874, Tumblety was announcing his arrival in Liverpool by advertising in local newspapers, later including testimonials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|pp=111–112.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the death of Edward Hanratty in January 1875, the same night he took a spoon of medicine supplied by Tumblety, and action taken by William Carroll to sue Tumblety for £200 after allegedly publishing a false testimonial, Tumblety fled to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|pp=113–114.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many newspapers reported the stories and in the wake of this adverse publicity, Tumblety recruited Caine to edit his biography.  Late January Tumblety wrote requesting Caine to obtain a quote for printing ten thousand copies in [[Liverpool]], telling of being betrayed by a supposed friend, and praising Caine for his genuine friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=116.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Riordan |2009|p=148.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Caine forwarded his letters, he wrote on 1 February discussing the upcoming biography and enclosed a letter supposedly originating from the [[Isle of Wight]], by [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=114.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day the first advert for the upcoming [[pamphlet]] appeared in the ''Liverpool Mercury''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Riordan |2009|p=148.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tumblety changed lodgings, initially missing an urgent telegram from Caine indicating there was a problem with the publication.  His response was to tell Caine to stop until he saw the proofs.  Tumblety offered to pay for Caine to visit him in London to discuss the pamphlet, his letter dated 16 February indicating Caine had taken up the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Riordan |2009|p=149.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told a friend that his visit to Tumblety was "arduous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A spate of correspondence relating to the publication ensued, Tumblety supplying Caine with names of notable people to be included in the pamphlet, along with money for printing and advertising.  Tumblety later wrote of disputes with the printer.  Claiming to be too ill to send money, he sent Caine a printer's bill for payment. Tumblety had hired an assistant who read the proofs to him.  The pamphlet entitled ''Passages from the Life of Dr Francis Tumblety'', and the fourth of Tumblety's biographies, was published in March 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=116.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tumblety wrote to Caine in April 1875 that he was contemplating manufacturing his pills in London, and required a partner to share the profits, telling Caine to approach Liverpool chemists as proposed outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=118.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine had declined a further invitation to London, but Tumblety persisted with his invites to join him in London, later made by telegram, additionally inviting him on a planned trip to [[America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Riordan |2009|p=150.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Around the time Alfred Thomas Heap was hanged in [[Kirkdale, Liverpool|Kirkdale Gaol, Liverpool]], for an abortion-related death, Tumblety, who had been arrested in 1857 for selling abortion drugs, disappeared. Caine made enquiries as to his whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=120.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Indian Herb Doctor – Curious Case|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=12 October 1857|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Briefly Tumblety set up offices in Union Passage, [[Birmingham]]. His correspondence turned menacing, demanding money from Caine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=123.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tumblety left London for New York City in August 1876.  Failing to entice Caine to join him, he followed months later with a pleading letter from San Francisco, after which there is no record of any further contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=128.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Riordan |2009|p=152.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rossetti years===
Caine delivered a series of three lectures on [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s work and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] movement between November 1878 and March 1879, afterwards combining them into an essay which was printed in ''Colburn's New Monthly Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=63, 68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine sent a copy of the magazine to the poet Rossetti, who by that time had become a virtual recluse and was "ravaged by years of addiction to chloral and too much whisky".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=69–71.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hall Caine and Rossetti.png|thumb|Dante Gabriel Rossetti walking to and fro while Hall Caine reads his lectures out loud during their stay in a farmhouse at St John's in the Vale, Cumbria.]]
Rossetti wrote his first letter to Caine on 29 July 1879. This letter was the first of nearly two hundred in quick succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|pp=59–62.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Around this time Caine's father was badly injured in an accident at work and Caine took responsibility for supporting his parents and siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=103.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early in 1880 he wrote ''Stones Crying Out'', a short book on the restoration of old buildings. Two of the chapters were papers he had read at the [[Social Science Congress]] and [[Liverpool Central Library|Liverpool Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|2000|pp=25, 36, 110.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rossetti introduced Caine to [[Ford Madox Brown]], who was at the time working on ''[[The Manchester Murals]]''. Following his visit to write an article on Brown's frescoes in July 1880 they became friends. On a later visit Caine accepted Brown's invitation to sit for one of the figures while he was working on ''The Expulsion of the Danes from Manchester'', the third fresco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=88, 105;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another visit he modelled for ''Crabtree watching the Transit of Venus A.D. 1639'', the fifth fresco to be painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=152.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine and Rossetti eventually met in September 1880 when Caine visited Rossetti in his home at 16 [[Cheyne Walk]], [[Chelsea, London]], where he lived "in shabby splendour".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=91.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strain of overworking was affecting Caine's health and in 1881, deciding to focus on his literary career, he left his job at Bromley &amp; Son and went to [[St John's in the Vale]], Cumbria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=148.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before long Rossetti wrote that he too was ill and asked Caine to go to London planning to return to Cumbria with him. By the time Caine arrived in London Rossetti had changed his mind and instead Caine became Rossetti's housemate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=150.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in September, persuaded by friends and family Rossetti spent a month with Caine at St John's in the Vale, accompanied by [[Fanny Cornforth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waugh|2011|p=228.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there, Caine recited a local myth to Rossetti. The myth was to become the inspiration for his first novel ''The Shadow of a Crime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=176–177.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also delivering weekly lectures in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=173, 190.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caine negotiated the acquisition of Rossetti's largest painting ''[[Dante's Dream|Dante's Dream of the Death of Beatrice]]'' by Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The sale of ‘Dante's Dream at the time of the Death of Beatrice’ to the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool: The Correspondence between D.

After Rossetti  "had an attack of paralysis on one side", his medical adviser, Mr John Marshall, recommended a change of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rossetti|1895|pp=384, 387.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architect [[John Pollard Seddon|John Seddon]] offered Rossetti the use of Westcliffe Bungalow at [[Birchington-on-Sea|Birchington]], Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rossetti|1895|pp=388, 395.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine eventually persuaded Rossetti to make the trip to Birchington, and they both arrived on 4 February 1882, accompanied by Caine's sister and Rossetti's nurse. Caine stayed with Rossetti until Rossetti's death on Easter Sunday, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1882|pp=294–295.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=88, 141.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Start of literary career==
[[File:Hall Caine Vanity Fair 2 July 1896.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''The Manxman''&lt;br&gt;Caine as caricatured in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', July 1896&lt;/center&gt;]]
From 1882 Caine was employed as a leader-writer on the ''Liverpool Mercury'' and was given free rein as to the subject and number of articles he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=82.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=252.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him the opportunity to attend and review numerous first nights at the London theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=34.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review angered actor-playwright [[Wilson Barrett]] and he demanded a meeting with Caine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=255.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrett concluding his complaint added "I think you could write a play, and if someday you should hit on a subject suitable to me, I shall be glad if you will let me hear of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=37.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caine's ''Cobwebs of Criticism:  A Review of the First Reviewers of the Lake, Satanic and Cockney Schools'' was published in 1883. It began as a series of Liverpool lectures exposing unjustified reviews of poets [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Leigh Hunt|Hunt]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] that were written during their lifetimes&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waller|2006|p=133.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary Hall Caine.jpg|thumb|left|Mary Hall Caine by Alfred Ellis]]
[[File:Portrait of Hall Caine.jpg|thumb|left|Hall Caine, by H. S. Mendelssohn]]
Returning to London after Rossetti's death, Caine moved into 18 [[Inns of Chancery|Clement's Inn]], in July 1882, sharing rooms with his academic friend [[Eric Sutherland Robertson|Eric Robertson]], where they often hosted intellectual gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=153.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had evening meals delivered from a nearby coffee shop in [[Clare Market]], which were brought by two teenage girls; one being thirteen year old Mary Chandler, who was to eventually marry Caine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=258.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=153.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months later, Mary's stepfather, and the other girl's father confronted Caine and Robertson demanding marriage, claiming the girls had been ‘ruined’. According to Caine's biographer, nothing more than 'a bit of flirting' had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=153.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Age of consent#Reforms in the 19th and 20th century|age of consent]] for girls was thirteen, raised from twelve in 1875. Robertson married the older girl and moved to Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=154.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Refusing to marry, Caine went to Liverpool to deliver lectures, returning to London early December 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=155.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon Caine's return Mary's stepfather abandoned her at Clement's Inn. Caine's choices were to leave Mary on the street, marry or adopt her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=259.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until she could start school after the Christmas holidays Mary lived at Clements Inn, she had received little education as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=155.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine's visiting friends assumed he and Mary had married as Robertson had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=83.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=159.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary was sent to [[Sevenoaks]] where she stayed for six months being taught either at a private school or privately by a governess, financed by Caine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=159–160.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 1883, with enough money to last about four months Caine, accompanied by Mary, went to the [[Isle of Wight]] where he rented Vectis Cottage, close to the cliffs and sea near [[Sandown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|pp=82–83.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=168.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There he set to work writing his first novel ''The Shadow of a Crime''. Inspired by his Cumbrian heritage the plot was based on one of the oldest legends of the Lake District, told to him by his grandfather, Ralph Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|p=ix.}} Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, Shadow of a Crime&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jerome|1897|p=59.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=283.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he uses the [[Cumbrian dialect]] that he had listened to and spoke during his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|p=ix.}} Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, Shadow of a Crime&lt;/ref&gt; When he had finished he moved back to London. Living in rooms on the fourth floor of New Court, in [[Lincoln's Inn]], he re-wrote it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=88.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After running as a serial in the ''Liverpool Mercury'', Caine's novel was published in February 1885, by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]], and serialised in several newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=174–175.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation was immediately established, along with a foremost place among the novelists of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Illustrated London News|date=2 April 1887|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later invited to write the story of writing ''The Shadow of a Crime'', which after its appearance in ''the Idler'' was published in 1894 in ''My First Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=83.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the publication of Caine's first novel, Mary created a series of scrapbooks containing items relating to his public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=176.}} Now held in the Manx Museum, [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary and Caine's son, [[Gordon Hall Caine|Ralph Hall]], was born in their rented house Yarra, Worseley Road, [[Hampstead]] on 15 August 1884. The following month they moved to live in Aberleigh Lodge, Red House Lane, [[Bexleyheath]], next door to William Morris' [[Red House (London)|Red House]], where they remained until 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Globe|date=23 November 1889|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caine had many friends in London's elite artistic and intellectual circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=36.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a friend of Stoker and Irving for many years he became a regular at Irving's [[Beefsteak Club|Beefsteak Room]] gatherings at the Lyceum, presided over by [[Ellen Terry]], where he became acquainted with the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales (later Edward VII)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=164.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one supper, where the only other guest was composer [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], Caine breaking the rules, brought his son Ralph with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|pp=143–144.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make essential money and acquire exposure in America, disregarding the advice of his friends, Caine's short novel ''[[She's All The World To Me]]'', was published in New York, in 1885 by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]]. The first of his novels to be set on the Isle of Man. Under [[American copyright law]]s the book's copyright was forfeited to Harper and Brothers, a situation unforeseen by Caine, he was incensed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=165, 178.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was never released outside America.  Caine recycled much of the material from the book in his later works, particularly in ''The Deemster''. It is likely that the story is Caine's 1883 ''Liverpool Mercury'' weekly serial entitled ''Danny Fayle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=178.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time Caine and the Mercury's editor John Lovell attempted to publish the serial as a book but were unable to find a publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=165.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set in the contrasting locations of the Vale of Newlands in the Lake District and [[Victorian London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=93.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Son of Hagar'', Caine's third novel was written in 1885-86 and published in 1886 by Chatto and Windus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|p=vi.}} Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, Son of Hagar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=92.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Begun in collaboration with [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]], their partnership was discontinued early on after discovering they did not work well together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|p=vi.}} Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, Son of Hagar&lt;/ref&gt; Dealing with the theme of [[illegitimacy in fiction|illegitimacy]], Caine has written a story close to his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=181.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening scene is set in Victorian London police court where a girl is charged with attempted suicide after she and her illegitimate baby had been dragged from the Thames, a scene he could well have witnessed while working as reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=259–261.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Caine attempted to suppress ''A Son of Hagar'' from both of the Collected Editions of his novels. Licensed to Thomas Nelson in 1907 by Chatto, the novel was printed in the ''Nelson Library''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=178.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Mary and Caine travelled to Scotland to watch Irving when he was on tour in Edinburgh where they covertly married on 3 September under Scottish law by declaration before witnesses. Mary became a devoted wife, reading all his work, advising and criticising when appropriate and was his first secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=184,205.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of Caine's sonnets, ''Where Lies the Land!'' and ''After Sunset'', were included in [[William Sharp (writer)|William Sharp]]'s 1886 anthology ''Sonnets of this Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=William|title=Sonnets of this century|url=https://archive.org/details/sonnetsthiscent01shargoog|publisher=London, W. Scott, limited|accessdate=10 June 2017|date=1886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher [[Walter Scott]] engaged Eric Robertson, Caine's former roommate, to edit a series entitled ''Great Writers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=185.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Aware of the study Caine had already made of Coleridge, Robertson asked Caine to contribute a brief [[biography]] of the poet to the series. In three weeks Caine wrote ''Life of Coleridge'', published in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=120.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  November the same year ''[[The Deemster]]'' was published in three volumes by Chatto &amp; Windus. It was set in 18th century Isle of Man, where the title of [[Deemster]] is given to the Island's judges. The plot includes the story of a fatal fight, with the body being taken out to sea only to float back to land the next day. It ran to more than fifty English editions and was translated into every major European language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=55.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine sent a copy of the novel to [[Wilson Barrett]] as he suited the main character, then set to work adapting his novel into a stage version called Ben-my-Chree, Manx for 'Girl of my Heart'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=120.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irving, after reading the book, saw potential in it, himself playing the Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=48.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=348–349.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The play opened at the Princess Theatre on 17 May 1888 and ran for a profitable nine weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=47.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a popular staple on Barratt's provincial and international tours for several years afterwards and successfully produced by others to whom he licensed the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=47.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1905|p=121.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciative Caine acknowledged Barratt's substantial contribution by naming him co-writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=346.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First visit to Iceland===
The first title published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] was Caine's 1890 three-volume novel ''[[The Bondman (novel)|The Bondman]]'', a plot of revenge and romance set in the late 18th century Isle of Man and [[Iceland]]. It commences with the story of a seaman who marries the daughter of Iceland's Governor-General, abandoning her before the birth of their child.&lt;ref name="EliotRose2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliot|first1=Simon|last2=Rose|first2=Jonathan|title=A Companion to the History of the Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8Pfs146nUAC&amp;pg=PA343|accessdate=1 January 2013|date=2009-04-06|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405192781|page=343.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between June and November 1889 it was serialised in the ''Isle of Man Times'', ''General Advertiser'' and several provincial newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|pp=91,227.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by Mary, Caine made a research visit to Iceland in August 1889, during which he made a seventy-mile round day trip from [[Reykavik]] to [[Krysuvik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|pp=ix-x.}}Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, The Bondman&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Heinemann]] was so pleased with initial sales, eventually selling almost half a million copies, that he named his company's [[telegraphic address]] after the novel's main character, "Sunlocks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=202.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cumbria===
Caine leased Castlerigg Cottage in [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in 1888. The following year Caine bought Hawthorns out of part of his earnings from ''Ben-my-Chree''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sherard|1895|p=92.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorns was a small square-built stone house on the Penrith Road, a mile outside Keswick, overlooking [[Bassenthwaite Lake]] and Derwentwater.  Caine also rented a [[Pied-à-terre]] at Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London.  Hawthorns was close to Chesnut Cottage that [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] had rented in 1811 and [[Greta Hall]] home of the poets [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey|Southey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=192–193,196–197.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house had ten acres of land where Caine kept two ponies he had transported from Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Literary Gossip|work= The Globe|date=23 November 1889|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary learned to make butter and cheese. The Caines lived at Hawthorns for four years.

Around 1890 Caine published a magazine serial called ''Drink: A Love Story on a Great Question''. This was about the same time as [[Bram Stoker]] began his notes for his ''[[Dracula]]'' novel. Stoker and Caine were lifetime literary friends. They shared an interest in [[mesmerism]]. ''Drink'' contains a number of similarities to Stoker's novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skall|2016|p=296.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1906 ''Drink'' was published by [[George Newnes]], and illustrated by expatriate Italian American illustrator and painter [[Cyrus Cuneo]]. It was described in the ''Manchester Guardian'' as ‘a rather gruesome love story’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=314.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is of a girl who inherits a taste for alcohol from her father and is put on the road to recovery by hypnotic influence. Two hundred thousand copies of the book had been sold in England by the time the American edition was published by [[D. Appleton &amp; Company|Appleton]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hall Caine and Hypnotism.; A Pup's Philosophy|work=The New York Times|date=26 January 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=125.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning of ''Mahomet''===
Caine's ''Mahomet'' is a four-act historical drama based on the life of [[Muhammad]], the [[prophet]] of [[Islam]], written in 1890 for the actor-manager [[Henry Irving]].  In Autumn 1889 Irving presented a copy of [[Henri de Bornier]]'s new play ''Mahomet'' to Caine, translated into English by [[Bram Stoker]]'s wife, Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=107.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving had been granted the English rights by [[Jules Claretie]], director of France's [[Comédie-Française|Théâtre Français]] and he asked Caine to revise it for staging at the Lyceum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=49.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The French government stopped Bornier's play on 22 March 1890, partly due to the intervention of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|pp=115–120.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine called the play's plot "false to history, untrue to character, Western in thought and Parisian in sentiment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hall Caine, A Literary Causerie|work=The Speaker|date=4 October 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued with his own version that concentrated on Muhammad's flight from Mecca and his triumphant return from Medina years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=54.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes were handwritten by Caine and subsequently reviewed by Irving after Stoker had them typed. Reviewed pages were returned with Irving's edits and often Stoker's suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=114.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June a piece appeared in the French ''[[Journal des débats]]'' soon followed by a longer piece in ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' connecting Bornier's ''Mahomet'' with Irving's English production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=57.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdullah Quilliam|William Henry (Abdullah) Quilliam]] orchestrated protests. In common with Caine he was of Manx descent, raised in Liverpool and had visited Morocco. Converting to Islam, Quilliam set up Britain's first mosque and was made Sheikh al-Islam for the British Isles by Abdul Hamid II.  Rumour that the play would be produced in London caused unrest in Britain's Muslim communities, threatened British rule in parts of India and strained the nation's relations with the Ottoman Empire. It was banned by the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom]] in his capacity as licenser of stage plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=59.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lathom's intervention was unusual, illustrating the high level of concern by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=196.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine's completed play was accepted by [[Edward Smith Willard]] for production in America. Influenced by Renan's ''Life of Christ'' he spent the remainder of 1890 hastily writing his own version. Dissatisfied with the result he refused to publish the book, despite being offered three thousand pounds for it in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Sherard|1895|p=92.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morocco===
Caine travelled to [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]], for three weeks In March 1890, researching [[Muslim]] and [[Jewish]] life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=114.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disregarding the advice of British consular officials Caine explored the Kasbah alone on foot at all hours of the day and night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=209.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning to Tangier in Spring 1891 to pick up local colour for his next novel ''The Scapegoat'', he suffered an attack of [[malarial fever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Correspondence|work=Birmingham Daily Post|date=6 July 1891|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caine|first1=Hall|title=The Scapegoat|date=1899|publisher=P.F. Collier &amp; Son|location=New York|page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine became the house-guest of [[Ion Perdicaris]], who arranged Caine's nursing until he was sufficiently recovered to return to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pall Mall Gazette Office|work= Pall Mall Gazette |date=2 May 1891|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July of the same year ''The Little Manx Nation'' was published. It was originally delivered in the form of three lectures on the history of the Isle of Man which were given at the [[Royal Institution]], London on 22 and 29 January and 4 February 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Institution of Great Britain|work= St. James's Gazette |date=19 January 1891|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pall Mall Gazette Office|work= Pall Mall Gazette |date=5 February 1891|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is dedicated to Manx poet [[Thomas Edward Brown]], who supplied Caine with information on Manx legends and ballads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=212.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Scapegoat '' was written at Hawthorns immediately after Caine returned home from Morocco, while he was still impeded by malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caine|first1=Hall|title= The Scapegoat|date=1899|publisher=P.F. Collier &amp; Son|location=New York|page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; First serialised in ''The Illustrated London News '' between July and October 1891, and then in ''[[The Penny Illustrated Paper]]'' between October 1891 January 1892. In the story, little Naomi is deaf and dumb and blind. Her mother is dead. She lives with her father, in Israel's house. As Israel changes his ways to become a better person Naomi starts to regain her lost senses. The novel was published in two volumes in September 1891 by William Heinemann, and simultaneously in Europe, America and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Allen|1997|p=434.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in Morocco in the last years of the [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco|Sultan Abd er-Rahman]], it exposed [[anti-Semitic]] persecution and was described as a ‘scathing indictment of Moroccan tyranny’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Correspondence|work=Birmingham Daily Post|date=6 July 1891|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was praised by ‘the most intelligent and influential members of the respectable Jewish community in London’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Hall Caine's Mission to Russia|work=Illustrated London News|date=10 October 1891|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine's Connections with the [[British Jewish community]] extended back to Caine's youth. Novelist [[Israel Zangwill]], enlisted Caine in the [[Zionist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=139.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Scapegoat'' brought Caine a considerable correspondence, mainly because of its pro-Jewish stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=211.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Caine and Mary's second son, [[Derwent Hall Caine|Derwent]] was born on 12 September 1891.

===Mission to Russia===
Following the publication of ''The Scapegoat'', Caine was approached by [[Hermann Adler]], the Chief [[Rabbi]] and chairman of the Russo-Jewish Committee. Jews were fleeing Russia due to the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]] and resulting atrocities happening there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Hall Caine's Mission to Russia|work=Pall Mall Gazette|date=25 September 1891|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler, certain no [[Jew]] would be allowed entry, requested Caine go to Russia and Poland on behalf of the committee. Caine's plans to depart for Russia after Christmas 1891 were delayed until 15 June 1892 due to famine and riots there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=214–215,217.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine funded the trip himself, refusing subsidies offered by the committee. He carried Adler's letter, in [[Hebrew]], to present to the rabbis in the various towns on his journey, which "secured him everywhere a most hospitable reception" and for protection against the Russian authorities Caine carried a letter from [[Lord Salisbury]], then Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Sherard|1895|p=93.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine managed to visit several Jewish communities in the [[Pale of Settlement]] but got no further than the frontier towns as many were dying due to a cholera outbreak. Fearing he was to suffer the same fate he returned to London, in time to attend [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|
Lord Alfred Tennyson's]] funeral in October 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=222.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine remained in London after the funeral working on three novellas ''Cap'n Davey's Honeymoon'', ''The Last Confession'' and ''The Blind Mother'', published in 1893 as one volume entitled ''Cap'n Davey's Honeymoon''. The book was edited by and dedicated to Stoker. At his suggestion, the last part of the title story was rewritten and ''The Last Confession'' was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=222.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in Morocco, ''The Last Confession'' is based on Rossetti's blank-verse poem of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=125.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isle of Man===
For the purpose of writing [[The Manxman (novel)|''The Manxman'']] Caine rented [[Greeba Castle]] for six months, a [[Crenellation|castellated]] house in the Isle of Man overlooking the [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] to [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this book, published as one volume in August 1894 by Heinemann, that ended the outdated system of three-volume novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|p=vi.}} Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, The Manxman&lt;/ref&gt; It is the story of Pete, a fisherman, considered by Kate's father as too poor to marry her. Pete leaves to make his fortune, and is reported dead. Kate falls in love with Philip, Pete's cousin and friend. Pete returns, creating a dilemma. The character of Pete was based on the Peel fishermen Caine mixed with and Joseph Mylchreest, a Manxman who made his fortune diamond mining in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine took full advantage of the subsequent Press attention. He was photographed and interviewed for the monthly magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British sales of ''The Manxman'' totalled nearly 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into twelve languages, selling over half a million copies by 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=231.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in London in June and July 1984, Caine wrote a dramatic version of ''The Manxman'', with Philip as the main character. Caine offered it to [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], who refused it as being unlikely to appeal to the [[Haymarket Theatre]] audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Sherard|1895|p=94.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 1894, three weeks after the book was published, Wilson Barrett's adaptation opened at the [[Grand Theatre, Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=121.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine bought the Greeba Castle estate in 1896 with part of his earnings from ''The Manxman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|p=vi.}} Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, The Manxman&lt;/ref&gt; His rented London home, 48 Ashley Gardens, in one of five red-brick Victorian mansion blocks adjacent to [[Westminster Cathedral]], was changed to 2 [[Whitehall Court]] between [[Whitehall]] and the [[Victoria Embankment]].

Caine wrote a guidebook entitled ''The Little Man Island: Scenes and Specimen Days in the Isle of Man'' for the 1894 tourist season. Published by the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] it comprises a mixture of descriptions, pictures and advertising.  At the end of the 19th century the Isle of Man was a popular tourist destination, a result of the [[Wakes Week]]s, when Lancashire mills and factories closed for holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Belchem |2000|p=223.}} Volume 5&lt;/ref&gt; To meet growing demand the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] purchased new steamers to bring many thousands of tourists to Douglas from Liverpool. The Isle of Man Advertising Committee was set up in 1894 under the Advertising Rate Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Kermode |2001 |p=20.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of bankers, local businessmen and developers built new hotels, boarding houses and entertainment venues. They formed a Committee publicising the Isle of Man as a holiday resort, opening an office in London with Caine's brother in charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Norris |1947 |p=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Caine wrote the Deemster in six weeks at a boarding house on the Douglas esplanade he saw these developments. He believed that the Island's economic prosperity lay in developing this trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Norris |1947 |p=52.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Caine's novels set in the Isle of Man boosted the tourist trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=282.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tynwald Day]], the island's national day, became better known both in England and America because of his novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Norris |1947 |p=9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine and Greeba Castle became a visitor attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Norris |1947 |pp=15–16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruising around Great Britain aboard the Royal yacht, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] visited the Isle of Man, in August 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Advertiser|location= Adelaide WA|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4884865|date=2 October 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first British monarchs to set foot on Manx soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Belchem |2000|p=232.}} Volume 5&lt;/ref&gt; The King had read most of Caine's works and through reading them he wanted to visit the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The King in the Isle of Man,|work= The Bedfordshire Advertiser |date=29 August 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen enjoyed Caine's Manx novels and was interested to see where his characters lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=287.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal party enjoyed Caine's hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Lee |1927|p=111.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was invited to join the royal couple on their yacht and to accompany them on their tour of the island the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=289.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian copyright===
At a time [[Copyright law of Canada|copyrights in Canada]] were governed by British laws and legal framework the Canadian Government was attempting to enact their 1889 Copyright Bill.

===First visit to the United States and Canada===
Caine arrived in New York 25 September 1895, accompanied by his wife Mary and eldest son Ralph, where they were met by his New York publisher [[William Henry Appleton|William Appleton]], an active in the struggle for an [[international copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=242–243.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried with him a letter of introduction to the Government of Canada from Chamberlain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seville |2006|p=128.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the street he was mobbed by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stoker|1906|pp=141–142.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month Caine reached Canada, where he met with leading members of the publishing trade. He had long discussions with the Canadian Prime Minister [[Mackenzie Bowell]] and the Canadian Minister of Justice [[Charles Tupper]] in Ottawa. At the request of the Canadian Copyright Association Caine went to Toronto where he had talks with the Toronto publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seville |2006|p=129.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine resolved the dispute between the Canadian publishers, the Canadian Copyright Association and English authors. The proposed solution, that Canadian publishers would have the right to republish copyright works that had not been published in Canada within sixty days of publication elsewhere, was incorporated into the draft copyright bill. On 25 November 1895 Caine presented the draft bill at the Ottawa copyright conference where all parties agreed to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Full text of "Conference on the copyright question"|date=1896|publisher=Canada Dept of Agriculture|url=https://archive.org/stream/conferenceoncopy00cana/conferenceoncopy00cana_djvu.txt|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian authorities and publishers were satisfied with the proposal put forward from England as were the American authors and publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Mr Hall Caine and the Copyright Question|work= Birmingham Daily Post|date=12 December 1895|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill never became law, the 1889 Act was abandoned and a more flexible solution was found by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2010|p=252.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lamonde|2005|p=156.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second visit to the United States===
[[File:Portrait of Viola Allen.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''Viola Allen as Glory Quayle''&lt;br&gt;This portrait shows [[Viola Allen]] as she would have appeared in the prologue of ''The Christian'']]
Taking two years to write, Caine's novel ''The Christian'' was published by Heinemann in 1897. It is the first novel in Britain to have sold over a million copies&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{Citation | last = Allen| first = Vivien| title = Caine, Sir (Thomas Henry) Hall (1853–1931)| work = [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | origyear = 2004| year = 2011| url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32237| accessdate = 3 August 2013 }} ({{ODNBsub}})&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was inspired by Rossetti's verses ''Mary Magdalene At The Door Of Simon The Pharisee'', written for his painting, depicting a man trying to pluck back a woman about to enter the gates of heaven. Caine followed it with a lecture tour of Scotland, a one-man dramatic performance of his novelette ''Home Sweet Home''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=250–251.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Christian'' was serialised in Britain in the ''[[Windsor Magazine]]'' between December 1896 and November 1897 and in the United States in ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'' between November 1896 and January 1898.  Mainly set in Victorian London, it is the story of Glory Quayle, a young woman living an independent life who becomes an actress, and John Storm, who enters the priesthood. It was the first time that Caine had taken up [[the Woman Question]]. The character of John Storm is drawn from a composite of the Hon. and Rev.  James Adderley, an Anglican priest of Berkley Chapel, Mayfair, London, and [[George Stanton|Father Stanton]], who became an Anglican bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Adderley |1916|pp=176–177.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caine dramatised the book in 1896. His play was so popular with the public that the [[Daily Mail]] published it in a thick-paper, illustrated edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nichol|2009|p=190.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the play, travelling to New York where he went on to deliver a series of lectures and readings there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=71.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hall Caine and His Son|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2018/New%20York%20NY%20Morning%20Telegraph/New%20York%20NY%20Morning%20Telegraph%201898/New%20York%20NY%20Morning%20Telegraph%201898%20-%200185.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2017|work=The Sunday Telegraph|date=18 September 1898|location=New York|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viola Allen]] produced the play for the first time on the stage at [[Albany, New York]] on 25 September 1898. It opened at the [[Knickerbocker Theatre (Broadway)|Knickerbocker Theatre]] on 10 October 1898, running for twenty-one weeks in New York. Almost one thousand clergymen attended a matinee on 15 November 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Christian,|work= Indianapolis News |date=8 March 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Peteri |2003|pp=103–105.}}&lt;/ref&gt; George C.

Caine rejected both the money and the play. Barratt unsuccessfully sued Caine on the grounds that they had an agreement to collaborate on the dramatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=72.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Christian'' was first produced in England at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in October 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=269.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It failed after two months. Caine authorised a touring production with his sister Lily playing Glory Quayle and managed by her husband George Day which in 1907 was still continuously performed by up to three companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=73.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Finnish politician and writer [[Aino Malmberg]] sought aid from Caine on her country's behalf, he offered the Finnish rights to the [[Finnish National Theatre]]. Finland belonged to the Russian Empire and was actively seeking Independence. Malmberg translated Caine's works into Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=269.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
Caine and his wife, Mary, spent four winters in Rome, renting a house, 18 Trinità de' Monti, near the [[Spanish Steps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hall Caine in New York|work=Chicago Tribune|date=19 October 1902|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their visit between January and April 1901 Caine finished ''The Eternal City'', his greatest commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=82.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Caine's only novel to be first conceived as a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=271.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story begins in Rome in 1900 at the fictional Pope Pius X's [[Jubilee (Christianity)|jubilee celebrations]], at the height of the dispute between the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and the Italian state on the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] of the Church. David Rossi, a socialist and republican is accused of conspiring to assassinate the Italian king. He opposes Baron Bonelli, a corrupt prime minister. Bonelli tries to prevent the culmination of the love story between his mistress Donna Roma Volonna and Rossi. ''The Eternal City'' was serialised in Britain in 1901 in [[The Lady's Magazine]] and in the United States in [[Collier's Weekly]], between February and August 1901. Immediately afterwards it was published in book form by Heinemann, with an initial print run of 100,000, running to twenty-six editions, selling more than a million copies in English alone and translated into thirteen languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=228.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage adaptation opened at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], London on 2 October 1902, produced by actor-manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], with [[incidental music]] by Italian composer [[Pietro Mascagni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|pp=78–80.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mallach|2002|pp=151–152.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the play opened in London, Caine republished the novel, cutting all the political parts and following the story of the play making it into a ‘theatre edition’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=83.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American production of ''The Eternal City'' premiered on 17 November, at the Victoria Theatre, New York City, with [[Viola Allen]] as Roma, [[Frederic De Belleville]] as Bonelli, and Edward J. Morgan as Rossi. Caine supervised rehearsals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=84.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 1903 six companies were performing ''The Eternal City'', in England, USA, Australia and South Africa.

===''Household Words''===
In 1901 Caine bought ''[[Household Words]]'', the literary magazine founded by [[Charles Dickens]] in 1850. He appointed his son Ralph as editor, and it was sold in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=- |work=London Daily News|date=20 July 1904|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Ralph Hall the Youngest Editor in London|work=Dundee Evening Post|date=11 December 1901|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Eternal City'' appeared as two instalments in the Christmas 1901 and January 1902 editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Publications|work=Sheffield Daily Telegraph|date=11 December 1901|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made many contributions including articles about [[Pope Leo XIII]], whom he had a private audience with, the story ''A Maid of Mona'' and a serialisation of ''The Manxman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Hall Caine on the Pope|work=Bolton Evening News|date=28 November 1901|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Appear in this day's Household Words|work=London Daily News|date=2 July 1903|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Notices|work=Thanet Advertiser|date=7 February 1903|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings on Roman Catholicism caused serious offence to his fellow members of the National Club of London, founded as a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Our London Letter|work=Aberdeen Press and Journal|date=4 December 1901|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second visit to Iceland===
To obtain local colour for his novel ''[[The Prodigal Son (Hall Caine novel)|The Prodigal Son]]'' Caine visited Iceland in 1903. On one of two exploration trips that started from Reykjavik Caine discovered a cave about 200 feet long in the valley of [[Thingvellir]], afterwards named "Hall's Hellin" (Hall's cave).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Hall Caine's Iceland Explorations|work=St James' Gazette|date=2 October 1903|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August Caine was at the close of the Iceland [[Althing]] where he was a guest of Magnús Stephensen, the island's Governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Hall Caine in Iceland|work=Gloucestershire Echo|date=7 September 1903|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Parliamentary dinner which followed, Caine was introduced "as a distinguished "skald" (bard), whose writings were widely known and greatly admired in Iceland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Hall Caine in Iceland|work=The Advertiser|location=Adelaide|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/5007566|date=9 October 1903|page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Prodigal Son'' was published in November 1904 by Heinemann and translated into thirteen languages. It is set in a sheep-rearing community in rural Iceland, with scenes in London and the [[French Riviera]].  In ''The Prodigal Son'' Magnus learns on his wedding day that his bride, Thora, is in love with his brother Oscar, a composer. She marries Oscar after Magnus releases her from the engagement. When Thora dies, a distraught Oscar places the only copies of his compositions in her coffin. Later he has her grave opened and his music retrieved. Caine's use of a similar event to Rossetti's exhumation of Elizabeth Siddal, where Rossetti recovered his poems that he had buried with her, caused a lasting rift between Caine and the Rossetti family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=90.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Prodigal Son'' was simultaneously dramatised, the copyright performance held at the Grand Theatre, [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].  American and British productions opened days apart in 1905, at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre in Washington, D. C.]] on 28 August, the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] in New York City on 4 September and at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London on 7 September, with [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]] playing Oscar and Caine's sister Lilian playing Thora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heard in the Green-Room|work=The Sketch|date=6 September 1905|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a long run at Drury Lane it was revived in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|1999|p=28.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1906 Caine's dramatised version of ''The Bondman'' was produced in London's [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], with [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] playing a leading role and Caine's son, Derwent (aged sixteen), making a stage début.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=315.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A copyright performance had taken place at the Theatre Royal, Bolton in November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=199.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine revised the play for [[Arthur Collins (theatre manager)|Arthur Collins]], moving part of the story to [[Sicily]] and creating a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=92.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highlight of the show was the sulphur mine explosion and volcano eruption. In April 1906 Collins and Caine had gone on a research trip where they spent a day with Leone Testa, the inspector-general of Sicily's sulphur mines and while visiting [[Naples]] they witnessed [[Mount Vesuvius]] erupt. The show ran for eleven weeks followed by eight weeks at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] and a revival of The Prodigal Son. The production went on tour in the UK and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=95.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Japanese actor and a founder of Japanese modern theatre [[Otojirō Kawakami]] staged the play in Japan in 1909, changing the setting to Japan and the Philippines and included the volcanic eruption. When Kawakami’s new western style theatre Teikoku-za opened in Osaka in March 1910 the first production was The Bondman.

1908 saw the publication of ''My Story'', described by Bram Stoker as "autobiographical rather than an autobiography and gives insight to the life and character of his many friends and their influence on his life and work, and of the gradual growth of his mind and of his importance in the world as the success of each book gave him further opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bram|last=Stoker|title=The Ethics of Hall Caine|work= The Homiletic Review| date=August 1909|page=98|url=http://www.bramstoker.org/pdf/nonfic/ethics.pdf|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian nationalism===
On 13 June 1906 British officers shot pigeons for sport in Denshawai, an Egyptian village whose inhabitants were pigeon farmers, resulting in a clash between the officers and several villagers.  One villager, falsely accused of murder was killed on the spot. Four villagers were hanged and others punished by jail sentences, hard labour and lashings. The [[Denshawai Incident]] proved a turning point in the history of the British occupation of Egypt, starting a fierce political debate both in Eygpt and Britain in which intellectuals and men of letters participated, eventually causing the resignation of [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]], the redoubtable British Consul General and de facto ruler of Egypt since 1882. Crucially poet [[Wilfred Scawen Blunt]] exposed the facts in his pamphlet ''Atrocities of Justice Under British Rule in Egypt'', provoking a public outcry in Britain. [[George Bernard Shaw]] drafted a petition published in ''The New Age'' with the main purpose of gaining the release of the Egyptian prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Denshawai Prisoners|url=http://wallace-online.org/content/frameset?keywords=denshawai&amp;pageseq=1&amp;itemID=S646a&amp;viewtype=text|accessdate=28 April 2017|website=wallace-online.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw denounces the "Denshawai horror" in his ''Preface to Politicians'' that introduces his ''John Bull's Other Island''. Caine's literary response to the debate is his controversial novel ''The White Prophet.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=318,339.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw reviews ''The White Prophet'' and opposes literary censorship in ''Bernard Shaw on Shams of Rule and of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shaw|1996|pp=230–240.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in Egypt at the start of the twentieth century, twenty years into the British occupation and opening with a ceremonial re-enactment of the [[Battle of Omdurman]], ''The White Prophet'' is the story of Colonel Charles George Lord, a British officer who joins the crusade of Ishmael Ameer, a Muslim prophet against selfishness and sedition. Lord compares him with Christ and John the Baptist. Ameer plans a coup against the British in Sudan, after developing political ambitions.  ''The White Prophet'' is Caine's only book never to have been reprinted; its sympathies for [[Egyptian nationalism]] rendered it a commercial failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diamond|2006|p=65.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine used material from ''Mahomet'' and ''The Mahdi'' in the novel.  Accompanied by his wife, he made three research visits to Egypt, March to May 1907, then January to May in 1908 and similarly in 1909 when he was joined by actor manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Connor|2007|p=207.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cromer failed to meet Caine during his visit to Egypt in 1907, instead Caine wrote urging him to grant the Egyptians wish "for a speedy fulfilment of England's promise to get out of Egypt as soon as it was safe to do so" and to "yield to legitimate claims to national independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=319.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=211.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally entitled ''The White Christ'', it was serialised in the British and US editions of ''The Strand Magazine'' between December 1908 and November 1909, and subsequently translated into seven languages. The Arabic translation was serialised in Cairo-based newspaper ''al-Minbar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=215.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Sladen]] read the first two instalments of ''The White Prophet'' and had the idea of writing a counterblast, the novel ''The Tragedy of the Pyramids: A Romance of Army Life in Egypt''. Closing the preface he writes "I felt bound to challenge the false light in which he presents the British Army of Occupation in Egypt to the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sladen|1909|pp=xi-xxiii.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copyright performance was performed at the [[Garrick Theatre]], London on 27 November 1908. Beerbohm Tree's plans to produce a dramatised version at [[His Majesty's Theatre, London]], which he was to direct and star in, were abandoned following threats to lobby the Lord Chamberlain against granting a license for the play, banning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaw on Caine's Work|work=Sacramento Union|location= California US|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SU19091115.2.125|date=15 November 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cromer is reported to have protested to the Lord Chamberlain's Department that "the state of the Nationalist agitation in Egypt made a dramatic representation of some of its features injudicious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Hall Caine Play Banned|work= Dundee Evening Telegraph |date=2 June 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of John Lord is widely believed to be Cromer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=220.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoting the publication of ''The White Prophet'' by Heinemann on 12 August 1909, Caine published a series of eight articles ''Aspects of the East'' in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Heinemann published Shaw's ''The Critics of The White Prophet'' as a pamphlet, endorsing the novel's political viewpoint.  It was to have been the preface for the second edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waller|2008|pp=737–738.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 1910, Caine's new stage adaptation of ''The Deemster'' entitled ''The Bishop's Son'' opened at the Grand Theatre, [[Douglas, Isle of Man]], with Caine's son, Derwent, playing Dan. It went on to open at London's [[Garrick Theatre]] on 28 September 1910 with [[Bransby Williams]] as Dan, which ran for seven performances.

===Controversy of ''The Woman Thou Gavest Me''===
Caine's novel ''The Woman Thou Gavest Me: Being the Story of Mary O'Neill'', published by Heinemann in 1913, "caused the biggest furore of any of his novels".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=351.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Translated into nine languages, worldwide advance orders for the book exceeded 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From October 1912 it was serialised in Britain in ''Nash's Magazine'' and concurrently in the United States in ''[[Hearst's Magazine]]''. The following month serialisation began in ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. [[Circulating libraries]] divided new books into three categories: satisfactory, doubtful and objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hammond|2006|p=28.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They attempted to boycott ''The Woman Thou Gavest Me'' along with [[Compton Mackenzie]]'s ''Sinister Street'' and [[W. B. Maxwell]]'s ''The Devil's Garden'', for failing their criteria. The authors directed a publicity campaign opposing the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradshaw|2013|p=66.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Woman Thou Gavest Me'', the second of Caine's novels to address the Woman Question, "arraigns the divorce laws" of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Book Boycotted|work= Otago Daily Times|location= New Zealand|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ODT19130802.2.58|date=2 August 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father [[Bernard Vaughan]], known for his sermons on ''The Sins of Society'', denounced Caine's book saying "it showed startling ignorance of Roman Catholic doctrine and practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Novel Denounced|work=Waikato Argus|location= New Zealand|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WAIGUS19131001.2.25.|date=1 October 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was one of several books the Catholic Federation in [[Auckland]], New Zealand wanted removed from sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Priest and a Book.|work=Sun|location= New Zealand|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19140519.2.13|date=19 May 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Novel Denounced|work=The Monitor And New Era|location=London|url= https://newspaperarchive.com/london-monitor-and-new-era-oct-04-1913-p-6/ |page=6|date=4 October 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wyndham, Western Australia]] the committee of Little River Mechanics Institute Free Library ordered the book banned and burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public listing status for the Little River Mechanics Institute Free Library|work=Wyndham Leader|location= Western Australia US|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/public-listing-status-for-the-little-river-mechanics-institute-free-library/news-story/b1219e39ef5294b69fb1bfe5084f8e14|date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American newspapers reported of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] preacher's daughter that eloped and married the son of a prominent family, who later divorced her and took away her child.

Parallels were drawn between the problem that Debs handled in real life and Caine's fictional story of Mary O'Neill, who marries unhappily and ends up on the street without shelter, with the whole world turned against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Woman That Debs Took Into His House—And Hall Caine's Extraordinary Novel, "The Woman Thou Gavest Me" Deb* Has Made an Interesting Experiment.

==Politics==
On 24 October 1901 Caine was elected a [[Member of the House of Keys]] in a by-election as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] for the constituency of [[Ramsey, Isle of Man]], by a majority of 267 votes. Caine sought election to the Keys after the collapse of {{Proper name|Dumbell}}'s Banking Company on 3 February 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=36.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash had resulted in a number of resignations and retirements, resulting in eleven by-elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Kermode |2001|p=26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bank had held most of the island's cash deposits and left businesses and residents without money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Manx Sun History of Dumbell's Bank|year=1900|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/ms1900/p001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the General election in 1903 Caine was re-elected for another five years.

During Caine's election campaign he supported dominion status for the Island with a Manxman as Lieutenant-Governor, a directly elected [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] and departmental officials appointed by and responsible to [[Tynwald]].  A pamphlet entitled ''Hall Caine's Letters and Speeches on Manx Politics'' was published in 1903, containing his election speech and articles he wrote for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Black and White (magazine)|Black and White]]'', describing his experiences and aspirations. In recognition of his single election speech Caine was appointed vice-president of the Land Nationalisation Society of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=42.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manx National Reform League made constitutional and social reform the central issues in the general election of 1903, after an extra-parliamentary initiative by journalist and printer Samuel Norris. It was influenced by Liberal demands for political change in the United Kingdom. In 1903 Caine was elected the first president of the Manx National Reform League. In 1904 the new House of Keys established a committee on constitutional reform, chaired by Caine, that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Kermode|2001|pp39=42.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caine retired from active politics in 1908. Due to the other pressures on his time he seldom spoke in the Keys. He also had little time to offer to politics on a larger scale. Prior to the Ramsey by-election, Caine was invited by [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] to stand for the [[British parliament]] but he refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=282–284.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Great War==

Caine was aged 61 at the outbreak of the Great War. The British secretly set up the War Propaganda Bureau under MP [[Charles Masterman]]. Caine was one of twenty-five leading authors Masterman invited to the Bureau's London headquarters, [[Wellington House]] on 2 September 1914 with the purpose of best [[British propaganda during World War I|promoting Britain's interests during the war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Buitenhuis |2011|p=14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Caine was one of fifty-three of the leading authors in Britain to sign the 'Authors' Declaration', a manifesto drafted by Masterman stating that Britain "could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war." Issued on 17 September the document was sent by special cable to the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pen and Sword Pt.

[[File:Caine war book.jpg|thumb|left|The cover of ''The Drama of 365 Days: Scenes in the Great War'', Caine's series of ''Daily Telegraph'' World War I propaganda articles. The book is dedicated to the young manhood of the British Empire.]]
Following the [[Rape of Belgium]] Caine edited ''King Albert's Book'' in support of the exiled [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert of Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;Caine, Hall (ed.), ''King Albert's Book, a Tribute to the Belgian King and People from representative men and women throughout the World'' (The Daily Telegraph, in conjunction with The Daily Sketch, The Glasgow Herald and Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Christmas 1914) ''"Sold in aid of the Daily Telegraph Belgian Fund."''&lt;/ref&gt; It was Caine's idea and was published at Christmas 1914 by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. The proceeds from the book, £20,000, went to the Daily Telegraph Belgium Fund, a fund created to support British efforts to receive and maintain Belgian refugees in Britain. In previous years Caine had edited several of these volumes already, the most recent for Queen Alexandra's charities in 1905 and 1908. Caine invited authors, artists, composers, statesmen and many notable people to present their view of events in Belgium. ''King Albert‘s Book'' contains contributions from two hundred and fifty of the most famous people of the time. Among the contributors are British [[Prime Minister Asquith]] and then Lord of the Admiralty [[Winston Churchill]], painters [[Claude Monet]] and [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]] and composer [[Claude Debussy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's homage to 'plucky Belgium'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/11295047/Britains-homage-to-plucky-Belgium.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Albert of Belgium made Caine an Officer of the [[Order of Leopold II|Order of Leopold of Belgium]] for his humanitarian aid to the Belgian refugees in 1918. Caine's portrait by the Belgian painter, [[Alfred Jonniaux]], was presented to him by the Fine Art Department of the Belgian Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Books of the Day|work=Illustrated London News|date=6 August 1921|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonniaux group=nb/&gt;

Caine wrote extensively in the English, American and Italian newspapers. He claimed that by this work and his personal influence with Italian statesmen he greatly helped bring Italy into the war on the side of the allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=62.}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Woodrow Wilson]] had declared the United States neutral and his policy of neutrality was enormously popular with the American people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Wilson's Declaration of Neutrality – World War I Document Archive|url=https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/President_Wilson's_Declaration_of_Neutrality|website=wwi.lib.byu.edu|accessdate=3 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Caine urged America to join the war by writing articles, mainly for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and in 1915 he gave a series of lectures in the United States but these were not well received. In September 1915, at the conclusion of the first year of war, a series of articles featuring royalty, countries and events which included [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] and the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania]] that Caine had contributed to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' were published as a book entitled ''The Drama of 365 Days: Scenes in the Great War''. Caine attended Nurse [[Edith Cavell]]'s memorial service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, on 29 October 1915; the World War I British nurse who is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers in Brussels from all sides without distinction. His account was published in The Daily Telegraph on 30 October and extensively in other newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Telegraph October 30 1915|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ww1-archive/11961168/Daily-Telegraph-October-30-1915.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=3 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 he was invited to work with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] towards the creation of the [[League of Nations]] after the end of the war. ''Our Girls: Their Work for the War'', is the title of Caine's Christmas book published by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Messrs Hutchinson]] early in December 1916, consisting of a series of Caine's articles written for the [[Ministry of Munitions]], together with additional stories of women's working lives in the factories and in the hospitals. It was designed to be a gift for [[Munitionettes|munitions girls]] to send to their men at the front.

The National War Aims Committee was set up in 1917 to focus on domestic propaganda. Caine was recruited for the committee by the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] to write the screenplay for the [[World War I film propaganda|propaganda]] film ''[[Victory and Peace]]'', designed to show what would happen in a German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hall Caine's Task|work=Shields Daily News|date=10 November 1917|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the negative of the newly finished film was destroyed in a fire at the offices of the London Film Company in June 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Hall Caine's propaganda film destroyed|work=Aberdeen Press and Journal|date=19 June 1918|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-filmed over four-months, just as the war ended and was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Slide |2015|Chapter=11.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of 1917 Caine was offered a [[baron]]etcy in recognition of the contribution he made to the war effort as an allied propagandist and his position as a leading [[intellectual|man of letters]]. Caine declined the hereditary peerage and accepted a [[knight]]hood instead. He was made [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire(KBE)]], insisting on being called, not 'Sir Thomas' but 'Sir Hall'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=367–368.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the war==

Caine returned to writing novels and in 1921 Heinmann's published '' [[The Master of Man|The Master of Man: The Story of a Sin]]''.  It was set in the Isle of Man and involves [[infanticide]].  Initially it sold well but sales soon dropped.  It was considered to be old-fashioned; Caine was using old themes and had not kept up with the time.  One reviewer referred to Caine as "this Victorian author".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=380–381.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Caine acquired the ''Sunday Illustrated'' newspaper which had been founded by [[Horatio Bottomley]].  In October of that year he was made a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]].  Caine's last novel ''[[The Woman of Knockaloe]]'' was brought out in 1923, this time published by [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell's]].  It is another love story set on the Isle of Man but this time dealing with the harm caused by racial hatred.  That year he sold the ''Sunday Illustrated''. On Armistice Day 1923 Caine's first radio broadcast, ''A Counsel of Peace'', was made to the nation from the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The World's Remedy.|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/106739363|work=Daily Herald|location=Adelaide|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=8 January 1924|pages=4}}Full text of ''A Counsel of Peace''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Hall Caine|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56bbef3d1c33498eb7287f157b95396f|website=The Radio Times|accessdate=2 November 2017|pages=2, 7|date=9 November 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caine's last published work in his lifetime was a revised version of ''Recollections of Rossetti'', with a shortened title, to coincide with the 1928 centenary of Rossetti's birth.  In 1929 Caine was given the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom]] of Douglas.  For much of his life Caine worked on a book entitled ''Life of Christ'' but it was not published until some time after his death, in 1938 with a foreword by his two sons.  It "aroused little or no interest and quickly disappeared".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=430.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
[[File:Hall Caine Visits the Set of “The Christian,” 1922.jpg|thumb|Hall Caine's visit to ''The Christian'' film set in 1922, Left to right: Caine, [[Mae Busch]] (Glory Quayle), [[Maurice Tourneur]] (Director), and [[Richard Dix]](John Storm).]]
Most of Caine's novels were made into [[black-and-white]] [[silent film|silent]] films. The first film made was [[The Christian (1911 film)|''The Christian'' (1911)]], by [[West's Pictures]] in Australia. The twenty-eight minute unauthorised film was the first directed by [[Franklyn Barrett]]. ''The Christian'' features the cast of the stage production by [[William Anderson (theatre)|William Anderson]]'s Company. An unauthorised film of ''[[The Bondman (1916 film)|The Bondman'' (1916)]] was made by [[Fox Film Corporation]] in the United States and was the first film they released under their De Luxe brand. All of Fox's 110 musicians accompanied ''The Bondman'' screenings. The music was composed by [[Max Steiner]], Fox's musical director. A financial and critical success it was re-released in 1918 as one of Fox's Big Six.

The first authorised film of a Caine novel is ''[[The Christian (1914 film)|The Christian]]'' (1914) released in the United States by the [[Vitagraph|Vitagraph Liebler Company]]. The first eight reel film they made. Vitagraph leased the Harris Theatre on West 42nd Street, for the purpose of exclusively showing their own films, opening with ''The Christian'' starring [[Earle Williams]] and [[Edith Storey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vitagraph article|url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/vitagrapharticle.html|website=www.silentsaregolden.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caine wrote the film scenario, the first time ever that a famous author undertook a film scenario of their own work. Vitagraph staff writer Eugene Mullins followed Caine’s own scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The sun.

Adapted and directed by established American screenwriter and director [[George Loane Tucker]], ''[[The Christian (1915 film)|The Christian]]'' (1915) was made by the London Film Company. The 9,000 feet film starred Caine's son [[Derwent Hall Caine]] as John Storm.  ''[[The Manxman (1916 film)|The Manxman]]'' (1916), also produced by the London Film Company and directed by Tucker, was filmed on the Isle of Man and, when released drew huge crowds in Britain and America. It was one of the few British films distributed in the United States that went on to become a financial and critical success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[National Board of Review]]|year=1951|title=Book Reviews|journal=Films in Review|publisher=National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|volume=2|page=55|issn=0015-1688}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring Derwent Hall Caine and [[Marian Swayne]] ''The Deemster'' (1917), made in the United States, is the first special feature film Arrow Film Corporation made.  Shot on location on [[Block Island|Block Island, Rhode Island]], the film was originally entitled ''The Bishop’s Son'' after Caine’s 1910 stage adaptation of ''The Deemster'' in which Derwent had also played Dan Mylrea and on which the film is based.  Caine remained closely involved with the production; based in England, Caine reviewed the scenario and produced drawings of the character of the buildings to be used. ''[[The Christian (1923 film)|The Christian]]'' was also remade in 1923, produced by [[Samuel Goldwyn]], and directed by the celebrated [[Maurice Tourneur]].

[[Adolph Zukor]]’s Famous Players Film Company produced the first version of ''[[The Eternal City (1915 film)|The Eternal City (1915)]]''. The $100,000 epic film featured stage star [[Pauline Frederick]]. Made on location in London and Italy in 1914 the production was interrupted by the start of the [[Great War]] and was completed in New York. For distribution of initially ''The Eternal City'' and other prestigious feature-length films Famous Players created the Select Booking Agency. Caine cabled the producers after attending the British premiere at Marble Arch Pavilion, in London congratulating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England Likes "Eternal City" |url=https://archive.org/stream/clipper63-1915-10#page/n65/ |work=New York Clipper |publisher=New York, NY: Frank Queen Publishing Co. |date=9 October 1915 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was re-released in 1918 as part of the Paramount "Success Series". In 1923 the Samuel Goldwyn Company shot a [[The Eternal City (1923 film)|remake]] in Italy. Caine was so unhappy with the latter film that he tried to withdraw his name from it, unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1990|p=457.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] recruited Caine in 1917 to write the screenplay for the propaganda film ''[[Victory and Peace]]'' (1918), made in Britain and directed by [[Herbert Brenon]]. Caine was appointed as chief adviser to the film campaign department of the National War Aims Committee. Lloyd George chose Caine due to his experience in the field of cinema and his "reputation as a man of letters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Letter from Lloyd George to Hall Caine, dated 23 October 1917, reprinted in the Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=10 November 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 1917, in [[Ithaca, New York]], Brenon’s representative obtained the film rights of ''The Woman Thou Gavest Me'' from [[Derwent Hall Caine]], Caine’s American agent, intending to start work in November 1917. The film was advertised but it was never made by Brenon. A film of ''[[The Woman Thou Gavest Me]]'' was made in 1919 by Famous Players and this drew good audiences and good reviews.

Caine wrote the screenplay of ''[[Darby and Joan (1920 film)|Darby and Joan]]''. Made by Master Films the 1920 film is directed by [[Percy Nash]] featuring [[Derwent Hall Caine]] and [[Ivy Close]]. Many of the scenes were shot in the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Globe|date=7 January 1918|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Woman of Knockaloe'' was filmed by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1927 as ''[[Barbed Wire (1927 film)|Barbed Wire]]''. Then [[Alfred Hitchcock]] arrived on the Isle of Man to film ''[[The Manxman]]'' (1929) but he and Caine did not get on well and the rest of the film was shot in Cornwall.  ''The Manxman'' was Hitchcock's last silent film. Caine was not happy with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=416.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from the army in 1922, Colonel Hanna joined the [[British Board of Film Censors]] and held the position of vice-president and chief censor throughout the 1930s. [[Gaumont British]]'s plan to film ''The White Prophet'' was abandoned after objections by Colonel Hanna as he thought it contained scenes with "a tendency to bring the British army into contempt and ridicule" and that "no scene of cavalry charging the mob and causing 100 deaths….would be permissible on the screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richards|2009|p=146.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before Caine's death in 1931, [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] purchased the screen rights of ''The Christian'' with the intention of making a [[talking picture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hall Caine Novel as Talkie|work= Daily Herald|date=1 May 1931|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hall Caine Film|work=The Derby Daily Telegraph|date=1 May 1931|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Happenings of the Stage and Screen|work=Pittsburg Post- Gazette|date=13 May 1931|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83696833 |title=Union Theatre's Scoop |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] |volume=L |issue=17 |location=Western Australia |date=15 December 1931 |accessdate=7 January 2018 |page=6|edition=HOME (FINAL) |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights were reported as selling for £8000.

==Personal and domestic==
In appearance Caine was a short man who tended to dress in a striking fashion.  His eyes were dark brown and slightly protuberant, giving him an intense stare.  He had red-gold hair and a dark red beard which he trimmed to appear like the [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]] [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]; indeed if people did not notice the likeness he was inclined to point it out to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=35–36.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also preoccupied throughout his life with the state of his health.  This was often the result of overwork or other stresses in his life and he would sometimes use nervous exhaustion as an excuse to escape from his problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=24, 213.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hall Caine's grave, Maughold, Isle of Man.JPG|thumb|left|Hall Caine's grave, designed by [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], [[Maughold (parish)|Maughold]], [[Isle of Man]]]]
In 1902 the Caines rented a large house on [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] Common, The Hermitage, and Mary spent much time there while Caine was abroad or at Greeba Castle.  Rumours spread that the marriage was in trouble and, as many of his visitors were male, that Caine was [[Gay|homosexual]].  However, there was never any reliable substance to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=292.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1906 the couple were leading increasingly separate lives but Mary remained loyal and faithful throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=313.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Derwent Hall Caine had an illegitimate daughter, Elin, and she was brought up as Caine and Mary's child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=348–350.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1914 Mary at last had her own London house – Heath Brow which overlooked [[Hampstead Heath]].  After the Great War this house had become too big and Mary moved into Heath End House, again overlooking Hampstead Heath.  By 1922 they informally separated; Caine could not live with Mary, nor could he break with her completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=388–389.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time, both suffered from various ailments.

On 31 August 1931, aged 78 Caine slipped into a coma and died at his home, [[Greeba Castle]], Isle of Man.  On his death certificate is the diagnosis of "cardiac syncope".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=423.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death messages of condolence were received from the Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]], King George V and Queen Mary.

At Caine's funeral on Friday 4 September 1931 representatives of all branches of public life in the Isle of Man followed the coffin. Sixty thousand Manx people and holiday makers paid tribute on the 25 mile journey. At Douglas great crowds lined the route and the majority of businesses closed. An address was made by the Bishop of Man. Caine was buried in [[Maughold (parish)|Kirk Maughold]] [[churchyard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=60,000 Mourn passing of Sir Hall Caine|work=Daily Herald|date=5 September 1931|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial service was held at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London on 9 September 1931. [[Reginald John Campbell|Rev. J. Campbell]] gave the address. The Prime Minister was represented by Charles Patrick Duff, and [[A. J. Sylvester|Albert James Sylvester]] represented [[Lloyd George]].
In March 1932, six months after her husband's death, Mary Hall Caine died from pneumonia. She was buried alongside her husband.

An Irish limestone obelisk depicting six characters from Caine's novels and a likeness of Mary was erected over their grave.  The design is based on the ancient Maughold Parish Cross that is preserved in the churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=74.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial is the work of artist [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]].

A statue of Hall Caine stands in Douglas, financed by money from the estate of Derwent Hall Caine.

==Postscript==

===Caine's legacy===
Hall Caine was an enormously popular and best-selling author in his time. Crowds would gather outside his houses hoping to get a glimpse of him.  He was "accorded the adulation reserved now for pop stars and footballers",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet he is now virtually unknown.

Allen suggests two reasons for this.  First that, in comparison with Dickens, his characters are not clearly drawn, they are "frequently fuzzy at the edges" while Dickens' characters are "diamond-clear"; and Caine's characters also tend to be much the same as each other.  Something similar could also be said about his plots. Possibly the main drawback is that although Caine's books can be romantic and emotionally moving, they lack humour; they are deadly earnest and serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=430–431.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time the Isle of Man had a second civil airport near Ramsey which was called the [[Hall Caine Airport]].

===Critical appraisals===
* Despite his proving the wealthiest of Victorian novelists,&lt;ref&gt;J. Sutherland, ''The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction'' (1990) p. 97-9&lt;/ref&gt; Caine has been largely dismissed as a mere [[melodrama]]tist by subsequent criticism.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[G. K. Chesterton]] said in "A Defence of [[Penny Dreadfuls]]" that "it is quite clear that this objection, the objection brought by magistrates, has nothing to do with literary merit. Bad story writing is not a crime. Mr. Hall Caine walks the streets openly, and cannot be put in prison for an anticlimax."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/penny-dreadfuls.html A DEFENCE OF PENNY DREADFULS&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.cse.dmu.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Hardy]] criticised Caine for his excessive [[egotism]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Seymour-Smith, ''Thomas Hardy'' (1994) p. 645&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jacques Laurent Agasse 001.jpg|thumb|''[[Playground|The playground]]'' (''Der Spielplatz'')]]
[[Image:The nubian giraffe.jpg|thumb|''The Nubian Giraffe'', by Jacques-Laurent Agasse (c.1827), depicts one of the three [[giraffe]]s sent to Europe by [[Mehmet Ali Pasha]] (another was [[Giraffe given to Charles X of France by Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Zarafa]]). This one was received by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in [[London]]. The gentleman shown in the top hat is [[Edward Cross (zoo proprietor)|Edward Cross]], operator of the [[menagerie]] at [[Exeter Exchange]] and then [[Royal Surrey Gardens]]. Agasse painted many other animals from his collection.]]

'''Jacques-Laurent Agasse''' (April 24, 1767 &amp;ndash; December 27, 1849) was an [[animal]] and [[Landscape art|landscape]] [[Painting|painter]] from Switzerland.

Born at [[Geneva]], Agasse studied in the public art school of that city. Before he turned twenty he went to [[Paris]] to study in veterinary school to make himself fully acquainted with the anatomy of horses and other animals. He seems to have subsequently returned to [[Switzerland]]. The ''Tübinger Morgenblatt'' (1808, p.&amp;nbsp;876) says that "Agasse, the celebrated animal [[Painting|painter]], now in [[England]], owed his fortune to an accident. About eight years ago, he being then in [[Switzerland]], a rich Englishman ([[George Pitt, 2nd Baron Rivers|George Pitt]], later Lord Rivers) asked him to paint his favourite dog ([[greyhound]]) which had died. The Englishman was so pleased with his work that he took the painter to [[England]] with him."

Nagler says that he was one of the most celebrated animal painters at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century. In [[Johann Georg Meusel]]'s ''Neue Miscellaneen'' (viii. 1052 et seq.), he compares Agasse and [[Philips Wouwerman|Wouwermans]], wholly in favour of the former. In that partial article much is said of his extreme devotion to art, of his marvelous knowledge of anatomy, of his special fondness for the English racehorses, and his excellence in depicting them. He appears first in the Academy catalogues in 1801 as the exhibitor of the 'Portrait of a Horse', and continued to exhibit more or less until 1845 (contradicting Nagler's statement that he died "about" 1806).

In the catalogues his name is given as J.L. Agasse or Agassé. The number of times Agassé changed his address confirms Redgrave's assertion that "he lived poor and died poor". The writer of the panegyric already quoted says, however, that he did not work for money, but that he was urged forward by the resistless force of natural genius.

He is also featured in the French thriller ''[[L'Antiquaire]]'', with some works credited to him—a painting of two Leopards, among others.

'''''Sir John Luttrell''''' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] [[oil painting]] of a [[Tudor period|Tudor]] soldier.

==Details==
Sir [[John Luttrell (soldier)|John Luttrell]] was an English [[soldier]], [[diplomat]], and [[courtier]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. The Flemish artist [[Hans Eworth]] produced a portrait of him in 1550, noted for its use of allegorical images. The painting shows John shaking his fist at a woman carrying an [[olive]] branch, while a ship founders on a stormy sea in the background. The painting is thought to represent John's anger at the peace treaty of 1550 between England and France; the ship is probably the ''Mary of Hamburg'', which served under John during one of his Scottish campaigns.&lt;ref name=GarnettP9&gt;Garnett, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Oliver Garnett considers the painting to be "one of the most unusual and puzzling of all Tudor images".&lt;ref name=GarnettP9/&gt;

The painting is now owned by the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in [[London]]; a copy, made in 1591, hangs at [[Dunster Castle]] in [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name=GarnettP9/&gt;

[[File:Judas Returning the Thirty Silver Pieces - Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|''Judas Returning the Thirty Silver Pieces'' (Rembrandt 1629)]]
'''''Judas Repentant, Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver''''' is a painting by [[Rembrandt]], depicting the story of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#9:9|27:3]]: "Then [[Judas]], which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders". The painting is one of Rembrandt's earliest paintings and was made in 1629 while he was working in [[Leiden]].

About 1630 [[w:Constantijn Huygens]] wrote an analysis of the figure of Judas in Rembrandt's painting ''Judas Repentant''. Huygens argued that Rembrandt had surpassed the painters from Antiquity, as well as the great sixteenth-century Italian artists when it came to the representation of emotions expressed by figures that act in a history painting. The location of Rembrandt's painting ''Judas Repentant, Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver'' is in [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Judas_Returning_the_Thirty_Silver_Pieces_-_Rembrandt.jpg Lythe, North Yorkshire, Mulgrave Castle]]

Then I wanted to dance, but when I realized how much hard work it involved, I wanted to change. But my parents were very encouraging about me continuing with ballet," she said.&lt;ref name="watts" /&gt; She took courses in ballet at the [[Sun Hwa Arts School]] in Seoul, and subsequently received instruction at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in [[London]] and [[L'Academie de Dance Classique de Princess Grace of Monaco]].&lt;ref name="watts" /&gt; She was a dancer with the [[Ohio Ballet]], and the [[Washington Ballet]];&lt;ref name="watts" /&gt; joining the latter in 1982.&lt;ref name="rising" /&gt;

She explained to ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' about getting married to a groom already deceased, "In Korean tradition, I've heard there are other cases of this kind of marriage. In our church, my case is the only one where it's happened this way. But even if this personal situation had not happened, the company would still have got started."&lt;ref name="hutera"&gt;{{cite news | last =Hutera | first =Donald | title =Toeing The Moonie Line | work =[[The Evening Standard]] | date =October 26, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Moon commented to ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' on her relationship with her husband, "When I dance, I'm communicating with my husband.

The Universal Ballet company of South Korea was founded to serve as a memorial to her husband.&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; Universal Ballet of [[Seoul]], Korea was founded in 1984, and the Universal Ballet Foundation, Inc. was started by the Unification Church in 1986.&lt;ref name="fried"&gt;{{cite news | last =Fried | first =Dayna Lynn | title =Critics fear dance academy is a cover to recruit Moonies | work =[[The San Diego Union]] | page =B-1 | date =May 18, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Universal Ballet Foundation, Inc. operates as a casting office for the Universal Ballet of Korea.&lt;ref name="fried" /&gt; The dance company was initially started by Bo Hi Pak and ballerina [[Adrienne Dellas]].&lt;ref name="hutera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yolen"&gt;{{cite book | last =Yolen | first =Jane |author2=Heidi E.

In December 1989, Julia Moon made her debut with the [[Kirov Ballet]] in [[Leningrad]] in a performance of ''[[Giselle]]''.&lt;ref name="eagle"&gt;{{cite news | last =Compiled from Eagle staff and wire reports | title =Moon having Kirov debut | work =[[The Wichita Eagle]]|location=[[Wichita, Kansas]] | page =1C | date =December 22, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Griffith | first =Dorsey | title =Ballet folks nervous about Rev.

In 1990, the founder of the Washington Ballet [[Mary Day]] commented to ''[[The New York Times]]'' about Julia Moon, "She's a lovely, lovely girl, and a lovely dancer and person. We were sorry to lose her when she went back to Korea to start the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Dunning | first =Jennifer (''[[The New York Times]]'') | title = Moon's ballet school - New non-sectarian academy offers dancers lavish surroundings in Washington | work =[[Houston Chronicle]] | page =12 | date =September 13, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1990 the Universal Ballet company had yet to perform in the [[United States]], but had hired guest performers from the U.S. at significant cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Goldner | first =Nancy | title =Russian ballet school in D.C., from Rev. Moon | work =[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | page = G01 | date =October 28, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1993 interview with ''[[Tulsa World]]'', Julia Moon said of the art of ballet, "It's really a universal language."&lt;ref name="watts"&gt;{{cite news | last =Watts Jr. | first =James D. | title =Moon Dance - Korean-American Julia Moon Puts Lyrical Touch on Tulsa Ballet's `Paquita' | work =[[Tulsa World]] | page =E1 | date =September 17, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke of Korean dancers versus other styles, "I think I would say that Korean dancers - those born and raised there - are very lyrical in their movements, more so than Japanese or Chinese or American dancers," she said. "It's probably something related to Korean folk dancing, which uses a very soft line and is very lyrical."&lt;ref name="watts" /&gt; In 1995, Julia Moon started her term as the general director of the Universal Ballet company.&lt;ref name="romeo"&gt;{{cite news | last =Paluch | first =Vicki Smith| title =Romeo, what art thou? - Universal Ballet's version of the Shakespeare tale takes liberties with the story to emphasize the dancing | work =[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]] | page =U16 | date =August 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Ballet company's first tour in the United States was in 1998.&lt;ref name="bleiberg"&gt;{{cite news | last =Bleiberg  | first =Laura | title =Troupe seeks a U.S. toehold - Dance: The Universal Ballet of Korea, which favors full-length story ballets and Russian style, launches a tour. | work =[[The Orange County Register]] | page =F04 | date =March 11, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Moon said that the company is separate from Sun Myung Moon, and that only herself and one other member are also members of the Unification Church.&lt;ref name="bleiberg" /&gt; Approximately half of the administrative staff, headed by her father, Bo Hi Pak, one of Rev.

I think we're ready for it. We need to expand artistically in that area, as well as keeping parallel with the classical tradition."&lt;ref name="bleiberg" /&gt;

In 2000, Julia Moon was interviewed by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' on her thoughts about being the general director of Universal Ballet.&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; "I lack certain qualities, as a dancer and as a director. Sometimes I do wish I was a nobody, but because this company was formed on me, I feel that if I faltered or wavered the company would falter as well," she said.&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; She commented in 2000 to ''The Evening Standard'' about [[homosexuality]] in ballet, "It exists in Korea, but since we started 16 years ago we haven't had any gay dancers. We just haven't had to deal with that issue."&lt;ref name="hutera" /&gt;

In 2001, the Universal Ballet company performed ''Shim Chung'' in [[California]].&lt;ref name="knaff"&gt;{{cite news | last =Knaff | first =Deborah L. | title =Ballet and Korea come together Dance: The Seoul-based Universal Ballet has gained critical acclaim for its classicism. | work =[[The Press-Enterprise]] | page =AA20 | date =July 13, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Moon commented to ''[[The Press-Enterprise]]'' on the selection of ''Shim Chung'' as the performance piece, "We thought that this would be a good ballet to bring with us on this tour. We are very proud of it and we think that it is a very beautiful ballet. But beyond that I believe it demonstrates in the most convincing way possible that classical ballet and Korean literary and dance traditions can come together to create a new dance form, a blend in which each of the parts has its place."&lt;ref name="knaff" /&gt; She to ''[[The Press-Telegram]]'' in 2001 that at this point Universal Ballet was judged more for its artistic merit than its origins, "People are now judging us by our artistry. The press is less interested in the connection with the church. The church has no role in the ballet company. I am a member of the church, as is one other dancer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Paluch | first =Vicki Smith | title =Global inspirations - A Korean ballet company looks to Russia for its repertoire | work =[[The Press-Telegram]] | page =W7 | date =July 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Julia Moon retired from her position as the star of the Universal Ballet company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Hunt | first =Mary Ellen | title =Universal's talent is deep, but muddled - The Korean ballet company's dancers are hampered by the lack of cohesion in this 'Romeo' | work =[[Contra Costa Times]]|location= [[Walnut Creek, California]] | page =C3 | date =August 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Universal Ballet company performed ''[[La Bayadere]]'' at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Korea.&lt;ref name="warrenlee" /&gt; "The ballet is known for its spectacle. It's mammoth, visually grand and one of the more exotic ballets in the repertory," explained Julia Moon.&lt;ref name="warrenlee" /&gt; By 2004, she had become artistic director of Universal Ballet.&lt;ref name="warrenlee"&gt;{{cite news | last =Lee | first =Warren | title =Love and betrayal in legendary India | work =[[The Korean Herald]] | date =February 24, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Bo Hi Pak was the chairman of the board of directors of the Universal Ballet company.&lt;ref name="romeo" /&gt; According to the ''[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]'', "[Julia Moon's] role as general director had been at times overshadowed by the strong presence and energy of the Rev. Moon, and Pak, both of whom share a desire to create a world-class ballet company for Korea."&lt;ref name="romeo" /&gt; In 2008, the Unification Church still gave financial support to the Universal Ballet company, and Julia Moon had a position on the company's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Holley | first =  Joe  | title = Ballet School Founder Yelena Vinogradova | work = [[The Washington Post]] | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/28/AR2008062801925.html | page =C8; Section: Metro | date = June 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1875">:''For the agricultural/topographic term see [[Keyline design]]''

A '''keyline''', in [[graphic design]], is a boundary line that separates color and [[monochromatic]] areas or differently colored areas of printing on a given page or other printed piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labelprintingportland.com/keyline/|title=What is a keyline and why we use them - Rose City Label|date=2013-08-16|work=Rose City Label|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line itself, usually consisting of a black (or other dark colored) border, provides an area in which lighter colors can be printed with slight variation in registration. In traditional [[paste-up]] graphics workflows, keylines for cropping were often merely indicated on original artwork, and then images were stripped into the area manually with the keylines themselves being added as part of the process. Keylines are often included when printing something that will be cut out using a die form, requires folding, or uses perforation lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indesignsecrets.com/creating-keylines.php|title=Creating Keylines - InDesignSecrets.com|date=2015-12-07|work=InDesignSecrets|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the [[International Paper]]'s Pocket Pal (18th ed., printed in 2000), keyline is defined as being "in artwork, an outline drawing of finished art to indicate the exact shape, position, and size for elements such as [[halftones]], line sketches, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruno |first=Michael H. |date=October 2000 |title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6228">'''Macedonian Renaissance''' is a label sometimes used to describe the period of the [[Macedonian dynasty]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (867–1056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into [[Christian art]]work.

== Concept ==
Because of problems with the term, scholars have employed alternative names to describe this period, including "renaissance" (with a small "r"), "renascence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Cormack
  | first = Robin
  | title = Byzantine Art
  | publisher =Oxford University Press
  | location= Oxford
  | year = 2000

  | isbn =0-19-284211-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Middle Byzantine Renaissance''' or '''First Byzantine Renaissance''' (the [[Palaeologan Renaissance]] from the 13th century on being the second).  [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] refers to the art of this period.

Because the word [[Renaissance]] (''rinascita'') was created in the 15th and 16th centuries by Italian humanists to describe their own time, its use outside of that context is problematic; however, the period in question certainly did produce ideas and works of art that reflected a reassessment of classical ideals.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the topic, see Cormack, ''Byzantine Art'', pp. 130-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Macedonian Renaissance'' was first used by Kurt Weitzmann in his ''The Joshua Roll: A Work of the Macedonian Renaissance''.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, Kurt. ''The Joshua Roll: A Work of the Macedonian Renaissance.'' Studies in Manuscript Illumination III, Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the architecture of Macedonia. At the same time, the manuscripts of "Paris Psalter" (cod. gr. 139, Paris, Bib. Nat. de France) were indicated as the best examples of Macedonian Renaissance by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Paris Psalterionu (Cod. gr. 139, Paris-Ulusal Kütüphane) ve Makedonyan Rönesansı (full paper text)|url = https://www.academia.edu/16355712/Paris_Psalterionu_Cod._gr._139_Paris-Ulusal_K%25C3%25BCt%25C3%25BCphane_ve_Makedonyan_R%25C3%25B6nesans%25C4%25B1_full_paper_text_|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Era ==
The term “Byzantine” arose from [[Byzantium]], a city founded in the eighth century BC on the site that would become [[Constantinople]] and is now [[Istanbul]]. Being on the easternmost territory of the Roman Empire allowed the groundwork for the Macedonian Renaissance to come about. [[Latin]] was the imperial language of law and government while [[Ancient Greek]] was the language of its literature  and the religion was [[Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;.	The Oxford Handbook of Byzantine Studies edited by Elizabeth Jeffreys with John Haldon and Robin Cormack. Published 2008 by Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[West Roman Empire]] had collapsed at the outset of the [[Middle Ages]], its Eastern half, the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], was able to survive and flourish. This was due mainly to its strategic location for commerce but also to the way it was able to hold back its enemies. [[Basil I]] (867-886), the founder of the [[Macedonian Dynasty]] of Byzantine rulers, was born in [[Byzantine Thrace|Thrace]] to a peasant family said to be of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent. He was employed in the influential circles of Constantinople and was rapidly promoted by the emperor [[Michael III]] eventually becoming co-emperor.&lt;ref&gt;"Basil I".  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 13 May. 2012  &lt;https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/55030/Basil-I&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

By means of political maneuvering he was able to secure his future as emperor and then began military and diplomatic campaigns to secure the empire. He was able to regain control over [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]] at the same time he was able to hold back [[First Bulgar Empire|Bulgarian]] advances into his territory. His dynasty was thus able to maintain a period of peace under which economics, philosophy, art, and culture could thrive.

This period produced a shift from the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|ban on the painting]] of religious figures to [[icon]]s being painted to reflect the more classical and naturalistic influences of art on the culture. [[Mosaic]]s such as the [[Virgin and Child]] in [[Hagia Sophia]] can still be seen today. The new style of art may have inspired Italian artists such as [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medieval-life-and-times.info/medieval-art/byzantine-art.htm Byzantine art]&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[Italian Renaissance]].

The period also saw a proliferation of literature, such as ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' ("The Book of Ceremonies"), which focused on governance, diplomatic interactions with neighboring nations, and other customs of the time. Education had also become a priority once again and the [[University of Constantinople]] boasted scholars such as [[Michael Psellus]], who wrote the ''Chronographia'', a history of fourteen Byzantine rulers. Meanwhile, reforms in law sought to limit the power and growth of large land owners by the formation of trade guilds that allowed the state to control growth as described in the [[Book of the Eparch]].

&lt;!--TO BE ENHANCED TO A SCIENCE SECTION??:--&gt;The building [[Magnaura]] in [[Constantinople]] had already become a school in 849 and was headed by the philosopher [[Leo the Mathematician]] (c. 790 – after 869).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HellenicMacedonia/en/EC.2.3a.html macedonian-heritage.gr: Leon the Mathematician]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his works are lost.

'''Mongol zurag''' ({{lang-mn|Mонгол зураг}}, ''Mongol painting'') is a style of painting in [[Mongolia]]n art. Developed in the early 20th century, zurag is characterised by the depiction of secular, nationalist themes in a traditional mineral-paint–on–cotton medium similar to Tibetan ''[[thangka]]''. It is thus distinguished from both traditional [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] fine art and the [[socialist realism]] favoured during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].

The style was pioneered in the aftermath of the [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921|1921 Revolution]] by artists such as [[Balduugiin Sharav]], whose ''One Day in Mongolia'' remains one of the most celebrated works of Mongolian art. Zurag paintings featuring scenes from everyday life, in both contemporary [[collective farm]] and traditional [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomadic]] settings, became popular in the 1950s and 1960s in the wake of the success of [[Ürjingiin Yadamsüren]]'s ''The Old Fiddler''. Historical depictions of the 1921 Revolution as well as earlier national figures were also popular, but overtly religious themes were discouraged by the state. Since the [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia|establishment of democracy in 1992]] there has been a resurgence of interest in the style. Recent zurag paintings have featured nationalistic scenes drawn from the ''[[Secret History of the Mongols]]'' and the life of [[Genghis Khan]], as well overtly religious imagery inspired by pre-Buddhist [[Tengriism|shamanism]]. They have also become more symbolic and less strictly representational.

Throughout its history zurag has encompassed a diverse range of visual styles. Flat, brightly coloured shading in the Buddhist tradition is used alongside European-style [[Realist visual arts|realism]] and [[geometric perspective]]. Some zurag artists co-opted older Buddhist iconographic conventions for purely secular topics. 
[[Otgonbayar Ershuu]] is an important painter of our time, he was portrayed in the film "ZURAG" by Tobias Wulff.&lt;ref&gt;ZURAG – a movie about Otgonbayar Ershuu; Germany/Mongolia 2010; produced by Tobias Wulff [http://www.zurag.de/zurag-film.html (The movie was broadcast twice in the Mongolian State television in 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Persian pottery''' or '''Iranian pottery''' refers to the pottery works made by the artists of [[Persia|Persia (Iran)]] and its history goes back to early [[Neolithic Age]] (7th millennium BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/anthropology/persia/history.htm  |title=The History of Persian Ceramics |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the centuries, Persian potters have responded to the demands and changes brought by political turmoil by adopting and refining newly introduced forms and blending them into their own culture. This innovative attitude has survived through time and influenced many other cultures around the world.

The Islamic prohibition on using vessels made of precious metal at the table, which had been usual for pre-Islamic elites of the earlier [[Persian empire]]s, meant that a market for luxury ceramics opened up, which Persian potters were able to fill with fancy glazes such as in [[lustreware]] and high-quality painted decoration.
 
==Early pottery from Susa==
{{main|Susa}}
Evidence of a painted-pottery civilization around [[Susa]] has been dated to c&amp;nbsp;5000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;{{cite book|title=An Encyclopedia of World History| editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. |edition = 5th | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company| location = Boston, MA| year = 1972 | isbn = 0-395-13592-3|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Susa was firmly within the [[Sumer]]ian [[Uruk]] cultural sphere during the [[Uruk period]]. An imitation of the entire state apparatus of Uruk, [[proto-writing]], [[cylinder seal]]s with Sumerian motifs, and monumental architecture, is found at Susa. Susa may have been a colony of Uruk. As such, the [[periodization]] of Susa corresponds to Uruk; Early, Middle and Late Susa II periods (3800–3100&amp;nbsp;BCE) correspond to Early, Middle, and Late Uruk periods.

Shortly after Susa was first settled 6000&amp;nbsp;years ago, its inhabitants erected a temple on a monumental platform that rose over the flat surrounding landscape. The exceptional nature of the site is still recognizable today in the artistry of the ceramic vessels that were placed as offerings in a thousand or more graves near the base of the temple platform. Nearly two thousand pots were recovered from the cemetery and now, most of them now are located in the [[Louvre]]; one such vessel is the [[Bushel with ibex motifs]]. The vessels found are eloquent testimony to the artistic and technical achievements of their makers, and they hold clues about the organization of the society that commissioned them.&lt;ref name="Aruz 1992 26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painted ceramic vessels from Susa in the earliest first style are a late, regional version of the Mesopotamian [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] ceramic tradition that spread across the Near East during the fifth millennium B.C.&lt;ref name="Aruz 1992 26"/&gt;

Susa I style was very much a product of the past and of influences from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types—a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar—implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute a large proportion of the vessels from the cemetery. Others are course cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.

==Early Islamic period==
The [[Samanid Empire|Samanid period]] saw the creation of epigraphic pottery. These pieces were typically [[earthenware]] vessels with black [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] lettering in [[Kufic|Kufi]] script painted on a base of white slip. These vessels would typically be inscribed with benedictions or adages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McWilliams|first1=Mary|title=Bowl Inscribed with a Saying of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/165532|website=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samarqand]] and [[Nishapur]] were both centers of production for this kind of pottery.&lt;ref name="Volov 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volov|first1=Lis|title=Plaited Kufic on Samanid Epigraphic Pottery|journal=Ars Orientalis|date=1966|volume=6|issue=1966|page=107-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware, enamelled with figures on a white background, and use [[fritware]], a [[silicon]]-based paste, rather than clay.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 64–73&lt;/ref&gt;  Metalworkers highlighted their intricate hammered designs with precious metal inlays.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky &amp; Rogers, 78–93&lt;/ref&gt;

One potter, [[Abū Zayd ibn Muḥammad ibn Abī Zayd]] (active c. 1186 – 1219, [[Kashan]]) has signed 15 surviving pieces, more than any other medieval Iranian potter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T000296  "Abu Zayd."] In Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online, (accessed February 5, 2012; subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safavid period==
[[Image:Plate pomegranates Louvre MAO868.jpg|thumb|right|''Plate decorated with two pomegranates'', v.&amp;nbsp;1500, [[the Louvre]]]]
[[Image:Tile young man flowers - Iran - Louvre museum - AD 27812.jpg|thumb|Tile with young man. Earthenware, painted on slip and under transparent glaze. Northwestern Iran, [[Kubachi ware]], 17th century.]]
The study and dating of ceramics under [[Shah Ismail]] and [[Shah Tahmasp]] is difficult because there are few pieces which are dated or which mention the place of production.  [[Chinese porcelain]] was collected by the elite, and was more highly valued than the local productions; Shah Abbas I donated much of the royal collection to the shrines at [[Ardabil]] and [[Mashhad]], renovating a room at Ardabil to display pieces in niches.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 101-104, 121-123, 137-159&lt;/ref&gt;  Many locations of workshops have been identified, although not with certainty, in particular: [[Nishapur]], [[Kubachi ware]], [[Kerman]] (moulded monochromatic pieces) and Mashhad. [[Lusterware]] was revived, using a different technique from the earlier production, and typically making small pieces with a design in a dark copper colour over a dark blue background. Unlike other wares, these use traditional Middle Eastern shapes and decoration rather than Chinese-inspired ones.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the designs tend to imitate those of Chinese porcelain, with the production of blue and white pieces with Chinese form and motifs, with motifs such as  chi clouds, and dragons.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 171&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Persian blue]] is distinguished from the [[Chinese blue]] by its more numerous and subtle nuances.  Often, quatrains by Persian poets, sometimes related to the destination of the piece (allusion to wine for a goblet, for example) occur in the scroll patterns. A completely different type of design, much more rare, carries iconography very specific to Islam (Islamic zodiac, bud scales, [[arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]) and seems influenced by the Ottoman world, as is evidenced by feather-edged anthemions (honeysuckle ornaments) widely used in Turkey.  New styles of figures appeared, influenced by the art of the book:  young, elegant cupbearers, young women with curved silhouettes, or yet cypress trees entangling their branches, reminiscent of the paintings of [[Reza Abbasi]]. 

Numerous types of pieces were produced: goblets, plates, long-necked bottles, [[spittoon]]s, etc.  A common shape is flasks with very small necks and bodies flattened on one side and very rounded on the other. Shapes borrowed from Islamic metalwork with decoration largely inspired by Chinese porcelain are characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 162-163, 218-219&lt;/ref&gt; With the closing of the Chinese market in 1659, Persian ceramic soared to new heights, to fulfill European needs.  The appearance of false marks of Chinese workshops on the backs of some ceramics marked the taste that developed in Europe for far-eastern porcelain, satisfied in large part by Safavid production.  This new destination led to wider use of Chinese and exotic iconography (elephants) and the introduction of new forms, sometimes astonishing ([[hookah]]s, octagonal plates, animal-shaped objects).

== Contemporary ==
One of the main areas in Iran that has a very special way of producing pottery is Kalpuregan. Kalpuregan village is located in south east of Iran. The only characteristic that distinguishes Kalpuregan from other areas is its indigenous pottery, creation of civilization by Baluchi women artists. According to one of the village elders, manufacturing practices dating back to about 4 to 6 thousand years ago still remains intact. The only workshop that is still active and persistent to continue working with primitive method is Kalpuregan pottery workshop.

Throughout the history the art of pottery in Kalpuregan has belonged to women since men had the burden of hunting or farming. According to historical evidence, indigenous women are creators of pottery art. In this land, delicate tasks are done by women and men only have the responsibility of preparing and firimg the clay.

Another thing that distinguishes pottery of the region from other parts of the country is that women in Kalpuregan do not use pottery wheel to make pottery. It is amazing that such a magnificent work is possible only with traditional and innovative methods and the help of rural women's loving cracked hands. Potteries in this area learn this art from their mothers or clan women.

Paintings on pottery are abstract symbols that remained from generation to generation and indicate the artist’s beliefs and spiritual desires of her surroundings. Often symbolic paintings are similar to early prehistoric pottery. Indigenous artist women in this area believe they should use simple and abstract geometric patterns to paint pottery pieces exactly like their Ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.farwayart.com/blog/indigenous-pottery-in-kalpuregan-iran|title=Indigenous pottery in Kalpuregan (Iran)|last=Art|first=Far Way|website=Far Way Art|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
There are large collections of Persian pottery at the [[British Museum]], the [[Hermitage Museum]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and elsewhere. In 2013, the Royal Ontario Museum, in partnership with [[Brill Publishers]] in the [[Netherlands]], published a special book about this art entitled "Persian Pottery in the First Global Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/persian-pottery-first-global-age |title=Persian Pottery in the First Global Age |publisher=Brill/ROM |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Portrait of an African Man''''' ({{lang-nl|Portret van een Afrikaanse man}}) also known as '''''Portrait of a Moor''''' ({{lang-nl|Portret van een Moor}})  is a painting by the [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Netherlandish Renaissance painter]] [[Jan Mostaert]]. Mostaert probably made the painting between c. 1525 and 1530, or slightly earlier. The exact subject of the painting has long been unclear, although numerous ideas have been put forward, including that the depicted figure is a soldier, a nobleman or [[Saint Maurice]]. The portrait is significant in that it may portray the earliest portrait of a specific black man in European painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sosha Lemmen|url=http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/251873|title=Ambassadeurs van het christendom – De representatieve en (politiek-)missionaire functies van portretten van zwarte mannen en vrouwen uit de 16de en vroege 17de eeuw|language=Dutch|date=1 February 2012|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rijksmuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-4986|title=Portrait of an African Man (Christophle le More?), Jan Jansz Mostaert, c. 1525 – c. 1530|work=Rijksstudio|publisher=[[Rijksmuseum]]|location=Amsterdam|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Saint Maurice, and [[Balthazar (Magus)|Balthazar]] of the Three Kings or [[Biblical Magi]], had long been usually portrayed as black.

==Subject==
If it is a portrait of a specific real individual, it appears to be the earliest known such painting of a black man in European painting.&lt;ref name=rijksmuseum/&gt;  The [[Rijksmuseum]], who own the painting, have said that it might be Christophle le More (Christopher the Moor), a black archer recorded at the court of the Habsburg emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].&lt;ref name=rijksmuseum/&gt; This theory could be supported by the badge of the Virgin on his cap, which would be a souvenir from a pilgrimage to [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]].&lt;ref name=rijksmuseum/&gt;
He has also been said to be a member of the entourage of [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy]] at her court in [[Mechelen]]. The posture, clothing and other details could indicate service at a European court and adaptation to their norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/recensies/rijksmuseum-koopt-portret-van-afrikaanse-man~a683831/ |title=Rijksmuseum koopt 'Portret van Afrikaanse man’ |language=Dutch |publisher=de Volkskrant |date=4 July 2005 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English historian Kate Lowe therefore argues he is a nobleman in the service of a visitor to the court at Mechelen, or such a visitor himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ernst van den Boogaart |url=http://www.groene.nl/artikel/een-portretwaardige-slaaf |title=Essay: een portretwaardige slaaf |language=Dutch |publisher=[[De Groene Amsterdammer]] |date=5 August 2005 |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars suggest that the insignia on his hat and bag may indicate possible Spanish or Portuguese origins.&lt;ref name=LivCol&gt;{{cite book|last=Jablonski|first=Nina|title=Living Color|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|isbn=978-0-520-25153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Wim Pijbes]], in a discussion on the Dutch folklore figure [[Zwarte Piet]] and his origins, mentions the ''Portrait of an African Man'', saying that the figure of Zwarte Piet is traceable to at least the 16th century, and the proud black figure depicted wearing a velvet jacket and a [[beret]] shows attributes nowadays associated with the figure of Zwarte Piet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/565895-wie-is-die-zwarte-piet-eigenlijk.html |title=Wie is die Zwarte Piet eigenlijk? |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] |date=23 October 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 a different explanation was offered by the literary and medieval scholar Marie-José Govers. She claimed the figure represented [[Saint Maurice]], a Roman soldier who by tradition came from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref name=nrc&gt;{{cite web|author=Marie-José Govers |url=http://www.nrc.nl/handelsblad/van/2014/november/07/niet-zwarte-piet-mauritius-in-rijks-1435497 |title=Niet Zwarte Piet, Mauritius in Rijks |language=Dutch |publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=7 November 2014 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Govers was to publish her research in 2015 but did so earlier to refute the remarks of Pijbes. She said that the figure depicted was an important man, not a servant. She bases this on the [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]] gloves, the belt which is covered with gemstones and the sword. She also adds that the sword is especially an attribute of Saint Maurice and that the [[pilgrim badge]] of Mary on his red beret makes him a Catholic. Govers adds that the time when the painting was made is also important. Govers claims this to be between 1520 and 1525 (disagreeing with the Rijksmuseum's view that the latter is about the earliest likely date).&lt;ref name=rijksmuseum/&gt; During that period [[Martin Luther]] was seen as a threat to the Catholic ruler Charles V. Luther was excommunicated by the Pope in 1520. Struggles between Catholics and Protestants were often violent. The depiction of Saint Maurice, a Christian who refused to fight against other Christians, could be related to this.&lt;ref name=nrc/&gt;

The art historian and curator Esther Schreuder disagrees with Govers's findings, stating that the evidence presented by Govers is too meager. Schreuder claims the sword is a typical symbol for a soldier and that Saint Maurice is most often depicted with a holy spear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Esther Schreuder |url=https://estherschreuder.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/st-mauritius-en-het-portret-van-mostaert/ |title=St Mauritius en het portret van Mostaert |language=Dutch |publisher=estherschreuder.wordpress.com |date=9 November 2014 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint Maurice==
Saint Maurice was very often depicted as a black soldier in northern Europe, and the years just before Mostaert's painting had produced such depictions in [[altarpiece]]s by the leading artists [[Matthias Grünewald]] (c. 1517–23) and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1522–25).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 011.jpg|The Grünewald]] and [[:File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Der heilige Mauritius.jpg|the Cranach]]&lt;/ref&gt;  But the small size of the Mostaert is more typical of a personal portrait.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==History==
The painting was bought from art dealer [[Robert Noortman]] by the Rijksmuseum in June 2005 with financial support of  amongst others the [[Rembrandt Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.verenigingrembrandt.nl/ul/cms/attachment/file/document/5/8/7/587/587/1/portret-van-een-afrikaanse-man.pdf |title=Portret van een Afrikaanse Man |language=Dutch |publisher=Vereniging Rembrandt |date= |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the purchase the painting was exhibited in the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] for some years due to renovations to the Rijksmuseum.&lt;ref name=rijksmuseum/&gt;

'''Robert Hubberthorne Burnside''' (August 13, 1873 – September 14, 1952)&lt;ref&gt;Scotlandspeople.org statutory birth records&lt;/ref&gt; was an American actor, director, producer, composer, and playwright.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wB8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA51 "R. H. Burnside"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]'', September 27, 1952, accessed December 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He was artistic director of the 5,200-seat [[New York Hippodrome]] from 1908 to 1923.  He wrote and staged hundreds of dramas, musicals and theatrical spectacles.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Burnside was born in [[Glasgow|Glasgow, Scotland]]. His father was George Burnside, a manager of the Gaiety Theatre in Glasgow. His mother was Margaret Thorne, an actress, whose father was William Hubberthorne, a theatre proprietor. His siblings were Janet Agnes (born about 1853), John, Ann R., Isabella, and George. Burnside attended the Great Yarmouth Academy.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1952/09/15/84356040.pdf "R. H. Burnside, 82, Producer, Is Dead. Former General Director of Old Hippodrome Staged 200 Shows During His Career"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 15, 1952, p. 25, accessed December 30, 2014 (payment required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.nypl.org/the/21994 R. H. Burnside collection], [[New York Public Library]], accessed December 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
As a child Burnside traveled on theatrical tours with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, William. "Burnside, R. H." in ''American National Biography Online'', accessed 6 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  His first stage appearance was as a dog in ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' in a royal command performance, starring [[Edward O'Connor Terry]], before the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

According to his passport application,&lt;ref&gt;Available at Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; he arrived in New York in October 1894, invited by [[Lillian Russell]] to direct her productions.  Beginning in 1900, he directed [[musical theatre]] at the [[New York Hippodrome]] and at other [[Broadway theatre]]s.  He was artistic director of the 5,200-seat [[New York Hippodrome]] from 1908 to 1923.  He composed the scores, wrote the librettos for, and directed the Broadway productions ''The Tourists'', ''Fascinating Flora'' (which he also produced), ''Jack o' Lantern, Happy Days, [[Good Times (musical)|Good Times]], Tip Top'' and ''Better Times''.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised his book for the musical ''Miss Billions'' in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Woollcott, Alexander. [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/12/10/archives/the-play-more-musical-comedy.html "More Musical Comedy",] ''The New York Times'', December 10, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the librettist and director for ''A Trip to Japan'' (1909, which he also produced), ''The International Cup, Chin Chin, Hip Hip Hooray!, The Big Show, Cheer Up, Everything, Stepping Stones'', and ''Three Cheers''.  He also directed the Broadway productions of others' works, such as ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1902), ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' (1905) and many others.  He joined ASCAP in 1914 as a charter member and collaborated with such composers as [[Raymond Hubbell]] and [[Gustave Kerker]].  His most famous songs were "You Can't Beat the Luck of the Irish", "Ladder of Roses", "Nice to Have a Sweetheart" and "Annabelle Jerome".  In 1935, 1942 and 1944, he staged many revivals of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas on Broadway.

The recording "The Ladder of Roses" from ''Hip-Hip-Hooray'' (1916)&lt;ref&gt;Released as Columbia A-2057&lt;/ref&gt; is not just a rendering of the song but documents a supposed rehearsal with Burnside in charge. He offers pointed and humorous criticism of the women's chorus, which finally sings the song's refrain at the recording's conclusion. During the course of Burnside's near-monologue, he introduces [[double entendre]]s referencing some of the notable Hippodrome shows such as ''Chin-Chin,'' ''Stop, Look, Listen'' and ''Cheer-Up''.  Here are two brief excerpts:

:BURNSIDE:  How many absences Mr. Stewart? Only one? Ah – Cleopatra Cassidy again!  Wonder what the excuse will be this time. I suppose she's had a fire in her house and she's waiting for the engines to arrive. Ah, here she is now. Good morning, Cleopatra. What's the trouble this time? Subway tied up again?  No?  Well, what happened? You're fifteen minutes late and everybody's waiting for you. What's that?

:CLEOPATRA: Had some trouble with my motor again!

:BURNSIDE: Well, you'll have some trouble with your salary again at the end of the week. Now come along everybody and let's get this rehearsal started.  (''choristers start talking noisily among themselves'')  Stop talking girls! This isn't a suffragette meeting.

Another excerpt: "Now stop, look, and listen all of you. The singing last night was awful. You must pay more attention to the musical director. All except you, Agnes – you're paying too much attention to him. If you don't stop it, I'll call his wife's attention to you!"  This recording was reissued on CD in the 1990s on the set ''Music from the New York Stage, 1890–1920''&lt;ref&gt;Pearl GEMM CDS 9056-8, vol. 3 (disc 2, track 17).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, he directed the film ''[[Manhattan (1924 film)|Manhattan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0122944/ R. H. Burnside] at the IMDB database&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside was the Shepherd (president) of [[The Lambs]] club from 1918 to 1921.&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;Hardee, Lewis J., Jr. [https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ujp_4nUEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''The Lambs Theatre Club''], Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland Publishing, 2010 [2006], p. 120. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-6095-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1905, Burnside married Katherine.  The couple had three daughters, Catherine, born about 1907, Helen Marguerite, born March 1, 1912, and Betty, born about 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Based on information supplied to the 1920 and 1930 United States Federal Census, available on Ancestry.com. Catherine is not listed in the 1930 census.&lt;/ref&gt; Helen married George Edward Blewitt on September 21, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;"Blewitt-Burnside," ''New York Times'', September 22, 1935, p. N5.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnside was the president (Shepherd) of [[The Lambs]], a theatrical club, from 1918 to 1921.&lt;ref name=lamb/&gt; Burnside became a naturalized American citizen in Manhattan on July 3, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;See Naturalizations, Southern District, [http://www.Italiangen.org ItalianGen].&lt;/ref&gt;  His wife Katherine died in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;William Stephenson, "Burnside, R. H." in ''American National Biography Online'', accessed 6 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside died at the Middlesex Nursing Home in [[Metuchen, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Because of his position as director and producer at the Hippodrome, Burnside inherited the legacies of Charles Dillingham and [[Charles Frohman]].  Upon his death, the material – including an extensive correspondence, business records, scripts, costume designs and other material – was donated to The [[New York Public Library]]. There the business records and correspondence are in the Manuscripts Division; scripts, production notes and designs are in the Billy Rose Theatre Division, and musical scores are held in the Music Division.

The '''Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük''' (also '''Çatal Höyük''') is a baked-clay, nude female form, seated between feline-headed arm-rests. It is generally thought&lt;ref&gt;A typical assessment: "A terracotta statuette of a seated (mother) goddess giving birth with each hand on the head of a leopard or panther from Çatalhöyük (dated around 6000 B.C.E.)" (Sarolta A. Takács, "Cybele and Catullus' ''Attis''", in Eugene N. Lane, ''Cybele, Attis and related cults: essays in memory of M.J. Vermaseren'' 1996:376.&lt;/ref&gt; to depict a corpulent and fertile [[Mother Goddess]]&lt;ref&gt;So rendered in popularized accounts, such as ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'', 2005: ''s.v.'' "Hittite-Hurrian mythology": "...the goddess of Çatalhöyük,&lt;!--Hüyük in original--&gt; her Anatolian descendants were the great [[Phrygia]]n goddess Cybele, the mother of the sacrificed [[Attis]], and the many-breasted [[Temple of Artemis|Artemis of Ephesus]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in the process of giving birth while seated on her throne, which has two hand rests in the form of  feline (leopard or panther) heads. The statuette, one of several [[iconography|iconographically]] similar ones found at the site, is associated to other corpulent prehistoric goddess figures,&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Honour and Fleming 2005 "Ch.1: Before History"&lt;/ref&gt; of which the most famous is the [[Venus of Willendorf]].

It is a [[neolithic]] sculpture shaped by an unknown artist, and was completed sometime about 6000 BC. It was unearthed by [[archaeologist]] [[James Mellaart]] in 1961 at [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Turkey]]. When it was found, its head and hand rest of the right side were missing. The current head and the hand rest are modern replacements. The sculpture is at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in [[Ankara]], Turkey.

[[Image:Shemahinskaya boyaderka 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A dancer from [[Shamakhi]]. [[Grigory Gagarin|G.Gagarin]], mid-19th century]]
The '''Shamakhi dancers''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: ''Şamaxı rəqqasələri'') were the principal dancers of the entertainment groups that existed in [[Shamakhi]] ([[Azerbaijan]]) up to the late 19th century. These groups worked similarly to [[tawaif]]s.

[[Russia]]n painter [[Grigory Gagarin]] who lived in the [[Caucasus]] in 1840–1855 depicted the Shamakhi dancers in a series of paintings, in which he referred to them as ''bayaderki''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/az/cultur/359/ Ими восхищался Дюма] by Emil Karimov and Mehpara Aliyeva. ''Azeri.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; (баядерки; sg. ''bayaderka'' – баядерка; originally the Portuguese term ''balliadera'' borrowed into Russian and other European languages via French (''bayadère'') and initially used to refer to the [[devadasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayadère. Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved February 1st, 2008 from Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The extant documents regarding the Shamakhi dancers, and dances, are very limited. In literature, Shamakhi dancers are referred to in [[Arthur Gobineau|Comte de Gobineau]]'s novel ''The dancing girl of Shamakha and other Asiatic tales''.

''The Dancer of Shamakha'' recounts the life of Armenian dancer [[Armen Ohanian]], her education as a dancer, her childhood in Russia, and her travels in Iran and Egypt. It was published in French as ''La Danseuse de Shamakha'' in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by [[Rose Wilder]].  After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles.  She eventually moved to Mexico.  She is the author of some 15 publications including autobiographical volumes and books on culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ohanian, Armen.  ''La Danseuse de Shamakha''.  Forward by Anatole France. Paris: Bernard Grasset, 1918

'''TRIAD Berlin''' is a German [[exhibition design]] firm based in [[Berlin]] with an office in [[Shanghai]]. The agency is best known for the development of two major sports museums: the [[German Football Museum]] in [[Dortmund]] and the [[FIFA World Football Museum]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/football-in-museums/av-19083717 |title=Football in museums|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[File:Expo 2010 Shanghai, Urban Planet Pavilion.jpg|thumb|''Urban Planet'' pavilion, Expo 2010 Shanghai]]
The Berlin agency was founded in 1994 by Lutz Engelke to realize the exhibition ''The Dream of Vision – Age of Televisions'' at [[Gasometer Oberhausen]] in the city of [[Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/koepfe/triad-berlin-eine-agentur-mit-der-besonderen-dna/12526828.html|title=Eine Agentur mit der besonderen DNA|publisher=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=1 November 2015|access-date=2018-03-16|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After designing the theme pavilion ''[[Expo 2010 pavilions#Urban Planet Pavilion|Urban Planet]]'' at [[Expo 2010]], the company also has an additional permanent office in Shanghai, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-11/02/content_11489135.htm |title=How to build cities with character|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency focusses on spatial communication and sees itself as a ''Think &amp; Do Tank''. Its main goal is to turn complex ideas into tangible experiences. Although the content of the projects varies, the method used for their development is always the same: the creation of stories that can be experienced from abstract ideas. A key component of this process is the development of a narrative that structures the messages and guides the visitor through the exhibition. Most of the times, the [[storytelling]] is enhanced by digital media. TRIAD exhibitions rely heavily on digital interactive exhibits with the intention of bridging the gap between the intellectual learning process and the physical experience. In many cases, TRIAD combines education and entertainment in a multimedia space. The result is the so-called [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]], whose goal is to educate through entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Engelke/Osswald, 2017, p. 964.&lt;/ref&gt;

TRIAD has applied edutainment concepts to various projects focused on children's education, such as the 2018 exhibition on the [[MS Wissenschaft]] about working life of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ms-wissenschaft.de/english/ |title=MS Wissenschaft – The Floating Science Center|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the company has used this approach in the [[Brandenburg Gate Museum]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/emotionen-am-tor-the-gate-zeigt-stadtgeschichte-in-einer-multimedia-show/13511474.html|title="The Gate" zeigt Stadtgeschichte in einer Multimedia-Show|access-date=2017-03-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is also tackling other challenges that exhibitions face today, like the creation of barrier-free museums. An example of this is the exhibition ''Wilderness Dreams'' in [[Eifel National Park]] which is part of the [[United Nations Decade on Biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.undekade-biologischevielfalt.de/projekte/aktuelle-projekte-beitraege/detail/projekt-details/show/Wettbewerb/1863/?cHash=59202f3f0faf587a430c6400f5b54774&amp;L=0 |title=„Wildnis(t)räume im Nationalpark-Zentrum Eifel|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Projects ==
The agency designs exhibitions, museums, experience centers, [[trade fair]]s, [[expo pavilion]]s, edutainment concepts, brand environments and events. A lot of the company's projects focus on three main areas: sustainability, sports, and culture.

'''''The Amazing Bone''''' is a 32-page [[picture book]] by [[William Steig]] from 1976. It was nominated for the [[Caldecott Medal]] in 1977; however, [[Leo &amp; Diane Dillon]]'s ''[[Ashanti to Zulu: African Traditions]]'' won, so ''The Amazing Bone'' only received the [[Caldecott Honor]] Award.&lt;ref name="Haase2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haase|first=Donald|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: Q-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVHhj-GIk0wC&amp;pg=PA919|accessdate=4 November 2012|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313334443|page=919}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of Steig's few books in which the main character is a female.

The story is about how Pearl the [[pig]] is walking home from school, and finds a [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] bone on the ground, which has the ability to imitate any sound and speak in any [[language]] (It samples Spanish, Polish and German for her). Pearl takes it with her, and on the way home they have several misadventures, including an encounter with a hungry [[fox]] who wants to eat Pearl for dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/arts/design/03conn.html|title=Worlds Outfoxed by a Wily Inner Child|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|date=3 March 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was featured in an episode of the [[PBS]] television show ''Storytime'' in which it was read to a live audience.

==Adaptation==
In the mid 80's a short [[animation|animated]] film was made of this book, with [[John Lithgow]] as the narrator. Lithgow also gave his voice for another film adaptation of a William Steig book, ''[[Shrek]]''.

A children's musical was produced at [[Lifeline Theatre]] in Chicago, Illinois in 1996.  This adaptation, by [http://www.ericlanebarnes.com Eric Lane Barnes], was also produced at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100216073354/http://www.pigandbone.com/Site/Home.html Morgan-Wixson Theatre] in Santa Monica, California in 2010.

"'''The Flying Trunk'''" (''Den flyvende Kuffert'') is a [[fairy tale]] by the Danish [[poet]] and [[author]] [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a young man who has a flying trunk that carries him to Turkey where he visits the Sultan's daughter. The tale was first published [[1839 in literature|1839]].

== Plot summary ==
A young man squanders his inheritance until he has nothing left but a few shillings, a pair of slippers, and an old dressing-gown. A friend sends him a trunk with directions to pack up and be off. Having nothing to pack, he gets into the trunk himself. The trunk is enchanted and carries him to the land of the Turks. He uses the trunk to visit the sultan's daughter, who is kept in a tower because of a [[Self-fulfilling prophency|prophecy]] that her marriage would be unhappy.

He persuades her to marry him. When her father and mother visit her tower, he tells them a story. They are impressed and consent to the marriage. To celebrate his upcoming marriage, the young man buys fireworks and flies over the land setting them off. Returning to the earth, a spark incinerates the trunk, and the young man can no longer visit the princess in the tower. Instead, he wanders the world, telling stories.

==Analysis==

The trunk suggests the flying carpets of "[[The Arabian Nights]]", a collection of tales Andersen read and loved as a child.

== Publication ==

The tale was first published in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]] by C.A. Reitzel 19 October 1839 as part of ''Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. Second Booklet. 1839.'' (''Eventyr, fortalte for Børn. Ny Samling. Andet Hefte. 1839.''). "The Flying Trunk" was the second tale in the booklet with "The Garden of Paradise" (''Paradisets Have'') being the first, and "The Storks" (''Storkene'') being the third and last. "The Flying Trunk" was republished 18 December 1849 as a part of ''Fairy Tales. 1850.'' (''Eventyr. 1850.''), and again 15 December 1862 as a part of ''Fairy Tales and Stories. First Volume. 1862.'' (''Eventyr og Historier. Første Bind. 1862.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=24 Hans Christian Andersen Center: Hans Christian Andersen: The Flying Trunk]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The River Bank (Ophelia)''''' is a 1980 painting by the English painter [[David Inshaw]]. The subject is from [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]''. It was made for a joint exhibition of the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]], where each artist made his own interpretation of the subject. Since 2015 it belongs to the [[Victoria Art Gallery]] in [[Bath, Somerset]].

==Description==
The painting depicts an [[English landscape garden|English garden]]. In the foreground is a river, in which a drowned woman lies. Another woman is running away, holding her red, broad-brimmed hat with both hands.

==Themes==
The [[Victoria Art Gallery]] writes: "In ''The River Bank'' we see the contrast between the carefully ordered world of the enclosed garden and the untamed wildness of the river bank, between reason and the madness that overcame Ophelia, this tragic Shakespearean character."&lt;ref name="victoriagal"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-05-17|url=https://www.victoriagal.org.uk/news/david-inshaw-acquisition|title=David Inshaw Acquisition|publisher=[[Victoria Art Gallery]]|accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sujata Iyengar, professor of English at the [[University of Georgia]], wrote in the 2016 book ''Rethinking Feminism in Early Modern Studies'': "The postmodern hyperrealistic style, with vivid colors and granular detail on, for example, the petals of an [[Iris (plant)|iris]], clongates and twists the women's bodies, the clothing of the drowned girl, and the shapes of greenery in a way that makes it hard for us to know whether we are seeing Gertrude (or a ladies' maid) discovering Ophelia's corpse, or Ophelia herself in both past and present, both contemplating suicide and achieving it."&lt;ref name="iyengar"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Iyengar|first=Sujata|year=2016|chapter=Gertrude/Ophelia: Feminist Intermediality, Ekphrasis, and Tenderness in ''Hamlet''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgxqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172|editor1-last=Loomba|editor1-first=Ania|editor2-last=Sanchez|editor2-first=Melissa E.|title=Rethinking Feminism in Early Modern Studies: Gender, Race, and Sexuality|location=London; New York City|publisher=[[Routledge]]|p=172|isbn=978-1-4724-2175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was made for a joint exhibition of the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]], of which Inshaw was a founding member. The character [[Ophelia]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' was the common theme for the entire exhibition.&lt;ref name="iyengar" /&gt;

It was bought by a private collector in October 1980. It was sold on 9 December 2015 as part of [[Christie's]] auction ''Modern British &amp; Irish Art'' (Sale 10443).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsalesindex.artinfo.com/auctions/David-Inshaw-6068683/The-River-Bank-(Ophelia)-1980|title=''The River Bank (Ophelia)''|work=Blouin Art Sales Index|publisher=[[Louise Blouin Media]]|accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by the [[Victoria Art Gallery]] with support from the ACE/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund and the Friends of the Victoria Art Gallery.&lt;ref name="victoriagal" /&gt;

|ShortSummary= In 1977, after being rejected by Mattel and Hasbro, [[Lucasfilm]] signed with [[Kenner Products]] to have toys produced for their sci-fi film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. This was a huge gamble, as Kenner was a small toy company at the time and the negotiation process started late due to [[George Lucas]]' secrecy over the ship designs. Since then, toy sales of the ''Star Wars'' franchise have totaled to US$14 billion worldwide.

|ShortSummary= In a toy industry dominated by the male demographic, [[Mattel]] co-founder [[Ruth Handler]] broke new ground in 1959 when she took a concept based on the German [[Bild Lilli doll]] and introduced the world to Barbie. The toy line has since become the largest selling doll and one of the most influential toys in modern history, selling over a billion dolls globally.

|ShortSummary= Searching for a new toy line for boys to compete with ''Star Wars'' after their toy lines for ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' and ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' flopped, designers at Mattel saw inspiration from [[Frank Frazetta]]'s artworks, as well as their creative imagination, and launched the ''Masters of the Universe'' action figures. The toy line dominated in sales from US$38.2 million in 1982 to US$400 million in 1986 before its demise in 1987 as a result of sales dropping to US$7 million and the critical and financial failure of the [[Masters of the Universe (film)|live-action film adaptation]].

|ShortSummary= Introduced in 1964, [[Hasbro]]'s [[G.I. Joe: America's Movable Fighting Man]] was the first action figure in toy history, but an [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and declining sales led to the line's demise in 1978. Desperate to hold their own against Kenner's ''Star Wars'' line, Hasbro took inspiration from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan-era]] [[Cold War (1979–1985)|Cold War]] to revive the line as ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'' in 1982, making over US$51 million that year and becoming one of the most influential boys' toys of all time.

|ShortSummary= Since the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] went on the air in 1966, the ''Star Trek'' franchise has had a history of ups and downs in the toy business - from [[Aluminum Model Toys|AMT]]'s faithful scale model kit of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] to [[Remco]]'s obscure tie-in merchandise, to [[Mego Corporation|Mego]]'s best–selling action figure line. Following Mego's bankruptcy in 1983 and a string of flops by [[Ertl Company|Ertl]] and [[Galoob]], [[Playmates Toys|Playmates]] picked up the toy license in the late 1980s and sparked a resurgence in the franchise's toy sales. From the mid-2000s onwards, companies such as [[Diamond Select Toys|Art Asylum]] and [[McFarlane Toys]] continue to keep the ''Star Trek'' toy franchise alive.

{{Episode list

|Title = [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]]
|OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|5|25}}
|ShortSummary= In 1983, when Hasbro was looking for a fresh, new line to sell alongside G.I. Joe, they bought the license of the [[Diaclone]] and [[Micro Change]] toys from [[Tomy|Takara]], then commissioned [[Marvel Comics]] to come up with a story-line and character names for the toys. The result: [[Transformers: Generation 1|Transformers]]. Despite [[Tonka]] releasing the cheaper [[Gobots]] line six months earlier, Hasbro's Transformers took the toy market by storm in 1984, raking in US$50 million that year. At the peak of the toy line's popularity, ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' hit theaters to further capitalize on its success, but the film polarized fans and collectors with the death of [[Optimus Prime]] and majority of the original characters. As Hasbro took full control of Transformers from Takara by the late 1980s, sales declined until the toy line was discontinued in 1991. After the failed [[Transformers: Generation 2|Generation 2]] reboot, ''[[Beast Wars: Transformers|Beast Wars]]'' rejuvenated the franchise in 1995. In 2007, the [[Transformers (film)|live-action ''Transformers'' film]] solidified Transformers' position as Hasbro's flagship toy line.

|Title = [[Lego|LEGO]]
|OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|5|25}}
|ShortSummary= In 1949, after decades of making wooden furniture and toys, [[Ole Kirk Christiansen]]'s small factory in [[Billund, Denmark]], moved to plastic and created the "Automatic Binding Bricks", which would later be known as LEGO. When the company patented the tube system in 1958, LEGO became the dominant toy line worldwide throughout the 1960s and 1970s. When other competitors capitalized on the expiration of the company's patents in the 1980s, LEGO faced stiff competition until they reported their first loss in 1998. Poor business decisions with film licenses and the failure of the Jack Stone and ''[[Galidor: Defenders of the Outer Dimension|Galidor]]'' lines brought LEGO to near-bankruptcy until [[Jørgen Vig Knudstorp]] took over the company and, by bringing it back to its roots, rejuvenated LEGO's profits. By the time ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' hit theaters in 2014, LEGO became the largest toy franchise in the world.

|ShortSummary= After leaving his job in the government, Japanese bureaucrat [[Shintaro Tsuji]] formed a toy and gift company in 1960 that would later be known as [[Sanrio]]. The company had success producing merchandise for popular manga such as ''[[Anpanman]]'' before purchasing the license for ''[[Peanuts]]''. But after being fed up with paying royalties to [[Charles M. Schulz]], Sanrio decided to create their own characters. In 1974, Tsuji and designer [[Yuko Shimizu]] worked on a cat-based character that eventually became Hello Kitty. Since her debut, Hello Kitty has become not only the best–selling girl's toy in Japan, but also a pop culture icon for all ages worldwide, earning at least US$5 billion a year.

The '''Tsebelda iconostasis''' is an Early Medieval peace of Christian art from [[Abkhazia]]/[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a limestone fragment of an altar screen from the 7th or 8th century, which were discovered near the village of [[Tsebelda (village)|Tsebelda]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="am"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berdzenishvili|first1=Irma|title=ადრე შუა საუკუნეთა ხანის რელიეფური სკულპტურის ძეგლები აფხაზეთიდან [Early Middle Ages Sculptural Monuments from Abkhazia]|journal=Amirani|date=2008|volume=20|pages=34-36|url=http://www.caucasology.com/amirani20/berdzenishvili.pdf|language=Georgian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two largest surviving fragments are on display at the [[Georgian National Museum]] in [[Tbilisi]], with smaller pieces also kept at a museum in [[Sukhumi]].

The ''' ''xenia'' motif''' in Roman [[mosaic]] is a [[still life]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] consisting of a grouping of various items, mostly edible, representing a generous offering (a ''xenia'') from a wealthy host to his guests.  The items are often spread across different compartments in floor mosaic schemes. No doubt there were once paintings, but these have been lost.

Typical elements of a ''xenia'' motif include game hanging from hooks, fish, baskets of fruit (often overturned), and the like. [[Vitruvius]] lists specifically "poultry, eggs, vegetables, and other country produce".&lt;ref&gt;''[[de Architectura]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/6*.html#7.4 VI:7:4]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xenia'' motifs are typically found in reception rooms.

[[Xenia (Greek)|The word ''xenia'']] is Greek, and means 'hospitality'; in Latin, it came to mean presents for guests, and later presents in general. It also came to include a class of [[epigram]]matic inscription attached to the presents, [[xenia epigram]]s.
