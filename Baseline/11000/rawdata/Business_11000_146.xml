      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3993">'''Aldo Garzanti''' (1883 in [[Forlì]] - 1961 in [[San Pellegrino Terme]]) was an Italian entrepreneur and publisher.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/aldo-garzanti_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|title=Garzanti, Aldo|publisher=[[Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani]] - Volume 52|year=1999|accessdate=9 December 2013|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in Forlì, his father was a schoolteacher and follower of Garibaldi. He was educated in his native city where G. Mazzatinti introduced him to librarianship. He then studied at the Faculty of Letters in the [[University of Bologna]], graduating in 1907.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

Immediately after graduating, he joined a group of intellectuals associated with the journal ''La Romagna nella storia, nella letteratura e nelle arti'', becoming its editor in 1911. He took a special interest in the social and economic history of the region, publishing accounts of developments from the 16th to the 18th centuries. At the same time, he took up teaching, first at the high school in [[Rimini]], then at [[Alatri]] (1909) and [[Chieri]] (1912). During the [[First World War]], he enlisted in the artillery until April 1919 when he was discharged with the rank of captain.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Business career==

Immediately after the war he moved to Milan where he gave up teaching in favour of a business career, becoming the Italian agent for American chemicals producers including [[Dupont de Nemours]] and founding his own company, Dott. Aldo Garzanti Coloranti et Prodotti Chimici, a distribution outlet supplying the textile and leather industries. As a result of his success, in 1921 he was able to open his own manufacturing company, SADAF, which produced dyes and chemicals for soaking and tanning hides and leathers. In 1932, he widened his interests, opening MIRET specializing in lace and silk. The following year he created a model agricultural enterprise in [[Suvignano]], [[Tuscany]] but above all, in 1936, he acquired the Treves publishing company which was in difficulty. Created in 1861 by [[Emilio Treves]], Fratelli Treves Editori had been a leading publisher not only in [[Lombardy]] but throughout Italy. After changing its name to Casa Editrice Garzanti, he received support from [[Benito Mussolini]] which brought him lucrative commissions from the library authorities, making it one of the top publishing companies in Italy.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garzantilibri.it/default.php?page=casaed|title=Garzanti Libri s.p.a.|publisher=Garzanti Libri|accessdate=11 December 2013 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company suffered during the [[Second World War]] when the old Treves printing plant was bombed but Garzanti was successful in rebuilding modern facilities within a year, winning the Roncoroni prize for rapid redevelopment. In 1952, suffering from poor health, he retired as managing director of the company but remained chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Later life==
In later life, Garzanti devoted his efforts mainly to philanthropic activities, contributing to the restoration of the castle Rocca Caterina Sforza in Forlì and assisting artists through the Fondazione Livio e Maria Garzanti. In 1954, he financed the Italian expedition which successfully climbed [[K2]]. He died in 1961 at the age of 78.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Family==

In 1920, Garzanti married Maria Ravasi who gave birth to their son Livio in 1921. Livio later took over the family publishing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cultura/11_giugno_20/torno-novanta-anni-livio-garzanti_94474866-9b25-11e0-b9a7-5cbc176a671d.shtml|title=La crisi italiana è culturale|publisher=Corriere della Sera|accessdate=11 December 2013 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bottecchia is a historical bicycle company that started as a small cyclery of Carnielli and improved in 1924 by [[Ottavio Bottecchia]]. A new company with a new name "Bottecchia" was born after the death of [[Ottavio Bottecchia]] in 1926. In 1940 the work force of Bottecchia was 100 people and the company became an outstanding race firm with the historical name of Ottavio Bottecchia and under the management of the Carnielli family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bottecchia.com/en/azienda/storia|title=HISTORY {{!}} Reparto Corse|website=www.bottecchia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were the technical sponsor of the [[Acqua &amp; Sapone]] professional Italian team, which rode the [[Giro d'Italia]] on Bottecchia SP9s in 2010 and on Bottecchia Emme 2s in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lennard Zinn|date=June 7, 2011|title=Technical FAQ|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2011/06/bikes-and-tech/technical-faq/lennard-zinn-technical-faq-tubular-v-tubeless-for-the-pros-getting-that-special-bike_177569|journal=VeloNews|accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bicycle manufacture==
Until now Bottecchia makes a lot of [[Racing bicycle|race]] frames. The company also produces bikes for daily purposes and bicycle parts named "BTC" used only internally. The race profile of the company, is recently imported in the trekking line ("tempo libero") by offering a carbon trekking bike for daily use.

A '''budtender''' is a title of a staff member who works within a [[dispensary]] or store where medical or recreational [[cannabis]] is sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/11/11/marijuana_legalization_and_language_budtenders_ganjapreneurs_420_joints.html|title=How Will Legalization Affect the Language Around Marijuana?|last=Dictionaries|first=Oxford|date=2014-11-11|work=Slate|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their job is to offer suggestions to customers, answer questions, handle products and showcase products being sold.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecannabist.co/2014/06/13/marijuana-terms-and-definitions-cannabis-lexicon-glossary-pot-terminology/13174/|title=The definitive cannabis lexicon: Marijuana terms from A-Z|date=2014-06-13|work=The Cannabist|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Budtender, a term recognized by [[Merriam-Webster]] as of March 2018,&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/budtender-as-marijuana-goes-legal-so-does-its-slang|title=As Marijuana Goes Mainstream, So Does Its Slang|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[portmanteau]] that combines the word [[bartender]] and [[bud]]. Like a bartender, budtenders serve customers within a licensed establishment while the word bud is referring to the dried flower tops of Cannabis used for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_basics.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis Vault: Basics|website=www.erowid.org|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications ==
The first budtenders gained knowledge through Cannabis farmers, extraction technicians, edible chefs and other cannabis experts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early days of legalized medical cannabis no prior schooling was needed to work as a budtender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of 2017, no [[license]] or [[certification]] is needed to be a budtender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because Cannabis is still illegal on a national level, no national licensing standards have been implemented.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/07/19/marijuana-salesperson-budtender-license/83958/|title=Do you need a license or certificate to be a budtender (weed salesperson)?|date=2017-07-19|work=The Cannabist|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most budtenders are self taught cannabis [[connoisseur]]s while some are trained formally. Training institutions include: Green CulturED, The Cannabis Training Institute, and Cannabis Trainers each with their own curriculum. For Green Cultured the total cost of the certifications is $119.00, Cannabis Training Institute is $299.00 for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecannabisreporter.com/want-budtender/|title=Want to Be A Budtender?

== Careers ==

=== Experience and knowledge ===
[[File:Cannabis Dispensary flower.jpg|thumb|right|Budtender behind a counter with various cannabis strains, 2018]]

Budtenders have to be qualified to work in a dispensary and must have a wide range of cannabis knowledge. In order to provide customers with a positive experience at a dispensary, budtenders need to demonstrate their knowledge of [[Cannabis strains|strains]], [[Cannabis edible|cannabis products]] and [[Medical cannabis|medical use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/budtender-product-spotlight-austin-tucker-dockside-cannabis-sodo-seattle|title=Budtender Spotlight: 5 Favorites From Dockside’s Austin Tucker {{!}} Leafly|date=2017-04-26|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They need to know the characteristics of each strain of cannabis they sell, based on their taste, smell and [[Effects of cannabis|effects]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leafly.com/news/industry/how-to-get-hired-to-work-in-the-medical-cannabis-industry-part-2|title=How to Get Hired to Work in the Legal Cannabis Industry Part 2: Getting Hired as a Budtender {{!}} Leafly|date=2015-05-05|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a customer were to ask about a specific strain that the dispensary does not have, a budtender should be able to recommend a similar strain with their broad understanding of cannabis in terms of the attributes of the customer’s original request. A budtender should also be able to adhere to the necessity for a medical marijuana user. Their ability to understand the medical circumstances of certain strains is critical and essential for the safety of the customer. Budtenders may stay aware of cannabis trends is by checking [[social media]] and industry [[blog]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Customer service ===
Since budtenders work one-on-one with customers, it is essential that they provide a welcoming environment for them. A budtender's job is to provide and share their knowledge of cannabis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leafly.com/news/industry/4-traits-of-a-bad-cannabis-budtender|title=4 Bad Budtender Habits that Consumers Notice (and Hate) {{!}} Leafly|date=2015-08-13|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a customer, have the ability to teach those who have never tried cannabis before and to provide insight to new trends or strains. Budtenders also sometimes share stories&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in order to market to a customer and also to create a friendlier environment. These stories are meant to provide apprehension of what a customer might feel or do when they use a certain type of cannabis. However, budtenders are not recommended to push their products by telling fake stories and experiences in order to get a customer to buy something;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; this is considered bad customer service within the industry. Also, budtenders are commended when they have good hygiene when addressing or working with customers. Having clean hands and tidy attire&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; are critical when a budtender works with a customer. Budtenders are also recommended to use tongs or gloves&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; when pulling out a sample from a jar instead of reaching in with their bare hands. Finally, budtenders are also highly recommended to express a sense of passion for their product in order to spark interest from a customer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Income ===
Because the distribution and use of marijuana is illegal on a [[Federal government of the United States|federal level]], budtending salaries vary per state. However as of 2014, the general hourly income for a budtender is $11–12 per hour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cannarecruiter.com/budtender-job-description/|title=Budtender Job Description: What is a Budtender? Qualifications Overview|date=2016-11-28|work=Canna Recruiter|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the perks of being a budtender is that many dispensaries give [[Discounting|discounts]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; of their product to their employees.

In the United States, there are 9 states that have legalized recreational marijuana, and another 21 states that have made medical marijuana legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/where-can-you-can-legally-smoke-weed-2018-1|title=Here's where you can legally smoke marijuana in 2018|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budtenders in these states are held to state legislation, and must comply with state law.

===Oregon===
Oregon, one of the 9 recreational marijuana states, is regulated by the [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]] (OLCC), and require all budtenders to be at least 21 years or older to obtain a license and or permit.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/Documents/Marijuana_Worker_Permit/MJ_WorkerPermitEducation_English.pdf|title=Recreational Marijuana Worker Permit Education|last=|first=|date=May 21, 2018|website=www.oregon.gov|archive-url=http://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/Documents/Marijuana_Worker_Permit/MJ_WorkerPermitEducation_English.pdf|archive-date=July 1, 2016|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it be production or processing purposes, any budtender who actively handles marijuana, must have a permit to secure or sell marijuana items.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Having these permits is necessary under Oregon law, however; permits are only valid for five years from the date issued by the OLCC. All permits under the commission grant an employee access to any licensed marijuana business in the state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Being a fairly regulated business, all budtenders are required by state law to have their worker permits readily available at any time while working, in case of immediate inspection by OLCC regulatory staff or enforcement officer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is advised to keep the permit on one's self when working, for this immediate reason. If a budtender who possesses a legal permit were to be convicted by the state for misdemeanor or felony, they have 10 days to submit a written notification to the Commission.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; No permit is transferable; the permit to sell recreational marijuana belongs to the permittee.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The only applicable license type that allows the sale of marijuana items to a consumer is the retail license. Every retailer must verify the age of every customer, for any and all purchases, and can only sell between the hours of 7am-10pm.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A budtender cannot offer free samples to customers, give free marijuana items, or provide any form of discount if the sale is inline with the sale of other items. Retailers may only receive marijuana products from the OLCC licensed producers, processors, and wholesalers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Carlos Villanueva Magdaluyo''' (May 20, 1921 in [[Pasay City]], [[Philippines]] – 1995) is a Filipino businessman. He was the director of [[Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation|PAGCOR]].

==Early life and education==
Little is known for his ancestry and early life. But, he is of [[Aklanon people|Aklanon]] descent. The name '''Magdaluyo''' came from [[Kalibo, Aklan|Kalibo]], [[Aklan]].

He graduated from BS Business Administrator at [[Far Eastern University – Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance]].

==Business career==
He was employed as cashier and slowly assumed other administrative and gaming responsibilities to become one of the pillars of [[Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation|PAGCOR]]. He started the gambling business in 1946 as a cashier in a casino in Manila.

After [[Martial law in the Philippines#Ferdinand Marcos|Martial Law]] was declared by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on September 21, 1972, Carlos decided to live a simple life with his kids.  After the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution, Carlos assumed the position of Vice President for Operations of the revived PAGCOR, and became the heart and soul of moving the nationalized gambling industry in the country.  Carlos, together with his Son Raymundo has for so many decades been moving for the legalization of casinos in the Philippines.  Together with Murray Hertz, their group even introduced the world of casino operations to the Koreans, setting up shop in Inchon in the 1960s.

==Death==
He celebrated his 74th birthday on May 20, 1995 in [[Batangas]]. Later that year, he died of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] at the age of 74.

==Legacy==
His grandson, Raymund Magdaluyo, together with his cousins opened [[Patio Carlito]]—a tribute for their grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=http://www.ourawesomeplanet.com/awesome/2011/06/patio-carlito-old-manila-bistro-by-raymund-magdaluyo.html |title=Patio Carlito &amp; WhiteHouse on 84th by Raymund Magdaluyo |publisher=Our Awesome Planet |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patio Carlito is similar to Abe (a tribute restaurant focused on old Kapampangan cuisine), except that it has a 1960s feel. It competes directly with Mario's  for group dining and the Sunday family buffet crowd. It is a good alternative to the best Filipino restos in the area—Bagoong Club and Romulo Cafe—and would make a nice venue for a get-together with balikbayans.

[[File:Чарльз Берд.jpg|thumb|Charles Baird]]
[[File:ПервыйРусскийПароход.jpg|thumb|''Elizaveta'', the first Russian steamship]]
'''Charles Baird''' (20 December 1766 – 10 December 1843) was a Scottish engineer who played an important part in the industrial and business life of 19th-century [[St. Petersburg]]. His company specialised in steam-driven machinery and was responsible for Russia's first steamboat.

==Biography==
Born at Westerton, [[Bothkennar]], [[Stirlingshire]], a farm owned by the Gascoigne family, Charles was one of the nine children of Nicol Baird, who later became a toll collector and then superintendent of works for the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]]. He was originally baptised Gascoigne Baird in January 1767. His younger brother [[Hugh Baird (engineer)|Hugh Baird]] also became an engineer. Charles Baird started his working life in 1782 as an apprentice at the [[Carron Ironworks]] near [[Falkirk]].

By the age of 19 Baird had a supervisory post in the gun department, and in 1786 he accompanied a Carron Company manager, [[Charles Gascoigne]], a son of the owner's family, to Russia to establish the Aleksandrovsk gun factory at [[Petrozavodsk]], and a cannonball foundry at [[Kronstadt]]. Gascoigne had been invited to Russia by [[Samuel Greig]], a Scot who was an admiral in the Russian Navy.

Gascoigne Baird came to be known as Charles Baird, perhaps to avoid confusion with Charles Gascoigne, and had his change of name to Charles Baird officially sanctioned by the church authorities in Scotland in February 1792. In 1792, Baird entered into partnership with Francis Morgan, whose daughter Sophia he had married in June 1794. Their St. Petersburg business became known as the '''Baird Works''' ({{lang-ru|Завод Берда}}) and specialised in steam-driven machinery. It supplied machinery for the [[Russian Empire|Imperial]] [[Arsenal]], [[Mint (coin)|Mint]], and glassworks, and undertook a range of projects from bridge-building to ornamental metalwork. Baird also had a [[sugar refinery]] using his own innovative method of refining.

The Baird Works were responsible for the ''Elizaveta'', Russia's first [[steamship]], launched in 1815, and this early start gave them a ten-year monopoly on steamship routes from St. Petersburg, including the ''Elizaveta's'' run to Kronstadt. They had their own [[wharves]], and the [[St. Petersburg Times (Russia)|St. Petersburg Times]] has said Baird helped "create a great industrial kingdom on the [[Neva]] River that is known today as [[Admiralty Shipyard]] (Admiralteiskiye Verfi), the shipbuilding company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird's supplied the ironwork for several bridges, including the first [[cast iron]] arch bridge in Russia (1805) and from the 1820s, [[suspension bridge]]s designed by [[Wilhelm von Traitteur]], like the [[Postoffice Bridge]] over the river [[Moika]]. The company also worked with the architect [[Auguste de Montferrand]] on the [[Alexander Column]] and [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], and were responsible for technical aspects of the cathedral dome design.

The business was operated by Russian [[Serfdom|serf]]s, some of them extremely skilled in fine ornamental metalwork, according to [[James Nasmyth]]'s account.&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt; Baird brought other engineers from Scotland to work with him: his son [[Francis Baird|Francis]] and nephew [[William Handyside]] made important contributions, with Francis carrying the Baird Works forward after his father's death. Handyside took the lead in the firm's work with Montferrand, and another nephew, [[Nicol Hugh Baird]] who spent a few years in St. Petersburg, later became a noted Canadian engineer. Other Handyside brothers came to work in Russia, including [[Andrew Handyside and Company|Andrew Handyside]]. Charles' younger brother [[Hugh Baird (engineer)|Hugh Baird]] was designer of the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow Union Canal]].

Charles Baird was known for his business skills as well as his technical ability, and his achievements were recognised both in Britain and in Russia. In 1841 he was elected to the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], and the many honours he received led to the title of [[Order of St. Vladimir|Knight of St Vladimir]]. He died on 10 December 1843 and is buried in the [[Smolensk]] [[Lutheran]] Cemetery.

The '''Common Fisheries Policy''' ('''CFP''') is the [[fishery|fisheries]] policy of the [[European Union]] (EU).  It sets quotas for which [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] are allowed to catch each type of fish, as well as encouraging the [[fishing industry]] by various market interventions. In 2004 it had a budget of €931&amp;nbsp;million, approximately 0.75% of the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

When it came into force, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] formally enshrined fisheries ''conservation'' policy as one of the handful of "exclusive competences" reserved for the European Union, to be decided by [[Qualified Majority Voting]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 3 (d) of the [http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st06/st06655.en08.pdf Consolidated Treaty on the functioning of the European Union ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, general fisheries policy remains a "shared competence" of the Union and its member states.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 (d) of the Consolidated Treaty on the functioning of the European Union&lt;/ref&gt; Thus decisions are still made primarily by the [[Council of the European Union]], as was the case previously.

The common fisheries policy was created to manage fish stock for the European Union as a whole. Article 38 of the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]], which created the [[European Communities]] (now [[European Union]]), stated that there should be a common policy for fisheries.

At 25&amp;nbsp;million square kilometres, it is the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/outermost_regions_en.htm EU Glossary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909000258/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/outermost_regions_en.htm |date=9 September 2010 }} at europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Importance of fishing==
Fishing is a relatively unimportant economic activity within the EU. It contributes generally less than 1% to gross national product. In 2007 the fisheries sector employed 141,110 fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/publications/pcp_en.pdf Employment in the fisheries sector (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 6.4&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of fish were caught by EU countries.&lt;ref name="Main world producers 2007"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/publications/pcp_en.pdf Main world producers (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU fleet has 97,000 vessels of varying sizes. [[Fish farm]]ing produced a further 1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of fish and shellfish and employed another 85,000 people. The shortfall between fish catches and demand varies, but there is an EU trade deficit in processed fish products of €3&amp;nbsp;billion.
[[File:Fisheryexpenditure2004.png|right|250px]]

The combined EU fishing fleets land about 6 million tonnes of fish per year,&lt;ref name="Main world producers 2007"/&gt; of which about 700,000 tonnes are from [[Exclusive economic zone|UK waters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK fishermen may not win waters back after Brexit, EU memo reveals|author=Daniel Boffey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/15/uk-fishermen-may-not-win-waters-back-after-brexit-eu-memo-reveals|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=3 July 2017|quote=Source: House of Lords, NAFC Marine Centre, University of the Highlands and Islands.|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's share of the overall EU fishing catch in 2014 was 752,000 tonnes, the second largest catch of any country in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-pinching-our-fish |title=Is the EU ‘pinching our fish’? |last=Milne |first=Claire |date=21 June 2017 |website=fullfact.org/ |publisher=Full Fact|access-date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proportion is determined by the [[Fisheries Convention|London Fisheries Convention of 1964]] and by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.

In [[Fraserburgh]], Scotland, the fishing industry creates 40% of employment and a similar figure in [[Peterhead]]. They are the EU's largest fishing ports and home to the [[pelagic]] vessel fleet. It is often in areas where other employment opportunities are limited. For this reason, community funds have been made available to fishing as a means of encouraging regional development.

The market for fish and fish products has changed in recent years. Supermarkets are now the main buyers of fish and expect steady supplies. Fresh fish sales have fallen, but demand for processed fish and prepared meals has grown. Despite this, employment in [[fish processing]] has been falling, with 60% of fish consumed in the EU coming from elsewhere. This is partly due to improvements in the ability to transport fresh fish internationally.  Competitiveness of the EU fishing industry has been affected by overcapacity and shortages of fish to catch.

===Aquaculture===
Fish farming is the fastest growing area of world food production. In 1995 it produced {{frac|1|3}} in value of world production of fish and shellfish. The main species in the EU are trout, salmon, mussels and oysters, but interest has been shown in sea bass, sea bream and turbot. Community support began in 1971 for inland fish farming, but was extended to other areas in the late 1970s. EU support covers similar areas to other land installations, but with additional concerns of technical and environmental problems caused by introducing major fish concentrations where farms are built. The industry suffers problems due to fluctuating demand for farmed fish.

==Mechanisms of the CFP==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The CFP currently has four components:
*Regulation of production, quality, grading, packaging and labelling
*Encouraging producer organisations intended to protect fishermen from sudden market changes
*Setting minimum fish prices and financing buying up of unsold fish
*Set rules for trade with non-EU countries

===Total allowable catch (TAC)===
The CFP sets quotas for how much of each species can be caught in a certain [http://geo.ices.dk/viewer.php?add_layers=ices_ref:ices_areas ICES Statistical Area] or groups of areas on a yearly or two-yearly basis. Each country is given a quota based upon the total available (Total Allowable Catch, TAC) and their traditional share (percentage). TACs are fixed annually by the Council of Ministers. They consider proposals drawn up by the European Commission, which consults its own scientific advisers (Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of Fisheries, STECF). STECF generally provides its advice to the European Commission taking account of the work conducted by the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] (ICES). The Council of Ministers furthermore (when relevant) takes account of the views of non-EU fishing nations and the advice coming directly from ICES, which is independent of EU institutions. After quotas are fixed by the Council of Ministers, each EU member state is responsible for policing its own quota. Countries distribute their quotas among fishermen using different systems.

===Fishing controls===
The Basic Regulation sets the common principles for the EU management, under which each Member State can use different management approaches as licences, limited entry or individual fishing quota. Catches and landings must be recorded. Regulations cover the kind of fishing gear that may be used. Areas may be closed from fishing to allow stocks to recover.

A [[Minimum landing size|minimum size]] for catch led to fishermen dumping dead fish that were too small to land legally, so a minimum mesh size was introduced, which let small fish escape to replenish stocks. Choice of mesh is complicated, because mature fish of different species are naturally different sizes and require different nets.

===Structural policy and onshore fishing industry===
In 1977 an aid programme was introduced to improve the fish processing industries. This includes such things as fish filleting, salting, drying, smoking, cooking, freezing and canning.  It was intended to indirectly assist the catching industry.  There has been an attempt to introduce new technologies to the sector, improve hygiene conditions, and also fund conversions of fish processing factories to other uses.

Each country is given a target for the size of its fleet. Funding is available to assist modernisation of boats and installations, but also to buy-out fishermen to reduce the fleet size. Money is available for advertising campaigns to encourage consumption of fish species that are not over-fished, or are unfamiliar to the public. Also, grants are available to assist the industry in improving product quality and managing quotas.

===Producer organisations===
[[File:Fishing Trawler.jpg|thumb|left|The EU's fishing fleet numbers 88,000 – the second largest in the world – and can fish freely across the European Union, catching nearly six million metric tonnes a year&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp_en.htm About the Common Fisheries Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/fisheries_sector_en.htm About the Common Fisheries Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225054421/http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/fisheries_sector_en.htm |date=25 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are now more than 160 producer organisations (PO) in the EU. These are voluntary organisations set up by fishermen or fish farmers to assist in selling their product. Their members must include a minimum percentage of vessels in that sector, not discriminate in terms of nationality or location of their members within the EU, and must comply with other EU regulations. Organisations are required to develop plans to adjust fish catches to market demand. They may require non-members fishing in the same areas to follow the same restrictions as members.

They are empowered to take produce out of the market if prices fall below levels set by the Council of Ministers and receive compensation from the EU. Levels of compensation are set such that price falls as the amount of fish involved increases. Fish stocks may be stored and later returned to the market, or sold for animal feed. Buying-up of stocks must only be to cover occasional surpluses.

Tuna fishermen have a scheme where surplus stock is not bought up, but fishermen receive direct compensation if their income falls.

==International relations==
Fishing rights to fisheries outside the EU were significantly reduced when [[exclusive economic zone]]s were [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|defined]] in 1982. The EU has negotiated agreements to recover some of these fishing grounds in return for alternative trading rights with the EU. External trade is now affected by the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), regulated by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).

===Areas of co-operation===
Responsibility for fisheries in the [[Baltic sea]] was shared with the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBFC), to which the EU belonged until 1 January 2006.  The Commission ceased to exist on 1 January 2007.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/external_relations/rfos/ibsfc_en.htm European Commission – Fisheries – The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312230134/http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/external_relations/rfos/ibsfc_en.htm |date=12 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Mediterranean fishing is confined to a 12-mile (22-km) strip considered territorial waters. The EU belongs to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, which also makes recommendations for Mediterranean tuna. In 1994 conservation regulations were introduced banning certain fishing methods. In 1997 targets were set for tuna catches.

==Compliance==
Enforcement is the responsibility of member states, but there is a community level inspection service to ensure that member states enforce the rules within their own country. Member states are also under an obligation to ensure that their vessels observe EU agreements when operating outside the EU. The regulations are also intended to harmonise penalties for breaking the regulations in different countries.

Enforcement involves managing quotas and implementing technical measures to preserve fish stocks. Inspectors may check fishing gear and inspect the register of fish caught. The type of fish caught is checked and compared to quotas of total permitted catch for a vessel. Checks may be made in port or at sea, and using aerial photography.

Inspectors may also check fish processing factories to ensure that all fish is documented and can be traced to its source. EU inspectors check that hygiene and processing regulations in any country exporting to the EU are satisfactory and of an equal standard to controls within the EU.

Non-compliance remains a significant problem. In a number of EU fisheries, illegal fishing accounts for one-third to one-half of all catches.

==Funding provision==
Fishing was initially funded under the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). In 1993 a separate fund was established (FIFG), the Financial Instrument for Fisheries. From 1994 to 1999 the budget for FIFG totalled 700&amp;nbsp;million ECU. Any grant from FIFG must be accompanied by a minimum contribution from the national government. A grant to business must include a proportionate contribution from the business itself. Different rates of aid are applied to different regions.

From 2007 to 2013, the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|European Fisheries Fund]] (EFF) will provide approximately 4.3&amp;nbsp;billion Euro to the European fishing sector. The adoption of the EFF was not uncontested, in particular by environmental groups, as it includes the possibility to fund vessel modernisation and other measures, which might increase pressure on already [[overfished]] stocks.

==Fishing and the environment==
In 1997 [[North Sea]] states and EU representatives agreed a joint approach to identifying risks to the marine environment. A precautionary approach was adopted to seek to prevent pollution before damage was caused to the environment. Studies are being undertaken to monitor stocks of all fish, not just commercially important species.

==Criticism==
The Common Fisheries Policy has been argued by certain commentators to have had disastrous consequences for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1570439/Fishing-quotas-are-an-ecological-catastrophe.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Christopher | last=Booker | title=Fishing quotas are an ecological catastrophe | date=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brunowaterfield/9604035/The_human_cost_of_the_EUs_fishing_failure/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=The human cost of the EU's fishing failure | date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contradicted by historical evidence revealing that fishing stocks have been in chronic decline over the last century as a result of intensive [[Bottom trawling|trawl fishing]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Black | title='Profound' decline in fish stocks shown in British records | date=4 May 2010 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10096649.stm |work=BBC News  | pages = | accessdate = 5 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scientific research published in 2010, the depletion of fishing stocks is a consequence of mismanagement long before the Common Fisheries Policy came into being, a statement illustrated by the fact that British catches have declined by 94% over the last 118 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thurstan | first1 = Ruth H. | last2 = Brockington | first2 = Simon | last3 = Roberts | first3 = Callum M. | title = The effects of 118 years of industrial fishing on UK bottom trawl fisheries | journal = [[Nature Communications]] | volume = 1 | pages = 15 | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]] | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1013 | date = 4 May 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1013 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Common Fisheries Policy has continued the trend of ineffective fisheries management in European waters. Indeed, the Common Fisheries Policy has done little if anything to reverse the decline of European fish stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Khalilian | first1 = Setareh | last2 = Froese | first2 = Rainer | last3 = Proelss | first3 = Alexander | last4 = Requate | first4 = Till | title = Designed for failure: a critique of the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1178–1182 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.marpol.2010.04.001 | date = November 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2010.04.001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common fisheries policy has been criticised by some fishermen who believe it is threatening their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

EU quotas can mean that fish are thrown overboard after being caught; yet as they are dead, this does not alleviate the problem as it was intended to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6122954/EU-fisheries-minister-calls-for-an-end-to-dumping-millions-of-dead-fish.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=EU fisheries minister calls for an end to dumping millions of dead fish | first=Louise | last=Gray | date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Common Fisheries Policy has been a major reason for countries with both substantial fish resources and small home markets, like Norway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/03/29/norway-and-the-eu/ | work=Euronews | title=Why isn’t Norway in the EU? | date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nordic States and European Unity|last = Ingebritsen|first = Christine|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Iceland and European Integration: On the Edge|last = Thorhallsson|first = Baldur|publisher = Routledge|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-56703-1_4|title=Nordic Nationalism and Right-Wing Populist Politics|last=Bergmann|first=Eirikur|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781137567024|pages=93–124|language=en|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-56703-1_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish dependencies ([[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/21516|title=Fish keep Faroe Islands at a distance from EU|author=|date=|website=euobserver.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and some other dependencies, to stay outside the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 

=== Management ===

==== Subsidiarity ====

A common criticism of the CFP is its [[Centralisation|centralised]], top-down approach to management; although [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] are responsible for the policy's implementation and enforcement, members have given the European Commission sole competence in the creation of proposals and the making of decisions. The Commission is not exclusively responsible for the setting of [[Total Allowable Catch|total allowable catches]]. These are proposed by the commission but ultimately determined by the Council of [Fisheries] Ministers.  Allocation of national catch quotas to Member States is on a pre-determined basis—the so-called relative stability—giving each member state pre-determined percentages of the available fishing opportunities. Although Member States hold some responsibilities, such as the distribution of quotas, it is argued that the EU retains too much authority over fisheries management. Furthermore, critics maintain that the organisation is ill-suited to the task of fisheries management as it lacks sufficient understanding of fisheries, and is too far removed from the realities of the industry to set accurate TACs and quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sissenwine|first=M.|author2=Symes, D.|title=Reflections on the Common Fisheries Policy|journal=EU commissioned report|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[command-and-control]] method characterised by the CFP is no longer deemed an effective form of fisheries management, and advocates of CFP reform consider a shift from traditional government to participatory third-order [[governance]], incorporating the fisheries industry and Member States, to be vital to the success of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sellke|first=P.|author2=Dreyer, M.|title=Enhancing Regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy: An Opportunity and Challenge for Participatory Fisheries Governance in the EU|journal=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association Annual Conference "Global Governance: Political Authority in Transition"|year=2011|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p500182_index.html|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, it is suggested that the management of the CFP could be improved through the application of the theory of [[subsidiarity]]—the principle that political decisions should be handled at the lowest, least-centralised competent level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Andrew|last2=Jeppersen |first2 = Tim|title=EU Environmental policy: adapting to the principle of subsidiarity?|journal=Environmental Policy and Governance |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=64–74 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0976(200003/04)10:2&lt;64::AID-EET219&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z | date = March–April 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-0976%28200003/04%2910:2%3C64::AID-EET219%3E3.0.CO;2-Z | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidiarity principle was introduced into EU policies as part of the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]]; however, it does not apply to areas such as the CFP over which the [[European Economic Community|Community]] retains exclusive competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=C.|title=Good Governance and the Common Fisheries Policy: An Environmental Perspective|journal=Institute for European Environmental Policy Report|year=2000|url=http://www.ieep.eu/assets/235/goodgovernanceandthecommonfisheriespolicy.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial [[devolution]] of authority, for example involving Member States in the decision-making process and delegating the day-to-day management of fisheries to industry-based organisations, could potentially facilitate the inclusion of industry concerns into the CFP, involving those directly affected by the policy in management decisions and creating to a CFP which encourages compliance and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Symes | first1 = David | last2 = Phillipson | first2 = Jeremy | title = Whatever became of social objectives in fisheries policy? | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.fishres.2008.08.001 | date = March 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2008.08.001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The call for application of the subsidiarity principle to the CFP lies within the argument for its [[decentralisation]]. De-centralisation featured prominently in discussions related to the 2002 CFP reform, but the reform itself actually increased centralisation within the CFP, removing the right of Member States to block quota proposals and increasing the EU's role in enforcement. This increasing monopoly and disregard for the wishes of the fisheries industry led to alienation of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and resulted in reduced compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Tim | last2 = Hatchard | first2 = Jenny | title = The 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy's system of governance—rhetoric or reality? | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 545–554 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/S0308-597X(03)00066-6 | date = November 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-597X(03)00066-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of this increasingly centralised reform has proved to de-centralisation advocates that stakeholder participation in the governance process is crucial to the future success of fisheries governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Participation in Fisheries Governance|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|author=Hatchard, J.|authorlink=Engaging stakeholder preferences through deliberative democracy in North Sea fisheries governance|editor=T. Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some critics argue that applying the subsidiarity principle to the CFP may not improve the policy's effectiveness, as it may lead to what de Vivero ''et al.'' term the "participation paradox"—the theory that the greater the number of actors involved in the decision-making process, the less significant the contribution made by each actor, and the smaller the participatory role played in the policy process. Greater devolution within CFP decision-making may therefore silence the voice of the fisheries industry as it competes with other state, private and civil actors to whom authority is also granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suárez de Vivero | first1 = Juan L. | last2 = Rodríguez Mateos | first2 = Juan C. | last3 = del Corral | first3 = D. Florido | title = The paradox of public participation in fisheries governance. The rising number of actors and the devolution process | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 319–325 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.marpol.2007.06.005 | date = May 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2007.06.005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the subsidiarity principle can facilitate the government-to-governance transition advocated by many in relation to reform of the CFP, the participatory role of key stakeholders affected by the policy must be maximised to ensure the development of an effective and equitable Common Fisheries Policy.

==History==

===1970===
{{POV section|date=July 2016}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
The first rules were created in 1970. The original six Common Market members realised that four countries applying to join the Common Market at that time (Britain, Ireland, Denmark including Greenland, and Norway) would control the richest fishing grounds in the world. The original six therefore drew up Council Regulation 2141/70 giving all Members equal access to all fishing waters, even though the Treaty of Rome did not explicitly include fisheries in its agriculture chapter. This was adopted on the morning of 30 June 1970, a few hours before the applications to join were officially received. This ensured that the regulations became part of the acquis communautaire before the new members joined, obliging them to accept the regulation. In its accession negotiations, the UK at first refused to accept the rules but by the end of 1971 the UK gave way and signed the Accession Treaty on 22 January 1972, thereby bringing into the CFP joint management an estimated four fifths of all the fish off Western Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Norway decided not to join. Greenland left the EC in 1985, after having gained partial independence from Denmark in 1979.

When the fisheries policy was originally set up the intention was to create a free trade area in fish and fish products with common rules. It was agreed that fishermen from any state should have access to all waters, except Irish fishermen that were refused access to fish any waters east of 4 deg west, thus closing the north sea to them. An exception was made for the coastal strip, which was reserved for local fishermen who had traditionally fished those areas. A policy was created to assist modernisation of fishing vessels and on-shore installations.

===1976===
In 1976 the EC extended its fishing waters from 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles ({{cvt|12|nmi|km|1|disp=out}} to {{cvt|200|nmi|km|1|disp=out}}) from the coast, in line with other international changes. This required additional controls and the CFP as such was created in 1983. This now had four areas of activity: conservation of stocks, vessels and installations, market controls, and external agreements with other nations.

===1992===
It was determined that there had been over-investment in vessels, over-fishing and that numbers of fish landed were decreasing.  The review identified a need to improve compliance with the regulations. This led to a tightening of regulations and better monitoring of individual vessels. A second review was planned for 2002.

===1995===
Although fishing could be managed by reducing the fleet size, available fish vary from year to year too much to make this sensible. So a permit system was introduced stating where and when boats are allowed to fish. Scientific studies were commissioned to better-determine available stocks and guide allocation of permits.

===2009===
In 2009, the EU Commission launched a wide-ranging debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  Common Fisheries Policy Reform | url = http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/reform/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the way that EU fisheries are managed. It received input from EU citizens, organisations and EU-countries and published a report on the consultation.

===2013===
In February 2013 the European Parliament voted for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, including measures to protect endangered stocks, and the ending of discards. The new CFP came into effect from 1 January 2014, though more talks with EU governments are involved. In presenting the reform package, the German Social Democrat MEP Ulrike Rodust stated: "As of 2015 the principle of  [[maximum sustainable yield]] shall apply ... Our objective is that depleted fish stocks recover by 2020. Not only nature will benefit, but also fishermen: bigger stocks produce higher yields."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21352617 BBC News: Euro MPs back large-scale fishing reform to save stocks]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 reform led to a greater role for the European Parliament, involving the convening of a trilateral dialogue (or "trilogue") between the European Council, European Commission and the Parliament, to work towards general agreement on reforming the CFP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Fisheries/Topics/EU-common-fisheries-policy/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-EU-Common-Fisheries-Policy-and-Fisheries-Partnership-Agreements-Challenges-for-ACP-countries EU Common Fisheries Policy and Fisheries Partnership Agreements – Challenges for ACP countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3632">'''Contract city''' is a term used in some [[U.S. state]]s for a city that contracts one or more municipal services to another unit of government, or to a private or commercial organization.  Most of the contracts are for police or fire / rescue / paramedic services to the county in which the city lies.

In the traditional method, ''franchising'', a private company has a [[government-granted monopoly|franchise]], or legal right, to perform certain public services normally done by municipal government. Cities of all kinds have entered into contracts for non-core governmental services, such as facilities and grounds maintenance, auditing, legal counsel, road construction, garbage collection, water and waste water treatment, engineering services, animal control, and others. Such cities rely on the private sector to provide public service delivery, while the public sector maintains oversight. Public officials are specifically responsible for writing, signing, managing and enforcing contracts.

Another method of contracting is for the city to contract with its county government or with neighboring cities to provide municipal services such as police and public safety, libraries, or parks and recreation. 

In contrast, independent cities are cities which provide basic governmental services themselves, without contracting (this usage is not to be confused with the more common usage of [[independent city]] as a city that is not part of any [[County (United States)|county]]). Most older cities are independent cities. In practice, many cities are hybrids of both. For instance, they may directly operate parks programs, but contract with the county for police and fire services. Most contract cities do their own [[land use planning]], since cities were incorporated to exert local control over land use.

==History==
In 1954, [[Lakewood, California]], became the first city to contract with its county for public services. The previously [[unincorporated area]] was facing a hostile annexation from adjacent [[Long Beach, California]], and residents favored retaining local control while maintaining the existing services provided by [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. The so-called Lakewood Plan has been the model for most new contract cities incorporated since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasdhq.org/lasd_services/contract_law/index.html |title=Welcome to contract law enforcement |work=Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department |accessdate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304185244/http://www.lasdhq.org/lasd_services/contract_law/index.html |archivedate=4 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ConverDyn''' is a general partnership between American multinational firms [[General Atomics]] and [[Honeywell]] that provides [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) conversion and related services to utilities operating nuclear power plants in North America, Europe, and Asia.  The company is the sole marketing agent of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; produced at the [[Honeywell Uranium Hexafluoride Processing Facility]] in [[Metropolis, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Nuclear Fuel Cycle|url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-T-Z/USA--Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/#.UeXYsY21HxI|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|330px|thumb|[[Nuclear fuel cycle]] begins when [[uranium]] is mined, '''converted''', enriched and manufactured to nuclear fuel (1) which is delivered to a [[nuclear power plant]]. After usage in the power plant the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (if fuel is recycled) (2) or to a final repository (if no recycling is done) (3) for geological disposition. In [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can be recycled to be returned to usage in a [[nuclear power plant]] (4).]]

From 1970 to 1992, there were two operating uranium hexafluoride conversion facilities in the United States.  These included [[Allied Signal]]'s Metropolis Works Facility and General Atomics' [[Sequoyah Fuels Corporation|Sequoyah Fuels Facility]] in [[Gore, Oklahoma]].  Facing low conversion prices and the implementation of the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]], both companies recognized the forthcoming struggles surrounding excess market supply of conversion services.  In 1992, Allied Signal and General Atomics agreed to close the Gore, Oklahoma facility and take joint and equal ownership of profits from Allied Signal's plant in Metropolis, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uranium Plant, Beset by Trouble, Is Closing|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-24/news/mn-1150_1_uranium-plant|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ConverDyn was formed as a general partnership between the two companies as the sole marketing organization of uranium hexafluoride produced at the Metropolis plant.  As a result, any and all uranium hexafluoride produced at Metropolis Works is marketed and sold by ConverDyn.  In 1999, Honeywell and Allied Signal merged resulting in the partnership structure that exists currently.

==Honeywell Metropolis Works==
Built in 1958, the Honeywell Metropolis Works Facility is the only uranium hexafluoride conversion facility in the [[United States]].  The plant has an annual conversion capacity of approximately 15,000 tU as UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; accounting for approximately 20% of worldwide production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conversion and Deconversion|url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Conversion-Enrichment-and-Fabrication/Conversion-and-Deconversion/#.UeXjR421HxJ|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The plant feeds U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; [[yellowcake]] received from uranium mines and produces uranium hexafluoride gas for enrichment at one of the primary enrichment sites around the world.  After being enriched, product is fabricated into nuclear fuel that ends up generating electricity at a nuclear power plant.

===Conversion Process===
Honeywell Metropolis Works deploys a unique technology and process by which it converts [[yellowcake]] to uranium hexafluoride gas.  The other Western conversion facilities, [[Areva]] and [[Cameco]], each utilize a process that requires two different facilities, one to convert [[yellowcake]] to either [[uranium tetrafluoride]] or uranium trioxide and another to convert to [[uranium hexafluoride]].  Honeywell developed a process known as the dry fluoride volatility conversion process that allows for complete yellowcake to UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; at a single facility and also yielding a greater level of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; purity at 99.99% or higher.&lt;ref name="converdyn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uranium Hexafluoride Specifications|url=http://www.converdyn.com/product/UF6%20SPECIFICATION%20Final.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dry fluoride volatility conversion process at Metropolis works goes through five basic steps: feed preparation, reduction, hydrofluorination, fluorination, and distillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conversion Process|url=http://www.converdyn.com/product/conversion.html|work=ConverDyn|publisher=ConverDyn|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Feed Preparation'''
[[File:MDP8867z.jpg|thumb|Uranium ore concentrate storage at the Metropolis Works Facility]]
The aim of this initial step it to ensure that uranium concentrates have the optimum particle size and density necessary to move forward in the process of conversion.

* '''Reduction'''
During this stage, uranium ore concentrates are converted to [[uranium dioxide]] and impurities are removed from the system into a waste gas stream.  The sized yellowcake is reacted with hydrogen in a fluidizing medium to form uranium dioxide

:'''2{{chem|U|3|O|8}}+{{chem|H|2}} &amp;rarr; 3{{chem|UO|2}} + 2{{chem|H|2|O}}'''

* '''Hydrofluorination'''
The UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resulting from the previous reduction stage is then converted into [[uranium tetrafluoride]] intermediate (Green Salt) and additional impurities are removed from the system.

:'''{{chem|UO|2}}+4{{chem|HF}} &amp;rarr; {{chem|UF|4}} + 2{{chem|H|2|O}}'''

* '''Fluorination'''
[[File:MTW Picture.jpg|thumb|Honeywell Metropolis Works Facility in [[Metropolis, Illinois]]]]
The Metropolis Works Plant operates the largest gaseous fluorine capacity in the world.  Fluorine is produced in this process by the electrolysis of HF in a Potassium Bifluoride substrate.  The fluorine is pulled to the fluorination process under vacuum so as to increase the safety of this step.  The result of this step is crude uranium hexafluoride gas.

:'''{{chem|UF|4}}+{{chem|F|2}} &amp;rarr; {{chem|UF|6}}'''

* '''Distillation'''
Finally, uranium hexafluoride from the previous step is purified in a two-stage distillation system.  The crude UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is vaporized and transferred through a boiling system into [[cold trap]]s.  After cooling, the final product is filled into [[Uranium hexafluoride#Storage in gas cylinders|cylinders]] for transport.  This stage is proprietary Honeywell technology which allows output of 99.99% or greater UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="converdyn" /&gt;

===2012 Required Plant Upgrades===
After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in 2011, the United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] conducted inspections at all US nuclear facilities for seismic deficiencies and general resistance to natural disasters.  Although initial inspections confirmed that the Metropolis Works Facility was in full compliance with its operating license, the NRC shutdown the plant in May 2012 and required a series of upgrades to improve resilience to natural disasters including earthquakes and tornadoes.  Honeywell elected to complete required upgrades and the plant restarted production of uranium hexafluoride in July 2013, after more than a year offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honeywell set to restart in Metropolis|url=http://thesouthern.com/news/local/honeywell-set-to-restart-in-metropolis/article_05659c88-e9e8-11e2-a262-0019bb2963f4.html|work=The Southern Illinoisan|publisher=The Southern Illinoisan|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRC Authorizes Honeywell Metropolis Facility to Resume Operations|url=http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1318/ML13183A430.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Combe''' (born 26 April 1943) was National Secretary of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), a political consultant and lobbyist, an Australian Trade Commissioner, a Senior Vice-President International of [[Southcorp Wines]], and a consultant to the Australian wine industry.

==Early life==
Harvey David Mathew Combe was born in 1943 in [[Adelaide]], South Australia, and was educated at [[Prince Alfred College]] and the [[University of Adelaide]], where he earned a BA.. He became interested in politics at university and joined the ALP, partly through his friendship with [[Don Dunstan]]. (He has been Patron of the Don Dunstan Foundation since 2004.)&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;{{rp|pp.230,240}}

==Career==
Combe was National Secretary of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (1973–1981), a political consultant and lobbyist (1981–1985), and an Australian senior trade commissioner (1985–1991), and has held senior executive and board positions within the Australian wine industry (1991–2008).

===Politics===
In 1973 Combe became the youngest-ever National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party after [[Australian federal election, 1972|the election of the first Labor government for 23 years]]. In November 1975, he was allegedly co-instigator, with [[Gough Whitlam]] and [[Bill Hartley (activist)|Bill Hartley]], of an unsuccessful approach to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq for a gift of 500,000 U.S. dollars to help in funding Labor's 1975 election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, Tony ''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/tony-parkinson/shame-whitlam-shame/2005/11/14/1131951094949.html Shame, Whitlam, Shame]'' The Age, 15 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Labor lost the [[Australian federal election, 1975|election]]. In an article published in ''The Bulletin'' in January 1982 Combe propagated the notion that Labor's defeat was partly due to the influence of the [[CIA]].&lt;ref name=Cain/&gt;{{rp|p.232}}

Combe remained National Secretary until July 1981, when he resigned to establish a lobbying business, David Combe and Associates Pty Ltd. It reportedly "received a great fillip in [[Australian federal election, 1983|March 1983]], when the Labor Party was re-elected to office. Business perceived Combe as the most influential lobbyist then working in Canberra."&lt;ref name=Blesing/&gt;{{rp|p.1}}

====Combe-Ivanov affair &lt;!--[[Combe-Ivanov affair]] redirects here--&gt;====
In 1983 Combe was accused of compromising Australia's national security in dealings with a Soviet diplomat, [[Valery Ivanov]].&lt;ref name=Blesing&gt;Blesing, Meena. ''Was Your Dad a Russian Spy? The Personal Story of the Combe/Ivanov Affair.''

The rest of the chapter discusses "ASIO and the Combe-Ivanov affair" and "Justice Hope's Royal Commission".&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Combe-Ivanov affair developed out of a trip Combe and his wife made to the USSR in 1982, in the course of preparations for which they met and developed a relationship with Valery Ivanov, then the First Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra. Soon after the formation of the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] government ASIO raised concerns that Combe, closely aligned to the ALP, might be being compromised by a Soviet citizen with KGB links. Ivanov was expelled from Australia in 1983 by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/12/world/around-the-world-australia-scandal-erupts-over-soviet-diplomat.html |title=''Australia Scandal Erupts Over Soviet Diplomat'' |date=12 May 1983 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highly publicised events were investigated by the Hope Royal Commission on Australia's security and intelligence agencies of 1983–1984. The commission found that Combe had indeed been targeted by the Soviets, but there was no proof of intelligence breaches or of any threat to national security. &lt;ref name=Pryor&gt;Pryor, Geoff, [http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview/?pi=nla.pic-an23136639], National Library of Australia, retrieved 1 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade commissioner===

Combe was Australia's senior trade commissioner in Western Canada from 1985 to 1989, and in Hong Kong from 1990 to 1991.&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;

===Wine industry===

Combe was Senior Vice-President International and ran the European operations of Penfolds and Southcorp Wines during the rise in popularity of Australian wines in the 1990s. He is credited with developing significant export business for [[Southcorp Wines]], whose exports increased in value from 40 million Australian dollars in August 1991 to 300 million dollars in June 2000.&lt;ref name=npg/&gt; In 2000 Combe was named Australia's Top Export Salesman by ''Overseas Trading'' magazine and was included in the list of "Twenty Five Most Influential Australians in Asia" published by ''Business Asia'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claxtonspeakers.com.au/speakers_profile/60 Speaker's profile: David Combe], at Claxton Speakers (undated)&lt;/ref&gt; 

From March 2001 to November 2003 Combe was a non-executive director for  the Western Australian wine producer Evans and Tate Limited.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Tate media release, 22 February 2001
[http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/ReferencesView.aspx?PersonID=67226540 copy available here]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, in a speech at Bordeaux, he lambasted the wine-purchasing policies of UK supermarkets, which, he said, "if committed in Australia, would represent major breaches of the trade practices laws".&lt;ref&gt;Erhlich, R ''[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/my-round-state-of-independence-559243.html My Round: State of Independence]'' The Independent, London, 11 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2004 he was appointed Chairman of Simon Gilbert Wines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cache.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=1849970857&amp;page_url=%2f%2fwww.skalliandrein.com%2fwinevolution%2fspeaker_david_combe.php&amp;page_last_updated=4%2f4%2f2007+12%3a46%3a10+AM&amp;firstName=David&amp;lastName=Combe Speaker's Profile], David Combe, Chairman of Simon Gilbert Wines Limited, Australia. Skalli &amp; Rein "Wine Revolution" Conference, www.skalliandrein.com. Cached at cache.zoominfo.com (2007). Retrieved on 1 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired as a director and chairman in February 2007, "to take up another position within the wine industry".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Gilbert Wines [http://www.coonawarravineyard.com.au/content/pdf/capt/archive/SGV%20Proposed%20Rights%20Issue%2014022007.pdf board statement], 14 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrait==
In 1983, [[Keith Looby]] painted Combe's portrait. The portrait was an unsuccessful entry in the [[Archibald Prize]] of 1983, and conspiracy theories on this matter abound. David Combe said in 1998 that there was 'circumstantially a good case to believe that some trustees were heavied by the Party' into rejecting the work.&lt;ref name=npg&gt;[http://www.portrait.gov.au/site/collection_info.php?searchtype=advanced&amp;searchstring=:::::1:&amp;irn=28 David Combe and the portrait], National Portrait Gallery, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cain/&gt; In 1998, Combe donated his portrait to the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Canberra, "through the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program".&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;

{{Maplink|frame=yes|zoom=13|frame-lat=37.545|frame-long=-77.438|type=shape|title=Richmond|text=There are several areas in Downtown Richmond, including [[Shockoe Bottom]], [[Shockoe_Slip#Shockoe_Slip|Shockoe Slip]], the [[River District]], [[Belle Isle (Virginia)|Belle Isle]], [[Monroe Ward]], [[Manchester, Virginia|Manchester]], [[Jackson Ward]], Main Street, [[Court End]], [[Tobacco Row]], and the Canal Walk.}}

'''Downtown Richmond''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. It is generally defined as being bound by Belvidere Street to the west, [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] to the north and east, and the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] to the south. The [[Fan district]] borders it to the west, Highland Park to the north, [[Church Hill]] to the east, and Manchester to the south.

==Buildings and towers==
Richmond is now widely considered Virginia's "tallest" city because of many tall buildings in what is Richmond's [[central business district]], surrounding the [[Virginia State Capitol]] and many government office buildings (many dating to the [[New Deal]]). The [[James Monroe Building]] and SunTrust Plaza tower over 449&amp;nbsp;ft, and 400&amp;nbsp;ft, respectively, making them Richmond's tallest buildings, and the state's second and third tallest in the behind the Westin Virginia Beach Town Center at 508&amp;nbsp;ft. Other towering [[skyscrapers]] include the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]], Bank of America Plaza, the James Center, [[Richmond City Hall Observation Deck|Richmond City Hall]], the Riverfront Plaza twin towers, the James Madison Building, [[Dominion Resources]] headquarters building, Main Street Center, the [[Central National Bank (Richmond, Virginia)|Central National Bank]], and [[VCU Medical Center]] (which includes several hospitals, most over 200 feet, and the new School of Medicine under construction will be 12 storeys). Other important buildings Downtown include the [[Richmond Coliseum]] and the Greater Richmond Convention Center (which includes a tourist information office). [[Shockoe Bottom]] and [[Shockoe Slip]] also have nightclubs, bars, condo towers and lofts in various architectural styles.

==From slave traders to skyscrapers==
From the 1800s, downtown Richmond was a booming city, one of the largest in the nation, and a major player in the slave trade market. The district now known as [[Shockoe Bottom]] was the largest and most famous slave trade market in the entire nation, with people traveling from the South to trade, purchase, or sell slaves. When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] came, though, Richmond became much of a military town, serving as the capital of the newly formed [[Confederate States of America]]. As the war came to an end, the South, in a last resort, deliberately set fire to Richmond, so that when the Union troops arrived, the entire city was ablaze. The troops tried to extinguish the fire, but 80 percent of the buildings of Downtown Richmond was completely burnt to the ground. In the era of [[Reconstrucion]], Richmond devised to rebuild and prosper back to the top as it once was, and quickly rebuilt itself. Now that all of the slaves were free, Richmond saw new economic opportunities in other businesses, such as finance, retail, and banking. In the 1920s, America shifted into an [[Art Deco]] period, which included the construction of many fancy buildings in Downtown Richmond, notably the Central Bank Building. Also, department retailers saw investment in the downtown sector, and opened up [[flagships]]. This included [[Sears &amp; Roebuck]], [[Thalhimers]], and [[Miller &amp; Rhoads]]. But the slow yet massive move out into suburban areas began making its mark on Downtown, as these department stores expanded out to the new suburban shopping centers, and eventually Sears closed the downtown store, and Thalhimers and Miller &amp; Rhoads went defunct in the 90s. Although retail was becoming less and less of a viable economy for downtown, banking and big business began booming, and in the 1960s, Richmond began a massive build-out, which included the construction of over 600 buildings. This would go on into the 80s, until the last few skyscrapers were topped out. In 1978, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]], designed by renowned architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]], debuted. Now, the economy of Richmond is booming, with several [[Fortune 500]] companies headquartered there. [[Dominion Resources]], [[MeadWestvaco]], and [[Universal Corporation|Universal]] are among those headquartered in the downtown district. [[MeadWestvaco]] built its new headquarters in 2010. However large areas of the town were allowed to fall into disrepair until the creation of large swathes of HUD priority areas in the worst areas. Developers were quick to take advantage of the generous re-development loans especially since there was a ready-made market in the form of students requiring cheap housing.

==Residents, apartments, and lofts==
The [[Shockoe Bottom]] and [[Shockoe Slip]] districts have successfully begun the process of converting tobacco warehouses and factories into lofts and apartments. Canal Walk is under consideration for development both on the residential and service sector sides, however it is not clear whether there is real consumer appetite for additional restaurants, bars and coffee shops in Richmond. HUD developments in the Manchester district are hoping to start converting former factories into apartment and loft complexes. Residential conversion of the historic John Marshall hotel is also aimed to provide inner-city living space for an optimistic planning target for residency. This is echoed by the planned new construction of Shockoe Valley Heights, a large residential development in Shockoe Bottom. The partial redevelopment of [[Tobacco Row]], a huge row of old tobacco warehouses near fashionable Cary Street is now complete and has attracted favorable attention. The economical loft conversions have proved popular among student tenants. Further housing and redevelopment is a theme favored by Mayor Dwight C. Jones, citing plans for large apartment and condominium towers on the Canal Walk and hoping that it will attract tourists to Richmond. Unfortunately this has not occurred, however the planning is now taking a more modest line aimed at enhancing the challenge of a rather dull and empty space. Plans for the demolition of the old Reynolds Metals plant are still awaiting funding of around $50 million to be followed by reconstruction of the old canal system and development of the infrastructure with HUD grant aid before private interests can be offered a suitable development area.

==Revitalization success and future plans==
Richmond's downtown is rich in history especially from the Civil War and reconstruction period, the "Gilded Age". A great deal of attention has been devoted to the potential tourism holds for the city, however the mainstay remains the VCU facilities and students together with the banking interests that form the backbone of the city. Industry friendly investment in infrastructure has enhanced Richmond's reputation and attracted business through the establishment of areas such as the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park, (located north of the [[Richmond Coliseum]]), which markets itself as a premier office park for research. However although much has been done in Richmond towards establishing a true urban core there are still concerns among both civic and private institutions that the city will risk crime and dilapidation in the Downtown areas unless investment is forthcoming. The City of Richmond Downtown Master Plan concretises the official line which is to build upward and create a Condo tower-based residential area Downtown. This will provide "the perfect place to live, work, and play". This will not solve the fact that there are no major national chain stores located in downtown or its direct vicinity. A rapid transport system to provide faster links between Washington and Richmond is also mooted as important to the create of New Richmond according to Mayor [[Dwight C. Jones]]: [[high-speed rail]].

==Festivals==
Downtown Richmond also is home to some of the nation's biggest festivals, including the [[National Folk Festival (United States)|National Folk Festival]] from 2005 to 2007, which spawned the [[Richmond Folk Festival]], which is now one of the biggest festivals in the state, drawing as much as 200,000 people in its weekend long schedule. It takes place each year on [[Brown's Island]] and the surrounding area. There is also the National Beer Festival, which was scheduled to come to Richmond for 2011, but will return next year on account that it was cancelled under mysterious circumstances. There are much more festivals that bring nearly a million people to Richmond every year. There is also the 2nd Street Festival in Jackson Ward, considered part of Downtown, and an Italian Festival, the Que Pasa? Hispanic Festival, and in the holidays, the James Center Grand Illumination.

'''Egmore''' is a neighbourhood of [[Chennai]], [[India]]. Situated on the northern banks of the [[Coovum River]], Egmore is an important residential area as well as a commercial and transportation hub. The [[Egmore Railway Station]] was the main terminus of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]] and later, the [[metre gauge]] section of the [[Southern Railway Zone|Southern division]] of the [[Indian Railways]]. It continues to be an important railway junction. The [[Government Museum, Chennai]] is also situated in Egmore. Other important institutions based in Egmore include the Government Women and Children's Hospital, the Tamil Nadu State Archives and the [[Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department]].  The [[Wesley Church, Egmore]] is the oldest church of the region.

==History==

The earliest references to Egmore occur in the inscriptions of the Chola king [[Kulothunga I]].&lt;ref name="epigraphiaindicav8"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Triplicane Inscription of Dantivarman|first=V.|last=Venkayya|authorlink=V. Venkayya|work=[[Epigraphia Indica]]|volume=8|editor=[[E. Hultzsch]]|year=1905-06|publisher=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;Under the Chola Empire, Egmore was the headquarters of an administrative division or ''Nadu'' called Elumbur Nadu.&lt;ref name="epigraphiaindicav8" /&gt; An inscription of the Nellore Chola king Vijaya Kanda Gopal dated 2 September 1264 speaks of a village in Elumur-Tudarmuni Nadu in Pulal Kottam. A [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijayanagar]] period inscription of Sriranganatha Yadavaraya records an endowment to a monastery in [[Thiruvottriyur]] by a resident of Serruppedu (identified with the present day [[Chetpet (Chennai)|Chetpet]]) in Elumur-Tudarmuni Nadu.  

Egmore is the Anglicised form of "Ezhumbur", the name of a pre-British era village situated on the northern banks of the River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaicorporation.com/aboutcoc/che_history10.htm ChennaiCorporation.com: The Leading Chennai Corporation Site on the Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the fact that Egmore had been a part of the East India Company's possessions since 1720, it was not until the "Golden age of British rule" stretching from 1858 to 1947 that Egmore witnessed some real growth. The Egmore Museum was one of the first notable monuments to be constructed here. The construction of this famous landmark was undertaken immediately after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. The Connemara Library was created as an annex housing the Museum's vast book collection and became operational in 1896.

Egmore, in 1796, was the site of the Military Male Orphan Asylum near Madras. This asylum was headed by [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]], who invented the [[Bell-Lancaster method|Madras System]] for schooling there.

===State assembly politics===
{{main|Egmore (State Assembly Constituency)}}
Egmore has been a stronghold for [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), ever since the party's creation. Other than barely losing to Congress in [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1962|1962 election]], it has consistently voted for DMK, even during times of low popularity for the DMK. However it is worth noting, that recently the [[Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (ADMK), have made significant in-grounds, like they have in many localities around [[Chennai]], which used to be DMK strongholds. Egmore is also 1 of the two total constituents won by DMK in [[Tamil Nadu state assembly election, 1991|1991 election]]. This constituent is reserved for [[scheduled caste]].  This is also the first MLA seat held by [[K Anbazhagan]], when he won it in [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1957|1957 election]].
* Note: In 1989, ADMK was split between [[Janaki Ramachandran|Janaki faction]] and [[J Jayalalithaa|Jayalalithaa faction]], and only the Jayalalithaa faction is reported in the ADMK column since they were the highest vote getter from the divided faction. The Janaki faction got 4,293, which is about 5.6% of the voters.

===Lok Sabha politics===
Egmore assembly constituency is part of [[Chennai Central (Lok Sabha constituency)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Transport==
[[Image:Egmorestation1926.jpg|thumb|Madras Egmore railway station in 1926]]
Egmore Railway Station is the second most important in the state of Tamil Nadu after the Chennai Central Railway Station. It was constructed in 1908 and functioned as the headquarters of the now defunct [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]] till 1951.

Egmore is well connected to other parts of the city. Many of the state-run Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses run through Egmore. Egmore has its own suburban train station on the Chennai Beach - Tambaram railway line, which connects it to other parts of the city.

The '''Embraer Legacy 450/500''' ('''EMB-545'''/'''EMB-550''') are Brazilian mid-size [[business jet]]s launched by [[Embraer]] in April 2008, the first of their size with a flat-floor stand-up cabin and [[fly-by-wire]]. The longer 500, which typically carries 4 passengers over {{convert|3,125|nmi|km|-1|abbr=on}} with room for up to 12, first flew on November 27, 2012, and was certified on August 12, 2014. The shorter 450 first flew on December 28, 2013, was certified on August 11, 2015, carries 4 passengers over {{convert|2,900|nmi|km|-1|abbr=on}} and can accommodate up to 9. Introduced in October 2018, the '''Praetor 500/600''' are variants of the Legacy 450 and 500, respectively, with more [[range (aeronautics)|range]].

==Development==

At the August 2007 [[National Business Aviation Association|NBAA]] convention, [[Embraer]] unveiled a cabin mock-up of two concepts positioned between the  $7 million [[Phenom 300]] and the $26 million [[Legacy 600]], called midsize jet (MSJ) and midlight jet (MLJ), positioned on 22% of the market in units. They should share their flat floor, stand-up cabin but the MSJ should be 5 feet longer to accommodate 8 passengers over a 2,800-nm range against 2,200-nm for the smaller version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aviation-international-news/2007-09-26/embraer-unveils-concepts-two-new-midsize-aircraft |title= Embraer unveils concepts for two new midsize aircraft |publisher= Aviation International News |author=  Curt Epstein |date= September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was introduced in April 2008, Embraer planned to invest US$750 million and to introduce the larger model in 2012 and the smaller in 2013. [[Honeywell HTF7500E]] turbofans were selected along a [[Rockwell Collins]] Pro Line Fusion [[avionics]] suite integrated [[cockpit]] and a [[Parker Hannifin]] [[fly-by-wire]] flight control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.embraerexecutivejets.com/en-us/press-events/press-releases/pages/embraer-announces-embraer-msj-and-embraer-mlj-executive-jets.aspx |title= Embraer announces embraer MSJ and embraer MLJ executive jets |publisher= Embraer |date= April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the May 2008 [[European Business Aviation Association|European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition]], the larger was named Legacy 500 and priced at $18.4 million and the smaller Legacy 450, priced at $15.25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.domain-b.com/aero/aero_mfg/20080522_announces.html |title= Embraer renames MLJ/MSJ as Legacy 450/500 – announces launch schedule |publisher= domain-b.com |date= 22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/embraers-legacy-500 |title= Embraer's Legacy 500 |publisher= [[Business Jet Traveler]] |date= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assembly line was officially opened in [[Melbourne, Florida]] on 2 June 2016, adding [[Embraer Legacy 450]] and 500 production to the existing [[Phenom 100]] and [[Phenom 300|300]] line, along a completion center/flight-prep building. The first Legacy 450 on the line since May 16 should be delivered in mid-December. The facility will be able to assemble up to 96 Phenoms and 72 Legacys annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2016-06-02/embraer-starts-legacy-450/500-production-us?eid=343244824&amp;bid=1422224 |title= Embraer Starts Legacy 450/500 Production in U.S. |author= Chad Trautvetter |publisher= Aviation International News |date= June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Praetor 500/600===

Embraer introduced improved variants at the October 2018 [[National Business Aviation Association|NBAA]] convention, the Praetor 500 and 600, presented on display, with 3,250 nmi (6,019 km) and 3,900 nmi (7,223 km) of range; the 600 should be certified in the second quarter of 2019 and the 500 in the third quarter of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1206455-embraer-introduces-the-most-disruptive-and-technologically-advanced-aircraft-into-the-midsize-and-super-midsize-categories-the-praetor-500-and-praetor-600-business-jets |date= Oct 14, 2018 |title= Embraer Introduces the Most Disruptive and Technologically Advanced Aircraft into the Midsize and Super-midsize Categories; The Praetor 500 and Praetor 600 Business Jets |publisher= Embraer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both have {{cvt|22 by 50|in|cm}} taller and wider winglets.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AIN14oct2018&gt;--&gt;
The $17 million Praetor 500 boosts the fuel capacity of the Legacy 450 from {{cvt|12,108 to 13,058|lb}} to match the Legacy 500.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AIN14oct2018&gt;--&gt;
The $21 million Praetor 600 is based on the Legacy 500 with two tanks on the fuselage belly for {{cvt|2,928|lb}} more fuel for a {{cvt|15,986|lb}} capacity, and more powerful {{cvt|7,528|lbf|kN}} HTF7500E engines.&lt;ref name=AIN14oct2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2018-10-14/embraer-moves-ahead-praetor-program |title= Embraer Moves Ahead with Praetor Program |author= Matt Thurber |date= October 14, 2018 |work= AIN online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Praetor 600 flight testing began on 31 March and 300h were logged with three aircraft by October 2018, while the Praetor 500 flight tests began on 13 September with 80h accumulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/nbaa-embraer-takes-command-of-midsize-market-with-p-452657/ |title= NBAA: Embraer takes command of midsize market with Praetor launch |date= 14 Oct 2018 |author= Kate Sarsfield |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[synthetic vision system]] has a flight [[guidance system]] for CAT I airports approach with [[satellite-based augmentation system|SBAS]], allowing [[decision height]] to be reduced from {{cvt|200 to 150|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Flight16Oct2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/flight-test-embraers-praetor-600-leaves-a-legacy-452373/ |title= FLIGHT TEST: Embraer's Praetor 600 leaves a Legacy |date= 16 Oct 2018 |author= Mike Gerzanics |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within US SBAS zones, the synthetic vision guidance system (SVGS) allows autopilot-flown [[instrument approach]]es down to {{cvt|150|feet}} height and {{cvt|1,300|feet}} [[Runway visual range|RVR]] without the optional Rockwell Collins [[enhanced vision system|EVS]] and [[head-up display|HUD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2018-11-20/pilot-report-embraer-praetor-600 |title= Pilot Report: Embraer Praetor 600 |author= Matt Thurber |date= November 20, 2018 |work= AIN online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous Legacy 450s can be upgraded to the Praetor 500 configuration for $500,000.&lt;!--&lt;ref AvWeek15oct2018&gt;--&gt;
For the higher thrust Praetor 600, Honeywell [[Aircraft_maintenance#Power-by-the-Hour|maintenance plan]]s increases to $294 per engine per hour.&lt;!--&lt;ref AvWeek15oct2018&gt;--&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Embraer Legacy 500 cockpit.jpg|thumb|Cockpit with 4 large [[Multi-function display|MFD]] and [[sidestick]]s]]

They are [[low wing]], [[T-tail]] airplanes with [[cabin pressurization]], powered by two rear mounted turbofans. The [[landing gear]] is fully retractable and designed to be operated on paved [[runway]]s only. The [[glass cockpit]] includes four [[multi-function display]]s. The operation is made through a [[flight management system]] with [[autopilot]], [[autothrottle]] and closed-loop control and monitoring of flight controls Fly-By-Wire. The aircraft are certified for Day, Night, VFR and IFR flights, and are approved for [[reduced vertical separation minima]] (RVSM) airspace and flight into known [[icing conditions]], extended flight over water, Category II [[Instrument landing system|ILS]], operations at high altitude airports up to 13800&amp;nbsp;ft and steep [[Final approach (aeronautics)|approach]] operations.&lt;ref name=ANACopEval/&gt;

Embraer offers an [[enhanced flight vision system]] constituted by the [[Rockwell Collins]] HGS-3500 [[Head-up display]] combined with the EVS-3000 [[Infrared camera]], permitting a decision altitude necessitating visual references of 100&amp;nbsp;ft above touchdown at a projected price of $515,000. [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s draft AC 20-167A further proposes a descent below 100&amp;nbsp;ft if the required visual references can be observed using the EFVS, similar to Cat II and III approaches with limited [[instrument landing system]]s in many small airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/flight-test-embraers-vision-enhancer-shows-great-p-428218/ |title= Embraer's vision enhancer shows great promise |work= Flight Global |date= 16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legacy 500 can be configured to carry up to 12 passengers, and can carry eight passengers over {{convert|2,948|nmi|km|0}}, or four passengers over {{convert|3,125|nmi|km|0}}.&lt;ref name=legacy500Brochure/&gt; The aircraft fly-by-wire control enhances safety and comfort.&lt;ref name=fly2015-02&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Goyer |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/aircraft/jets/we-fly-embraer-legacy-500 |title=We Fly: Embraer Legacy 500 |publisher= [[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-06-29/pilot-report-embraer-legacy-500 |title= Pilot Report: Embraer Legacy 500 |publisher= Aviation International News |author= Matt Thurber |date= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Climbing to its FL 430 initial cruise altitude takes 22 min and its 27° [[wing sweep]] allow a {{cvt|436|knots|km/h}} {{abbr|TAS|True Air Speed}} average long-range cruise, Mach 0.76 - 0.78, while a Mach 0.80 cruise lowers the range by 3%.&lt;ref name=BCA22sep2017/&gt;

The Legacy 500 competes with midsize jets like the $17.9 million [[Cessna Citation Sovereign]]+ and $23.4 million [[Cessna Citation X]],&lt;ref name=BATmay2015/&gt; but also with super-midsize $24 million [[Gulfstream G280]] and $26 million [[Bombardier Challenger 350]] and can be compared with the halted $21 million [[Learjet 85]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.flyingmag.com/aircraft/jets/embraer-legacy-500-versus-world |title= Embraer Legacy 500 Versus the World: Comparison Specs |publisher= [[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date= February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bombardier discounts its [[Challenger 300]]/350 to match the Legacy 500's $20 million price, $7 million cheaper, while Gulfstream stays firm on its $24.5 million G280 price, as is Embraer, but the Legacy 500 loses 25% of its base value on the pre-owned market because of the glut of used super-midsize jets.&lt;ref name=BCA22sep2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/legacy-500-super-midsize-technology-leader-fights-market-share |title= Legacy 500: Super Midsize Technology Leader Fights For Market Share |date= Sep 22, 2017 |author= Fred George |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near 70% of the 50+ Legacy 500s are in the U.S., mostly owned by [[Fortune 1000]] private firms or wealthy individuals.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=BCA22sep2017/&gt;--&gt;
[[Toluca]]'s [[Fly Across]] operates four Legacy 500s, as is [[Flexjet]] which plan to trade its five 450s to five 500s to become its largest operator.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=BCA22sep2017/&gt;--&gt;
The Legacy 500 average mission is less than 2 hours, and while fleet operators fly them more than 700 hours per year, single aircraft operators typically fly theirs 150–200 hours per year.&lt;ref name=BCA22sep2017/&gt;

It burns {{cvt|2,200|-|2,400|lb}} of fuel in the first hour, and then {{cvt|1,700|-|1,800|lb}} at heavy weights down to {{cvt|1,500|-|1,600|lb}} when lighter.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=BCA22sep2017/&gt;--&gt;
Maintenance per flight hour cost US$642 to US$658 for the two [[Honeywell HTF7500E]] depending on utilization, while [[airframe]] costs US$321 plus US$4,300 per month for low-utilization.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=BCA22sep2017/&gt;--&gt;
Dispatch reliability often exceeds 99% with most components mounted outside the pressure vessel for easy access if it breaks, except batteries and potable water servicing.&lt;ref name=BCA22sep2017/&gt;

An '''escalation clause''' is a clause in a [[lease]] or [[contract]] that guarantees a change in the agreement price once a particular factor beyond control of either party affecting the value has been determined. An important example of this is a contract that adjusts for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crawford and Stewart|title=Writing an escalation contract using the Consumer Price Index|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-1/writing-an-escalation-contract-using-the-consumer-price-index.htm|publisher=US BLS|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Escalation clauses are quite common in construction contracts to cover unexpected costs due to fluctuations in the prices for [[raw materials]], fuel, and labor during the course of the construction project. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1937">'''Felipe A. Bosch Gutierrez''' (born 1962) was  born in [[Guatemala]].  He is a Board Member of [[Corporación Multi Inversiones]] (CMI), a large agro-industrial conglomerate which, according to an article in El Diario de Hoy, is one of the largest circulating newspapers in El Salvador, and one of the biggest corporations in Central America. Founded in 1920, CMI now has near 30,000 employees, operating in 13 countries with seven divisions: poultry and pork; Pollo Campero and other fast food restaurants; flour mills, pasta and cookie production; construction; renwable power generation and financial services.

He is listed as a past president of the Committee of Agriculture, Commerce, Industry and Finance Association (CACIF) on the CACIF website, and is also listed as a past president of the Industry Chamber (Cámara de Industria de Guatemala) on the Industry Chamber’s website.  According to the Guatemalan newspaper ''Diario La Hora'', Bosch is one of the original directory members who created “Plan Visión de País,” which is an inter-institutional initiative effort to create a long term development plan for the country.  Bosch was a regular columnist in ''[[Siglo Veintiuno]]'', one of the leading [[newspapers in Guatemala]]. He and his companies have also spearheaded various public policy campaigns. Bosch has organized important relief efforts for poor families and orphans in Guatemala, some of which have been reported by ''Diario La Hora''. He is also a member of the President's Leadership Council for the [[Inter-American Dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedialogue.org/experts/felipe-a-bosch-gutierrez/|title=Inter-American Dialogue {{!}}   Felipe A.

'''Frederick Robert Flatman''' (1843 – 21 September 1911) was a New Zealand Member of Parliament of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] for the [[Pareora (New Zealand electorate)|Pareora]] and [[Geraldine (New Zealand electorate)|Geraldine]] electorates.

==Early life==
Flatman was born in [[Suffolk]] and went to school in [[Oulton Broad]]. He came to [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] on the ''Mary Ann'' in 1862 and went to South Canterbury. He was a successful businessman, and was storekeeper in [[Geraldine, New Zealand|Geraldine]] and [[Woodbury, New Zealand|Woodbury]], and a sawmiller, before he concentrated on farming.&lt;ref name="NZETC Flatman"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand : Canterbury Provincial District|year=1903 |url= http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc03Cycl-t1-body1-d6-d90-d1.html#name-422984-mention |author=Cyclopedia Company Limited|accessdate=25 May 2010|location=Christchurch |chapter=Geraldine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Zealand Liberals: The Years of Power, 1891–1912'' By David Hamer (1988, Auckland University Press, Auckland), p.&amp;nbsp;362&lt;/ref&gt;

Flatman represented the [[Pareora (New Zealand electorate)|Pareora]] and [[Geraldine (New Zealand electorate)|Geraldine]] electorates for fifteen years (1893–1908) in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=197}} He defeated [[Arthur Rhodes (politician)|Arthur Rhodes]] for the Pareora electorate in 1893 by 1594 to 1377 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The General Election|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=THD18931201.2.21 |accessdate=8 November 2011|newspaper=Timaru Herald|volume=LV |issue=5828 |date=1 December 1893|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1904 to 1906 Flatman served as the Liberal Party's senior whip.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=279}} In 1908 he was defeated by [[William Nosworthy]] for the [[Ashburton (New Zealand electorate)|Ashburton electorate]] in the [[Second Ballot Act 1908|second ballot]].&lt;ref name="General Election, 1908"&gt;{{cite web |title=The General Election, 1908 |url= http://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&amp;d=AJHR1909-II.2.5.2.12 |publisher=National Library |accessdate=14 April 2012|pages=19, 33 | year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lyttelton Times described Frederick Flatman as a member "''not of the ornamental type, but plain, blunt, possessing strong convictions, straightforward manners and simple directness of speech. He also acquired in 3 years a surprising grasp and mastery of political questions. He was certainly the best of the South Island farmer members-perhaps the best in New Zealand. He was a fine man''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= |accessdate= |newspaper=[[Lyttelton Times]] |date= 22 September 1911 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Paulsen was born in the tiny port hamlet of Dagebüll on the [[Nordfriesland|North Frisian]] coast. Both his parents originated from the neighbouring island of [[Föhr]].

In 1933 during his studies at [[Kiel]] Paulsen suffered from harassments and threats by the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] due to his opposing political believes. Therefore, he fled to [[Malmö]], Sweden via [[Basel]] in Switzerland to avoid his internment at a [[concentration camp]]. In [[Sweden]], whose citizen he became in 1941, he laid the foundation for the establishment of FERRING (1950) by his research on [[hormone]]s and their synthentical production. Upon accepting the Swedish citizenship he changed his given name Friedrich to ''Frederik''.

After his withdrawal from the company's management he died in 1997 at the age of 87 in Alkersum on Föhr. His son [[Frederik Paulsen Jr]] is the current [[chairman]] of Ferring Pharmaceuticals.

'''Greenwich Pizza''', founded in 1971 by Cresida Tueres, is a [[pizza]] and [[pasta]] [[Chain store|chain]] in the [[Philippines]].

In 1994, [[Jollibee Foods Corporation]] acquired 80% of Greenwich shares.&lt;ref name="a20060118"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ordinario |first=Cai U. |title=Jollibee Foods buys out partner in Greenwich Pizza |work=BUSINESS |publisher=The Manila Times Internet Edition |date=2006-01-18 |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/jan/18/yehey/business/20060118bus8.html |accessdate=2007-03-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621190536/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/jan/18/yehey/business/20060118bus8.html |archivedate=2007-06-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2006, Jollibee bought out the remaining shares of its partners in Greenwich for PHP384 million, giving rise to a new company known as the Greenwich Pizza Corporation. The [[franchising|franchise]] experienced rapid expansion from the original 50 stores in 1994 to over 240 stores with an annual [[revenue]] of over [[Philippine peso|PHP]]4 billion in 2005.  Expanding further through 2011, the corporation had opened over 330 stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenwich.com.ph/history.asp Greenwich History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418055151/http://www.greenwich.com.ph/history.asp |date=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Enterprise of Omnibuses ==

He founded the first serious enterprise of omnibuses in Bogotá which covered mainly the route between Bogotá and Facatativá. The fleet, imported from Philadelphia, consisted of four carriages which he named "Azucena", "No me olvides", "Rosita" and "Trinitaria". They were decorated with pictures of actresses of the time, scenes, mirrors and lanterns. The carriages were of such high quality that at least one of them was active for forty three years.  This enterprise's contribution to the economic progress of Colombia was commented by various writers.  
[http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/literatura/lagreen/lagreen0.htm Isidoro Laverde] wrote (translated quote from Spanish): "The capital, negligently leaning at the foot of Monserrate and Guadalupe [mounts], for long long years saw its streets paved with stone covered with weed in the absence of any noise that is not the one from the nocturnal ghosts.  Only two couches circulated its streets, the one from the Archbishop and the one from the Viceroy, that passed by the Alameda to a little distance from the convent of San Diego.  The use of couches did not start to be generalized until, in 1854, señor Guillermo París took this industry on his own account."
In the words of one of the best journalists of the time, "as we arrived in Facatativá we found the pleasant surprise of the establishment of the enterprise of omnibuses founded by the progressive gentleman Mr. Guillermo París; since then [people] were able to traverse the plateau in relatively comfortable vehicles ...".  Upon the demise of París, the company went to Ignacio Osorio Ricaurte.

'''i54 South Staffordshire''' is a 239-acre (98 hectare) UK technology-based business park strategically located at Junction 2 on the [[M54 Motorway]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], on the boundary of [[South Staffordshire]] and [[Wolverhampton]].

i54 South Staffordshire is a £50&amp;nbsp;million pound joint venture partnership between [[Staffordshire County Council]], [[Wolverhampton City Council]] and [[South Staffordshire Council]] and has attracted global business occupants, which have in turn warranted visits from the UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and [[Her Majesty The Queen]]. It benefits from Enterprise Zone Status and falls within the [[Black Country Enterprise Zone]].

The site entrance is at Junction 2 of the [[M54 Motorway]], just to the west of the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]].  The site is home to several global high-tech and advanced manufacturing companies including [[Moog Inc|MOOG]] Aerospace, [[Eurofins]] Laboratories, International Security Printers (ISP) and the home of the £500&amp;nbsp;million UK advance engine manufacturing facility of [[Jaguar Land Rover]].


== The aim ==
The aim of this strategically location business site is to deliver major employment opportunities and maximise job creation potential in key industries. It will also play a key role in the diversification and growth of the regional economy. It is also believed that i54 South Staffordshire will achieve high standards of sustainability.

The regeneration project is a joint venture between [[Wolverhampton City Council]], [[Staffordshire County Council]] and [[South Staffordshire Council]].

== Project costs and details ==
The cost of the project to the 98 hectare site is estimated to be costing £67&amp;nbsp;million [[GBP]] and was granted crucial planning approvals from two local authorities in September 2006.

In August 2006 contractors to the site started the second major phase of the scheme, a £5&amp;nbsp;million [[GBP]] 12-month programme of infrastructure and reclamation work.

On Tuesday 3 July 2007 key partners for the project toasted the substantial completion of a £10&amp;nbsp;million [[GBP]] programme of remediation and site preparation works on the i54 site. The site preparation work ran over a 16-month period and has been carried out by Blackwell and supervised by [[Mouchel Parkman]] engineering consultancy. During this time the following was achieved:

* Produced level development plots
* Installation of primary infrastructure including a spine road
* Drainage Systems
* Site fencing
* Creation of new wetland and ecological habitats

Other statistics include:

* 152,000 cubic metres of topsoil has been excavated but retained on site.
* 190,000 cubic metres of sub-soil and rock excavated and reused on site.
* 1 kilometre spine road constructed
* 4.5 kilometres of fencing erected ''(3 kilometres still to be erected)''
* Total of 6,500 cubic metres of ponds and [[Swale (landform)|swales]] created as part of the landscaping

JLR engines are currently being supplied by [[Ford Motors]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/259222/ JLR's new UK engine plant | Autocar]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage potential ==
* Around {{convert|2000000|sqft|m2|-3}} of industrial space
* {{convert|376000|sqft|m2|-2}} of commercial/retail and leisure.

==Construction==
Construction started on site in 2011, with MOOG fully operational on site by the start of 2012. The Aerospace company makes flight controls and spent £15&amp;nbsp;million to move from its current location, to the i54 South Staffordshire development. The company hopes to safeguard 400 jobs with its relocation. Laboratory firm [[Eurofins Scientific|Eurofins]] also moved into the development and was fully operational by 2012.

==Enterprise zone==
The i54 South Staffordshire site is the largest of the 19 sites which make up the Black Country Enterprise Zone, which has 5 sites in Wolverhampton and 14 in [[Darlaston]], Walsall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2013/06/16/more-than-350-jobs-to-be-created-at-site/ |title=More than 350 jobs to be created at site |publisher=[[Express &amp; Star]] |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the zone for the Black Country was announced on 23 March 2011 by Chancellor George Osborne. [[Enterprise zone]] status speeds up the process of allowing companies to re-locate to the site and encourages it with tax breaks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/03/24/tax-breaks-boost-for-local-businesses/ Tax breaks boost for local businesses « Express &amp; Star]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISC has been described as a "quasi-governmental" organization.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca MacKinnon|title=Consent of the Networked: The Worldwide Struggle For Internet Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1Ll03dPL1cC&amp;pg=PP35|accessdate=15 March 2012|date=31 January 2012|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-02442-1|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and regulation ==
The ISC issues what the Chinese government calls “self-disciplinary regulations,” including the [[Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry]], which has been signed by thousands of organizations operating websites in China, including [[Baidu]], [[Soseen]], [[Yahoo]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Google]]. In signing the agreement, companies pledge to identify and prevent the transmission of any information that Chinese authorities deem objectionable, including information that “breaks laws or spreads superstition or obscenity,” or that “may jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Einhorn and Ben Elgin|first=Bruce|title=The Great Firewall Of China|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_04/b3968055.htm|accessdate=11 December 2011|newspaper=Business Week magazine|date=23 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kine|first=Phelim|title=China's Internet Crackdown|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/05/27/china-internet-web-censor-surveillance-technology-security-google-yahoo-green-dam.html|accessdate=11 December 2011|newspaper=Forbes|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alfred|first=Hermida|title=Behind China's internet Red Firewall|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2234154.stm|accessdate=11 December 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=3 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12995">'''Land administration''' is the way in which the rules of [[land tenure]] are applied and made operational. Land administration, whether formal or informal, comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to administer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y4307E/y4307e05.htm#bm05.2 Land Tenure and Rural Development, FAO Land Tenure Studies, No 3, Rome, 2002. - 3.16 Land administration]&lt;/ref&gt; The processes of land administration include the transfer of rights in land from one party to another through sale, lease, loan, gift and inheritance; the regulating of land and property development; the use and conservation of the land; the gathering of revenues from the land through sales, leasing, and taxation; and the resolving of conflicts concerning the ownership and the use of land. Land administration functions may be divided into four components: Juridical, regulatory, fiscal, and information management. These functions of land administration may be organized in terms of agencies responsible for [[National mapping agency|surveying and mapping]], [[land registration]], and [[Land valuation#Governing authorities and professional organizations|land valuation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1999) Land Administration. Oxford University Press, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose and scope of this knowledge domain appear from the following introducing notes:
:These Guidelines define land administration as the process whereby land and the information about land may be effectively managed. They are mainly written for senior governmental staff and politicians engaged in land administration issues. The aim is to outline the benefit of having a relevant and reliable land information system in place. The Guidelines identify the factors that should be taken into account in developing the legislation, organization, databases and maps, as well as the funding mechanisms, required to implement and maintain a solid land administration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=25632 |title=Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition |publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |date=December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of use of the notion of land administration is a 1973 ''Seminar on Land Administration'' in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1988) Land Information Management. - An introduction with special reference to cadastral problems in Third World countries. Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 18, note 17&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land administration arrangements'' were charted in a 1985 paper by Holstein, McLaughlin, and Nichols,&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1988) p. 18, note 10&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia changed name in 1986 to Department of Land Administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The UNECE in 1996 published ''Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=25632 Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition. December 1996.] {{ISBN|92-1-116644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dale &amp; McLaughlin textbook on ''Land Information Management'' from 1988 was in 1999 succeeded by the textbook ''Land Administration''.

== History ==

The practise of land administration is older than the presently used term. In ''The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State'', mention is made of [[Cadastre|cadastral survey]] and subsequent tax collection in northern part of the Netherlands, initiated by an order  in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Roger J P Kain &amp; Elizabeth Baigent (1992) The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State - A history of property mapping. The University of Chicago press. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other early, seventeenth century mapping for administrative purposes are found, e.g. in Sweden and in German [[Principality|principalities]]. In the duchy of Austrian Lombardy, a complete cadastral survey, the Milan cadaster, was finally adopted as a taxation base in 1760, and this provided the model for continental European countries to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 184-185&lt;/ref&gt; Largely independent from this cadastral development, local courts recorded [[Deed#Deeds of conveyance|deeds of conveyance]]. In the context of [[Codification (law)|codification]] of national legislation, most European countries in the nineteenth century established a [[Torrens title|title system]] at the local courts. England and Wales departed from this trend, as prolonged debates during the nineteenth century left parties with optional public recording of deeds of conveyance and the locating of properties and their boundaries on large-scale topographic maps, where available, similar to the [[metes and bounds]] method.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 256, 275&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of [[British Raj|British India]] was covered, during the nineteenth century, by the Revenue Survey.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 325 f&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colony (now state) of South Australia, [[Robert Torrens]] in 1858 introduced a title system. Like the Milan cadastre, this system became a model to be followed, initially within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. In the USA, the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established the basis for the [[Public Land Survey System]], which provides locational functions as the cadastral or - in modern terms - [[land information system]] described above. For the present adoption of the Torrens system in the USA, see Justin T. Holl, Jr. et al. (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://grm.thomsonreuters.com/our-knowledge/2011/07/2011/12/2011/12/white-paper-the-earthen-vessel-land-records-in-the-united-states.aspx Justin T.

== International organizations ==
The domain of '''land administration''' is characterized by the engagement of [[international organization]]s as much as by its intrinsic, multi-disciplinary structure. Among [[intergovernmental organization]]s,
* The [[World Bank]] has supported land and real estate reforms across a wide range of countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/A6S3NQ9PZ0 Galal, A; Razzaz, Omar (2001) Reforming land and real estate markets.

* [[UN-HABITAT]]'s section on Land, Tenure &amp; Property Administration focus on the implementation of land, housing and property rights, particularly women's secure tenure, affordable land management systems and pro-poor flexible types of tenure. The insufficient attention paid to the development of methods for implementing land policies, led to the development of pro poor land tools that are affordable and accessible for use by a variety of stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=283&amp;cid=1504 UN-HABITAT, Land &amp; Housing, Research &amp; Tool Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072839/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=283&amp;cid=1504 |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts further include the creation of the Global Land Tool Network (GLTN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gltn.net/ The Global Land Tool Network (GLTN)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[FAO]] focuses on [[land tenure]] in the rural domain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/lt-home/en/?no_cache=1 Access and Tenure of Natural Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; and has among others issued a ''Multilingual thesaurus on land tenure''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/sd/2003/in0602_en.htm Multilingual land tenure thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he became Fiat's director of marketing. He coordinated marketing for the [[Fiat Punto]] and [[Fiat 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Barbie Latza Nadeau |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/11/27/playboy-industrialist-lapo-elkann-wants-to-remake-italy-s-image.html |title=Playboy Industrialist Lapo Elkann Wants to Remake Italy's Image |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2011-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129002951/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/11/27/playboy-industrialist-lapo-elkann-wants-to-remake-italy-s-image.html |archivedate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkann left Fiat in 2005 after being widely reported as having a serious cocaine and heroin overdose,&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; creating [[Italia Independent]], a lifestyle and clothing brand featuring Italian products.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;[https://howtospendit.ft.com/vehicles/5893-tales-from-lapoland "Tales from Lapoland" ''Financial Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/business/worldbusiness/23iht-wbspot24.4698908.html?_r=0 "Ever-obsessive, Lapo Elkann returns with no apologies"], Peter Kiefer,  Feb. 23, 2007, NY Times

Still in 2011 Italia Independent and ToyWatch of [[Gianluca Vacchi]] presented a special edition of 1007 copies of watches called Unique Edition.

In June 2013 Elkann listed Italia Independent on the [[Milan Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanderson |first=Rachel |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2dc2dee6-df36-11e2-a9f4-00144feab7de.html#axzz2XprvIt9u |title=Lapo Elkann’s Italia Independent set for Milan debut |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-06-27 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brother John had to reinvest in Italia Independent in 2017 after its share price plunged from €40 to €4.4 following disappointing sales and mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/aed10ea4-424b-11e8-803a-295c97e6fd0b|title=Fiat scion aims to bring back 'roaring 50s' luxury|last=Sanderson|first=Rachel|date=20 April 2018|work=Financial Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Licensed professional counselor''' ('''LPC''') is a [[licensure]] for [[mental health professional]]s in some countries.

In the US, licensed professional counselors (or in some states, "licensed clinical professional counselors" or "licensed mental health counselors") provide mental health and substance abuse care to millions of Americans.
Licensed professional counselors (LPCs) are doctoral and master's-level mental health service providers, trained to work with individuals, families, and groups in treating mental, behavioral, and emotional problems and disorders. LPCs make up a large percentage of the workforce employed in community mental health centers, agencies, and organizations, and are employed within and covered by managed care organizations and health plans. LPCs also work with active duty military personnel and their families, as well as veterans.

Licenses are awarded for professional counselors ('''LPC''') and professional counselor supervisors ('''LPC-S'''); Interns are identified with the corresponding suffix "I" ('''LPC-I'''), and [[Licensed Professional Counselor Associate]]s, with the suffix "-A"; this also applies to licensed therapists, as in the case of Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists ('''LMFT''') who are designated as: '''LMFTA'''.

In U.S., the exact title varies by state, but the other most frequently used title is ''licensed mental health counselor'' (LMHC).  Several U.S. states, including [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], and [[Tennessee]], have implemented a two-tier system whereby both the LPC and LCPC (or equivalent) are used. In those states higher tier professionals are granted the privilege to practice independently. However, in most states LPC's or LMHC's may practice independently. Licensed Professional Counselors are one of the six types of licensed mental health professionals who provide psychotherapy in the United States.

In addition to their education, LPCs must obtain supervised clinical experience and must pass a state licensing exam. Different states require one of several different licensing examinations. Examples are the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certification (NCE) as well as the National Certified Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE). LPCs are regulated by federal and state laws, which either protect the title of LPC or LMHC or actually define the scope of practice of a professional counselor and stipulate certain client protections. If an LPC is also a member of a professional association or has received additional certifications, they must adhere to the codes of ethics of the professional association or certification body with which they have aligned.

==Requirements for professional counselors==
===United States===
LPC (or variation, e.g. LCPC, LMHC, etc.) licensure is recognized in 50 states in the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counseling.org/publicpolicy/whoarelpcs.pdf|title=WHO ARE LICENSED PROFESSIONAL COUNSELORS?|website=Counseling.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements vary from one jurisdiction to the next.  Most states require some combination of a master's degree, counseling experience and supervision, as well as passing a national examination, such as the National Counselor Examination (NCE) and/or the National Clinical Mental Health Counseling Examination (NCMHCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcc.org/Certification-Licensure |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209070211/http://nbcc.org/Certification-Licensure |archivedate=February 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of requirements from the state of [[Texas]] LPC board serves as an example;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/counselor/lpc_apply.shtm|title=Texas Department of State Health Services, Texas State Board of Examiners of Professional Counselors  - Apply for a New License - Requirements|first=Texas Department of State Health|last=Services|website=Dshs.state.tx.us|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; requirements vary from state to state.  For example, practicum/internship requirements (during the master's degree) vary significantly between states (i.e.: 300 in Texas and 1000 in Vermont). Course requirements and credit amount also vary, making reciprocity between states difficult for many licensed counselors.

#A master's degree or doctoral degree in counseling or a related field.
#Academic course work in each of the following areas: normal human growth and development; abnormal human behavior; appraisal or assessment techniques; counseling theories; counseling methods or techniques (individual and group); research; lifestyle and career development; social, cultural and family issues; and professional orientation.
#As part of the graduate program, a supervised practicum experience that is primarily counseling in nature. The practicum should be at least 300 clock-hours with at least 100 clock-hours of direct client contact. Academic credit for the practicum must appear on the applicant's transcript.
#After completion of the graduate degree and before application, an applicant must take and pass the National Counselor Exam and the Texas Jurisprudence Exam. After receiving a temporary LPC license from the board, the applicant may begin the supervised post-graduate counseling experience (internship). 3000 clock-hours with at least 1,500 being direct client contact of internship under the supervision of a board-approved supervisor is required. The 3000 clock-hours may not be completed in a time period of less than 18 months."

====Exemptions====
Some states, such as [[Oregon]], have broad exemptions that allow the practice of professional counseling without a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unlicensed-practitioner.com/69/|title=Practicing Your Profession In Oregon Without a License, Legally and Ethically - Alternative &amp; Unlicensed Practitioners|date=6 December 2014|website=Unlicensed-practitioner.com|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, nothing in the chapter regulating professional counseling applies to the activities, services, titles, and descriptions of persons employed, as professionals or as volunteers, in the practice of counseling for IRS recognized 501(c)(3)  public and private nonprofit organizations or charities. [Alabama Code 34-8A-3-a-6]

===Canada===
In the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], the Ordre des conseillers et conseilleres d'orientation et psychoeducateurs et psychoeducatrices du Quebec (OCCOPPQ) grants counselor licensure. The Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association, CCPA offers a distinct certification, Canadian Certified Counsellor (CCC), separate from the regular professional membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/en/memberbenefits/certification/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605064802/http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/en/memberbenefits/certification/ |archivedate=June 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Professional Counsellors Association (CPCA) is a national competency-based association that provides the designation of Registered Professional Counsellor (RPC) to its members. Unlike degree-based associations, a specific degree level does not automatically qualify applicants for membership.  Instead, the CPCA requires core competencies in education and experience prior to taking a qualifying exam and undergoing psychological testing  as part of the membership application process.  Counsellors must then embark on a two-year candidacy under the supervision of an approved Clinical Supervisor prior to becoming a full member.  The CPCA membership roles are a mixture of Diploma, Bachelor, Master, and PhD level degree holders, and its primary purpose is the protection of the public and the promotion of competency in the mental health profession in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpca-rpc.ca|title=Home: Canadian Professional Counsellors Association - Canada BC|first=David|last=Teal|website=Cpca-rpc.ca|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well; the Canadian Addiction Counsellors Certification Federation (CACCF) promotes, certifies and monitors the competency of addiction specific counsellors in Canada using current and effective practices, which are internationally recognized. The certifications CACCF issues and its professional conduct review process provide public protection for counsellors, employers, regulatory agencies, clients and their families. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caccf.ca/pdf/Membership%20Handbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mads Johansen Lange''', nicknamed the '''''King of Bali''''', (18 September 1807 in [[Rudkøbing]], Denmark{{snds}}13 May 1856 in [[Kuta]], [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]) was a Danish trader, [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], [[Peace makers|peace maker]] on Bali, knight of the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], and recipient of the Danish gold medal of achievement. He was the son of Lorents Lange Pedersen{{efn|Some sources name him as Lorentz, with a 'z' instead of an 's'.}} and Maren Lange, a merchant and a merchant's daughter, respectively.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=20}}

Lange travelled to the [[Dutch East Indies]] at an early age and settled on the island of Bali. Here he built a thriving commercial enterprise, exporting rice, spices and beef, and importing weapons and textiles. He maintained good relations with the local [[Raja]]s and mediated between them and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonists with great success.

Lange died 48 years old, possibly because of poisoning. His business had been in decline by then, and even the joint efforts of his brother and nephew could not change this. The remains of the business were sold to a Chinese merchant. He had three children with local Balinese women. His daughter Cecilia married into [[Johor|Johore]] royalty and bore a son, [[Sultan Ibrahim of Johor|Ibrahim]], who became the [[Sultan of Johor]]. Lange is buried in Kotta (now '[[Kuta]]').

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Mads Lange was born in [[Rudkøbing]] on 18 September 1807, as the second son of Lorents Lange and Maren Hansen. He had one sister and ten brothers, three of whom were children from an earlier marriage of his mother. The youngest brother died when he was six years old. Little else is known about Mads' childhood.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=36}}

=== Ancestors ===
His father, Lorents Lange Pedersen, was the son of master builder Peder Frandsen Knudsøn and Johanne Margrethe Lorentzdatter Lange. He was the only one of his nine brothers and sisters to take his mother's surname, Lange, as his baptismal name. Although the idea was for it to be a middle name, in practice it became his surname, meaning his mother's surname lived on through him. Lorents was the only boy among the three children who survived into adulthood. In later life Lorents was a member of the [[Langeland]] militia. He had an indirect role in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]: Spanish soldiers were [[billet]]ed in his house from 1812 to 1813. He received 4{{nbsp}}florins a month for this, but it meant his family home was now occupied by about fifteen people. This was surely a contributing factor in his decision to buy a new house on the Østergade, No.{{nbsp}}12{{nsndns}}14, in 1816. In 1822 Lorents started a transport company with a mail coach and two horses, not uncommon for a merchant in those days. His cousin was master of the ferry services, which probably benefited the small company enormously. Lorents died in 1828.

Lange's mother, Maren Hansen, had married Mads Andresen in 1799. With him she had three sons. Mads Andresen died in 1805, and later that year Maren married Lorents Lange. She had inherited a tavern and a shop, which Lorents ran even though he had been trained to be a master builder. After Lorents' death she married Mads Hansen.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=20}}

== Career at sea ==
Lange started his career at sea at fourteen years of age. Three years later, in 1824, he worked aboard the ship ''North'', where he met [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] John Burd. They sailed together for many years, including to the Danish [[trading post]] [[Tranquebar]] in [[India]]. In 1833 they returned to Denmark, and Mads seized this opportunity to visit his parents' home. He remained in Denmark for some time and was counted in the 1834 [[census]].

In the meantime, Burd sold the ship ''North'' in [[Hamburg]]. A little while later he and Lange bought the ship ''South'', which they steered towards India and China. Burd was the captain and Lange the first mate. With them traveled Lange's three brothers: Hans, Carl Emil, and Hans Henrik, 20, 18, and 14 years old, respectively. None of the four brothers would ever return to Denmark.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=60}}

== Settlement in the East ==

=== Lombok ===
In 1835 Mads decided to settle on the island of [[Lombok]], east of Bali and [[Java]], because here there was a lively commercial traffic. The island contained two princely states, Karangasem Lombok and Mataram. The first was the largest, and it was the Raja from this state who allowed Lange to trade from the port city of Tanjungkarang, in exchange for a yearly fee. It was here that Lange created his first flourishing commercial enterprise. He exported coffee, rice, spices and green tobacco, importing textiles and weapons that could easily be sold to the local warring tribes.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=61}}

In 1839 fights erupted ever more frequently between the princely states. Combined with increased Dutch efforts to colonize the island, this forced Mads to leave Lombok. When the Raja who had supported him was defeated, Mads had to flee to Bali head-over-heels in his [[schooner]] ''Venus''.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=62}}

=== Bali ===
[[File:MJL faktori 01.png|thumb|Gate of the [[Factory (trading post)|''factorij'']], painting c.{{nbsp}}1845]]

Lange now had to start over on Bali. He settled on the south coast of the island, near the town of [[Kuta|Kotta]]. The town was situated on a narrow peninsula, which made it possible to load goods on the east and the west side. This came in very handy during the [[monsoon]] season, when winds abruptly changed direction.

Four factors helped Lange settle on Bali successfully. First was his long history of trading with Bali. This meant he knew the possibilities this island had to offer. Second were his good relations with the Balinese Rajas. Raja Kassiman of [[Badung]] had even invited him to settle on the island. This meant he enjoyed protection and could obtain cheap labour, but probably also that he possessed a monopoly on trade on the island. The third factor was that the local population on Bali was suffering from an economic depression, after a war with Java that had made the export of slaves impossible. The fourth factor was a shortage of rice in Asia. Bali was well situated to reap the benefits of this shortage because the island population was well skilled in rice farming, and because the climate was such that it allowed for up to three harvests a year.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=41}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=62}}

Lange built his [[Factory (trading post)|''factorij'']] at [[Kuta|Kotta]] and steadily expanded it with residential units and warehouses. The Dutch nobleman and politician [[Wolter Robert, Baron van Hoevell]] visited Bali and Mads Lange, and gave a description of the ''factorij'':{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=56}}

{{quote|quote=A large stone wall was the first thing that caught our eye. Through a large door or gate, which was locked at night, we rode into the estate. Opposite the gate stands a cannon with the mouth in the direction of the gate as a warning in case of enemy attacks. It proved that mister Lange did not blindly entrust his well-being to Raja of the country in which he was residing, and that vigilance and a gun in hand were better to rely on.

Inside this wall are the buildings that form mister Lange's house (…). Here beauty is sacrificed for usefulness. The central building consists of several good guest rooms which, as I was told, left nothing to be desired.

In the foreground ones gaze is drawn towards a large Pandopo which is used for receiving Balinese come to talk about trade. There is almost never any place for visitors. You could describe it as a [[stock exchange]] which never closes. There are also a special dining room and a billiards room, which are very well equipped, and in which the generous host made sure his guests were wanting nothing.

Next to the main building are several houses for the staff and very good, spacious warehouses. Even in this there was an intense and uninterrupted bustle. Continuously rice was being brought in by the Balinese, in exchange for cash or other goods they came to acquire. Through the creative force of mister Lange, a sort of colony has steadily grown within those walls, a lively and densly occupied city, which possesses order, dynamism and prosperity.|source=''Van Hoëvell''}}

[[File:MJL faktori 02.png|thumb|[[Factory (trading post)|''Factorij'']], with Mads Lange in the back in the middle. Painting, c.{{nbsp}}1845]]

Lange was in good standing with the Balinese, and within a few years he had built a flourishing company with about fifteen ships, plying lively trade among ports in the East Indies, the West Indies, and Europe. His brothers helped him out in the [[Factory (trading post)|''factorij'']], and sometimes sailed on the ships when trading missions were difficult or demanding. Pirates and bad weather conditions often made these journeys dangerous. Two of Lange's brothers, Hans Henrik and Carl Emil, died during these kinds of journeys, the latter dying in plain sight of Mads when the rowboat he was in [[capsizing|capsized]].{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=48}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=37}}

Lange's career as a merchant blossomed during the 1840s. Halfway through that period his fleet of ships was capable of transporting between 800 and 1500 tons of freight. Many of the ships were newly built, probably in [[Singapore]], a city Mads often visited. [[Coconut oil]] was sold in Singapore in great quantities, yielding profits of 200 to 300%. Because of this, Mads had an oil mill imported entire from Europe. This was an expensive operation, but the costs were recuperated within a few years. Rice kept being announced for low prices in the newspapers of Singapore, Australia and China.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=69}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=128}}

From 1841 to 1843 Lange had an intimate relationship with his second cousin Malana von Munk, who was a distant relative of [[Christian IX of Denmark]]. While the relationship was strong and there are writings describing Lange's infatuation with von Munk, she had to return to Denmark due to personal reasons, bringing the two-year relationship to an end.

Predominantly French ships sailed to Kotta to load trading goods, especially cattle, ponies, pigs and poultry. Often the Balinese would come to the beaches with far more livestock than the ships could carry. Lange took advantage of the situation. He bought the livestock that remained, especially the cattle, since beef was a popular food. He functioned as a beach butcher, where a man could have his cows butchered quickly. [[Dendeng|Dried beef, known as "ding-ding]]", was shipped to Dutch troops on Java.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=26}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=85}}

During those days, Lange's [[Factory (trading post)|''factorij'']] had trading interests of a million guilders in trade with Java specifically. His success was primarily due to his ability to create personal ties, especially with the local Rajas. The Dutch, who were also trying to set up trade on Bali, were less successful, and in May 1844 they named Lange their agent on the island, with the right to fly the Dutch flag. Now Mads was not just working for himself, but also for the Dutch authorities who profited from his cooperation.

=== Peace broker ===
In the last half of the 1840s, the Dutch again tried to gain control over Bali and its Rajas. In July 1846 they sent a military force to the island, the [[Dutch intervention in Northern Bali (1846)|First Dutch Expedition to Bali]]. Their goal was the northern city of [[Buleleng]]. After an ultimatum to surrender unconditionally was rejected, the Dutch landed on the island on 28{{nbsp}}June and attacked the city. It was conquered and burned. The next day the Dutch troops marched for the [[Residency (country subdivision)|residency]] of [[Singaraja]], where this city was taken without much resistance ase most Balinese were moving inland to the fort of Djagaraga. During the attack, the Dutch received support from their fleet, whose commander would not allow the troops to move too far inland. Lange offered to go to the Rajas of Buleleng and [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]] for negotiations. These were successful and on 9{{nbsp}}July the peace accords came into effect. The Rajas would pay a small amount of damages, and the Dutch would maintain a small occupation force on the island until the matter could be settled.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=69}}

When the Rajas did not comply with all the agreements of the treaty of 1846, the Dutch sent a larger expedition to Bali in 1848, the [[Dutch intervention in Northern Bali (1848)|Second Dutch Expedition to Bali]]. Lange was able to keep the states of [[Tabanan]] and Badung neutral, but the rest of the Balinese forces assembled at Djagaraga, the same place they had sought refuge in 1846. During the preparations for their campaign, the Dutch blockaded the coast of Bali, wreaking havoc on trade. Djagaraga lay deep inland, so the attack had to go through without the help of the fleet. At first all went well, but the Dutch were stopped when they met Gusti Djilantiek, who had dug in with 600 riflemen. When it became clear that the Dutch supply was badly organized, because there were not enough [[coolie]]s to carry everything, the Dutch could no longer resist Balinese attacks from the villages and were forced to retreat.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=101}}

The Dutch defeat resonated through the Dutch East Indies and the government felt compelled to re-establish authority in order to prevent revolts in other parts of the archipelago. A new force twice the size of the previous one was sent in 1849, the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1849)|Third Dutch Expedition to Bali]]. This time, the army brought along 200 coolies to carry supplies and the wounded. On 1{{nbsp}}April 1849 the fleet reached Buleleng and on 4{{nbsp}}April general-major [[Andreas Victor Michiels]] set up his headquarters in the abandoned palace of Singaraja. Emissaries of the Rajas of Buleleng and Karangasem were sent to the general, but he refused to talk to anyone but the Rajas themselves. He urged them to hurry up, or they would lose their territories. The meeting took place on 7{{nbsp}}April. The Balinese arrived at the palace with a force of 12,000 men, after the Dutch had allowed them to take as many guards as the Rajas deemed necessary. Fighting did not occur, since the Rajas accepted all demands of the Dutch, including the immediate demolition of the fortifications at Djagaraga.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=109}}

[[File:Puputan of the Raja of Boeleleng.jpg|thumb|left|Raja of Buleleng commits [[Puputan]] together with his subjects, from ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]''.{{efn|In reality the Raja escaped alive.}}]]

The Dutch now decided to focus their attention on the south of Bali, and they attacked the small states of Karangasem and [[Klungkung]]. At the same time, they accepted an offer of 400 soldiers from the Prince of Lombok, who also coveted power over Karangasem. On 12{{nbsp}}May 1849 preparations were complete, and the Dutch landed near the coastal town of Padang Cove, which they overtook. A week later, warriors from Lombok infiltrated in Karangasem, which rose in revolt against its Raja. The Raja, facing total defeat, [[Puputan|killed all his wives and children and then committed suicide]]. The Raja of Buleleng, together with Gusti Djilantiek, fled into the mountains, with the warriors from Lombok in pursuit. The Dutch now focussed their attacks on Klungkung, where the most important and holiest Raja of Bali resided, the [[Dewa Agung]]. This Raja and his sister were the most fanatical opponents of Dutch influence on Bali, and it was of utmost importance to sideline them. Under command of major-general Michiels, the Dutch advanced and took control of an old, holy temple and the town of Kasumba. The next night, however, they were attacked by the Balinese, and Michiels was wounded in the thigh. He died after an unsuccessful amputation. The second in command, lieutenant-colonel Jan van{{nbsp}}Swieten, took over command and decided to retreat to the coast. There he waited for further instructions from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. They were met by the warriors from Lombok, who informed them that the Raja and Gusti Djilantiek were no longer alive.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=113}}

[[File:Aanval der Baliers bij Kasoemba.jpg|thumb|Balinese attack the Dutch at Kasumba]]

Lange's trade suffered from the war, and when the Raja of Kassim launched an attack on neighbouring Mengwi, the people in Kotta feared a counter-attack. Mads convinced the Rajas to assemble a force of 16,000 men and join him on a journey to the Dewa Agung, to plead with him to conduct peace negotiations with the Dutch. Even though fortune favoured the Balinese after the death of Michiels and the retreat of the Dutch army, the Rajas decided to accept Lange's request. Lange had placed a man aboard his ship ''Venus'' and sent him ahead to inform the Dutch of his mediation. They were not convinced he would succeed, and when the monsoon season arrived, they decided that action needed to be taken lest the whole expedition fail. The army advanced on Kasumba and met almost no resistance. The Balinese had raised their defences around Klungkung. Early in the morning of 10{{nbsp}}June, the Dutch left Kasumba for Klungkung. Along the way, they met Lange and a small group of riders. He informed them that his mediation had failed, but that the Rajas wished for peace. Mads also warned the Dutch not to advance any farther, for he could not guarantee that his 16,000 men would not join the Balinese defences. The Dutch were grateful for the information and retreated. They sent Lange back to the Rajas, together with a Dutch officer, to agree with the Rajas that the Balinese would send an embassy to the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] to recognize Dutch sovereignty over the island.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=115}}

A few days after the new commander of the military forces in the Dutch East Indies, [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792–1862)|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], had arrived, Lange organised a meeting for all Dutch soldiers and 12,000 Balinese. The latter were extremely curious about this 'real' European prince. The Rajas and the prince assured each other of their peaceful intentions, after which the prince left for Batavia, taking most of the Dutch troops with him. Jan van{{nbsp}}Swieten was tasked with forging a final peace agreement with the Balinese princes. When the residences of the Rajas proved to be too small for the meetings, talks were held in Lange's ''factorij'', which by that time was already a meeting place where quarrels between Balinese and foreigners were resolved. The meeting took place from 10 to 15{{nbsp}}July. The Dewa Agung was ill and had sent his son Raja Geit Putera from Klungkung. The Rajas of Bandung, Tabanan, [[Gianyar Regency|Gianyar]] and Mengwi were also present. Both parties saw the final arrangement as a victory. The Dutch left the island as sovereigns, and the Balinese would remain de facto independent for the rest of the 19th century.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=32}}

According to estimates, around 20,000 people attended the meetings, mostly Balinese. During the many days of negotiations, they all stayed in or around Lange's ''factorij''. This must have been a huge drain on his resources. Raja Kassiman rewarded him for his efforts by granting him the honorary title of ''unggawa besar'' or ''high commissioner'', one of the most senior titles on Bali. The Dutch for their part rewarded Lange with the Knight's Cross in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], awarded on 11{{nbsp}}December 1849 by King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]]. The newspaper of Langeland, the Danish island where Lange had been born, wrote in 1850 about the award:

{{quote|quote=His many great services and self-sacrificing toils in support of the Dutch, have finally been acknowledged by the Dutch government, both in the East Indies as well as in Europe, proven by the fact that last year he was named Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=32}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=117}}}}

=== Economic decline ===
After the war Bali suffered an economic decline, which also affected Lange and his business. The Dutch blockades during the military campaigns had practically stopped all trade. Also the majority of the male inhabitants had fought in the war instead of working  the fields, leading to a standstill in the production of major export products. Lange was able to buy rice in Lombok and sell it to Raja Kassiman, but his expensive oil mill ground to a halt due to a shortage of coconuts.

At the same time as this drop in production, the number of ships in the waters around Bali dropped sharply. As skippers were not able to match their previous profits, their numbers declined. Sailing ship were out-competed by steamers, resulting in more traffic for large ports like Hong Kong and Singapore, and less for smaller places. Lange also suffered from illness, and a never-sent letter to the Raja of Tabanan shows he had plans to return to Rudkøbing.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=64}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=127}}

== Relationship with Denmark ==
Lange had never forgotten his fatherland even though he had lived on Bali for most of his life. He sent several artefacts to the Royal Ethnographic Museum in Copenhagen, which was opened in 1849 by [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]]. After Lange's death, his sea chest was offered to the museum by a Swedish engineer who had acquired it on Bali. On 28{{nbsp}}July 1854 the many gifts Lange had donated to the museum resulted in his being awarded the Danish [[Medal of Merit (Denmark)|Golden Medal of Merit]] by [[Frederik VII of Denmark]]. Papers in the Danish National Archives show the bureaucratic process surrounding this award:

{{quote|quote=Mads Lange was awarded the golden medal by [[Royal Order]] of 28{{nbsp}}July 1854 resulting from a proposal by the Ministry for Culture. The initiative for this recognition of merit was taken by Christian Jürgensen Thomasen, who on 7th{{nbsp}}march sent a letter to the director of the Royal Gallery, nominating Mads Lange for donating valuable artifacts to the Ethnographic Museum. On the 11th{{nbsp}}may the director sent the proposal on to the Ministry for Culture, which lent its approval on 24{{nbsp}}July, after which it was signed by Frederik{{nbsp}}VII on 28{{nbsp}}July.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=33}}}}

Lange's contribution did not confine itself to the cultural sphere. He sent thousands of [[Dutch rijksdaalder|rijksdaalders]] to Denmark during the [[First Schleswig War|First Danish-German War]] of 1848–1851. He also collected money for the Danish organisation Aid for the Victims of War.

== Death ==

Lange died on 13 May 1856, 48 years of age. His daughter Cecilia was only eight years old, but, like Lange's English physician, she suspected he had been poisoned during a visit to a Raja. There were also rumors he had been poisoned by the Dutch. Since no official inquiry has ever been made, it is impossible either to prove or to disprove any of those theories.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=65}}

In talks with writer Aage Krarup Nielsen, Cecilia accused Lange's nephew Peter Christian Lange of stealing everything Lange had of value and fleeing. According to Nielsen, she said, "He was a robber who left for home in Denmark with all that was left of my fathers riches, without leaving us two children a single penny."{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=54}} [[Ludvig Verner Helms]] defended this nephew, based on a letter he had received in 1883 from one of Hans Nielsen Lange's sons, who wrote about Peter Christian Lange: "He sold everything that had belonged to my father, ships and buildings, nothing was left for me. The house in [[Banjuwangi]] was left to Cecilia, but because she had no documentary evidence that she was Lange's daughter, the government would not allow this."{{efn|It was believed that Cecilia would inherit the house on Java, but the government denied this.}}{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=55}}

=== Testament ===
Lange had drawn up a will in 1851. Krarup Nielsen received a copy of this will from his daughter Cecilia during one of her visits. It is highly likely that this copy still rests at the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library in Copenhagen]].

The reason why Lange had made a will at such a young age was the declining economic situation of his company. His planned trip to Denmark was also part of the decision. His brother had recently died in an accident, and making a will before undertaking a long and dangerous journey would have seemed like a good idea. A short while before writing the will Mads had lost his lover, the Balinese woman Nyai Kenyèr, probably because of an outbreak of [[cholera]].

According to the will, each of his children received a [[Will and testament#Terminology|legacy]] of 10,000 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]]. Besides this, Cecilia would inherit all belongings and properties on Java, on the condition that her mother would be allowed to use these properties for the rest of her life. Cecilia's mother would inherit 3,000 pieces of gold, the interest on which would make her financially secure. Ida Bay, Lange's cousin, would inherit 4,000 gold pieces and 1,000 [[Spanish dollar|Spanish dollars]], but she had to support Lange's mother, who would inherit all remaining assets. Lastly, two nephews, one in Rudkøbing and one on Bali, would each inherit 1,000 guilders. Around 1855, Mads changed his will: the first change was removing the name of his son William Peters due to his death in Singapore. The second change was the reduction of the legacy of his other son Andreas Emil to 5,000 guilders, and that Andreas would now inherit all his father's personal belongings and succeed him as head of the company. Cecilia's legacy was reduced by 25% and was frozen at a 9% interest rate. The funds would not be released until she married or reached adulthood.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=61}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=140}}

Lange was buried near his ''factorij'' in a small grove of palm trees. Today the grave lies on the main road between Sanur and Kotta. An [[obelisk]] on a white base was erected in 1927 by the Dutch government, at the urging of the Danish consul at [[Surabaya]], Johan Ernst Quintus Bosz.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== The end of the business ===
Lange's brother Hans and his nephew Peter Christian tried to keep the ''factorij'' going after his death. The nephew even invested a large amount of his personal wealth. After Hans' death in 1860, Peter Christian was the only remaining Christian member of the family on Bali. After Raja Kassiman died in 1863, the ''factorij'' lost its protector. A short time later, Peter found himself in conflict with the Rajas. He subsequently sold the business to a Chinese merchant. He died in 1869 in Denmark at the age of 42.

Several times Cecilia and her half-brother tried in vain to get clear information about the value of their father's belongings on Bali. An investigation by the Dutch authorities in 1872 resulted in several lengthy exchanges of letters between the Raja and the Dutch. In the meantime, the once-flourishing company withered away. The empty ''factorij'' was abandoned and today no visible traces remain of its existence.

== Descendants ==
[[File:CLange.jpg|thumb|Cecilia Catharina, Mads Lange's daughter]]
Mads Lange never married. His whole life he hoped to marry his cousin Ida Bay, who was ten years younger than him. He sent her letters and gifts, but the feeling was clearly not mutual, and she did not even comment on the letter containing the marriage proposal from the east.

On Bali, Lange fathered three children with two women. One was a Balinese woman named Njai Kenjèr or Nyai Kenyèr.{{efn|The spelling is uncertain. Her name appears in one letter only, which she wrote to Mads Lange from Tabanan.}} His second wife was a Chinese woman who Mads called ''Nonna Sangnio'', which means ''"Miss"'' or ''"Mistress"''.

He had three children in total. With Nyai Kenyèr he had William Peter (1843) and Andreas Emil (1850), and with Nonna Sangnio he had Cecilia Catharina (1848). Both his sons went to school in Singapore. William Peter died here{{clarify|date=February 2017}}&lt;!--Where?--&gt; at twelve years of age. Andreas Emil was educated at the [[Raffles Institution (Secondary)|Raffles Institute]], married an Asian woman, had several children, and was Private Secretary to the [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Rajah of Sarawak]] for at least eighteen years, during which time he had six sons and two daughters between 1881 and 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byarkivet.langelandkommune.dk/Dengodehistorie/Madslange/Gammel%20stamtavle|title=The old Mads Lange Familytree - Rudkøbing Byhistoriske Arkiv|last=|first=|date=|website=byarkivet.langelandkommune.dk|publisher=|language=da|access-date=3 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074901/http://byarkivet.langelandkommune.dk/Dengodehistorie/Madslange/Gammel%20stamtavle|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas's descendants live in Singapore and Australia.

Cecilia Catharina was sent to Singapore when she was seven years old to receive an education at a convent school. When Lange died the next year, she was adopted by an English family who took her on holidays to Europe and India. She received a thorough education, which proved to be of great use when she returned to Singapore in 1870. Here she met [[Abu Bakar of Johor|Abu Bakar]], who was the ruler of [[Johor]] at the time. He fell in love with her and was so smitten he ignored all the customary stereotypes that in those days stood in the way of a marriage between a full-blooded Malay man and a Eurasian woman. They eventually married, and Cecilia took the name ''Zubaidah''. She was not Abu Bakar's first wife, however, and when her husband became [[sultan]] in 1885 with the blessings of the British, it was his third wife Fatima who received the title of [[sultana (title)|sultana]]. Cecilia was named ''"Inche Besar Zubaidah"'', a title bestowed upon wives of the sultan who were not sultana. But in contrast to his other wives, it was Cecilia who bore him a son and continued the dynasty. Her son [[Ibrahim of Johor|Ibrahim]] is a descendant of Lange, and his family sits on the throne of Johor to this very day.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=134}}

== Notes ==
Former New Zealand prime minister [[David Lange]], who is known to be of Danish ancestry, is descended from a different branch of the family, according to himself.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=43}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6426">''''Marketing intelligence''' ('''MI''') is the everyday information relevant to a company’s markets, gathered and analyzed specifically for the purpose of accurate and confident decision-making in determining market opportunity, market penetration strategy, and market development metrics. Marketing intelligence is necessary when entering a foreign market.

Marketing intelligence determines the intelligence needed, collects it by searching environment and delivers it to marketing managers who need it. Marketing intelligence software can be deployed using an on-premises or [[software as a service]] (SaaS, or cloud-based) model. These systems take data from disparate data sources, like [[web analytics]], [[business intelligence]], call center and sales data, which often come separate reports, and put them into a single environment. In order to collect marketing intelligence, marketing managers must be in constant touch with relevant books, newspapers and trade publications. They must talk to various stakeholders like customers, distributors, and suppliers. In addition to this, they must also monitor social media and carry out online discussions. Marketing managers can design reports that correlate and visualize data coming from a variety of departments and sources (even, in some cases, external data.) This allows them to see current [[key performance indicators]] in real time (or as quickly as sources provide data) and analyze trends, rather than wait for analysts to deliver periodic reports.

Marketing intelligence systems are designed to be used by marketing managers and often viewed by employees throughout an organization. Notable systems on the market include Leadtime, Pardot, Marketo, and Hubspot. They may have [[user interfaces]] that closely resemble consumer software than the software around individual data sources, which are designed for use by analysts. Business intelligence, for example, can collect highly accurate, timely, granular data, but often requires IT support to build and edit custom reports.

Organizationally, marketing intelligence can be the name of the department that performs both the market intelligence and competitor analysis roles.  Business intelligence of any kind may also be their responsibility, in tandem with (or solely performed by) the Finance department, for measuring market share and setting growth targets, the [[mergers and acquisitions]] group for exploring acquisition opportunities, the legal department to protect the organization's assets or [[research and development]] for cross-company comparison of innovation trends and the discovery of opportunities through innovative differentiation.

Steps to be taken by a Company to improve its Marketing Intelligence

(1) Train and Motivate Sales Force: A company's sales force can be an excellent source of information about the current trends in the market. They are the "intelligence gatherers" for the company. The acquired facts can be regarding the company's market offerings, whether any improvements are required or not or is there any opportunity for new products, etc. It can also provide a credible source to know about competitor activities, consumers, distributors, and retailers.

(2) Motivate Distributors, retailers, and other intermediaries to pass along important intelligence: Specialists are hired by companies to gather marketing intelligence. In order to measure the quality of production, the way the employees are behaving with customers, quality of facilities being provided; retailers and service providers send mystery shoppers. Firms can also assess the quality of customer experience with the shops with the use of mystery shoppers.

(3) Network Externally: Every firm must keep a tab on its competitors. [[Competitive intelligence]] describes the broader discipline of researching, analyzing and formulating data and information from the entire competitive environment of any organization. This can be done by purchasing the competitor's products, checking the advertising campaigns, the press media coverage, reading their published reports, etc. Competitive intelligence must be legal and ethical.

(4) Set up a customer advisory panel: Companies can set up panels consisting of customers. They can be the company's largest customers or representatives of customers or the most outspoken customers. Many business schools set up panels consisting of alumni who provide their knowledge and expertise and help in constituting the course curriculum.

(5) Optimal usage of Government data resources: Governments of almost all countries publish reports regarding the population trends, demographic characteristics, agricultural production and a lot of other such data.  All this data must be or can be referred to as base data. It can help in planning and formulating policies for the companies.

(6) Information bought from external suppliers: Certain agencies sell data that can be useful to other companies. For example, television channels will require information on the number of viewership, ratings of TV programs, etc. An agency which calculates this information and generates this data will provide it to companies that need it.

(7) Collect Competitive Intelligence through online customer feedback: Customer's view about a product is essential for any company. Ultimately it's the customer who's buying the product. Hence customer feedback must be taken. Online platforms like chat rooms, blogs, discussion forums, customer review boards can be used to generate customer feedback. This enables the firm to understand customer experiences and impressions. It becomes easier for companies to apply a structured system to do so as it can then scan out the relevant messages without much of a trouble.

With the above steps being applied, a company's marketing intelligence system will prove to be beneficial to its effective functioning.

'''Paxherbals''' also known as '''Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories''' is a Nigerian [[alternative medicine]] product manufacturing company founded by [[Adodo Anselm]] in 1996 at [[Ewu Monastery]].

The company adopted a science-based approach to its [[Traditional African medicine]] brand of alternative medicine by establishing three sets of science laboratories for its operations.&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Itchen|first1=Jame etal|title=Modern African Remedies - Herbal Medicine and Community Development in Nigeria|journal=Policy Voice Series|date=April 2015|issue=April 2015|url=http://www.africaresearchinstitute.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ARI-Policy-Voice-Pax-Herbal-download.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was with a view to diffusing the age-long bias associated with African herbal practices in Nigeria and in most parts of Africa which associated [[herbal medicine]] with [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[ritualism]], [[paganism]], and all sorts of [[Fetishism|fetish]] practices.

As of 2017, Paxherbals has a presence in 26 states out Nigeria's 36 states with a network of 1,000 alternative medicine product distributors.&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt; Thirty-three health products are certified by Nigerian National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control ([[NAFDAC]]).&lt;ref name="taylor2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adodo|first1=Anselm|title=Integral Community Enterprise in Africa: Communitalism as an Alternative to Capitalism|date=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1138636798|page=8|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=9DeEDgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa: Summary of 'Africa's Natural Remedies' Event With Father Anselm Adodo|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201505051547.html|website=Africa Research Institute (London)|publisher=Africa Research Institute|accessdate=16 May 2017|ref=ARIAllAfrican2015|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| Certification by [[NAFDAC]] means certified products do not contain harmful substances.

==History==
[[File:Paxherbals outside view at a distance.jpg|thumb|Pax Herbal Center complex]]
===1997 to 2007===
In 1997, the founder of Paxherbals ([[Adodo Anselm]]) started a small herbal garden in [[Ewu Monastery]] where he grew medicinal plants. The first herbal preparations from the herbal garden were used in making herbal remedies for common ailments like [[malaria]] and [[cough]]. A loan of about thirty thousand Nairas (NGN 40,000 or approx. $200) was used to build a three-room clinic where patients from nearby villages were attended to by Anselm and his first employee Gbogbo John. The three-room clinic soon came to be called Pax Herbal Center.&lt;ref name="taylor2017" /&gt;
By May 2006, Paxherbals have built a set of laboratories which was commissioned by Chief [[Lucky Igbinedion]], Governor of [[Edo State]] (1999-2007).&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt; The laboratories include a quality control laboratory and microbiology laboratory.&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt; By 2008, Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories had become the biggest, best-equipped, best organized, and most modern herbal research center in Africa.&lt;ref name="lessem2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ronnie|first1=Lessem|title=The Integrators: The Next Evolution in Leadership, Knowledge and Value Creation|date=2016|publisher=Routledge: Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1472481214|page=86|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Integrators-The-Next-Evolution-in-Leadership-Knowledge-and-Value/Lessem/p/book/9781472481214|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor2017" /&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Researchers at work at paxherbal lab with products.jpg|thumb|Paxherbal research and quality control laboratory]]
[[File:Product formulation laboratory.jpg|thumb|Paxherbals Product formulation laboratory]]

Poor regulation and insufficient research has always been the bane of herbal medicine practice in Africa.&lt;ref name=van1999&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Wyk|first1=Ben-Erik|last2=van Oudtshoorn|first2=Bosch|last3=Gericke|first3=Nigel|year=1999|title=Medicinal Plants of South Africa|page=7|location=Pretoria|publisher=Briza Publications|isbn=978-1-875093-37-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to change this narrative, Paxherbals created a research team which is a mixture of exogenous (pharmacists, botanists, pharmacologists, microbiologists, laboratory scientists and plant scientists) and the indigenous (traditional birth attendants, bone setters, local taxonomists, village historians, and chemists).&lt;ref name="lessem2016" /&gt; The research team is headed by professor Okogun Joseph, who is the head of Scientific Research and Development.&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt;

===With Institute of African Studies===
[[File:Herberium.jpg|thumb|Paherbals herbarium laboratory]]
Paxherbals have formed a partnership with the [[Institute of African Studies]] (IAS) with the view of changing the way herbal medicine is learned and taught in Nigeria. With the university's curriculum committee approving a new curriculum, the university is open to admitting students for masters and Ph.D studies in Traditional African Medicine.&lt;ref name="THEGUARD1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muanya|first1=Chukwuma|title=Why government should invest in trado-medicine development|url=https://guardian.ng/features/why-government-should-invest-in-trado-medicine-development/|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian Newspapers|accessdate=4 May 2017|ref=THEGUARD1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
A major challenge to research effort at Paxherbals has been Nigerian government's regulations which requires that clinical trials have to be done in partnership with the government and so far, this have not proved possible&lt;ref name="ARI april 2015"/&gt; until 2016 when some collaborative efforts was recorded.

'''Pharmaceutics''' is the discipline of [[pharmacy]] that deals with the process of turning a [[new chemical entity]] (NCE) or old drugs into a medication to be used safely and effectively by patients.  It is also called the science of dosage form design.  There are many chemicals with [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] properties, but need special measures to help them achieve therapeutically relevant amounts at their sites of action. Pharmaceutics helps relate the formulation of drugs to their delivery and disposition in the body.&lt;ref name="washington1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sop.washington.edu/pharmaceutics/about/what-is-pharmaceutics.html |title=What is Pharmaceutics? &amp;amp;#124; Pharmaceutics |publisher=Sop.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pharmaceutics deals with the formulation of a pure drug substance into a [[dosage form]].
Branches of pharmaceutics include:
*[[Pharmaceutical formulation]]
*
*[[Pharmaceutical manufacturing]]
*Dispensing pharmacy
*Pharmaceutical technology
*Physical pharmacy
*Pharmaceutical jurisprudence
Pure drug substances are usually white [[crystalline]] or [[amorphous]] powders. Historically before the advent of medicine as a science it was common for pharmacists to dispense drugs ''as is'', most drugs today are administered as parts of a dosage form. The clinical performance of drugs depends on their form of presentation to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=edited by Gilbert S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7918">[[File:Camara municipal Povoa Varzim bandeiras.JPG|230px|right|thumb|City Hall, in Almada Square, dressed with Póvoa de Varzim municipal flags.]]
'''Póvoa de Varzim City Center''' or '''Downtown Póvoa de Varzim''' (Portuguese, ''Centro'')  is the heart of [[Póvoa de Varzim]] in [[Portugal]], and is the location for most of the city's municipal services, tourist attractions and businesses. It is the center, not only for the city or the municipality, but also neighboring municipalities. The greater downtown area also called "Centro" can also include most districts part of [[Póvoa de Varzim Parish]].

Downtown, as defined by the City Hall, is arranged around [[Praça do Almada]], the civic center, and extends in all directions for a number of blocks, including [[Rua da Junqueira|Junqueira shopping street]], [[Passeio Alegre]] waterfront square, Mouzinho de Albuquerque business avenue, and Praça Marquês de Pombal (market square). It does not include the medieval and Discovery Age civic center of the city which is located in [[Bairro da Matriz]] district.

Despite proven to be occupied at least since the Roman period, Downtown developed its current layout in the 18th century, by royal order of Queen Mary I of Portugal due to the importance that Póvoa de Varzim got as the main seaport in Northern Portugal.

[[File:Vista para Povoa de Varzim sec XIX.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Downtown skyline in mid-19th century.]]
[[File:Avenida Mouzinho Albuquerque Povoa Varzim.JPG|thumb|Mouzinho de Albuquerque avenue.]]
Downtown is limited to the North by [[Bairro Norte]], to the south by [[Bairro Sul]], to the east by [[Barreiros, Póvoa de Varzim|Barreiros]]/[[Moninhas]] and [[Bairro da Matriz|Matriz]]/[[Mariadeira]] and to the west it borders [[Redonda Beach]] and Póvoa Cove.

Downtown Póvoa de Varzim is, to a large extent, made up of pedestrian areas, with difficult car access in much of its extension, although underground parking spaces are available in the waterfront and in Avenida Mouzinho de Albuquerque.

===Civic Center===
[[Praça do Almada]], the civic center, is landscaped in an egg-shape, cut in half by the National Highway 13, and is tipped by buildings with local style. The building of the City Hall (1791) dominates the square. In the square, the Manueline pillory of Póvoa de Varzim (1514) is a national monument and represents Póvoa de Varzim's self-government and laws. Next to the pillory, the romantic gazebo (1904) follows the liking of the old Povoan bourgeoisie for its spare time.&lt;ref name="IPPAR"&gt;[http://www.igespar.pt/pt/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/71021 Coreto da Praça do Almada] - IGESPAR&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junqueira shopping district===
Despite being pedestrian, [[Rua da Junqueira]] is the most famous and elder of those three streets. Junqueira, which links Praça do Almada to the waterfront, appeared in the written records in 1694, even though artifacts from the Roman era surfaced in diverse street rearrangements and is the site of an ancient Roman fish factory. In 1839, the Town Hall expressed concerns over urbanization issues due to popularity of this street, one of the busiest in Póvoa de Varzim, as it became in that century a full-blown shopping street, identity that it maintained to these days in which ancient stores survive.

Undersized but charismatic squares in Junqueira district, between Praça do Almada and Passeio Alegre (waterfront) can be found:  Praça da República and Largo David Alves.

===Old theater area===
From the surroundings of Praça do Almada, three parallel streets lead to the waterfront: Rua Tenente Valadim, that ends between the Casino and Grande Hotel, Rua da Junqueira and [[Rua Santos Minho]]. The later is related to the arts, most notably performing arts, since the 18th century. It was a square known as Campo das Cobras and the location of a theater since 1793, the local bullfighting arena and circus. The old building Salão Teatro (Theater Saloon) and [[Teatro Garrett]] Theater from the 19th century, with small artist's studios in the way, can still be found.

==History==
{{main|History of Póvoa de Varzim}}
Albeit inhabited since the Roman period, with Roman fish factories and a Roman villa. The seaport, a natural harbor, appeared in the written records in the 11th century, and the ship-making industry developed considerably in the 17th century, it was in the 18th century, with the fishing industry getting national importance, that defined the city center as it is today, with the Royal Provision by [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Mary I]] on February 21, 1791. The queen ordered ''Corregedor'' Almada to reorganize the town's layout given Póvoa's prosperity and importance in the fishing sector. Prior to development the area had [[lagoons]] in the port area such as Boído Lagoon and Galé Lagoon.

The new civic center (''Praça Nova'' - New Square) with a new town hall was built in an area used as a market square during some periods in the site of Boído Lagoon. The square was later renamed [[Praça do Almada]] in honor of Corregedor Almada efforts. The new square replaced the old town hall around [[Praça Velha]], the Old civic center.

Prior to that, [[Junqueira (Póvoa de Varzim)|Junqueira]] district was already a bustling fishing quarter. As the 19th century moved in, and beach therapy became popular with the elites, [[Junqueira (Póvoa de Varzim)|Junqueira]] became a bourgeois shopping street.

In late 19th century and under the visions of David Alves, when Póvoa de Varzim was already a prosperous beach resort, sections of the urbanized area, which didn't grew in an orderly way, were demolished to give way for Mousinho de Albuquerque Avenue, linking [[Passeio Alegre]] Square to uptown's [[Largo das Dores|Dores Square]] (''Largo das Dores''), where mansions for the wealthy beach goers started being built. During late 20th century, some of the mansions and ''Orfeão Poveiro'' music hall ruins were destroyed to give rise to multifamily homes. Despite its losses, Mousinho Avenue got a new character, it became a central business avenue and a rehabilitation program was done in the 21st century.

Around Rego Square, later [[Largo David Alves|David Alves square]], appeared some of the most charismatic entertainment venues of Póvoa in the 19th century, the Hotel Luso-Brazileiro, the Chinês Saloon, Garrett Theater, and other entertainment venues. Centering the plaza, the Chinês Saloon appeared in 1882 and became popular all over the country and the most famous casino of Póvoa alongside Café David. The elites could listen to music, see shows with Spanish dancers, meet in [[tertulia]] and play roulette.

Old bourgeois area par excellence, with the increasing business importance of Junqueira and Praça do Almada, whose spaces had been taken for tertiary activities such as shops and offices, in such a way that, today, only few people live in the most central areas of the city.&lt;ref name="deo"&gt;As Procissões na Póvoa de Varzim (1900–1950).

'''Robert Malval''' (born July 11, 1943 in [[Port-au-Prince]]) was the prime minister of [[Haiti]] from August 30, 1993 to November 8, 1994.

The social market economy was designed to be a [[third way]] between ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[economic liberalism]] and [[socialist economics]].{{sfn|Abelshauser|2004|p=89-93}} It was strongly inspired by [[ordoliberalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Goldschmidt, Hermann Rauchenschwandtner|title=The Philosophy of Social Market Economy: Michel Foucault's Analysis of Ordoliberalism|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10419/4374|accessdate=16 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=Universität Freiburg, Freiburger Diskussionspapiere zur Ordnungsökonomik}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social democracy|social democratic ideas]] and the political ideology of [[Christian democracy]], or more generally the tradition of [[Christian ethics]].&lt;ref name="Lamberts1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamberts|first=Emiel|title=Christian Democracy in the European Union, 1945/1995: Proceedings of the Leuven Colloquium, 15-18 November 1995|year=1997|publisher=Leuven University Press|language=English|isbn=9789061868088|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Abelshauser|2004|p=89-93}} The social market economy refrains from attempts to plan and guide production, the workforce, or sales, but it does support planned efforts to influence the economy through the organic means of a comprehensive economic policy coupled with flexible adaptation to market studies. Combining monetary, credit, trade, tax, customs, investment and social policies as well as other measures, this type of economic policy aims to create an economy that serves the welfare and needs of the entire population, thereby fulfilling its ultimate goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3415|title=GHDI – Document – Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "social" segment is often wrongly confused with [[socialism]] and [[democratic socialism]] and although aspects were inspired by the latter the social market approach rejects the socialist ideas of replacing [[private property]] and markets with [[social ownership]] and [[economic planning]]. The "social" element to the model instead refers to support for the provision of [[equal opportunity]] and protection of those unable to enter the free market labor force because of old-age, disability, or unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.kas.de/upload/dokumente/2010/06/60_Years_SME/marktanner.pdf | title=Addressing the Marketing Problem o f the Social Market Economy | author=Marcus Marktanner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the social market economy model evolved from [[ordoliberalism]], this concept was not identical with the conception of the [[Freiburg School]] as it emphasized the state's responsibility actively to improve the market condition and simultaneously to pursue a social balance. In contrast to [[Walter Eucken]], who sought an answer to the social question by establishing a functioning competitive order within a constitutional framework, [[Alfred Müller-Armack]] conceived the social market economy as a regulatory policy idea aiming to combine free enterprise with a social programme that is underpinned by market economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., ''Soziale Marktwirtschaft – Handwörterbuch der Sozialwissenschaften'', vol. 9, Göttingen, 1956, p. 390; Idem, Wirtschaftsordnung und Wirtschaftspolitik, Studien und Konzepte zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft und zur Europäischen Integration, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1966, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In putting social policy on par with economic policy, Müller-Armack's concept was more emphatic regarding socio-political aims than the ordoliberal economic concept. This dual principle also appeared in the name of the model. Although the adjective "social" often attracted criticism as a decorative fig leaf or conversely as a gateway for antiliberal interventionism,&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F. A. v., "Was ist und was heisst 'sozial'?", in: Hunold, A. (ed.), ''Masse und Demokratie'', Erlenbach-Zurich/ Stuttgart, 1957, pp. 71 ff. See also the contributions of Wünsche, H. F., Welcher Marktwirtschaft gebührt das Beiwort "sozial"? and Wartin, C., Zur sozialen Dimension marktwirtschaftlicher Ordnungen, in: Hohmann, K.; Schönwitz, D.; Weber, H. J.; Wünsche, H. F. (eds.), Grundtexte zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Band 2, Das Soziale in der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Stuttgart/New York, 1988, pp. 21-31, and pp. 411-415.&lt;/ref&gt; it meant more than simply distinguishing the concept from that of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism on the one side and of ordoliberal conceptions on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. J., The Bonn Republic – West German Democracy 1945–1990, London/ New York, 1997, pp. 59 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In drawing on [[Wilhelm Röpke]]'s anthropo-sociological approach of an economic humanism leading to a ''Civitas Humana'',&lt;ref&gt;Röpke, W., Civitas Humana – Grundfragen der Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsordnung, Erlenbach-Zürich, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Müller-Armack pursued a "Social Humanism" or "Social Irenics"—the notion "irenics" derives from the Greek word ''εἰρήνη ''(eirēnē), which means being conducive to or working toward peace, moderation or conciliation—to overcome existing differences in society. Therefore, the social market economy as an extension of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] thought was not a defined economic order, but a holistic conception pursuing a complete humanistic societal order as a synthesis of seemingly conflicting objectives, namely economic freedom and social security.&lt;ref name="Müller-Armack, A. 1971, pp. 50"&gt;Müller-Armack, A., Auf dem Weg nach Europa. Erinnerungen und Ausblicke, Tübingen/ Stuttgart, 1971, pp. 50 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This socio-economic imperative actively managed by a strong state—in contrast to the ordoliberal minimal state solely safeguarding the economic order&lt;ref&gt;In regard to the different conceptions of the state see the study Lange-von Kulessa, J.; Renner, A., Die Soziale Marktwirtschaft Alfred Müller-Armacks und der Ordoliberalismus der Freiburger Schule – Zur Unvereinbarkeit zweier Staatsauffassungen, in: ORDO 49, Stuttgart, 1998, pp. 79-104.&lt;/ref&gt;—is often labelled by the ambiguous but historical term ''Der Dritte Weg'' ("The Third Way").

The concept of the social market economy received fundamental impulses from reflection and critique of historical economic and social orders, namely Smithian ''laissez-faire'' liberalism on the one hand and Marxian socialism on the other. Furthermore, various [[Third Way]] conceptions prepared the ground for the socio-economic concept. Already in the late 19th century, the ''Kathedersozialisten'' ("Catheder Socialists") engaged in social reforms in the ''Verein für Socialpolitik'', turning away from pure liberalism to demand a purposive state policy designed to regulate economic life and advocating a middle course between anarchic individualism, traditionalistic corporatism and bureaucratic etatism.&lt;ref&gt;Nipperdey, Th., Deutsche Geschichte 1866–1918. Erster Band: Arbeitswelt und Bürgergeist, Munich 1993, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the Frankfurt sociologist and economist [[Franz Oppenheimer]] postulated a so-called liberal socialism (i.e. socialism achieved via liberalism) as the pursuit of a societal order in which economic self-interest preserves its power and persists in free competition.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, F., System der Soziologie (III/1). Band 3: Theorie der reinen und politischen Ökonomie, Teil 1: Grundlagen, Jena, 1910, p. 9. The economist Franz Oppenheimer (1864–1943) also published his economic conception in ''Sprung über ein Jahrhundert'', Bern/ Leipzig, 1935 under the pseudonym F. D. Pelton.&lt;/ref&gt; This desirable order of freedom and equality was labelled by a later programmatic publication entitled ''Weder so – noch so. Der dritte Weg'' (''Neither thus, nor thus. The third way'').&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, F., Weder so – noch so. Der dritte Weg, Potsdam, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

This position was widely shared by Oppenheimer's doctoral student and friend [[Ludwig Erhard]],&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer supervised Erhard's doctoral thesis titled 'Wesen und Inhalt der Werteinheit', namely a study on various historical schools' perception of character and content of value, in the years 1922 to 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; though the latter displaced adjective and subject by promoting a [[social liberalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Franz Oppenheimer, dem Lehrer und Freund (1964), in: Hohmann, K. (ed.), Ludwig Erhard. Gedanken aus fünf Jahrzehnten, Reden und Schriften, Düsseldorf/ Vienna/ New York, 1988b, p. 861.&lt;/ref&gt; and never liked the expression Third Way.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the influence of Oppenheimer on Erhard, see Wünsche, H. F., Der Einfluss Oppenheimers auf Erhard und dessen Konzeption von der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, in: Caspari, V.; Schefold, B. (eds.), Franz Oppenheimer und Adolph Lowe, Zwei Wirtschaftswissenschaftler der Frankfurter Universität, Marburg, 1996, pp. 141-161; Haselbach, D., Franz Oppenheimer's Theory of Capitalism and of a Third Path, in: Koslowski, P. (ed.), The Theory of Capitalism in the German Economic Tradition. Historism, Ordo-Liberalism, Critical Theory, Solidarism, Berlin et al., 2000, pp. 54-86.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, the term was tainted, reminding him too much about ideas of a mixed economy, somewhere between a market economy and central planning. He vehemently and consistently argued against the view that models were converging.&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Wirtschaft und Bildung (17 Aug 1957), reprinted in: Hohmann, K. (ed.), l.c., 1988b, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further in contrast to Müller-Armack who emphasised the social aspect, for Erhard the social market economy was always first and foremost a market economic system.&lt;ref&gt;Comparative study Goldschmidt, N., Alfred Müller-Armack and Ludwig Erhard: Social Market Liberalism, in: CREPHE-CREA Histoire du Liberalisme en Europe, Brochure no. 21, Paris, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; By proclaiming "the freer an economy is, the more social it is",&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Wirken und Reden, Ludwigsburg, 1966, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard once told [[Friedrich Hayek]] that the free market economy did not need to be made social, but that it was social in its origin.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (University of Chicago Press, 1991), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard was rather inclined to Walter Eucken's ordoliberal competitive market order. Although he even considered himself an ordoliberal,&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik – Der Weg der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Düsseldorf/Vienna/New York/Moscow, 1992 (originally published in 1962), p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard based his economic conception neither on Eucken nor on Müller-Armack. In fact, his doctoral supervisor Oppenheimer and especially Röpke, like Erhard a student of Oppenheimer, was his source of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. J., l.c., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard perceived Röpke's books as works of revelation and considered the economist a brother in spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Hentschel, V., Ludwig Erhard – Ein Politikerleben, Berlin, 1998, pp. 75-78.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August 1948, Erhard referred to Müller-Armack by whom he was strongly impressed most of all not as a theorist, but instead as one who wanted to transfer theory into practice&lt;ref name="Hentschel, V. 1998, p. 25"&gt;Hentschel, V., Ludwig Erhard – Ein Politikerleben, Berlin, 1998, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and his concept of the social market economy. Soon after, at the second party congress of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] in the British zone in Recklinghausen on 28 August 1948, Erhard circumscribed the concept as a "socially committed market economy".&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Marktwirtschaft im Streit der Meinungen, printed in: Erhard, L., Deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik – Der Weg der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Düsseldorf/ Vienna/ New York/ Moscow, 1992, p. 70. Finally, Erhard used and described the term in an article in the Berliner Tagesspiegel on 23 April 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most neoliberal economists viewed the concept not only as an economic path between the Scylla of an untamed pure ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and the Charybdis of a collectivist planned economy, but also as a holistic and democratic social order, Erhard and in particular Müller-Armack emphasised public acceptance and civic engagement as prerequisites for the success of the socio-economic model.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., The Social Market Economy as an Economic and Social Order, in: Review of Social Economy 36, Washington, D.C., 1978, pp. 326 f.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Müller-Armack stressed that by "more socialism" he meant the social engagement for and with the people.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., Religion und Wirtschaft, Bern/ Stuttgart, 1950, pp. 559 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Erhard pointed out that the principles of the social market economy could only be achieved if the public was determined to give them priority.&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Wohlstand für alle, Gütersloh, 1963, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important figures in the development of the concept include Eucken, Röpke, [[Alexander Rüstow]], [[Franz Böhm]], Oppenheimer, Erhard, [[Constantin von Dietze]] and Müller-Armack, who originally coined the term ''Soziale Marktwirtschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedrich, Carl J.|year=1955|title=The Political Thought of Neo-Liberalism|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=49|issue=2|pages=509–525|doi=10.2307/1951819|jstor=1951819|publisher=American Political Science Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; They share an involvement in the Anti-Nazi Opposition, whose search for a post-Nazi order for Germany is an important background for the development of this concept. Early protagonists had close contacts to the oppositional church-movement [[Bekennende Kirche]] and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] and emphasized the reference of their concept to Catholic and Protestant social ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Blumenthal-Lampe: Das wirtschaftspolitische Programm der Freiburger Kreise: Entwurf einer freiheitlich-sozialen Nachkriegswirtschaft, Berlin 1973; Harald Jung: Soziale Marktwirtschaft und weltliche Ordnung, Berlin 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhine capitalism ===
[[Michel Albert]] described a similar concept, "Rhine capitalism". He compared the so-called "neo-American model" of a capitalistic market economy introduced by the administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] with what he called Rhine capitalism, present in Germany, France and in some of the Northern European economies.

While the neo-American model builds largely on the ideas of [[Friedrich Hayek|Friedrich von Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]], Rhine capitalism according to Albert has its foundations on publicly organized [[social security]]. Albert analyzes the Rhenish model as the more equitable, efficient and less violent one. However, according to Albert complex psychological phenomena and the functioning of the press lets the American model appear more attractive and dynamic to the general public.&lt;ref name="Albert1993"&gt;Michel Albert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dBDsAAAAMAAJ Capitalism Against Capitalism]''. Whurr; 1993. {{ISBN|978-1-870332-54-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social capitalism model ===
Social capitalism as a theory or political or philosophical stance challenges the idea that the capitalist system is inherently antagonistic to social goals or to a political economy characterized by greater economic equality.&lt;ref name="Hill2010" /&gt; The essence of the social market economy is the view that private markets are the most effective allocation mechanism, but that output is maximized through sound state macroeconomic management of the economy. Social market economies posit that a strong social support network for the less affluent enhances capital output. By decreasing poverty and broadening prosperity to a large middle class, capital market participation is enlarged. Social market economies also posit that government regulation and even sponsorship of markets can lead to superior economic outcomes as evidenced in government sponsorship of the Internet or basic securities regulation.

=== Main elements ===
The main elements of the social market economy in Germany are the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanherzoginstitut.de/uploads/tx_mspublication/Enste-Soziale_Marktwirtschaft_aus_ordnungspolitischer_Sicht.pdf Roman Herzog Institute: Social Market Economy in Germany] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224125722/http://www.romanherzoginstitut.de/uploads/tx_mspublication/Enste-Soziale_Marktwirtschaft_aus_ordnungspolitischer_Sicht.pdf |date=2011-02-24 }} (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

* The social market contains central elements of a free market economy such as private property, free foreign trade, exchange of goods and free formation of prices.
* In contrast to the situation in a free market economy, the state is not passive and actively implements [[Regulation|regulative]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/popup/popup_lemmata.html?guid=Y0VZ7J keyword "social market economy" = “Soziale Marktwirtschaft”] Duden Wirtschaft von A bis Z. Grundlagenwissen für Schule und Studium, Beruf und Alltag. 2. Aufl. Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut &amp; F.A. Brockhaus 2004. Lizenzausgabe Bonn: Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements such as [[Pension#Germany|pension insurance]], [[Universal health care#Germany|universal health care]] and [[unemployment insurance]] are part of the social security system. These insurances are funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies. The social policy objectives include employment, housing and education policies as well as a socio-politically motivated balancing of the distribution of income growth. In addition, there are provisions to restrain the free market (e.g. anti-trust code, laws against the abuse of market power and so on). These elements help to diminish many of the occurring problems of a free market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon: [http://wirtschaftslexikon.gabler.de/Definition/soziale-marktwirtschaft.html Eintrag: keyword "social market economy" = Soziale Marktwirtschaft]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The social market economy was born and formed in times of severe economic, but equally socio-political crises. Its conceptual architecture was set by particular historical experiences and political prerequisites: Germany's preoccupation with the social question since the late 19th century, the criticism of liberal capitalism triggered by the world economic crisis of the early 1930s and a pronounced anti-[[totalitarianism]] as well as anti-[[collectivism]] formed by the experiences of the [[Third Reich]]. These led to the eventual development of the social market economy as a viable socio-political and economic alternative between the extremes of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism and the collectivist [[planned economy]] not as a compromise, but as a combination of seemingly conflicting objectives namely greater state provision for social security and the preservation of individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Glossner, C. L.; Gregosz, D., The Formation and Implementation of the Social Market Economy by Alfred Müller-Armack and Ludwig Erhard, Sankt Augustin/Berlin, 2011, S. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major factors for the emergence of the German model of capitalism was to ameliorate the conditions of workers under capitalism and thus to stave off the threat of [[Karl Marx]]'s militant socialist movement. Germany implemented the world's first welfare state and universal healthcare program in the 1880s. Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] developed a program in which industry and state work closely to stimulate economic growth by giving workers greater security. To trump the militant socialists, Bismarck gave workers a corporate status in the legal and political structures of the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Hennock. "Social Policy under the Empire: Myths and Evidence" ''German History'' 1998 16(1): 58–74; Herman Beck, ''The Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia. Conservatives, Bureaucracy, and the Social Question, 1815–70''. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1884, Bismarck declared:

{{quote|The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, left to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic B. M. Hollyday, ''Bismarck'' (1970) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bismarck's program centered squarely on providing universal social insurance programs designed to increase productivity and focus the political attentions of the German workers on supporting [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]]. The program included universal healthcare, compulsory education, sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance and a retirement pension, none of which were then in existence to any great degree anywhere else in the world.

After the collapse of the totalitarian Third Reich with its statist and corporatist economic policy, economists and academics at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany advocated a neoliberal or new liberal and socio-economic order. In this context, it is important to distinguish between the [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] [[Freiburg School]] (or Freiburg School of Law and Economics) and the [[Freiburg Circles]]. Frequently, the two schools of thought were believed to be the same,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Götz, H. H., Die geistigen Väter der sozialen Marktwirtschaft, in: Eick, J. (ed.), So nutzt man den Wirtschaftsteil einer Tageszeitung, Frankfurt am Main, 1971, pp. 57-61 or Rieter, H.; Schmolz, M., The Ideas of German Ordoliberalism 1938–1945: Pointing the Way to a New Economic Order, in: The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought 1, London, 1993, pp. 87-114.&lt;/ref&gt; although the first emerged from the latter and among the members of the Freiburg School only the founders [[Walter Eucken]] and [[Franz Böhm]] belonged to the Freiburg Circles and conversely no member of the Freiburg Circles can be attributed to the Freiburg School, which partly advocated different economic objectives. Both schools of economic thought considered that a certain form of planning was necessary for a transitional period following the war. However, whereas the pivotal members of the Freiburg Circles, [[Erwin von Beckerath]], [[Adolf Lampe]] and [[:de:Jens Jessen|Jens Jessen]], favoured productive governmental intervention, i.e. an economy regulated by a relatively strong state,&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg-Lampe, C. (ed.), Der Weg in die Soziale Marktwirtschaft: Referate, Protokolle, Gutachten der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Erwin von Beckerath 1943–1947, Stuttgart, 1986, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Eucken, Böhm and [[Constantin von Dietze]] believed in self-regulating market forces and limited indirect state interference.&lt;ref&gt;Grossekettler, H., Adolf Lampe, die Transformationsprobleme zwischen Friedens- und Kriegswirtschaften und die Arbeitsgemeinschaft Erwin von Beckerath, in: Goldschmidt, N. (ed.), Wirtschaft, Politik und Freiheit, Freiburg im Breisgau, 2005, p. 104 and Blumenberg-Lampe, C., Das Wirtschaftspolitische Programm der "Freiburger Kreise", Berlin, 1973, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eucken and his competitive order labelled ordoliberalism, the state must solely create a proper legal environment for the economy and maintain a healthy level of competition through measures that follow market principles. Thus, the paramount means by which economic policy can seek to improve the economy is by improving the institutional framework or "ordo".

In drawing on both Eucken's ordoliberal competitive order and [[Wilhelm Röpke]]'s economic humanism leading to a "Civitas Humana",&lt;ref&gt;Röpke, W., Grundfragen rationeller Wirtschaftspolitik, in: Zeitschrift für Schweizer Statistik &amp; Volkswirtschaft, no. 1, 1941, p. 112; Idem, Civitas Humana – Grundfragen der Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsordnung, Erlenbach-Zurich, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; the ordoliberal competitive order was further developed by the Cologne School around the economist and anthropologist [[Alfred Müller-Armack]], who therefore coined the term ''Soziale Marktwirtschaft'' ("social market economy") in a publication in December 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., Wirtschaftslenkung und Marktwirtschaft, Hamburg, 1946, p. 88. However, the question of the origins of the term Soziale Marktwirtschaft is still controversial. In his autobiography Wahrheit und Wirklichkeit. Der Weg aus den Weltkriegen in die Soziale Marktwirtschaft und eine künftige Weltordnung, Homburg-Saarplatz, 1996, pp. 571 ff., Karl Günther Weiss, academic assistant to the former permanent representative of the State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Economics, Otto Ohlendorf, argues, the term 'social market economy' was the outcome of a discussion with Ludwig Erhard on 12 Jan 1945. There is also some evidence that Harold Rasch, who in 1946/47 was deputy head of the inter-zonal economic administration in Minden, used the term in late 1947 and early 1948 independently of Müller-Armack (1901–1978); cf. Rasch, H., Grundlagen der Wirtschaftsverfassung, Bad Godesberg, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it evolved from ordoliberalism  as a new variant of [[neoliberalism]], this concept was not identical with the conception of the Freiburg School. In contrast to Eucken, who favoured a strictly procedural or rule-oriented liberalism in which the state solely sets the institutional framework and abstains generally from interference in the market, Müller-Armack emphasised the state's responsibility actively to improve the market condition and simultaneously to pursue a social balance.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., Soziale Marktwirtschaft – Handwörterbuch der Sozialwissenschaften, vol. 9, Göttingen, 1956, p. 390; Idem, Wirtschaftsordnung und Wirtschaftspolitik, Studien und Konzepte zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft und zur Europäischen Integration, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1966, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In putting social policy on a par with economic policy, Müller-Armack's concept was more emphatic regarding socio-political aims than the ordoliberal economic concept. However, the social market economy as an extension of neoliberal thought was deliberately not a defined economic order, but an adjustable holistic conception pursuing a complete humanistic societal order as a synthesis of seemingly conflicting objectives, namely economic freedom and social security.&lt;ref name="Müller-Armack, A. 1971, pp. 50" /&gt; Although it is often viewed as a ''mélange'' of socio-political ideas rather than a precisely outlined theoretical order, the conception possessed an effective slogan, which facilitated its communication to both politics and the public. However, the eventual implementation required not only communication, but also political backup.

Here, Müller-Armack's concept soon met with the conception of the then Chairman of the ''Sonderstelle Geld und Kredit'' (Special Bureau for Money and Credit) within the Administration for Finance, i.e. an expert commission preparing the currency reform in the then Anglo-American [[Bizone]], [[Ludwig Erhard]]. Although Erhard was rather inclined to Eucken's ordoliberal competitive market order&lt;ref&gt;Commun, P., Erhards Bekehrung zum Ordoliberalismus: Die grundlegende Bedeutung des wirtschaftspolitischen Diskurses in Umbruchszeiten, in: Freiburg Discussion Papers on Constitutional Economics 04/4, Freiburg im Breisgau, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and even considered himself an ordoliberal,&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik – Der Weg der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Düsseldorf/ Vienna/ New York/ Moscow, 1992 (originally published in 1962), p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; he was strongly impressed by Müller-Armack most of all not as a theorist, but instead as one who wanted to transfer theory into practice.&lt;ref name="Hentschel, V. 1998, p. 25"/&gt;

When Erhard succeeded [[Johannes Semmler]] as Director of the Administration for Economics in the [[Bizonal Economic Council]] on 2 March 1948, the social market economy entered the political sphere. Soon after on 21 April 1948, Erhard informed the parliament about his economic policy and introduced the concept of the social market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wörtliche Berichte über die 1.-40. Vollversammlung des Wirtschaftsrates des Vereinigten Wirtschaftsgebietes (Zweizonen-Wirtschaftsrat) in Frankfurt am Main, 8 vols., Wiesbaden/ Frankfurt am Main, 1947–1949, pp. 436 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no unanimous applause, both the liberal democrats and the conservatives widely welcomed the transition to a more market-oriented economy.&lt;ref&gt;Görtemaker, M., Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Von der Gründung bis zur Gegenwart, Munich, 1999, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereupon, the Chairman of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) in the British zone of occupation, [[Konrad Adenauer]], invited Erhard to also inform the party members about his socio-economic conception at the party convention in Recklinghausen, Germany on 28 August 1948. In a visionary and stirring speech, entitled ''Marktwirtschaft im Streit der Meinungen'' ("Market Economy in Dispute"),&lt;ref&gt;Stoltenberg, G., Konrad Adenauer und die Soziale Marktwirtschaft, in: Die Politische Meinung, edited by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS), vol. 45 (373), Sankt Augin, 2000, pp. 21 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard defended his concept of the social market economy alluding to the dualism between a controlled economy and a market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., l.c., 1992, pp. 69-85.&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the upcoming regional and federal elections, Adenauer, who was initially sceptical about Erhard,&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., l.c., 1971, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; was not only impressed by the polarising slogan, i.e. "Controlled or Market Economy", but also by the efficacy of Erhard and his programme.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, H.-P., Adenauer. Der Aufstieg. 1876–1952, Stuttgart, 1986, p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for a successful political alliance was laid.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078072-0004, Konrad Adenauer.jpg|thumbnail|[[Konrad Adenauer]], a proponent of the social market economy]]

Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] of the ruling CDU implemented a new novel economic order amalgamating the promotion of free competition with the responsibility of the social government. The [[Wirtschaftswunder]] or "economic miracle" of [[West Germany]] could not have been brought about without secure social peace in the country. Adenauer's program centered on legislation establishing co-determination in the coal and steel industry, the system of employee property formation, the equalization of burdens, the creation of subsidized housing, child benefits, the agricultural Green Plan and the dynamism of pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.3717/|title=Biography of Konrad Adenauer, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 1948, the principles of the "social market economy" espoused by the CDU became the foundation of modern German economic policy:

{{quote|The "social market economy" is the socially anchored law for the industrial economy, according to which the achievements of free and able individuals are integrated into a system that produces the highest level of economic benefit and social justice for all. This system is created by freedom and responsibility, which find expression in the "social market economy" through genuine performance-based competition and the independent control of monopolies. Genuine performance-based competition exists when the rules of competition ensure that, under conditions of fair competition and equal opportunity, the better performance is rewarded. Market-driven prices regulate the interaction between all market participants.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Democratic Union, ''The CDU and the Social Market Economy: Düsseldorf Guidelines for Economic Policy, Agricultural Policy, Social Policy and Housing'' (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU) also expressed its commitment to a market economy with social balance and the then newly elected Bavarian Minister for Economic Affairs [[Hanns Seidel]] advocated Erhard's liberal and social economic model at the CSU's party convention in Straubing in May 1949,&lt;ref&gt;Wirtschaftspolitische Richtlinien der CSU in Bayern, (supposedly end of 1948).&lt;/ref&gt; the economic principles elaborated by the Working Committee of the [[CDU/CSU]] as liaison body and information centre of the two political parties commonly referred to as the "Union", centred the social market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wirtschaftspolitische Leitsätze der Arbeitsgemeinschaft der CDU/CSU, (presumably April 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, these principles were adopted as party platform and manifesto for the upcoming federal elections at the CDU's party conference in Düsseldorf on 15 July 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Narr, W.-D., CDU-SPD. Programm und Praxis seit 1945, Stuttgart, 1966, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the previous ideological Ahlener Programm suggesting a rather abstract and anti-materialist ''Gemeinwirtschaft'',&lt;ref&gt;Ahlener Programm, in: Heck, B. (ed.), Die CDU und ihr Programm – Programme, Erklärungen, Entschliessungen, Melle/ Sankt Augin, 1979, pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; these so-called ''Düsseldorfer Leitsätze'' not only provided a concrete, pragmatic and materialist economic programme, but also an attractive slogan to reach consensus within the party and the public. While eventually the union of the two recently established political parties (i.e. the CDU and the CSU) possessed a coherent and unifying economic programme enabling a more consistent public front, the oldest German political party, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), led by the advocate of economic planning and extensive socialisation [[Kurt Schumacher]], did not introduce its own economic concept. This not only complicated the parliamentary work of the party in the [[Economic Council]], but also limited the public relations of the party as a whole especially in times of campaigning where the partially complex political programmes were simplified and popularised.

In the run-up to the federal elections in August 1949, the CDU/CSU consequently aligned their party platforms, policies and manifestos and campaigned with the social market economy. In particular, the former advertising manager for consumer goods Ludwig Erhard, who affirmed that he would "go into the upcoming political party clashes with particular energy for the CDU",&lt;ref&gt;Wengst, U., Die CDU/CSU im Bundestagswahlkampf 1949, in: Viertelsjahreshefte für Zeitgeschichte (VfZ) 34, no. 1, Munich, 1986, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; realised the potential of subtle and systematic marketing to transform the concept from an economic theory, or even abstract economic policy, into the basis of a political party's propaganda and public image that held broad appeal. Eventually, on Sunday 14 August 1949 around 31 million Germans were called to cast a vote for the first German [[Bundestag]] and to decide between the social market economy and a controlled economy advocated by the SPD. Of those eligible to vote, 25 million or 78.5 per cent actually went to the ballot boxes and showed a clear commitment to the emerging post-war democracy.

Although the SPD turned out to be the most successful single party by gaining 29.12 per cent of the votes, the CDU/CSU combined attracted more votes, totalling 31 per cent and 139 mandates compared to 131 for the SPD. However, in fact both Volksparteien had suffered large percentage losses over their previous Land election totals by failing to capture a comparable share of the enlarged electorate. The most remarkable advance by winning over a million extra votes and achieving 11.9 per cent of the total votes was that made by the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) led by the chairman [[Theodor Heuss]]. The [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] FDP were in fact the only political party consistently gaining percentage of votes between 1946 and 1949. While these results affirmed the then general pro-market trend in public opinion, eventually, the electorate made its decision contingent on the satisfaction of its practical needs rather than on any particular theoretical economic system. The advantage of the CDU and the CSU lay precisely in the fact that they were quasi-governing across the [[Bizone]] and thus increasingly identified with the economic recovery and the improving economic conditions. Although the implementation of the social market economy benefited also from other crucial factors, including the East-West conflict and a favourable political and social climate within Germany and abroad, the stabilising alliance between the conservative and liberal parties, the pro-market composition of the Economic Council and even the Federal Republic's own ''[[Grundgesetz]]'' (Basic Law), which stressed individual freedom, human dignity and the subsidiarity of societal organisation, it was also the consistent efforts at political communication of the [[cooperative]] and corporate model that led to the implementation and eventual electoral validation of the social market economy in post-war West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Glossner, C. L., The Making of the German Post-War Economy – Political Communication and Public Reception of the social market economy after World War II, London, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first controversial, the model became increasingly popular in West Germany and Austria since in both states economic success (''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'') was identified with it. From the 1960s, the social market economy was the main economic model in mainland Western Europe, pursued by administrations of both the [[centre-right]] (led by the CDU/CSU) and the [[centre-left]] (led by the SPD). The concept of the social market economy is still the common economic basis of most political parties in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg Programme of the SPD, page 24, http://www.parteitag.spd.de/servlet/PB/show/1734195/Hamburger%20Programm%20engl.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911035738/http://www.parteitag.spd.de/servlet/PB/show/1734195/Hamburger%20Programm%20engl.pdf |date=2008-09-11 }}&lt;br/&gt;CDU on 60 years of social market economy, http://www.cdu.de/politikaz/wirtschaft.php&lt;br/&gt;Wiesbaden Programme of the FDP, page 14, http://www.fdp.de/files/565/wiesbaden-declaration.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and a commitment to some form of social market economy is present in Article 3 of the [[Treaty on European Union]].

=== United Kingdom ===

In the [[United Kingdom]], the concept of the social market economy was first introduced by the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative]] politician [[Keith Joseph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/jicsc/05-034.pdf | title=Christianity and the Social Market Economy in Britain, Germany and Northern Ireland | author=Esmond Birnie | journal=Journal of the Irish Christian Study Centre | year=1994 | volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[World War II]], the main political parties agreed on the nationalization of industry and close economic regulation. In the 1970s, Joseph introduced the idea as an alternative to the [[post-war consensus]] allowing [[free markets]] for competition and innovation whilst the role of government was to help hold the ring, provide infrastructure, maintain a stable currency, a framework of laws, implementation of law and order, provision of a safety net (welfare state), defence of property rights and all other rights involved in the economic process. Throughout his political career, Joseph used his position to restate the principles of the social market economy and re-direct Conservative policy in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/dec/12/obituaries|title=Keith Joseph|first=John|last=Biffen|date=12 December 1994|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph eventually set up a think tank in 1974 to study the model and initially called it the Ludwig Erhard Foundation and Institute for a Social Market Economy before settling on the name [[Centre for Policy Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2015/11/06/comment-why-is-labour-still-so-obsessed-with-the-german-mode|title=Why is Labour still so obsessed with the German model?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Social Market Foundation]] (one of the top 12 think tanks in the country) founded by Conservative politician [[Daniel Finkelstein]] also aims at championing ideas of "a market economy with social obligations".

== Criticism ==
Although one of the main factors for the emergence of the European model of capitalism was to attempt to ameliorate the conditions of workers under capitalism and thus stave off the emergence of socialism or socialist revolution,&lt;ref&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. "The European Model" (P.207): "Karl Marx also influenced the European model indirectly through his warnings about the inherent instability of capitalism. Western Europe, composed of prosperous nations ruled by Marx's hated bourgeoisie, feared that if the economy were left to its own devices, Marx's prediction of collapse would come true, and the proletariat would overthrow the ruling class... Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced social welfare legislation in Germany between 1883 and 1888, despite violent political opposition, as a direct attempt to stave off Marx's socialist revolution."&lt;/ref&gt; critics identify the social market model with the notions of the [[welfare state]] and sometimes mistakenly identify it as being [[Socialism|socialistic]].&lt;ref name="Hill2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David B.

The '''statutory accounting principles''' are a set of accounting rules for insurance companies set forth by the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]].  They are used to prepare the statutory financial statements of insurance companies.  With minor state-by-state variations, they are the basis for state regulation of [[Own risk and solvency assessment|insurance company solvency]] throughout the United States.

The rules are issued as discussion drafts, and public comments are solicited, before they are codified in the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual.

'''Cosmetic testing on animals''' is a type of [[animal testing]] used to test the safety and [[hypoallergenic]] properties of products for use by humans. Due to the harm done to the animal subjects, this testing is opposed by [[animal rights ]] activists and others. Cosmetic animal testing is banned in the [[European Union]], [[India]], [[Israel]],&lt;ref name="WorldPost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSUS"/&gt; and [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="US Bill"/&gt;

==Definition==
Using animal testing in the development of [[cosmetics]] may involve testing either a finished product or the individual ingredients of a finished product on animals, often [[rabbit]]s, as well as [[mice]], [[rat]]s, and other animals. Cosmetics can be defined as products applied to the body in various ways in order to enhance the body's appearance or to cleanse the body. This includes all hair products, makeup, nail products and soaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm074201.htm|title=Laws &amp; Regulations - Is It a Cosmetic, a Drug, or Both? (Or Is It Soap?)|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|date=|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) continues to endorse animal testing methods.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"/&gt;

Re-using existing test data obtained from previous animal testing is generally not considered to be cosmetic testing on animals; however, the acceptability of this to opponents of testing is inversely proportional to how recent the data is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kunde oder Vertriebspartner werden|url=http://www.vegas-germany.de/|website=VEGAS Cosmetics|language=de-DE|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Methods of testing cosmetics on animals include many different tests that are categorized differently based on which areas the cosmetics will be used for. One new ingredient in any cosmetic product used in these tests could lead to the deaths of at least 1,400 animals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/flair/2017/09/276688/cruelty-free-cosmetics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063147/https://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/flair/2017/09/276688/cruelty-free-cosmetics |archivedate=9 February 2018 |df=dmy-all }}. &lt;/ref&gt;

Dermal penetration: Rats are mostly used in this method that analyzes moment of a chemical, and the penetration of the chemical in the bloodstream. Dermal penetration is a method that creates a better understanding of skin absorption.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"/&gt;

Skin sensitisation: This is a method that determines if a chemical causes an allergic reaction. The chemical adjuvant is injected to boost the immune system. In the past it was performed on guinea pigs, and applied on a shaved patch of skin. Substances are assessed based on appearance of skin.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"/&gt;

Acute toxicity: This test is used to determine danger of exposure to a chemical by mouth, skin, or inflammation. Rats and mice are injected  in lethal dose 50% (LD50). This test can cause animal convulsions, loss of motor function, and seizures.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aavs.org/animals-science/how-animals-are-used/testing/|title=Testing|work=American Anti-Vivisection Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Draize test]]: This is a method of testing that may cause irritation or corrosion to the skin or eye on animals, dermal sensitization, airway sensitization, endocrine disruption, and {{LD50}} (which refers to the lethal dose which kills 50% of the treated animals).

Skin corrosivity or irritation: This method of test assesses the potential of a substance causing irreversible damage to the skin. It is typically performed on rabbits and involves putting chemicals on a shaved patch of skin. This determines the level of damage to the skin that includes itching, inflammation, swelling, etc.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"/&gt;

==Alternatives==
Cosmetics manufacturers who do not test on animals may now use ''in vitro'' screens to test for endpoints which can determine potential risk to humans with a very high sensitivity and specificity. Companies such as CeeTox in the USA, recently acquired by Cyprotex, specialize in such testing and organizations like the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), PETA and many other organizations advocate the use of ''in vitro'' and other non-animal tests in the development of consumer products. By using safe ingredients from a list of 5,000 which have already been tested in conjunction with modern methods of cosmetics testing, the need for tests using animals are negated.&lt;ref name="Aus"/&gt;

EpiSkin™, EpiDerm™ and SkinEthic are each composed of artificial human skin as an option for alternative testing. Artificial skin can imitate the reaction actual human skin will have to a product and the chemicals it contains and can be altered to mimic different skin types and ages. For example, using UV light on EpiSkin can cause it to resemble older skin and adding melanocytes will turn the skin a darker color. This helped create a spectrum of different skin colors that are then used to compare the results of sunblock on a different variety of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merali|first=Zeeya|date=July 28, 2007|title=New Scientist|url=|journal=Human skin to replace animal tests|volume=195|pages=14-14|via=|doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(07)61866-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address potential issues with other parts of the human body, research companies such as NOTOX have developed a synthetic model of the human liver, which is the main organ to detox the body, in order to test harmful ingredients and chemicals to see if the liver can detox those elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mone|first=Gregory|date=April 2014|title=New Models in Cosmetics Replacing Animal Testing|url=|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=57|pages=20–21|doi=10.1145/2581925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research companies can also use body parts and organs taken from animals  slaughtered for the [[meat industry]] to perform tests such as the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Test and Isolated Chicken Eye Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alternatives to Animal Tests : The Humane Society of the United States|url = http://m.humanesociety.org/issues/cosmetic_testing/facts/alternatives_animal_tests.html?credit=web_id329654370|website = m.humanesociety.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1937, a mistake was made that ended up changing the pharmaceutical industry drastically. A company created a medicine “to treat streptococcal infections”, and without any scientific research the medicine was out on shelves.&lt;ref name="medicaldaily.com"&gt;Scutti, Susan. "Animal Testing: A Long, Unpretty History." Medical Daily, 27 June 2013,www.medicaldaily.com/animal-testing-long-unpretty-history-247217.&lt;/ref&gt; This medicine turned out to be extremely poisonous to people, leading to large poisoning outbreaks followed by over 100 deaths.&lt;ref name="medicaldaily.com"/&gt; This epidemic led to a law being passed in 1938, called the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, enforcing more rigorous guidelines on cosmetic products.&lt;ref&gt;Scutti,Susan. "Animal Testing: A Long, Unpretty History." Medical Daily, 27 June 2013,www.medicaldaily.com/animal-testing-long-unpretty-history-247217.&lt;/ref&gt; After this law was passed companies looked to animals to test their products, in turn, creating the first encounters of cosmetic animal testing.

==Procedures of animal testing==
{{See also|The Three Rs (animals)}}
There is a strategy used in animal testing laboratories titled the 'Three R's:' Reduction, refinement, and replacement' (Doke, "Alternatives to Animal Testing: A Review"). 
*'''Reduction:''' This approach is built upon the ethics to have a minimal number of animal subjects being tested on for current and later tests. 
*'''Refinement:''' This suggests that the planned distress and pain caused to an animal subject to be as little as possible. This approach focuses on making a home for the animals before entering testing grounds in order to elongate the life of laboratory animals. Discomfort to animals causes an imbalance in hormonal levels which create fluctuating results during testing. 
*'''Replacement:''' This provides the opportunity to study the response of cellular models, but in other words, replacement searches for alternatives that could be done rather than testing on animal subjects.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Legal requirements and status==
{{update section|date=December 2015}}
Due to the strong public backlash against cosmetic testing on animals, most cosmetic manufacturers say their products are not tested on animals. However, they are still required by trading standards and [[consumer protection]] laws in most countries to show their products are not toxic and not dangerous to public health, and that the ingredients are not dangerous in large quantities, such as when in transport or in the manufacturing plant. In some countries, it is possible to meet these requirements without any further tests on animals. In other countries, it may require animal testing to meet legal requirements. The United States and Japan are frequently criticized for their insistence on stringent safety measures, which often requires animal testing.
Some retailers distinguish themselves in the marketplace by their stance on animal testing.

=== Legal requirements in Japan ===

Although Japanese law doesn’t require non-medicated cosmetics to be tested on animals, it doesn’t prohibit it either, leaving the decision to individual companies.&lt;ref name="hsi.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Cruelty-Free Campaign Backed by Global Stars, Launches in Tokyo to End Cosmetics Animal Testing in Japan (March 17, 2014)|url=http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2014/03/japan-bcf-campaign-launch-031714.html|website=Humane Society International|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal testing is required mainly when the product contains newly-developed tar colors, ultraviolet ray protective ingredients or preservatives, and when the amount of any ingredient regulated in terms of how much can be added is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of Cosmetics -- Toward Abolishment of Animal Testing (February 2015)|url=http://www.japanfs.org/en/news/archives/news_id035188.html|website=JFS: Japan for Sustainability|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Brands such as Shiseido and Mandom have ended much, but not all, of their animal testing. However, most other leading cosmetics companies in Japan still test on animals.&lt;ref name="hsi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Initiatives in Response to Animal Testing and Alternative Methods|url=https://www.shiseidogroup.com/csr/challenge/experiment/|website=Shiseido Group|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approach to alternative to animal experiments|url=http://www.mandom.co.jp/english/eco/src/society_animal.html|website=Mandom|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisdictions with bans ===

==== Brazil, São Paulo ====
[[São Paulo]] in Brazil, banned cosmetic animal testing in 2014.&lt;ref name="Sao Paulo"&gt;{{cite news|title=São Paulo Bans Animal Testing|url=http://www.petmd.com/news/care-safety/sao-paulo-bans-animal-testing-31269|publisher=AFP News|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Union ====
The European Union (EU) followed suit, after it agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban cosmetics-related animal testing.&lt;ref name="Euro"&gt;{{cite news|title=EU extends ban on animal-tested cosmetics|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/03/11/eu-extends-ban-on-animal-tested-cosmetics/|date=11 March 2013|publisher=EuroNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal testing is regulated in [[EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics#Restrictions for hazardous ingredients and animal testing|EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics]]. Imported cosmetics ingredients tested on animals were phased out for EU consumer markets in 2013 by the ban,&lt;ref name="Euro"/&gt; but can still be sold to outside of the EU.&lt;ref name="Rhiannon"/&gt; Norway banned cosmetics animal testing the same time as the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway ban animal testing of cosmetics|url=http://www.theoslotimes.com/norway-ban-animal-testing-of-cosmetics/|work=The Oslo Times|date=12 March 2013|author=Aryan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318075255/http://www.theoslotimes.com/norway-ban-animal-testing-of-cosmetics/|archivedate=18 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018 the European Parliament voted for the EU and its Member States to work towards a UN convention against the use of animal testing for cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foster: "Cosmetic testing on animals must be banned worldwide”|url=http://conservativeeurope.com/news/foster-cosmetic-testing-on-animals-must-be-banned-worldwide|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 May 2018|author=Jacqueline Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== India ====
In early 2014, India announced a ban on testing cosmetics on animals in the country, thereby becoming the second country in Asia to do so.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt bans cosmetic companies from testing on animals|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Govt-bans-cosmetic-companies-from-testing-on-animals/articleshow/29225017.cms|date=23 Jan 2014|author=Mukherjee, Rupali|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later India banned import of cosmetics tested on animals in November 2014.&lt;ref name="Mohan 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mohan | first=Vishwa | title=India bans import of cosmetics tested on animals |work=The Times of India | date=14 October 2014 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-bans-import-of-cosmetics-tested-on-animals/articleshow/44814398.cms | accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
Israel banned "the import and marketing of cosmetics, toiletries or detergents that were tested on animals" in 2013.&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Import ban on animal-tested products goes into effect|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/import-ban-on-animal-tested-products-goes-into-effect/|work=The Times of Israel|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
In 2015, New Zealand also banned animal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/270097/mps-unanimously-support-animal-testing-ban|title=MPs unanimously support animal testing ban|date=31 March 2015|work=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Turkey ====
Turkey "banned any animal testing for cosmetic products that have already been introduced to the market."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2015/07/27/animal-testing-for-cosmetics-banned-in-turkey|title=Animal testing for cosmetics banned in Turkey|date=27 July 2015|work=DailySabah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UK ====
Animal testing on cosmetics or their ingredients was banned in the UK in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Research Regulations in the UK |url=http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/animal-research-regulations-in-the-uk/ |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisdictions where prohibitions are considered ===

==== Association of Southeast Asian Nations ====
The [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) is potentially "making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals."&lt;ref name="US Bill"/&gt;

==== Australia ====
In Australia, the ''End Cruel Cosmetics Bill'' was introduced to Parliament in March 2014, which would ban local testing, which generally doesn't happen there, and importation of cosmetics tested on animals.&lt;ref name="Aus"/&gt; In 2016 a bill was passed to ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals, which will come into effect in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/cosmetics-tested-on-animals-to-be-banned-in-australia/news-story/a6362ab50a6146af5c83e60c8e40d93e&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazil ====
Brazil's legislation will vote on a nationwide animal testing for cosmetics ban by the end of March 2014.&lt;ref name="HSUS"/&gt;

==== United States ====
In March 2014, the ''Humane Cosmetics Act'' was introduced to the U.S. congress which would ban cosmetic testing on animals and eventually would ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals.&lt;ref name="US Bill"/&gt; The bill did not advance.

==== South Korea ====
South Korea is also potentially "making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals."&lt;ref name="US Bill"/&gt;

==== Taiwan ====
In 2015, Taiwan launched a bill proposing a ban on cosmetic testing on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/animalalt/Taiwan-Proposes-Animal-Testing-Ban-for-Cosmetics-303286171.html|title=Taiwan Proposes Animal Testing Ban for Cosmetics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It passed in 2016 and goes into effect in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2016/10/taiwan-bans-cosmetics-animal-testing-072116.html|title=Taiwan bans cosmetics animal testing|publisher=Humane Society International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other statuses ===

==== China ====
China passed a law on 30 June 2014 to eliminate the requirement for animal testing of cosmetics. Though domestically-produced ordinary cosmetic goods do not require testing, animal testing is still mandated by law for Chinese-made "cosmeceuticals" (cosmetic goods which make a functional claim) which are available for sale in China. Cosmetics intended solely for export are exempt from the animal testing requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethicalelephant.com/understanding-china-animal-testing-laws/|title=Understanding China's Animal Testing Laws 2015|author=|date=9 September 2015|website=ethicalelephant.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
In 2013, the Russian Ministry of Health stated "Toxicological testing is performed by means of testing for skin allergic reaction or test on
[[mucous tissue]]/eye area (with use of lab animals) or by use of alternative general toxicology methods (IN VITRO). In this manner the technical regulations include measures which provide an alternative to animal testing".&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cruelty Free International wins Russian commitment on non-animal testing|url=http://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/en/a/Cruelty-Free-International-wins-Russian-commitment-on-non-animal-testing|accessdate=12 May 2015|archivedate=18 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073423/http://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/en/a/Cruelty-Free-International-wins-Russian-commitment-on-non-animal-testing|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--===UK position===
Although the British Home Office stopped giving licences to test finished cosmetic products in 1998, compounds that have both cosmetic and medical uses, such as those in the "anti-wrinkle" preparations Zyderm, Restylane and [[Botox]], are still bound by the regulations requiring animal testing. According to activists, a raid on a laboratory in 2004 revealed that the {{LD50}} test is still used on every batch of Botox (a [[toxin]] that, when administered intravenously, is lethal to humans) to establish potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918114852/http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/156/156795_animal_rights_man_faces_jail_over_lab_raid.html |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/156/156795_animal_rights_man_faces_jail_over_lab_raid.html |archivedate=18 September 2012 |title=Animal rights man faces jail over lab raid |date=29 April 2005 |work=[[Manchester Evening News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217084038/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/news/2004/0401boto.htm |url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/news/2004/0401boto.htm |archivedate=17 February 2006 |publisher=Animal Aid |title=Boycott Botox! – Cosmetic scandal exposed |date=January 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929132044/http://www.sarconline.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=129&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0&amp;POSTNUKESID=f070fc85519cfcb46ad4f3d2d92abb1c |url=http://www.sarconline.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=129&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0&amp;POSTNUKESID=f070fc85519cfcb46ad4f3d2d92abb1c |archivedate=29 September 2007 |title=Keith Mann Sentanced &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; – Press response |publisher=Southern Animal Rights Coalition }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''WBNW''' (1120 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a business [[talk radio]] [[radio station|station]] in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] market.  The station is owned by Money Matters Radio, Inc. and is licensed to [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. It is simulcast on [[Broadcast translator|translator station]] W275CM (102.9 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) in Concord. WBNW's flagship program, ''The Financial Exchange'', is syndicated to several other stations in [[New England]] through the '''Money Matters Radio Network'''. Recently talk hosts [[Michael Graham (radio personality)|Michael Graham]], [[Don Imus]], and [[John Batchelor]] were added to the lineup.

==History==
The station first took to the air August 28, 1989&lt;ref name="by1999"/&gt; as '''WADN''', with a [[folk music]] format.&lt;ref name=tbg-wadnstart&gt;{{cite news|last=Bickelhaupt|first=Susan|title=WADN-AM to feature folk music|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8133535.html|accessdate=January 27, 2012|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=August 15, 1989}} (subscription content preview)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the station's staff had previously worked at an earlier Boston-area folk music station, WCAS (740 AM, now [[WJIB]]).&lt;ref name=nerw-wadntalk&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=So Long to Folk on WADN|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-961230.html|accessdate=January 27, 2012|newspaper=New England RadioWatch|date=December 30, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original owner Walden Communications Company sold the station to Assabet Communications Corporation on June 4, 1993.&lt;ref name=fcc-saletoassabet&gt;{{cite web|title=Application Search Details|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=179766|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the original WBNW (590 AM) was acquired by [[Salem Communications]] and became [[Religious broadcasting|religious]] station [[WEZE]] in December 1996, WADN announced that it would begin carrying some [[Bloomberg Radio]] programming;&lt;ref name=nerw-wadnbloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=WEZE Moves to 590|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-961212.html|accessdate=January 27, 2012|newspaper=New England RadioWatch|date=December 12, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the month, the folk format was moved to weekends only to accommodate the business and talk programming,&lt;ref name=nerw-wadntalk /&gt; and in April 1997 folk was dropped entirely. Money Matters Radio bought WADN in 1998;&lt;ref name=nerw-saletomoneymatters&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=1150 Splits Off...|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-980514.html|accessdate=January 27, 2012|newspaper=North East RadioWatch|date=May 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had produced the station's morning show, also simulcast on [[WPLM (AM)|WPLM]] (1390 AM) in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], WNRB (1510 AM, now [[WMEX (AM)|WMEX]]) in Boston, and [[Attleboro, Massachusetts|Attleboro]]-based [[WARA (AM)|WARA]] (1320 AM), since 1997.&lt;ref name=nerw-wadnmorningshow&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=Sales and Format Changes Everywhere...|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-971023.html|accessdate=January 27, 2012|newspaper=North East RadioWatch|date=October 23, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call letters were changed to WBNW on December 1, 1998.&lt;ref name=nerw-wadntowbnw&gt;{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=Big Apple's Big Changes, and, We Visit The Midwest|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-981211.html|accessdate=January 27, 2012|newspaper=North East RadioWatch|date=December 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station currently belongs to a partnership led by Canadian&amp;ndash;American investment counsellor Barry Armstrong.

'''Wan Kuok-koi''' ({{zh|t=尹國駒|w=Wan Gwok-keui|p=Yǐn Guójū}}; born 1955), popularly known as '''Broken Tooth Koi''' (崩牙駒; Cantonese: bung nga keui; Mandarin: bēng yá jū),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/nov/30/notorious-macau-gangster-broken-tooth-koi-set-pris/ Notorious gangster 'Broken Tooth' freed from prison in Macau, SCMP, 2 Dec 2012, John Carney&lt;/ref&gt; was, until his arrest, the leader of the [[Macau]] branch of the [[14K Triad]]. He was released after more than 14 years in prison on 1 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h4-kVr36GfWQf-SiQJc3_YbkY2cQ?docId=CNG.e005752de618c89324b5cd4777c3b725.441&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gang war with former associate ==

However, tension between the two gangsters grew as Wai grew wary of Wan's high-profile persona. Teaming up with rival triad group the [[Shui Fong]], a vicious turf war broke out in 1996 and 1997. In early 1997, an unsigned letter was sent to several newspapers in the area. It said: ''"Warning: From this day on it is forbidden to mention Broken Tooth Koi in the press; otherwise bullets will have no eyes, and knives and bullets will have no feelings."''

In 1997 Wan briefly fled Macau to avoid two arrest warrants, one from a new anti-triad law enacted in Macau, and one for drug-trafficking from [[China]]. However, in August a Portuguese judge cleared Wan of all charges, and unexpectedly retired and moved back to Portugal the very next day.

Wan then proceeded to attack Wai in public, putting up posters claiming he was a drug trafficker and declaring that anyone visiting Wai's casinos would become his enemy. Ultimately, Wan amassed enough power and influence and took over Wai's rackets completely. By this time he was earning $6 million a month from his legal gambling establishments.

== Involvement in the film industry and arrest ==

In the autumn of 1997, Wan approached Hong Kong movie producer [[Henry Fong Ping]] to produce a film based on his life. The result was the 1998 movie ''Casino'' (aka ''Ho Kong Fung Wan'') starring [[Simon Yam]] as Giant, a triad boss living the high life in the Macau underworld. Wan agreed to extensive research meetings to make the film as accurate as possible, as well as using his influence on Macau to help the crew film.

One of his most outrageous stunts was to close down the [[Governador Nobre de Carvalho Bridge|Macau-Taipa Bridge]] for some hours to allow filming of a crucial scene in the movie. The producers had asked the Macau Government for permission to film on the bridge, closing it to traffic, but permission was denied. However, Wan wanted the scene to be shot anyway so he closed traffic from both sides of the bridge without any warning and the scene was filmed in this manner. Traffic to and from Macau was, because of this, halted for around two hours. No [[Public Security Police Force of Macau|police]] intervention was made or any other measures by the [[Government of Macau|Macau Government]] were taken to reopen the bridge to normal traffic flow on what was then one of the two links between Macau mainland and [[Taipa]]-[[Coloane]].

A week before opening night, as he watched his own movie ''Casino'', Wan was arrested and charged with illegal gambling, loan-sharking, criminal association, and attempted murder of chief of police Antonio Marques Baptista with a car bomb. In November 1999, in a landmark trial, he was convicted and jailed, along with eight associates including his brother Wan Kuok-hung. Wan was sentenced to 15 years in prison.  All assets of the nine were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/533226.stm 'Broken Tooth' goes to jail], BBC News, 23 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; His jail term was later reduced to 13 years and 10 months.&lt;ref name=MDTdec12/&gt;

Wan was released from prison on 1 December 2012 and is thought to be planning to re-enter the casino junkets business.&lt;ref name=MDTdec12&gt;[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/38602-%E2%80%98broken-tooth%E2%80%99-koi-to-be-released-december-1st%3A-pj-setting-up-taskforce-to-%E2%80%98welcome%E2%80%99-wan.html http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/broken-tooth-koi-to-be-released-december-1st], Macau Daily Times, 14 Sep 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=12&amp;art_id=126877&amp;sid=37773603&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20120928&amp;fc=7 Crime Lord Returns - The Standard 28 Sep 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private and public life ==

Much like [[Nicky Barnes]] and [[John Gotti]], Wan kept a very stylish public appearance, driving expensive sports cars and wearing expensive suits and jewelery. Prior to his prison sentence he went through three marriages and has fathered six children.

As a result of his gangster lifestyle he has also acquired a number of wounds. He has been shot twice and has had his arms badly mangled by [[meat cleavers]], and as a result cannot straighten his two middle fingers.

The eldest of five siblings, Wong was born in [[Ipoh]] and grew up in the village of Ampang Baru, in a wooden house with the unit number 200. His [[Immigrant generations|second generation]] local-born father Wong Yon Loong (born 1941) is a proponent of mainstream Chinese education and had served as headmaster in various primary schools in Kinta district.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} His [[Immigrant generations|second-generation]] mother, Goh Swee Kim (24 December 1936 – 1 December 1999) was an educationist and of pure [[Fuzhou people|Foochow]] and a quarter [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] descent and origin, having been headmistress at various Chinese primary schools in Perak.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Despite being Chinese educationists, they elect to send Wong to a Methodist Christian missionary school for an English education {{citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;!-- - which was subsequently changed to Malay stream national education--&gt;.

He did his secondary education in Anderson School, Ipoh after leaving Seri Putera (Seri Kepayang) secondary school in Fair Park, Ipoh as well as Ho Seng Ong Methodist primary school in Canning Garden, Ipoh.
