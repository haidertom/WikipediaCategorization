'''Acid rain''' is a [[rain]] or any other form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that is unusually [[acid]]ic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low [[pH]]). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of [[sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]], which react with the [[Properties of water|water molecules]] in the [[atmosphere]] to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by [[lightning]] strikes, and sulphur dioxide is produced by [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]]. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, [[corrosion]] of steel structures such as bridges, and [[weathering]] of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.

==Definition==
"Acid rain" is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog,  cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. [[Distilled water]], once [[carbon dioxide]] is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a [[pH]] greater than 7 are alkaline. "Clean" or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], a weak acid according to the following reaction:

:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula |C||O|2}} (g) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} ([[Aqueous solution|aq]])

Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of [[carbonate]] and [[hydronium]] ions:

:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H||C||O|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + {{Chemical formula|H|3|O}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)

However, unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH (acidity level). A common example is [[nitric acid]] produced by [[electric discharge]] in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/JD092iD11p13299|author1=Likens, Gene E. |author2=Keene, William C. |author3=Miller, John M. |author4=Galloway, James N. |title=Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia|year=1987|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=92|issue=D11 |page=13299 |bibcode=1987JGR....9213299L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid deposition as an [[environmental issue]] (discussed later in the article) would include additional acids other than {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}}.

==History==

The corrosive effect of polluted, acidic city air on limestone and marble was noted in the 17th century by [[John Evelyn]], who remarked upon the poor condition of the [[Arundel marbles]].&lt;ref&gt;E. S. de Beer, ed. ''[[The Diary of John Evelyn]]'', III, 1955 (19 September 1667) p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere have increased.&lt;ref name="NASA Glossary"&gt;{{Citation

The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local [[pollution]] has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation.&lt;ref name="Likens, G. E. 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|author =Likens, G. E. |author2=Wright, R. F. |author3=Galloway, J. N. |author4=Butler, T.

E. |year=1984|title= Acid rain: the smokestack is the "smoking gun" |journal=Garden |volume=8|issue=4|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions, with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition (simply because of their higher rainfall). An example of this effect is the low pH of rain which falls in [[Scandinavia]].

The earliest report about acid rain in the United States was from the chemical evidence from [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest|Hubbard Brook]] Valley. In 1972, a group of scientists including [[Gene Likens]] discovered the rain that was deposited at White Mountains of New Hampshire was acidic. The pH of the sample was measured to be 4.03 at Hubbard Brook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Likens|first=Gene E.|last2=Bormann|first2=F.

Acid rain that mixed with stream water at Hubbard Brook was neutralized by the alumina from soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noye M.|last2=Driscoll|first2=Charles T.|last3=Eaton|first3=John S.|last4=Likens|first4=Gene E.|last5=McDowell|first5=William H.|date=1981-09-01|title='Acid rain', dissolved aluminum and chemical weathering at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703781902763|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=45|issue=9|pages=1421–1437|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(81)90276-3|bibcode=1981GeCoA..45.1421J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this research indicates the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminum leads to increasing rate of soil weathering. Experimental research was done to examine the effects of increased acidity in stream on ecological species. In 1980, a group of scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook, New Hampshire, and observed the change in species’ behaviors. There was a decrease in species diversity, an increase in community dominants, and a decrease in the [[food web]] complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Ronald J.|last2=Likens|first2=Gene E.|last3=Fiance|first3=Sandy B.|last4=Hendrey|first4=George R.|date=1980-08-01|title=Experimental Acidification of a Stream in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=976–989|doi=10.2307/1936765|issn=1939-9170|jstor=1936765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the U.S. Congress passed an [[Acid Deposition Act]].&lt;ref name="Lackey"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/staff/lackey/pubs/ACID-RAIN-SCIENCE-POLICY-LACKEY-BLAIR-JOURNAL-REPRINT-1997.pdf |author =Lackey, R.T. |year=1997|title= Science, policy, and acid rain: lessons learned|journal= Renewable Resources Journal|volume= 15|issue=1|pages= 9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act established an 18-year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). NAPAP looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective. It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.

From the start, policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts, or to disparage those of their opponents.&lt;ref name="Lackey" /&gt;  For the U.S. Government's scientific enterprise, a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists, program managers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1462-9011(98)00006-9|title=Acid rain: Science and policy making|year=1998|last1=Winstanley|first1=Derek|last2=Lackey|first2=Robert T.|last3=Warnick|first3=Walter L.|last4=Malanchuk|first4=John|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=1|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the National Academy of Sciences was looking into research about the controversial issues regarding acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/08/science/acid-rain-issue-creates-stress-between-administration-and-science-academy.html|title=ACID RAIN ISSUE CREATES STRESS BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND SCIENCE ACADEMY|last=Times|first=Robert Reinhold, Special To The New York|date=1982-06-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Ronald Reagan did not place a huge attention on the issues of acid rain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ronald_Reagan_Environment.htm|title=Ronald Reagan on Environment|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US.

In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/20013U0E.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981+Thru+1985&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D:%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C81thru85%5CTxt%5C00000012%5C20013U0E.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|title=Report of the Acid Rain Peer Review Panel|last=|first=|date=July 1984|website=Document Display {{!}} NEPIS {{!}} US EPA|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] reviewed the draft report and sent [[Fred Singer]]’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://grist.org/article/from-tobacco-to-climate-change-merchants-of-doubt-undermined-the-science/full/|title=From tobacco to climate change, ‘merchants of doubt’ undermined the science|date=2010-04-17|newspaper=Grist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nierenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulphur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was due to the fact that the report was not ready to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/18/us/legislators-sat-white-house-suppressed-acid-rain-report.html|title=LEGISLATORS SAT WHITE HOUSE SUPPRESSED ACID RAIN REPORT|last=Franklin|first=Ben A.|date=1984-08-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the US National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program : 1990 integrated assessment report. Washington, D.C. : National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Office of the Director, [1991]&lt;/ref&gt; It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.

Meanwhile, in 1990, the U.S. Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/clean-air-act-title-iv-subchapter-acid-deposition-control |title=Clean Air Act Title IV - Subchapter A: Acid Deposition Control &amp;#124; Overview of the Clean Air Act and Air Pollution &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title IV of these amendments established the a [[cap and trade]] system designed to control emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;John Bachmann, David Calkins, Margo Oge. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/air.pdf “Cleaning the Air We Breathe: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. September 2017. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from power plants, close to a 50% reduction&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulphur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulphur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.

During the 1990s, research continued. On March 10, 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; in the eastern United States. When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70% and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by over 60% from 2003 levels.&lt;ref name="US Environmental Protection Agency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |title=US EPA: A Brief History of Acid Rain |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925214841/http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |archivedate=2010-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals. Since the 1990s, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the [[Pacific Research Institute]], acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/03/MNMMTJUS1.DTL&amp;hw=Cap+trade+Acid+Rain&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 'Cap-and-trade' model eyed for cutting greenhouse gases], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2facts.com/RecordUrl.asp?article=/icof/search/i0702840.asp |title=Facts On File News Services Databases |publisher=2facts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional regulation was used in the European Union, which saw a decrease of over 70% in SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Gilberston, T. and Reyes, O. 2009.

In 2007, total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long-term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/arp07.html Acid Rain Program 2007 Progress Report], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the EPA estimated that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; Forbes says: ''In 2010, by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the George W. Bush administration’s Clean Air Interstate Rule, SO2 emissions had fallen to 5.1 million tons.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerdes|first1=Justin|title=Cap and Trade Curbed Acid Rain: 7 Reasons Why It Can Do The Same For Climate Change|url=http://onforb.es/yfatTf|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=27 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Citizen science]] can be traced back as far as January 1989 and a campaign by the [[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society]] to measure Acid rain. Scientist Muki Haklay cites in a policy report for the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Wilson Center]] entitled 'Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective' a first use of the term 'citizen science' by R. Kerson in the magazine [[MIT Technology Review]] from January 1989.&lt;ref name=1stUse&gt;{{cite web|author=Muki Haklay|title=Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Citizen_Science_Policy_European_Perspective_Haklay.pdf|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|page=11|date=2015|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson&gt;{{cite magazine|author=R. Kerson|title=Lab for the Environment|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=1989|volume=92|issue=1|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting from the Wilson Center report: "The new form of engagement in science received the name "citizen science". The first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989, describing how 225 volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acid-rain awareness raising campaign. The volunteers collected samples, checked for acidity, and reported back to the organization. The information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon."&lt;ref name=1stUse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson/&gt;

==Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification==
The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulphur dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form [[nitric acid]] are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulphur containing compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes from [[fossil fuel]] combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from [[wildfires]] and 7–8 Tg(S) per year from [[volcanoes]].&lt;ref name="Berresheim 1995"&gt;Berresheim, H.; Wine, P.H. and Davies D.D. (1995). "Sulfur in the Atmosphere". In ''Composition, Chemistry and Climate of the Atmosphere'', ed. H.B. Singh. Van Nostrand Rheingold {{ISBN|0-442-01264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural phenomena===
The principal natural [[phenomena]] that contribute acid-producing gases to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] are emissions from volcanoes. Thus, for example, [[fumarole]]s from the Laguna Caliente crater of [[Poás Volcano]] create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a pH of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements.
Acid-producing gasses are also created by [[biology|biological]] processes that occur on the land, in [[wetland]]s, and in the [[ocean]]s. The major biological source of sulphur containing compounds is [[dimethyl sulfide]].

Nitric acid in [[rainwater]] is an important source of fixed [[nitrogen]] for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=nitric%20acid|title=|last=|first=|date=January 24, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acidic deposits have been detected in [[glacier|glacial ice]] thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.&lt;ref name="Likens, G. E. 1979"/&gt;

Soils of [[coniferous forests]] are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles, and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.

===Human activity===
[[File:Gavin Power Plant.jpg|thumb|The coal-fired [[Gavin Power Plant]] in [[Cheshire, Ohio]]]]
The principal cause of acid rain is sulphur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as [[electricity generation]], factories, and [[motor vehicle]]s. Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions that are responsible for acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.

==Chemical processes==
Combustion of fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulphuric acid and nitric acid.&lt;ref name="CAA01"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/09/980928072644.htm Clean Air Act Reduces Acid Rain In Eastern United States], ''ScienceDaily'', September 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas phase chemistry===
In the [[gas phase]] sulphur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the [[hydroxyl]] radical via an [[intermolecular]] reaction:&lt;ref name="Seinfeld 1998"/&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·
which is followed by:
:HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
In the presence of water, [[sulfur trioxide|sulphur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted rapidly to [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]]:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

[[Nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with OH to form nitric acid:
[[File:Air Pollution-Causes&amp;Effects.svg|thumb|This shows the process of the air pollution being released into the atmosphere and the areas that will be affected.]]
:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Chemistry in cloud droplets===
When clouds are present, the loss rate of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.

;Hydrolysis

sulphur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] in a series of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

;Oxidation

There are a large number of aqueous reactions that [[redox|oxidize]] sulphur from S([[oxidation state|IV]]) to S(VI), leading to the formation of sulphuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]] (reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by [[iron]] and [[manganese]] in the cloud droplets).&lt;ref name="Seinfeld 1998"/&gt;

==Acid deposition==

===Wet deposition===
Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.

===Dry deposition===
Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition.&lt;ref name="archive glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |title=UK National Air Quality Archive: Air Pollution Glossary |publisher=Airquality.co.uk |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417054802/http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.

==Adverse effects==
Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.

===Surface waters and aquatic animals===
[[File:Waterspecies.gif|thumb|This chart shows that not all fish, shellfish, or the insects that they eat can tolerate the same amount of acid; for example, frogs can tolerate water that is more acidic (i.e., has a lower pH) than trout.]]
Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. At pHs lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pHs can kill adult fish. As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the [[brook trout]] in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/surface_water.html Effects of Acid Rain – Surface Waters and Aquatic Animals]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website states: "Of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75% of the acidic lakes and about 50% of the acidic streams".&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt; Lakes hosted by silicate basement rocks are more acidic than lakes within limestone or other basement rocks with a carbonate composition (i.e. marble) due to buffering effects by carbonate minerals, even with the same amount of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mineral Resources, Economics and the Environment.|last=Kesler|first=Stephen|publisher=Cambridge University|year=2015|isbn=9781107074910|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Soils===
Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodhe, H., et al. The global distribution of acidifying wet deposition. Environmental Science and TEchnology. vlo. 36, no. 20 (October) p.&amp;nbsp;4382–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[enzyme]]s of these microbes are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize [[toxin]]s, such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name="EPA: Forests"&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html Effects of Acid Rain – Forests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726034352/http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html |date=July 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as [[sugar maple]] ([[Acer saccharum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The biogeochemistry of sulfur at Hubbard Brook|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/BioGeo60.235.316.pdf|doi=10.1023/A:1020972100496|year=2002|last1=Likens|first1=G.E.|last2=Driscoll|first2=C.T.|last3=Buso|first3=D.C.|last4=Mitchell|first4=M.J.|last5=Lovett|first5=G.M.|last6=Bailey|first6=S.W.|last7=Siccama|first7=T.G.|last8=Reiners|first8=W.A.|last9=Alewell|first9=C.|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=60|issue=3|page=235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.272.5259.244|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/Sci.272.244.246.pdf|title=Long-Term Effects of Acid Rain: Response and Recovery of a Forest Ecosystem|year=1996|last1=Likens|first1=G.

===Forests and other vegetation===
[[File:Acid rain woods1.JPG|thumb|Acid rain can have severe effects on vegetation. A forest in the [[Black Triangle (region)|Black Triangle]] in Europe.]]
Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.

Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.&lt;ref&gt;DeHayes, D.H., Schaberg, P.G. and G.R. Strimbeck.

===Ocean acidification===
{{main|Ocean acidification}}
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}
Acid rain has a much less harmful effect on the oceans. However, acid rain can cause the oceans acidity to rise, making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their [[exoskeleton]]s that they need to survive. These coastal species link together as part of the ocean's food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/headline_universe/olpa/acid_coasts_7sept07.html|title=Acid Rain Has Disproportionate Impact on Near-Shore Ocean Waters - Windows to the Universe|website=www.windows2universe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coral's limestone skeletal is sensitive to pH drop, because the [[calcium carbonate]], core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic (low pH) solutions.

===Human health effects===
Acid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. However, the particulates responsible for acid rain (sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air do contribute to heart and lung problems including [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/health.html Effects of Acid Rain – Human Health]. Epa.gov (2006-06-02). Retrieved on 2013-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse effects===
[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|Effect of acid rain on statues|thumb|right]]
[[File:Skulptur aus Sandstein, Dresden 2012-09-06-0555.jpg|Acid rain and weathering|thumb|right]]
Acid rain can damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as [[limestone]] and [[marble]], that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) {{eqm}} CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. Acid rain also increases the [[corrosion]] rate of metals, in particular [[iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m0441x12l06k5n23/ |title=ICP on effects on materials |accessdate=2010-11-18 |doi=10.1007/BF01186242 |volume=85 |issue=4 |journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |pages=2701–2706|bibcode=1995WASP...85.2701R |last1=Reisener |first1=A. |last2=Stäckle |first2=B. |last3=Snethlage |first3=R. |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/WP-89-104.pdf |title=Approaches in modeling the impact of air pollution-induced material degradation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affected areas==
Places significantly impacted by acid rain around the globe include most of eastern Europe from Poland northward into Scandinavia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/acid_rain_in_europe |title=Acid Rain in Europe |author=Ed.

==Prevention methods==

===Technical solutions===
Many coal-firing [[power station]]s use [[flue-gas desulfurization|flue-gas desulphurization]] (FGD) to remove sulphur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% or more of the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulphur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral [[calcium sulfate]] that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulphur pollution into industrial sulfates.

In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as [[gypsum]] when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. In others, they are placed in [[landfill]]. However, the effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to [[Restoration ecology|restore]] native life.

[[Fluidized bed combustion]] also reduces the amount of sulphur emitted by power production.

[[Vehicle emissions control]] reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.

===International treaties===
A number of international treaties on the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, the [[1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]] under the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]]. Canada and the US signed the [[Air Quality Agreement]] in 1991.  Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties.

===Emissions trading===
{{main|Emissions trading}}
{{See also|Acid Rain Program}}
In this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.

The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]]&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=6 Transcript] (see p6). December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 ''U.S. Code'' 7651&lt;/ref&gt; is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), the primary causes of acid rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.

'''Air conditioning''' (often referred to as '''AC''', '''A/C''', or '''air con''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/air-con|title=air con Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of removing heat and moisture from the interior of an occupied space, to improve the comfort of occupants.  Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as [[computer server]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, and even to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.

Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a [[car]] to improve [[thermal comfort]] and [[indoor air quality]]. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. The [[cooling]] is typically achieved through a [[refrigeration cycle]], but sometimes [[evaporative cooler|evaporation]] or [[free cooling]] is used. Air conditioning systems can also be made based on [[desiccant]]s (chemicals which remove moisture from the air) and subterraneous pipes that can distribute the heated refrigerant to the ground for cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/AE_earth_cooling_tube.html |title=Earth cooling tube |first=David |last=Darling |website=daviddarling.info |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most general sense, air conditioning can refer to any form of technology that modifies the condition of air (heating, (de-)humidification, cooling, cleaning, ventilation, or air movement). In common usage, though, "air conditioning" refers to systems which cool air. In [[construction]], a complete system of heating, [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], and air conditioning is referred to as [[HVAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowall |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=Fundamentals of HVAC Systems |publisher=Elsevier |page=3 |isbn=9780080552330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Evaporative cooling===
Since prehistoric times, snow and ice were used for cooling. The business of harvesting ice during winter and storing for use in summer became popular towards the late [[17th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Nagengast| first=Bernard| title=A History of Comfort Cooling Using Ice| journal=ASHRAE Journal| date=February 1999| page=49| url=http://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/docLib/Public/200362710047_326.pdf| access-date=22 July 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812202321/https://ashrae.org/File%20Library/docLib/Public/200362710047_326.pdf| archive-date=2013-08-12| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was replaced by mechanical ice-making machines.

The basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water. The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. In [[ancient Rome]], water from [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them. Other techniques in medieval [[Persia]] involved the use of [[cistern]]s and [[wind tower]]s to cool buildings during the hot season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bahadori MN|title=Passive Cooling Systems in Iranian Architecture| journal=Scientific American| volume=238| issue=2| pages=144–154| date=February 1978| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0278-144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd-century Chinese mechanical engineer and inventor [[Ding Huan]] of the [[Han Dynasty]] invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for air conditioning, with seven wheels {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in diameter and manually powered by prisoners of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|year=1991|title=Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4: Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=99, 151, 233 |isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 747, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712–762) of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) had the ''Cool Hall'' (''Liang Dian'' {{lang|zh|涼殿}}) built in the imperial palace, which the ''Tang Yulin'' describes as having [[hydraulics|water-powered]] fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains. During the subsequent [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|year=1991|title=Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4: Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering|publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=134, 151 |isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the Dutch inventor [[Cornelis Drebbel]] demonstrated "Turning Summer into Winter" as an early form of modern air conditioning for [[James I of England]] by adding salt to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laszlo |first=Pierre |title=Salt: Grain of Life |year=2001 |publisher=Comumbia University Press |url= https://books.google.com/?id=DhhN_FthpYMC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Cornelius+Drebbel+%22air+conditioning%22 |isbn= 9780231121989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of mechanical cooling===
[[File:Gorriemuseumapalachicola ice mchn1.jpg|thumb|upright|Three-quarters scale model of Gorrie's ice machine at [[John Gorrie State Museum]], Florida]]
Modern air conditioning emerged from advances in [[chemistry]] during the 19th century, and the first large-scale electrical air conditioning was invented and used in 1902 by [[United States|US]] inventor [[Willis Carrier]]. The introduction of residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped enable the great migration to the [[Sun Belt]] in the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 1758, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]], a chemistry professor at [[Cambridge University]], conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object. Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids (such as alcohol and ether) could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed up the [[evaporation]]. They lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to {{convert|-14|C|0}} while the ambient temperature was {{convert|18|C|0}}. Franklin noted that, soon after they passed the freezing point of water {{convert|0|C|0}}, a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching {{convert|-14|C|0}}. Franklin concluded: "From this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Franklin| first1=Benjamin| title=Letter to John Lining| url=http://www.waughfamily.ca/Montgomery/benfranklin1758.htm|accessdate=6 August 2014| date=June 17, 1758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, English scientist and inventor [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that compressing and liquefying [[ammonia]] could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the "Ice King", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced {{convert|3,000|kg}} of ice per day.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Though Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice-refrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: "Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Electrical air conditioning ===
[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]
In 1902, the first modern electrical air conditioning unit was [[invention|invented]] by [[Willis Carrier]] in [[Buffalo, New York]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} After graduating from [[Cornell University]], Carrier found a job at the [[Buffalo Forge Company]]. There, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The first air conditioner, designed and built in Buffalo by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Designed to improve manufacturing [[process control]] in a [[printing]] plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte]] was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term "air conditioning", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to "water conditioning", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to "condition" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Apparatus for treating air.|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US808897A/en|date=1904-09-16|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the first private home to have air conditioning was built in Minneapolis in 1914, owned by [[Charles Gilbert Gates|Charles Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7951/a-brief-history-of-air-conditioning-10720229/ |title=A Brief History of Air Conditioning |publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=2015-01-01|date=January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes, particularly in regions with warmer climate, [[David St. Pierre DuBose]] (1898-1994) designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home ''Meadowmont'', all disguised behind intricate and attractive Georgian-style open moldings.{{when|date=September 2015}} This building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the United States equipped for [[central air conditioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rizzoconferencecenter.com/PDFs/History-of-Meadowmont.pdf |title=Early University Benefactors |publisher=Rizzoconferencecenter.com |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, [[Robert Sherman (engineer)|Robert Sherman]] of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] invented a portable, in-window air conditioner that cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and filtered the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://navlog.org/patent_1.html |title=Unsung Engineering Heros: Robert Sherman |publisher=Navlog.org |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigerant development ===
{{Main|Refrigerant}}
[[File:Embraco compressor.jpg|thumb|A modern [[R-134a]] hermetic refrigeration [[gas compressor|compressor]]]]
The first air conditioners and [[refrigerator]]s employed toxic or flammable gases, such as [[ammonia]], [[methyl chloride]], or [[propane]], that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'', in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).

[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, so the only source for air-conditioning repair purposes is the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems. Several non-ozone-depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives, including [[R-410A]]. It was first commercially used by Carrier Corp. under the brand name ''Puron''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Modern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] ([[R-134a]], used in most cars) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/blog/air-conditioners-dehumidifiers-r-410-a-refrigerant/|website=Sylvane |title=Air Conditioners &amp; Dehumidifiers|date=July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems. Moreover, policy and political influence by corporate executives resisted change.&lt;ref&gt;Mate, John "Making a Difference: A Case Study of the Greenpeace Ozone Campaign" RECIEL 10:2 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedick, Richard Elliot Ozone Diplomacy Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations insisted that no alternatives to HFCs existed. The environmental organization [[Greenpeace]] provided funding to a former East German refrigerator company to research an alternative ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant in 1992. The company developed a hydrocarbon mix of [[isopentane]] and [[isobutane]], but as a condition of the contract with Greenpeace could not patent the technology, which led to its widespread adoption by other firms.&lt;ref name="greenpeace.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Happy birthday, Greenfreeze! |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/happy-birthday-greenfreeze/blog/44473/ |publisher=Greenpeace |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ozone.unep.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozone Secretariat |url= http://ozone.unep.org/Events/4C1_PublicInfo_Awards97.shtml |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150412225008/http://ozone.unep.org/Events/4C1_PublicInfo_Awards97.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 April 2015 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=8 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{Cite news |title=Öko-Coup aus Ostdeutschland |url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/oeko-revolution-aus-ostdeutschland-wie-foron-den-ersten-fckw-freien-kuehlschrank-der-welt-erfand-a-951064.html|date=September 13, 2013 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |accessdate=4 September 2015|last1=Gunkel|first1=Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their activist marketing first in Germany led to companies like Whirlpool, Bosch, and later LG and others to incorporate the technology throughout Europe, then Asia, although the corporate executives resisted in Latin America, so that it arrived in Argentina produced by a domestic firm in 2003, and then finally with giant Bosch's production in Brazil by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilustrados.com/tema/3015/Historia-Greenfreeze.html |title=La Historia del "Greenfreeze" |publisher=Ilustrados.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/pt/Noticias/discurso-de-frank-guggenheim-n/ |title=Discurso de Frank Guggenheim no lançamento do Greenfreeze &amp;#124; Brasil |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigeration cycle ===
{{Main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}
[[File:Heatpump.svg|thumb|A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1)&amp;nbsp;[[condensing coil]], 2)&amp;nbsp;[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&amp;nbsp;[[evaporator coil]], 4)&amp;nbsp;[[Gas compressor|compressor]]]]
[[File:Capilliary metering device.jpg|thumb|upright|Capillary expansion valve connection to evaporator inlet. Notice [[frost]] formation.]]

In the refrigeration cycle, heat is transported from a colder location to a hotter area. As heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction, work is required to achieve this. A [[refrigerator]] is an example of such a system, as it transports the heat out of the interior and into its environment. The [[refrigerant]] is used as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently ejects that heat elsewhere.

Circulating refrigerant vapor enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]], where its pressure and temperature are [[Gas compressor#Temperature|increased]]. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be [[Condensation|condensed]] and is routed through a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. Here it is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air.  The removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the condenser coils, making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve.

The condensed, pressurized, and still usually somewhat hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]] (often nothing more than a pinhole in the system's copper tubing) where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in [[flash evaporation]] of a part of the liquid refrigerant, greatly lowering its temperature. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the [[evaporator coil|evaporator]]. A fan blows the interior warm air (which is to be cooled) across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan/ blower into the room. To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor. In order for the process to have any efficiency, the cooling/evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating/condensing portion, and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own "kind" of air (either the hot air or the cool air).

Modern air conditioning systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside, they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside. Because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it, the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray at the bottom of the unit from which it must then be routed outside, usually through a drain hole. As this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it, it will not cause mineral buildup on the coils. This will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low. If ice begins to form on the evaporative fins, it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice, etc.  A clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this, as will raising the target cool temperature of the unit's thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally. A failing [[thermistor]] may also cause this problem. Refrigerators without a [[defrost]] cycle may have this same issue. Dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result: ice.

By running an air conditioner's compressor in the opposite direction, the overall effect can be completely reversed and the indoor area will become heated instead of cooled (see [[heat pump]]). The engineering of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas–vapor mixtures is called [[psychrometrics]].

==== Heat pump unit ====
{{Main|Heat pump}}
[[File:External heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|An example of an externally fitted AC unit which uses a heat pump system]]
A heat pump is an air conditioner in which the [[refrigeration cycle]] can be reversed, producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as a "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. Some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a central air conditioner. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).

Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4–13&amp;nbsp;°C (40–55&amp;nbsp;°F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. A heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.

The icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as a [[natural gas]] or [[heating oil|oil]] [[furnace]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.

[[Absorption refrigerator|Absorption heat pumps]] are a kind of air-source heat pump, but they do not depend on electricity to power them. Instead, gas, solar power, or heated water is used as a main power source. An absorption pump dissolves ammonia gas in water, which gives off heat. Next, the water and ammonia mixture is depressurized to induce boiling, and the ammonia is boiled off, which absorbs heat from the outdoor air.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Some more expensive fixed window air conditioning units have a true heat pump function. However, a window unit may only have an electric resistance heater.

=== Evaporative cooling ===
{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}
[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]
In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.

Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace| edition = 2nd| author = Shane Smith| publisher = Fulcrum Publishing| year = 2000| isbn = 978-1-55591-450-9| page = 62| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&amp;q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window }}&lt;/ref&gt; These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.

=== Free cooling ===
{{Main|Free cooling}}
Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant (typically water or a glycol mix) from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes, equipped with heat exchanger. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.

Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snijders |first=Aart |date=2008 |url= http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf |title=ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe |publisher=IFTech International |website=Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humidity control ==
{{noref section|date=December 2016}}
Since humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, drier air (up to a point) improves the comfort provided. The comfort air conditioner is designed to create a 50% to 60% relative [[humidity]] in the occupied space.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Dehumidification and cooling ===
Refrigeration air conditioning equipment usually reduces the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system. The relatively cold (below the [[dewpoint]]) evaporator coil condenses water vapor from the processed air, much like an ice-cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass. Therefore, water vapor is removed from the cooled air and the relative humidity in the room is lowered. The water is usually sent to a drain or may simply drip onto the ground outdoors.
The heat is rejected by the condenser which is located outside of room to be cooled.

===Dehumidification program===

Most modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} to reduce the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops;{{clarify|date=October 2017}} this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the temperature rises again,{{clarify|reason=temperature of what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.

Occasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Inverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold,{{clarify|reason=too cold for what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Dehumidifier ===
{{main|Dehumidifier}}
[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]
A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.

In addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.

Inside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.

Dehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].

== Energy transfer ==
In a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Jan F. |editor-last=Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning |publisher=CRC Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8493-9584-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&amp;nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&amp;nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&amp;nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&amp;nbsp;W of power.

It is typical for air conditioners to operate at "efficiencies" of significantly greater than 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winnick, J|title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-05590-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).

Air conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of "[[ton of refrigeration|tons of refrigeration]]", with each  approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html| archivedate= 28 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18&amp;nbsp;kW) in capacity.

=== Seasonal energy efficiency ratio ===
{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}
For residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (W·h) during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S|title=Energy Glossary&amp;nbsp;– S |accessdate=2006-07-02 |work=Energy Glossary |publisher=Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''SEER = BTU ÷ (W·h) '''
this can also be rewritten as:
: '''SEER = (BTU / h) ÷ W''', where "W" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.

For example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.

The electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:

: '''500 W × 1000 h = 500,000 W·h = 500 [[kWh]]'''

Assuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).

Another method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:

: '''5000 BTU/h × 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''

Then, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:

: '''5,000,000 BTU ÷ 10 = 500,000 W·h = 500 kWh'''

SEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric]. Web.archive.org (2007-12-02). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

: (1) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''SEER = EER ÷ 0.9'''
: (2) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''SEER = COP × 3.792'''
: (3) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''EER = COP × 3.413'''

From equation (2) above, a SEER of 13 is equivalent to a COP of 3.43, which means that 3.43 units of heat energy are pumped per unit of work energy.

The United States now requires that residential systems manufactured in 2006 have a minimum SEER rating of 13 (although window-box systems are exempt from this law, so their SEER is still around 10).

== Installation types ==

===Window unit and packaged terminal===
[[File:Window air conditioner working.gif|thumb|How a window air conditioner works]]
[[File:Condicionadordear.jpg|thumb|Air conditioning window unit]]
[[File:Air conditioning unit-en.svg|thumb|Parts of a window unit]]
Window unit air conditioners are installed in an open window. The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.

In 1971, [[General Electric]] introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/13/bright-ideas/B8Fuvbgy021GG95bydrHgM/story.html |title=Timeline: Bright ideas |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2016-01-13 |accessdate=2017-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sylvane.com/packaged-terminal-air-conditioner-buying-guide.html|website=Sylvane |title=PTAC Buying Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.

The first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines |title=Popular Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA885 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |date=June 1935 |publisher=Hearst Magazines |pages=885– |issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Split systems ===
Split-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) [[heat exchanger]] is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.

==== Mini-split (ductless) system ====
[[File:Splitklimaanlage IMGP9925 unbranded.jpg|thumb|Outside part of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]&lt;!----&gt;[[File:GALANZ II.jpg|thumb|right|Indoor part of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]
A mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mitsubishi Contractors Guide |page=16 |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020149/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's.

Advantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc. Cooling &amp; Heating &amp;#124; HVAC |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |date=2010-02-17 |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603025417/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |archivedate=2015-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity."&lt;ref name=doe20120809&gt;
{{cite web |title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems. However, lower operating costs and [[rebate (marketing)|rebates]] or other financial incentives—offered in some areas—can help offset the initial expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ductless, mini-Split Heat Pumps| url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps | publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central (ducted) air conditioning====
Central ([[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]]) air conditioning offers whole-house or large-commercial-space cooling, and often offers moderate multi-zone temperature control capability by the addition of air-louver-control boxes.

In central air conditioning, the inside heat-exchanger is typically placed inside the central furnace/AC unit of the [[Forced-air|forced air]] [[central heating|heating system]] which is then used in the summer to distribute chilled air throughout a residence or commercial building.

The heat-exchanger cools the air that is being forced through it by the furnace blower. As the warm air comes in contact with this cool surface the water in the air condenses. By pulling the water molecules from the air. According to the psychometric chart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Biomeasurement and Experimental Techniques for Avian Species|url=http://web.uconn.edu/poultry/NE-127/NewFiles/Psychrometric.html |at=Figure 1. Psychrometric Chart |title=Psychrometric Chart Use |publisher=Northeast Regional Poultry Research Project, NE-127 |date= |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as relative humidity decreases in order to feel cool you will have to lower the temperature even more. A common way to counteract this effect is by installing a whole-home humidifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/home-humidifier-types-4072878|title=Should You Get a Portable Humidifier?|author=|date=|website=thespruce.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, installing a high efficient system this need to turn the temperature down wont have such and influence on your energy costs.

==== Multi-split system ====
A multi-split system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning|last=Trott|first=A. R.|last2=Welch|first2=T|publisher=Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd|year=2000|isbn=0 7506 4219 X|location=Great Britain|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts ([[evaporator]] and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.

''Difference between split system and multi-split system'':

Other common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.

Its unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building.The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.

===== Multi-split system installation considerations =====
Before selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.

The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.

The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.

=== Portable units ===
A portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.

The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.

==== Portable split system ====
A portable  system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit.

==== Portable hose system ====
Hose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.

A single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose. |publisher=Experts123.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&amp;nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.

==== Portable evaporative system ====
[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called "swamp coolers", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].

Evaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.

== Uses ==
Air-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into ''comfort'' and ''process'' applications.

=== Comfort applications ===
[[File:ACFujitsu2.jpg|thumb|An array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building]]
Comfort applications aim to provide a [[Building science|building indoor environment]] that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.

Air conditioning makes [[deep plan]] buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with [[light well]]s so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via [[natural ventilation]]. Air conditioning also allows buildings to be taller, since [[Wind gradient|wind speed]] increases significantly with altitude making natural ventilation impractical for very tall buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Comfort applications are quite different for various building types and may be categorized as:
* Commercial buildings, which are built for commerce, including offices, malls, shopping centers, restaurants, etc.
* High-rise residential buildings, such as tall dormitories and apartment blocks
* Industrial spaces where thermal comfort of workers is desired
* Cars, aircraft, boats, which transport passenger or fresh goods
* Institutional buildings, which includes government buildings, hospitals, schools, etc.
* Low-rise residential buildings, including single-family houses, duplexes, and small apartment buildings
* Sports stadiums, such as the [[University of Phoenix Stadium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/12/03/qatar.world.cup/ | work=CNN | title=Qatar promises air-conditioned World Cup | date=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2010/12/101203_qatar_wt_sl.shtml |title=BBC World Service - News - Qatar 2022: How to build comfortable stadiums in a hot climate |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to buildings, air conditioning can be used for many types of transportation, including automobiles, buses and other land vehicles, trains, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft.

==== Domestic usage ====
[[File:AirConditioner3.jpg|thumb|Typical residential central air conditioners in North America]]
Air conditioning is common in the US, with 88% of new [[single-family homes]] constructed in 2011 including air conditioning, ranging from 99% in the [[Southern United States|South]] to 62% in the [[Western United States|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/construction/chars/highlights.html| title=Characteristics of New Housing|authors=US Census Bureau (MCD): Cheryl Cornish, Stephen Cooper, Salima Jenkins| work=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], air conditioning use varies by province. In 2013, 55% of Canadian households reported having an air conditioner, with high use in [[Manitoba]] (80%), [[Ontario]] (78%), [[Saskatchewan]] (67%), and [[Quebec]] (54%) and lower use in [[Prince Edward Island]] (23%), [[British Columbia]] (21%), and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150310/dq150310a-eng.htm|title = Statistics Canada - Households and the Environment Survey, 2013|date = 2015-03-10|accessdate = 2015-05-11|website = The Daily - Households and the Environment Survey, 2013|publisher = Statistics Canada|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, home air conditioning is generally less common. [[Southern Europe]]an countries such as [[Greece]] have seen a wide proliferation of home air-conditioning units in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=819799&amp;lngDtrID=244| script-title=el:''"Χρυσές" δουλειές για τις εταιρείες κλιματιστικών έφερε το κύμα καύσωνα''| publisher=[[Lambrakis Press]]|location=[[Athens]]| date=2007-07-25| accessdate=2008-06-30| language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another southern European country, [[Malta]], it is estimated that around 55% of households have an air conditioner installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/docs/HBS2008.pdf| accessdate=2011-07-14| title=STĦARRIĠ DWAR ID-DĦUL U L-INFIQ TAL-FAMILJA 2008 /HOUSEHOLD BUDGETARY SURVEY 2008| work=National Statistics Office, Maltz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process applications ===
Process applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out, regardless of internal heat and humidity loads and external weather conditions. It is the needs of the process that determine conditions, not human preference. Process applications include these:
* [[Chemistry|Chemical]] and [[Biology|biological]] [[laboratory|laboratories]]
* [[Cleanroom]]s for the production of [[integrated circuit]]s, [[pharmaceuticals]], and the like, in which very high levels of air cleanliness and control of temperature and humidity are required for the success of the process.
* [[Data center environmental control|Environmental control]] of [[data centers]]
* Facilities for breeding [[laboratory animal]]s. Since many animals normally reproduce only in [[Spring (season)|spring]], holding them in rooms in which conditions mirror those of spring all year can cause them to reproduce year-round.
* Food [[cooking]] and [[food processing|processing]] areas
* Hospital [[operating theatre]]s, in which air is filtered to high levels to reduce [[infection]] risk and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration. Although temperatures are often in the comfort range, some specialist procedures, such as [[Cardiac surgery|open heart surgery]], require low temperatures (about 18&amp;nbsp;°C, 64&amp;nbsp;°F) and others, such as [[neonatal]], relatively high temperatures (about 28&amp;nbsp;°C, 82&amp;nbsp;°F).
* [[Industrial ecology|Industrial environments]]
* [[Mining]]
* [[Nuclear power]] facilities
* Physical testing facilities
* Plants and farm growing areas
* [[Textile manufacturing]]

In both comfort and process applications, the objective may be to not only control temperature, but also [[humidity]], air quality, and air movement from space to space.

== Health effects ==

In hot weather, air conditioning can prevent [[heat stroke]], [[dehydration]] from excessive sweating and other problems related to [[hyperthermia]]. [[Heat wave]]s are the most lethal type of weather phenomenon in developed countries. Air conditioning (including filtration, humidification, cooling and disinfection) can be used to provide a clean, safe, [[hypoallergenic]] atmosphere in hospital operating rooms and other environments where proper atmosphere is critical to patient safety and well-being.  It is sometimes recommended for home use by people with [[allergies]].

Poorly maintained water [[cooling tower]]s can promote the growth and spread of microorganisms,&lt;ref name="Negative Health Effects of Central AC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Negative Health Effects of Central AC|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/160205-negative-health-effects-of-central-air-conditioning/|publisher=livestrong.com|accessdate=21 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128044033/http://www.livestrong.com/article/160205-negative-health-effects-of-central-air-conditioning/|archivedate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'', the infectious agent responsible for [[Legionellosis|Legionnaires' disease]], or thermophilic [[actinomycetes]]. As long as the cooling tower is kept clean (usually by means of a chlorine treatment), these health hazards can be avoided or reduced. Excessive air conditioning can have a negative effect on skin, causing it to dry out, and can also cause [[dehydration]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Environmental impacts ==

=== Power consumption and efficiency ===
Innovation in air conditioning technologies continues, with much recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency. Production of the electricity used to operate air conditioners has an environmental impact, including the release of greenhouse gases.

Cylinder unloaders are a method of load control used mainly in commercial air conditioning systems. On a semi-[[hermetic seal|hermetic]] (or open) compressor, the heads can be fitted with unloaders which remove a portion of the load from the compressor so that it can run better when full cooling is not needed. Unloaders can be electrical or mechanical.

According to a 2015 government survey, 87% of the homes in the United States use air conditioning and 65% of those homes have central air conditioning. Most of the homes with central air conditioning have [[programmable thermostat]]s, but approximately two-thirds of the homes with central air do not use this feature to make their homes more energy efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32112 |title=One in eight U.S. homes uses a programmed thermostat with a central air conditioning unit |work=U.S. Energy Information Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=2017-07-19 |accessdate=2017-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower-energy alternatives===
Alternatives to continual air conditioning can be used with less energy, lower cost, and with less environmental impact.  These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/07/20/how-live-without-air-conditioning/4DqSdLtDiJ4iAn29lNCjaI/story.html

* In large commercial buildings, making windows able to be opened by occupants when the air outside is cool enough to be comfortable
* Setting thermostats to around {{convert|82|F}} and allowing workers to wear more climate-appropriate clothing, such as [[polo shirt]]s and [[Bermuda shorts]]. This approach has worked for the [[Cool Biz campaign]] in Japan.
* [[Passive cooling]] techniques, such as:
** [[Natural ventilation]] under and through buildings
** Operating windows to induce a [[stack effect]] breeze
** Letting in cool air at night and closing windows during the day
** Operating shades to reduce solar gain
** Building slightly underground, to take advantage of unpowered conduction and geothermal mass
** Placement of trees, architectural shades, windows (and using window coatings) to reduce [[solar gain]]
** [[Thermal insulation]] placed to prevent heat from entering
** Light-colored building materials reflect away more incoming [[infrared radiation]]
* Using a [[Fan (machine)|fan]] if the air is below body temperature
* [[Swamp cooler]]s in hot but dry weather
* Using a [[geothermal heat pump]] or [[ground-coupled heat exchanger]]
* Using naturally cooler basement rooms more
* Taking a [[siesta]] during the hottest part of the day
* Sleeping outside on a [[porch]] or [[roof]]

===Automobile power consumption===
In an automobile, the A/C system will use around 4 [[horsepower]] (3&amp;nbsp;kW) of the engine's [[power (physics)|power]], thus increasing fuel consumption of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy00osti/28960.pdf| title=Impact of Vehicle Air-Conditioning on Fuel Economy| publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigerants ===
The selection of the [[working fluids]] (refrigerants) has a significant impact not only on the performance of the air conditioners but on the environment as well. Most refrigerants used for air conditioning contribute to global warming, and many also [[ozone depletion|deplete the ozone layer]].&lt;ref name=CEPArefrigs&gt;{{cite web|title=Refrigerant Management Program Refrigerants Regulated |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/reftrack/reftrackrefrigerants.htm |publisher=Californial Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004073937/http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/reftrack/reftrackrefrigerants.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs are potent [[greenhouse gases]] when leaked to the atmosphere.

The use of [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] as a refrigerant was once common, including the refrigerants R-11 and R-12 (sold under the brand name ''Freon-12''). Freon refrigerants were commonly used during the 20th century in air conditioners due to their superior stability and safety properties. When they are released accidentally or deliberately, these chlorine-bearing refrigerants eventually reach the [[Earth's atmosphere|upper atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/chemfact/f_freon.txt |format=TXT |title=CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT: FREON 113 (CAS NO. 76-13-1) : prepared by OFFICE OF POLLUTION PREVENTION AND TOXICS, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY |date=August 1994 |publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the refrigerant reaches the [[stratosphere]], [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the [[Sun]] [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytically cleaves]] the chlorine-[[carbon]] [[Chemical bond|bond]], yielding a chlorine [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]. These chlorine radicals [[catalyst|catalyze]] the breakdown of [[ozone]] into [[diatomic]] [[oxygen]], depleting the [[ozone layer]] that shields the Earth's surface from strong UV radiation. Each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst until it binds with another radical, forming a stable [[molecule]] and quenching the [[chain reaction]].

Prior to 1994, most automotive air conditioning systems used R-12 as a refrigerant. It was replaced with [[R-134a]] refrigerant, which has no [[ozone depletion potential]]. Old R-12 systems can be retrofitted to R-134a by a complete flush and filter/dryer replacement to remove the mineral oil, which is not compatible with R-134a.

[[Chlorodifluoromethane|R22]] (also known as HCFC-22) has a [[global warming potential]] about 1,800 times higher than [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf |title=Chapter.2_FINAL.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010, and is to be completely discontinued by 2020. Although these gasses can be recycled when air conditioning units are disposed of, uncontrolled dumping and leaking can release gas directly into the atmosphere.

In the UK, the Ozone Regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/protecting-and-enhancing-our-urban-and-natural-environment-to-improve-public-health-and-wellbeing/supporting-pages/controlling-ozone-depleting-substances-and-fluorinated-greenhouse-gases |title=2010 to 2015 government policy: environmental quality |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2015-05-08 |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.

The manufacture and use of CFCs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion (see also [[Montreal Protocol]]).&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030730080139.htm Sciencedaily.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406223118/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030730080139.htm |date=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schlossberg |first=Tatiana |authorlink=Tatiana Schlossberg |date=August 9, 2016 |title=How Bad Is Your Air-Conditioner for the Planet? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/science/air-conditioner-global-warming.html |newspaper=NYT |location= |access-date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of these environmental concerns, beginning on November 14, 1994, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] Environmental Protection Agency has restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians, per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/608fact.html |title=Complying With The Section 608 Refrigerant Recycling Rule &amp;#124; Ozone Layer Protection - Regulatory Programs &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= 2015-04-21|accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to conventional refrigerants, other gases, such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[R-744]]), have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.r744.com/knowledge/papers_result_free.php?page_no=0&amp;txt_key_free=air%20conditioning&amp;sortby=year%20DESC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514012832/http://www.r744.com/knowledge/papers_result_free.php?page_no=0&amp;txt_key_free=air%20conditioning&amp;sortby=year%20DESC |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-14 |title=The current status in Air Conditioning – papers &amp; presentations |publisher=R744.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; R-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in Europe and Japan. It is an effective refrigerant with a [[global warming potential]] of 1, but it must use higher compression to produce an equivalent cooling effect.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In 1992, a non-governmental organization, Greenpeace, was spurred by corporate executive policies and requested that a European lab find substitute refrigerants.  This led to two alternatives, one a blend of propane (R290) and isobutane (R600a), and one of pure isobutane.&lt;ref name="ozone.unep.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ecomall.com"/&gt; Industry resisted change in Europe until 1993, and in the U.S. until 2011, despite some supportive steps in 2004 and 2008 (see Refrigerant Development above).&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/news-and-blogs/campaign-blog/greenfreeze-f-gas-victory-greener-refrigerato/blog/38405/| title=Greenfreeze F-Gas Victory!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9569">An '''algae bioreactor''' is used for cultivating micro or macro algae. Algae may be cultivated for the purposes of [[biomass]] production (as in a [[seaweed cultivator]]), [[wastewater treatment]], [[Carbon fixation|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation]], or aquarium/pond filtration in the form of an [[algae scrubber]]. Algae bioreactors vary widely in design, falling broadly into two categories: open reactors and enclosed reactors. Open reactors are exposed to the atmosphere while enclosed reactors, also commonly called [[photobioreactor|photobioreactors]], are isolated to varying extent from the atmosphere. Specifically, algae bioreactors can be used to produce fuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol, to generate animal feed, or to reduce pollutants such as NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in flue gases of power plants.  Fundamentally, this kind of bioreactor is based on the [[Photosynthese|photosynthetic]] reaction which is performed by the [[chlorophyll]]-containing algae itself using dissolved carbon dioxide and sunlight energy. The carbon dioxide is dispersed into the reactor fluid to make it accessible for the algae. The bioreactor has to be made out of transparent material.

The algae are photoautotroph organisms which perform oxygenic photosynthesis.

The equation for photosynthesis:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{6\; CO_2 + 6\; H_2O \quad \longrightarrow \;C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\; O_2} \qquad \Delta H^0 = + 2 870\ \frac{\mathrm{kJ}}{\mathrm{mol}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Historical background ==
Some of the first experiments with the aim of cultivating algae were conducted in 1957 by the "[[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]]" in Washington. In these experiments, monocellular Chlorella were cultivated by adding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and some minerals. In the early days, bioreactors were used which were made of glass and later changed to a kind of plastic bag. The goal of all this research has been the cultivation of algae to produce a cheap animal feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buch-der-synergie.de/c_neu_html/c_04_02_sonne_geschichte_2.htm|title=Achmed Khammas - Das Buch der Synergie - Teil C  - Die Geschichte der Solarenergie|author=|date=|website=www.buch-der-synergie.de|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frequently used photo reactor types ==
Nowadays 3 basic types of algae photobioreactors have to be differentiated, but the determining factor is the unifying parameter – the available intensity of sunlight energy.

=== Plate photobioreactor ===
A plate reactor simply consists of vertically arranged or inclined rectangular boxes which are often divided in two parts to effect an agitation of the reactor fluid. Generally these boxes are arranged to a system by linking them. Those connections are also used for making the process of filling/emptying, introduction of gas and transport of nutritive substances, easier. The introduction of the [[flue gas]] mostly occurs at the bottom of the box to ensure that the carbon dioxide has enough time to interact with algae in the reactor fluid.

=== Tubular photobioreactor ===
A tubular reactor consists of vertical or horizontal arranged tubes, connected together to a pipe system. The algae-suspended fluid is able to circulate in this tubing. The tubes are generally made out of transparent plastics or borosilicate glass and the constant circulation is kept up by a pump at the end of the system. The introduction of gas takes place at the end/beginning of the tube system. This way of introducing gas causes the problem of deficiency of carbon dioxide, high concentration of oxygen at the end of the unit during the circulation, and bad efficiency.

=== Bubble column photobioreactor ===
A [[Bubble column reactor|bubble column photo reactor]] consists of vertical arranged cylindrical column, made out of transparent material. The introduction of gas takes place at the bottom of the column and causes a turbulent stream to enable an optimum gas exchange. At present these types of reactors are built with a maximum diameter of 20&amp;nbsp;cm to 30&amp;nbsp;cm in order to ensure the required supply of sunlight energy.

The biggest problem with the sunlight determined construction is the limited size of the diameter. Feuermann et al. {{who|date=August 2010}} invented a method to collect sunlight with a cone shaped collector and transfer it with some fiberglass cables which are adapted to the reactor in order to enable constructions of a column reactor with wider diameters. - on this scale the energy consumption due to pumps etc. and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cost of manufacture may outweigh the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured by the reactor.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Industrial usage ==
The cultivation of algae in a photobioreactor creates a narrow range of industrial application possibilities.
Some power companies &lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine |last= Patel|first= Sonal|date= 5/1/2016|title=A Breakthrough Carbon-Capturing Algae Project|url=https://www.powermag.com/breakthrough-carbon-capturing-algae-project/ |magazine= Powermag|location= Texas, USA |publisher= powermag.com|access-date=16 November 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt; already established research facilities with algae photobioreactors to find out how efficient they could be in reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, which are contained in [[flue gas]], and how much biomass will be produced. Algae biomass has many uses and can be sold to generate additional income. The saved emission volume can bring an income too, by selling emission credits to other power companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/wasser/themen/meere/mikroalgen.htm#Biomasse Umweltbundesamt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721022457/http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/wasser/themen/meere/mikroalgen.htm |date=2009-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utilisation of algae as food is very common in East Asian regions. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Algae, The Food That Could Save Humanity |url= https://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/algae-the-food-that-could-save-humanity|magazine= Le Monde|location= France|publisher= worldcruch.com|date= 09-07-2016|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the species contain only a fraction of usable proteins and carbohydrates, and a lot of minerals and trace elements. Generally, the consumption of algae should be minimal because of the high iodine content, particularly problematic for those with hyperthyroidism. Likewise, many species of diatomaceous algae produce compounds unsafe for humans.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/sem/phytoplankton.cfm|title=Toxic diatoms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 09-01-2014|website= NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center|publisher= NOAA |access-date=16 November 2018 |quote= the family Pseudo-nitzschia; under certain conditions these diatoms can produce toxins harmful to humans}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algae, especially some species which contain over 50 percent oil and a lot of carbohydrates, can be used for producing [[biodiesel]] and [[bioethanol]] by extracting and refining the fractions. This point is very interesting, because the algae biomass is generated 30 times faster than some agricultural biomass, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pnsc.2014.06.008 |title=Algal biomass as a global source of transport fuels: Overview and development perspectives |journal=Progress in Natural Science: Materials International |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=329–339 |year=2014 |last1=Ullah |first1=Kifayat |last2=Ahmad |first2=Mushtaq |last3=Sofia |last4=Sharma |first4=Vinod Kumar |last5=Lu |first5=Pengmei |last6=Harvey |first6=Adam |last7=Zafar |first7=Muhammad |last8=Sultana |first8=Shazia |last9=Anyanwu |first9=C.N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly used for producing biodiesel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3608">The '''aquifer properties''' of the aquifer essentially depend upon the composition of the [[aquifer]]. The most important properties of the aquifer are [[porosity]] and specific yield which in turn give its capacity to release the water in the pores and its ability to transmit the flow with ease.
==Porosity==
In [[soil mechanics]] and [[hydrology]], porosity is defined as the ratio of volume of voids to the total volume of porous medium. Mathematically it can be represented by the equation expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{V_V}{V_T} = \frac{V_V}{V_S + V_V} = \frac{e}{1 + e}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is void ratio, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is [[porosity]], ''V''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of void-space (air and water), ''V''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of solids, and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the total or bulk volume of medium.&lt;ref&gt; Craig, R. F. ''Craig's Soil Mechanics.'' London: Spon, 2004, p.18. {{ISBN|0-203-49410-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The significance of the porosity is that it gives the idea of [[water]] storage capacity of the aquifer. Qualitatively, porosity less than 5% is considered to be small, between 5 and 20% as medium and the percentage exceeding 20% is considered as large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geol.lsu.edu/Faculty/Nunn/gl4182/Fetter_Ch4.html | title=Properties of Aquifers | accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific yield==
Porosity gives a measure of the water storage capability of [[soil]] but not all the water present in the soil pores is available for extraction by pumping for the use of humans or draining by [[gravity]]. The pores in the soil hold back sufficient quantity of water on account of forces like [[surface tension]] and molecular attraction. Hence the actual amount of water that can be extracted from the unit volume of aquifer by pumping or under the action of gravity is called as specific yield. The fraction of water held back in the aquifer is known as specific retention. Thus it can be said that porosity is the sum of specific yield and specific retention. Specific yield of soils differ from each other in the sense that some soil types have strong molecular attraction with the water held in their pores while others have less. It is found experimentally that cohessionless soils have high specific yield than cohesive soils because the former has significantly less molecular attraction then the latter. Coarse-grained soils or rocks such as coarse [[sandstone]] can have specific yields that are closer to their actual porosity in the range 20 to 35%. The case of fine grained materials is quite opposite to that range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Engineering_Hydrology.html?id=URaFZvATAcEC | title=Engineering Hydrology | publisher=McGraw Hill Education (India) | author=K Subramanya | authorlink=Groundwater | year=2014 | pages=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.viu.ca/earle/geol304/geol-304-b.pdf | title=Specific retention and Specific yield | accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the table above, [[sand]] and [[gravel]] though having less porosity than clay yield much more than clay because of relatively less molecular attraction and coarse size of particles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6477">'''Asian Business Case Competition @ Nanyang''' is an [[international]] [[undergraduate]] [[business]] case [[competition]] in [[Singapore]], established in 2007.&lt;ref name="DarylNeo"&gt;Daryl Neo. (12 October 2009). "Environmental business solutions". The Business Times (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; It is organised by [[Nanyang Business School]]’s case club Business Solutions and is backed by the Asian Business Case Centre. ABCC @ Nanyang is a student-led case competition with a focus on sustainability.
Every year, the competition hosts undergraduate participants from [[business school]]s around the world, applying their knowledge and skills to solve real-life business problems.
ABCC @ Nanyang has been certified [[carbon neutral]] by TheCarbonNeutral Company.&lt;ref name="HafidhZulkarnaen"&gt;Hafidh Zulkarnaen (8 November 2010). "Making a case for green business practices". The Business Times (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Case competition ===

The competition centres around a 40-hour-long case,&lt;ref name="QuahChin"&gt;Quah Chin Chin (29 October 2008). "A battle of wits and grit". The Business Times.&lt;/ref&gt; where students would strategize their best solution to a [[business case study]], and present their case to a panel of judges. In 2017, after one successful decade of hosting Asian Business Case Competition, the format of competition was changed to include one 8-hour case, and one 24-hour case to provide an enhanced competition experience.

'''Bayesian efficiency''' is an analog of [[Pareto efficiency]] for situations in which there is [[incomplete information]].&lt;ref name="implementation"&gt;Palfrey, Thomas R.; Srivastava, Sanjay; Postlewaite, A. (1993) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZTls-JJSxgC&amp;pg=PA13 Bayesian Implementation.]'' Pg. 13-14. {{ISBN|3-7186-5314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Pareto efficiency, an allocation of a resource is Pareto efficient if there is no other allocation of that resource that makes no one worse off while making some agents strictly better off.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt; A limitation with the concept of Pareto efficiency is that it assumes that knowledge about other market participants is available to all participants, in that every player knows the payoffs and strategies available to other players so as to have complete information.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt; Often, the players have types that are hidden from the other player.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

==Overview==
The lack of complete information raises a question of when the efficiency calculation should be made.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt; Should the efficiency check be made at the [[ex ante]] stage before the agent sees their types, at the interim stage after the agent sees their types, or at the [[ex post]] stage where the agent will have complete information about their types? Another issue is incentive.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt; If a resource allocation rule is efficient but there is no incentive to abide by that rule or accept that rule, then the [[revelation principle]] asserts that there is no mechanism by which this allocation rule can be realized.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

Bayesian efficiency overcomes problems of the [[Pareto efficiency]] by accounting for incomplete information, by addressing the timing of the evaluation (ex ante efficient, interim efficient, or ex post efficient), and by adding an incentive qualifier so that the allocation rule is incentive compatible.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baltagi, Badi Hani. (2001) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qjBF3Z3xcWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover A Companion to Theoretical Econometrics.]'' Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4051-0676-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian efficiency separately defines three types of efficiency: ex ante, interim, and ex post. For an allocation rule &lt;math&gt;x:T\to A&lt;/math&gt;:

''Ex ante efficiency'': &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule &lt;math&gt;y:T\to A&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;\int u^i(y(t),t)dG^i(t) \geq \int u^i(x(t),t)dG^i(t)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, with strict inequality for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

''Interim efficiency'': &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule &lt;math&gt;y:T\to A&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;\int U^i(y(t),t)dG^i(t_{-i}|t_i) \geq \int U^i(x(t),t)dG^i(t_{-i}|t_i)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;, with strict inequality for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;.

''Ex post efficiency'': &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule &lt;math&gt;y:T\to A&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;U^i(y(t),t) \geq U^i(x(t),t)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, with strict inequality for some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, &lt;math&gt;G^i&lt;/math&gt; are beliefs, &lt;math&gt;U^i&lt;/math&gt; are utility functions, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; are agents. An ex ante allocation is always interim and ex post efficient, and an interim efficient allocation is always ex post efficient.&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6860">'''Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory''' is a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]]-owned research and development facility in the [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania]], that works exclusively on the design and development of [[nuclear power]] for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. It was one of the leaders in creating the [[nuclear navy]].

The laboratory, which is part of the [[Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program]], a joint U.S Navy-[[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] program responsible for the research, design, construction, operation and maintenance of U.S. nuclear-powered warships is operated by Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation.

The laboratory was founded in 1949 on the site of the former [[Bettis Field]], named after [[Cyrus Bettis]]. It covers approximately {{convert|207|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/reg3wcmd/ca/pa/pdf/pa0890090004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From the Lab's founding until 1998, it was run by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. [[Bechtel Corporation]] won the contract to run the laboratory on September 19, 2008 and assumed operation on February 1, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bechtel.com/2008-09-19.html Bechtel Corporation: Bechtel Awarded Contracts for Bettis, Knolls Laboratories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; first under its subsidiary Bechtel Bettis, Inc., later under Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation.

The laboratory developed [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge National Laboratory's]] original design of the [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) for operational naval use. It built the nuclear propulsion plants for the first U.S. nuclear [[submarine]]s and [[surface ship]]s including {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, {{USS|George Washington|SSBN-598|6}}, {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|6}}, and  {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/legacies/simpson.html IEEE - IEEE History Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126072439/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/legacies/simpson.html |date=November 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westinghouse's Nuclear Power Division adapted the PWR design for commercial use and built the first commercial nuclear power plant in the [[United States]], the [[Shippingport Reactor|Shippingport Power Plant]] in the west hills of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/facility/bettis.htm Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory - United States Nuclear Forces&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory had two [[supercomputer]]s listed on the 26th [[TOP500]] List (November 2005). Ranked 97 a 1,090 processor [[Opteron]] system and ranked 405 a 536 processor [[Itanium 2]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.top500.org/sublist/Site.php?id%3D427 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110083013/http://top500.org/sublist/Site.php?id=427 |archivedate=2005-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--dead link--&gt;

The laboratory is also home to the U.S. Navy's Bettis Reactor Engineering School. The school provides a post-graduate certificate program in [[Nuclear engineering|Nuclear Engineering]] with a focus on nuclear reactor design, construction, and operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/eng/appndx-c.htm Naval Reactors (NR): A Potential Model for Improved &lt;BR&gt;Personnel Management in the Department of Energy (DOE)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/officer/nuclear |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828231328/http://www.navy.com/officer/nuclear |archivedate=2005-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is open only to Naval personnel and Bettis engineers.

The laboratory had been chosen to develop the [[Project Prometheus]] nuclear power source for the JIMO ([[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]]) project, however, funding for this program was cancelled in the fall of 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1211">'''Bis-peptides''' are analogues of [[peptide]]s, but consist of [[bis-amino acid]]s, which bear two [[carboxyl group]]s and two [[amino group]]s. The connection of specific bis-amino acids leads to the formation of bis-peptides with well-defined molecular shape, which is of great interest for designing nano-structures.

Possible applications that are currently investigated include the binding and inactivation of [[cholera toxin]] and the cross linkage of surface [[protein]]s of various viruses ([[HIV]], [[Ebola virus]]). Further the group of Christian Schafmeister developed molecular hinges, which can be used for the construction of [[molecular machine]]s, such as nano-[[valve]]s or [[data storage device|data storage]] systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10380">[[File:Location TsugaruPeninsulaJp.jpg|thumb|The Tsugaru Strait which forms the natural [[biogeography|zoogeographical]] boundary of Blakiston's Line]]

The '''Blakiston Line''' or '''Blakiston's Line''' is a [[wikt:faunal|faunal]] boundary line drawn between two of the four largest [[island]]s of [[Japan]]: [[Hokkaidō]] in the north and [[Honshū]], south of it. It can be compared with faunal boundary lines like the [[Wallace Line]]. Certain animal species can only be found north of Blakiston's Line, while certain other species can only be found south of it.

[[Thomas Blakiston]], who lived in Japan from 1861 to 1884 and who spent much of that time in [[Hakodate]], Hokkaido, was the first person to notice that animals in [[Hokkaidō]], Japan's northern island, were related to northern [[Asia]]n species, whereas those on [[Honshū]] to the south were related to those from [[southern Asia]]. The [[Tsugaru Strait]] between the two islands was therefore established as a [[biogeography|zoogeographical]] boundary, and became known as ''Blakiston's Line''. This finding was first published to the [[Asiatic Society of Japan]] in a paper of 14 February 1883, named ''Zoological Indications of Ancient Connection of the Japan islands with the Continent''.&lt;ref&gt;Collection Writings of Sir Hugh Cortazzi, Volume II, Sir Hugh Cortazzi, Routledge, Oxon, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations and Hypotheses on the existence of Blakiston's Line ==
[[File:Japan glaciation.gif|thumb|right|Japanese archipelago, possibly 10,000-20,000 years ago with Hokkaido island bridged to the mainland, the thin black line indicates present-day shorelines.]]
The difference in the fauna can probably be attributed to land bridges that may have existed in the past. Whilst Hokkaido may have had [[land bridge]]s to the north of Asia, via [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]], the other islands of Japan like [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]] and [[Kyushu]], may have been connected to the Asian continent via the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/japan/hokkaido/background/other-features/18ee2039-f6f7-4c73-89a1-c742c4086f49/a/nar/18ee2039-f6f7-4c73-89a1-c742c4086f49/1323400|title=The Blakiston Line in Hokkaidō|last=Planet|first=Lonely|work=Lonely Planet|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to when these land bridges existed, scientists do not agree with each other. It may have been between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago, it may have been later than that.&lt;ref&gt;Effects of climate, distance, and a geographic barrier on ectomycorrhizal fugal communities in Japan: A comparison across Blakiston's Line by Yumiko Miyamoto, Maki Narimatsu and Kazuhide Nara, Hokkaido University January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A new timeframe for the diversification of Japan’s mammals by Bailey D. McKay, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Hoboken 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sakhalin, the island just north of Japan, and Hokkaido may even have been connected to the mainland as recently as 10,000 years ago or less.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, M. (1994), Patterns of distribution in Japanese land mammals. Mammal Review, 24: 91-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these former land bridges, there are more factors that play a role in why there is a difference in the fauna north and south of the line:
* The Tsugaru Strait is relatively deep, the maximum depth is 449 m.
* The narrowest part of the Tsugaru Strait is 12.1 miles (19.5 km).
* Currents in the Tsugaru Strait are strong, tidal currents coincide with ocean currents&lt;ref&gt;EFFECTS OF WAVE, TIDAL CURRENT AND OCEAN CURRENT COEXISTENCE ON THE WAVE AND CURRENT PREDICTIONS IN THE TSUGARU STRAIT, Ayumi Saruwatari, Yoshihiro Yoneko and Yu Tajima&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conlon, Dennis Michael, "Dynamics of Flow in the Region of the Tsugaru Strait." (1980).  LSU Historical Dissertations and Theses. 3557.  https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_disstheses/3557&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate in the north is generally far colder than that in the south.

== Species North and South of Blakiston's Line ==
[[File:Blakiston`s fish owl1.jpg|thumb|Example of Blakiston's Fish Owl which was named after Blakiston]]
Besides birds, animals that are of different origins north and south of the Blakiston Line include [[wolve]]s, [[bear]]s and [[chipmunk]]s. [[Monkey]]s do not even live north of Blakiston's Line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://travelswiththomas.wordpress.com/chapter-one-blakistons-line/|title=CHAPTER ONE – BLAKISTON’S LINE|date=2009-12-10|work=TravelsWithThomas|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table gives some examples of animal species involved&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet Japan by Rebecca Milner et al. 15 ed. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Wildlife in Japan, Ministry of the Environment of Japan, Tokyo, March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boredpanda.com/cute-animals-hokkaido-ezo-japan/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic|title=Hokkaido Island In Japan Is Home To 7 Incredibly Cute Animals|work=Bored Panda|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

Note that species that can only be found on the [[Ryukyu Islands]] are excluded from this table, even though their habitat is clearly south of Blakiston's Line, as other factors account for their distribution. Besides animal species that can only be found either north or south of Blakiston's Line, there are very many that can be found at either side of the line, in part because of human involvement. Examples of the latter are the [[Japanese Shorthorn]], a breed of small Japanese beef cattle that is distributed in northern Honshu and also in Hokkaido, and the [[Japanese weasel]], which was introduced to Hokkaido by human intervention.

It has also been studied whether or not this biogeographic boundary applies to far smaller organisms like soil microbes.&lt;ref&gt;Effects of climate, distance, and a geographic barrier on ectomycorrhizal fugal communities in Japan: A comparison across Blakiston's Line by Yumiko Miyamoto, Maki Narimatsu and Kazuhide Nara, Hokkaido University January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Faunal Boundary Lines in Japan ==
Apart from Blakiston's Line, other faunal boundary lines have been proposed for Japan, like [[Watase’s line]] ([[Tokara   Straits]]): for   mammals,   reptiles,   amphibians   and   spiders, [[Hatta’s line]] (Soya line): for reptiles, amphibians and freshwater invertebrates, [[Hachisuka’s line]] for birds and [[Miyake’s line]] for insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nature in Japan | publisher = Ministry of the Environment Government of Japan | url = http://www.env.go.jp/earth/coop/coop/materials/08-ttmnce/08-ttmnce-21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of Thomas Blakiston ==
[[File:Tsugaru street detail.PNG|thumb|More detailed map of the Tsugaru Strait]]
There has been speculation about why Blakiston was the person who discovered this faunal boundary line and no one before him had done so. Andrew Davis, who has been a professor at [[Hokkaido University]] for four years, argued that this may have been because of his unusual position in Japanese society as a European''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japansociety.org.uk/6873/a-line-in-birdsthomas-w-blakistons-contribution-to-ornithology-and-biogeography-in-early-meiji-japan-by-andrew-davis/|title=A Line in Birds:Thomas W Blakiston's contribution to Ornithology and Biogeography in Early-Meiji Japan by Andrew Davis - Japan Society of the UK|date=2009-10-28|work=Japan Society of the UK|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blakiston spent much time researching bird species in Japan. At that time, Japanese ornithology was at its infancy. In 1886 [[Leonhard Stejneger]] remarked: "Our knowledge of Japanese ornithology is only fragmentary"&lt;ref&gt;Review of Japanese Birds in Proceedings of United States National Museum by Leonhard Stejneger, Washington 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; The years after his stay in Japan, Blakiston made publications on birds in Japan in general&lt;ref&gt;A Catalogue of the Birds of Japan by T. Blakiston and H. Pryer, Ibis International Journey of Avian Science, Fourth Series, No. VII. July 1878&lt;/ref&gt; and on water birds of Japan in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Water-birds of Japan in Proceedings of United States National Museum by T.W. Blakiston, Washington 1885&lt;/ref&gt; Bird species like [[Blakiston's fish owl|Blakiston's Fish Owl]] (''Bubo blakistoni'') and ''Regulus regulus japonensis'' Blakiston have been named after him. In Hakodate, Blakiston made a large collection of birds, which is currently located at the museum of Hakodate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Blakiston|first=Herbert Edward Douglas|title=Blakiston Thomas Wright|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Blakiston,_Thomas_Wright_(DNB01)|work=Dictionary of National Biography, 1901 supplement|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distributions of many [[bird]] species observe the Blakiston line, since many birds do not cross even the shortest stretches of open ocean water. 

For his discovery of Blakiston's Line, a monument was erected in his honor on [[Mount Hakodate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nihon-kankou.or.jp.e.wp.hp.transer.com/hokkaido/012025/detail/01202aj2200023170|title=Monument of Blakiston {{!}} Must-see-japan Hakodate-shi (Japanese sightseeing promotion association) of the whole country|website=www.nihon-kankou.or.jp.e.wp.hp.transer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zipangguide.com/travel/sight/hokkaido/hakodateyama_tenbodai.html|title=Mount Hakodate Observatory - Zipang Guide|website=Zipang Guide|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bowers v. Hardwick''''', 478 U.S. 186 (1986), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that upheld, in a 5–4 ruling, the constitutionality of a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[sodomy law]] criminalizing [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] in private between consenting adults, in this case with respect to homosexual sodomy, though the law did not differentiate between homosexual sodomy and heterosexual sodomy.&lt;ref name="decision"&gt;{{ussc|name=Bowers v. Hardwick|478|186|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This case was overturned in 2003 in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.

The majority opinion, by Justice [[Byron White]], reasoned that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not confer “a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy”.&lt;ref name="decision"/&gt; A concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] cited the “ancient roots” of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting [[William Blackstone]]’s description of homosexual sex as an “infamous crime against nature”, worse than rape, and “a crime not fit to be named”. Burger concluded: “To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.”&lt;ref name="concurrence"/&gt; Justice [[Lewis F. Powell]] later said he regretted joining the majority, but thought the case of little importance at the time.

The senior dissent, by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy. Blackmun's dissent accused the Court of an “almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity" and an “overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases”. In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality, Blackmun wrote: “That certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry. The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine.”&lt;ref name="blackmun-dissent"&gt;''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 211 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen years after ''Bowers v. Hardwick'', the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;{{ussc|name=Lawrence v. Texas|volume=539|page=558|pin=|year=2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and held that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional.

==Background==
In early July 1982, [[Atlanta Police Department (Georgia)|Atlanta police]] officer Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a citation for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle into a trash can outside the gay bar where he worked, allegedly observing him violating the city's ordinance that prohibits drinking in public.&lt;ref name=nussbaum&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195305319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a clerical error on the citation issued by Torick, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying a $50 fine at a court office, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's house three weeks later, on August 3, to serve the now-invalid warrant.&lt;ref name=eskridge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eskridge|first1=William N.|title=Sodomy Laws in America, 1861-2003|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|pages=232–234|isbn=9780670018628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murdoch and Price"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murdoch|first1=Joyce|last2=Price|first2=Deb|title=Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians V. The Supreme Court|date=2002|publisher=Basic Books|pages=277–280|isbn=9780465015146}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, an unrelated guest of Hardwick was sleeping on the couch in Hardwick's living room; at around 8:30 am, Officer Torick entered the house (the front door may have been ajar) and awoke the guest, then proceeded down a hallway towards Hardwick's bedroom.&lt;ref name="nussbaum"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt; The officer opened the bedroom door, and Torick observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=278}}

Hardwick was angry at the intrusion and threatened to have Torick fired for entering his home. Torick later stated that he "would never have made the case if [Hardwick] hadn't had an attitude problem."&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt; Torick then arrested both men for [[sodomy]], a felony under Georgia law that carried a sentence of one to twenty years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Code Ann. § 16-6-2 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; District Attorney Lewis Slaton chose not to prosecute the sodomy charge, considering that the warrant had expired, and his own belief that the sodomy law should not be used to prosecute consensual sexual activity.&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt;

Hardwick then sued [[Mike Bowers|Michael Bowers]], the [[attorney general]] of Georgia, in federal court for a [[declaratory judgment]] that the state's sodomy law was invalid. He charged that as a non-celibate gay man, he was liable to eventually be prosecuted for his activities. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had been searching for a “perfect test case” to challenge anti-sodomy laws, and Hardwick's cause presented the one they were looking for.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=279}} They approached Hardwick, who agreed to be represented by ACLU attorneys.

In the lower federal courts, Hardwick was represented by attorney Kathleen Wilde. The case was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]], where it was dismissed, with the Court ruling in favor of Bowers. Hardwick appealed, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] reversed the lower court, finding that the Georgia sodomy statute was indeed an infringement upon Hardwick's Constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hardwick v. Bowers |vol=760 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1202 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=1985 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/760/1202/75648/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Georgia then appealed, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted [[certiorari]] on November&amp;nbsp;4, 1985, to review the case.

Hardwick was represented before the Supreme Court by [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Laurence Tribe]]. Michael Hobbs, assistant attorney general, argued the case for the State. The legality of the officer's entry into Hardwick's home was not contested; only the constitutionality of the sodomy statute was challenged.

A heterosexual married couple was initially named in the suit as plaintiffs [[John Doe|John and Mary Doe]], alleging that they wished to engage in sodomy but were prevented from doing so by the Georgia anti-sodomy law.&lt;ref name="decision" /&gt; But they failed to obtain [[Standing (law)|standing]] and were dropped from the suit.&lt;ref name="decision" /&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court issued a 5-4 ruling upholding the sodomy laws. Justice [[Byron White]] wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices [[William Rehnquist]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Warren E. Burger]], and [[Lewis F. Powell]]. Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] wrote a dissent joined by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and [[John Paul Stevens]]. Stevens also wrote a dissent joined by Brennan and Marshall.

===Majority opinion===
The issue in ''Bowers'' involved the right of [[privacy]]. Since 1965's ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'',&lt;ref name=Griswold&gt;{{ussc|name=Griswold v. Connecticut|volume=381|page=479|pin=|year=1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court had held that a right to privacy was implicit in the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In ''Bowers'', the Court held that this right did not extend to private, consensual sexual conduct, at least insofar as it involved homosexual sex. The majority opinion in ''Bowers'', written by Justice [[Byron White]], framed the legal question as whether the constitution confers “a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.” The opinion answered this question in the negative, stating that “to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’ is, at best, facetious.”

Justice White added a [[slippery slope]] warning about undesirable potential implications for other sex laws: &lt;blockquote&gt;And if respondent's submission is limited to the voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults, it would be difficult, except by fiat, to limit the claimed right to homosexual conduct [p196] while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, incest, and other sexual crimes even though they are committed in the home. We are unwilling to start down that road.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chief Justice Burger's concurrence===
The short concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] emphasized historical negative attitudes toward homosexual sex, quoting Sir [[William Blackstone]]’s characterization of sodomy as “a crime not fit to be named”.&lt;ref name="concurrence"&gt;''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 197 (Burger, C.J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Burger concluded, “To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.”

===Justice Powell's concurrence===
In a concurring opinion, Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] joined the majority opinion in upholding the law against a substantive due process attack. But he voiced doubts about the compatibility of Georgia's law with the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], noting that even consensual sodomy could be punished with up to twenty years in prison, the same sentence as aggravated battery or first-degree arson. However, since Hardwick had not been tried or sentenced, the question of the statute's constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment did not come up in the case.

Powell was considered the deciding vote during the case. He had initially voted to strike down the law but changed his mind after conservative clerk [[Michael W. Mosman]] advised him to uphold the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-9252-domestic_partner_decision_revisiting_old_wounds.html Domestic Partner Decision: Revisiting Old Wounds?], ''Willamette Week''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that Powell's decision to uphold the law was influenced by his belief that he had never known any [[homosexual]]s, even though one of his own law clerks was gay.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lazarus|Lazarus, Edward]]. ''[[Closed Chambers]]: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court,'' p. 386. “At the ''Bowers'' conference, Powell told his colleagues that he had ‘never met a homosexual’.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Extreme Makeover: The story behind the story of Lawrence v. Texas |author=Dahlia Lithwick |date=12 March 2012 |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/03/12/120312crbo_books_lithwick?google_editors_picks=true |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But that clerk has said that Powell had met his boyfriend, and that Powell had asked him about the mechanisms of homosexual sex when deciding the case. He felt that Powell had made the remark in order to avoid revealing that one of his clerks was gay at a time when such a revelation could have destroyed that clerk's future legal career. Journalists have since found that Powell hired more gay law clerks than any of the other justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exhibit ''A'' for a Major Shift: Justices’ Gay Clerks |date=June 10, 2013 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/us/exhibit-a-for-a-major-shift-justices-gay-clerks.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=recg |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissents===

====Justice Blackmun's dissent====
A sharply worded dissenting opinion by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] attacked the majority opinion as having an "almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity". Blackmun wrote, "Only the most willful blindness could obscure the fact that sexual intimacy is 'a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality{{'-}}” (ironically quoting from Burger's opinion in ''[[Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton]]'', which held that obscene films are not constitutionally protected). The dissent compared the majority opinion to that in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Minersville School District v. Gobitis|volume=310|page=586|pin=|year=1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was reversed by the Court after only three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette|volume=319|page=624|pin=|year=1943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmun revealed in a 1995 [[oral history]] with [[Harold Hongju Koh|Harold Koh]] that his dissent in ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' was written primarily by [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/groups-push-for-first-gay-justice-022106|title=Groups push for first gay justice|work=POLITICO|date=2009-05-05|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/stanford-law-professor-pam-karlan-concludes-2006-acs-national-convention|title=Stanford Law Professor Pam Karlan Concludes 2006 ACS National Convention {{!}} ACS|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en|date=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pamela S. Karlan|Pamela Karlan]] (then Blackmun's clerk and now a professor of law at [[Stanford Law School]]). Blackmun said of the dissent, "Karlan did a lot of very effective writing, and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out. She felt very strongly about it, and I think is correct in her approach to it. I think the dissent is correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_04_17-2005_04_23.shtml#1114025448 |title=The Volokh Conspiracy |publisher=Volokh.com |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Justice Stevens's dissent====
Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote a separate dissent that focused on the selective enforcement of the law against homosexuals. The Georgia statute could not be applied to married heterosexuals, as consensual sexual activity within the bounds of marriage was protected under ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.&lt;ref name=Griswold/&gt; Nor could the law be applied to unmarried heterosexuals, as ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Eisenstadt v. Baird|volume=405|page=438|pin=|year=1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried people. Since heterosexuals could never be prosecuted for sodomy, Georgia should have the burden of proving that selective enforcement against homosexuals was constitutional.

====Subsequent findings====
According to Daniel Richman, former law clerk for Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], Marshall's friendship with [[civil rights]] leader [[Bayard Rustin]] and Rustin's openness about his homosexuality played a significant role in Marshall's decision to join both dissents. Richman also recalled that Marshall thought that the case was a "no-brainer", and told Richman, who wrote a bench memo for Marshall on the case, that "this [case] is controlled by [[Stanley v. Georgia|''Stanley'']]".{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=292}}

==Subsequent events==

===Jurisprudence===
''Bowers'' was decided at a time when the court's privacy jurisprudence, and in particular the right to abortion recognized in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|volume=410|page=113|pin=|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had come under heavy criticism. ''Bowers'' signaled a reluctance by the Court to recognize a general constitutional right to privacy or to extend such a right further than they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Franke |first=Katherine |title=Dignifying Rights: A Comment on Jeremy Waldron's 'Dignity, Rights, and Responsibilities' |url=http://www2.law.columbia.edu/faculty_franke/Dignifying%20Rights%20%28Final%20Proof%29.pdf |publisher=Columbia Law School |accessdate=12 June 2013 |page=1188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia law upheld in ''Bowers'' criminalized oral sex and anal sex whether engaged in by people of the same sex or different sexes, but White's decision was restricted to homosexual sex. “The only claim properly before the Court, therefore, is Hardwick’s challenge to the Georgia statute as applied to consensual homosexual sodomy. We express no opinion on the constitutionality of the Georgia statute as applied to other acts of sodomy.” State sodomy laws were seldom enforced against private, consensual conduct in the decades following the decision, though many courts and state governments interpreted it to justify a wide variety of bans and limitations on the lives of [[gay]] people.&lt;ref name="keen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Strangers to the Law: Gay People on Trial |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/keen-law.html |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Lisa Keen |author2=Susanne B. Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bowers'' was used to deny suspect class qualification to gays and lesbians, thus restricting the standard of review to rational basis. Although ''Bowers'' was later overruled, decisions based on it, such as ''[[High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office |vol=895 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=563 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1990 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/895/563/46921/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes still cited as precedent in gay rights cases.

===Justice Powell's later comments===
In 1990, three years after retiring from the Court, Powell told a group of [[New York University]] law students that he considered his opinion in ''Bowers'' an error. “I do think it was inconsistent in a general way with ''Roe''. When I had the opportunity to reread the opinions a few months later I thought the dissent had the better of the arguments."&lt;ref name = shilts&gt;Shilts, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; But Powell believed the case was one of little importance and in 1990 said he hadn't devoted thirty minutes to thinking about it since the ruling.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price}}

===Repeal of state sodomy laws===
In the years after ''Bowers'' was decided, several state legislatures repealed their sodomy laws. In addition, a number of state courts invalidated sodomy laws under privacy or other provisions of their state constitutions. The same sodomy law that was upheld in ''Bowers'' was struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court under the Georgia state constitution in the case of ''[[Powell v. Georgia|Powell v. State]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Powell v. State |vol=270 |reporter=Ga. |opinion=327 |pinpoint= |court=Ga. |date=1998 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1338934/powell-v-state/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keen"/&gt;

====''Lawrence v. Texas''====
The remaining 13 state sodomy laws in the U.S. were invalidated, insofar as they applied to private consensual conduct among adults, by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref name=Lawrence/&gt; which explicitly overturned ''Bowers''. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas|Lawrence]]'', ruling that Texas's state sodomy law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause (adult consensual sexual intimacy in one's home is a vital interest in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause). Kennedy wrote: “''Bowers'' was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' should be and now is overruled.”&lt;ref&gt;''Lawrence'', 539 U.S. at 578.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media portrayal===
[[Bill Moyers]] discussed the decision at length in an interview with Blackmun on the episode "Mr. Justice Blackmun" of the 1987 Constitutional bicentennial documentary miniseries ''In Search of the Constitution''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://billmoyers.com/content/mr-justice-blackmun-supreme-court/ Mr. Justice Blackmun (April 16, 1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a play based on the life of Michael Hardwick and the judicial proceedings, ''Sodomy Rules: The Bowers v. Hardwick Trial'', was written and performed by Bill Crouch in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carol Polcovar and Festival Participants: Fresh Fruit Festival, June 28, 2009|url=http://www.nytheatre.com/Content/Interview/freshfruit|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130062125/http://www.nytheatre.com/Content/Interview/freshfruit|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 30, 2013|publisher=nytheater.com|accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
The last name of the satirical character Betty Bowers, played by [[Deven Green]], is taken from this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

===Hastening LGBTQ rights advocacy===
The decision was a watershed moment in LGBTQ rights, leading to renewed organizing, and directly to the formation of advocacy groups such as [[PROMO]].

The CTLLS is the second highest of the teaching qualifications specifically for this sector of education, the others being the [[Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector]] (DTLLS) and the [[Preparing to Teach in the Lifelong Learning Sector]] (PTLLS), qualifications all of which were introduced in 2007 and later updated in 2011.

The [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF]] Level 4 Certificate in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector qualification (CTLLS), will be replaced with the '''Level 3 Award in Education and Training''' qualification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22319">'''Cognitive semantics''' is part of the [[cognitive linguistics]] movement. [[Semantics]] is the study of linguistic meaning. Cognitive semantics holds that language is part of a more general human [[Cognition|cognitive ability]], and can therefore only describe the world as people conceive of it.&lt;ref name=Croft&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics|author=Croft, William and D. Alan Cruse|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004|pages=1,105,7–15,33–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=I6Z9H-eRSgoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is implicit that different linguistic communities conceive of simple things and processes in the world differently (different cultures), not necessarily some difference between a person's conceptual world and the real world (wrong beliefs).

The main tenets of cognitive semantics are:
* That grammar manifests a conception of the world held in a culture;
* That knowledge of language is acquired and contextual;
* That the ability to use language draws upon general cognitive resources and not a special [[language module]].&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

As part of the field of cognitive linguistics, the cognitive semantics approach rejects the traditional separation of [[linguistics]] into [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[pragmatics]], etc. Instead, it divides semantics into ''meaning-construction'' and ''knowledge representation''. Therefore, cognitive semantics studies much of the area traditionally devoted to [[pragmatics]] as well as [[semantics]]. 

The techniques native to cognitive semantics are typically used in [[lexicology|lexical]] studies such as those put forth by [[Leonard Talmy]], [[George Lakoff]], [[Dirk Geeraerts]], and [[Bruce Wayne Hawkins]]. Some cognitive semantic frameworks, such as that developed by Talmy, take into account syntactic structures as well.

== Points of contrast ==

As a field, semantics is interested in three big questions: what does it mean for units of language, called [[lexeme]]s, to have "meaning"? What does it mean for sentences to have meaning? Finally, how is it that meaningful units fit together to compose complete sentences? These are the main points of inquiry behind studies into [[lexical semantics]], [[structural semantics]], and theories of [[compositionality]] (respectively). In each category, traditional theories seem to be at odds with those accounts provided by cognitive semanticists.

Classic theories in semantics (in the tradition of [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]) have tended to explain the meaning of parts in terms of ''necessary and sufficient conditions'', sentences in terms of ''truth-conditions'', and composition in terms of ''[[propositional function]]s''. Each of these positions is tightly related to the others. According to these traditional theories, the meaning of a particular sentence may be understood as the conditions under which the proposition conveyed by the sentence hold true. For instance, the expression "snow is white" is true if and only if snow is, in fact, white. Lexical units can be understood as holding meaning either by virtue of [[Extension (semantics)|set of things]] they may apply to (called the "extension" of the word), or in terms of the [[Intension|common properties]] that hold between these things (called its "intension"). The intension provides an [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] with the necessary and sufficient conditions that let a thing qualify as a member of some lexical unit's extension. Roughly, propositional functions are those abstract instructions that guide the interpreter in taking the free variables in an [[open sentence]] and filling them in, resulting in a correct understanding of the sentence as a whole.

Meanwhile, cognitive semantic theories are typically built on the argument that lexical meaning is conceptual. That is, meaning is not necessarily reference to the entity or relation in some real or possible world. Instead, meaning corresponds with a concept held in the mind based on personal understanding. As a result, semantic facts like "All bachelors are unmarried males" are not treated as special facts about our language practices; rather, these facts are not distinct from encyclopaedic knowledge. In treating linguistic knowledge as being a piece with everyday knowledge, the question is raised: how can cognitive semantics explain paradigmatically semantic phenomena, like category structure? Set to the challenge, researchers have drawn upon theories from related fields, like [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive anthropology]]. One proposal is to treat in order to explain category structure in terms of ''nodes'' in a ''knowledge network''. One example of a theory from cognitive science that has made its way into the cognitive semantic mainstream is the theory of [[prototype theory|prototypes]], which cognitive semanticists generally argue is the cause of [[polysemy]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

Cognitive semanticists argue that truth-conditional semantics is unduly limited in its account of full sentence meaning. While they are not on the whole hostile to truth-conditional semantics, they point out that it has limited explanatory power. That is to say, it is limited to indicative sentences, and does not seem to offer any straightforward or intuitive way of treating (say) commands or expressions. By contrast, cognitive semantics seeks to capture the full range of [[grammatical mood]]s by also making use of the notions of framing and mental spaces.

Another trait of cognitive semantics is the recognition that meaning is not fixed but a matter of [[construal]] and conventionalization. The processes of linguistic construal, it is argued, are the same psychological processes involved in the processing of encyclopaedic knowledge and in perception. This view has implications for the problem of compositionality. An account in cognitive semantics called the [[dynamic construal theory]] makes the claim that words themselves are without meaning: they have, at best, "default construals," which are really just ways of using words. Along these lines, cognitive semantics argues that compositionality can only be intelligible if pragmatic elements like context and intention are taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

== The structure of concepts ==

Cognitive semantics has sought to challenge traditional theories in two ways: first, by providing an account of the meaning of sentences by going beyond truth-conditional accounts; and second, by attempting to go beyond accounts of word meaning that appeal to necessary and sufficient conditions. It accomplishes both by examining the structure of concepts.

===Frame semantics===
{{Main|Frame semantics (linguistics)}}
Frame semantics, developed by [[Charles J. Fillmore]], attempts to explain meaning in terms of their relation to general ''understanding'', not just in the terms laid out by truth-conditional semantics. Fillmore explains meaning in general (including the meaning of lexemes) in terms of ''"frames"''. By "frame" is meant any concept that can only be understood if a larger system of concepts is also understood.

==== Fillmore: framing ====

Many pieces of linguistic evidence motivate the frame-semantic project. First, it has been noted that word meaning is an extension of our bodily and cultural experiences. For example, the notion of ''restaurant'' is associated with a series of concepts, like ''food, service, waiters, tables, and eating''.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; These rich-but-contingent associations cannot be captured by an analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, yet they still seem to be intimately related to our understanding of "restaurant".

Second, and more seriously, these conditions are not enough to account for asymmetries in the ways that words are used. According to a semantic feature analysis, there is nothing more to the meanings of "boy" and "girl" than:

# BOY [+MALE], [+YOUNG]
# GIRL [+FEMALE], [+YOUNG]

And there is surely some truth to this proposal. Indeed, cognitive semanticists understand the instances of the concept held by a given certain word may be said to exist in a ''schematic relation'' with the concept itself. And this is regarded as a legitimate approach to semantic analysis, so far as it goes.

However, linguists have found that language users regularly apply the terms "boy" and "girl" in ways that go beyond mere semantic features. That is, for instance, people tend to be more likely to consider a young female a "girl" (as opposed to "woman"), than they are to consider a borderline-young male a "boy" (as opposed to "man").&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; This fact suggests that there is a latent frame, made up of cultural attitudes, expectations, and background assumptions, which is part of word meaning. These background assumptions go up and beyond those necessary and sufficient conditions that correspond to a semantic feature account. Frame semantics, then, seeks to account for these puzzling features of lexical items in some systematic way.

Third, cognitive semanticists argue that truth-conditional semantics is incapable of dealing adequately with some aspects of the meanings at the level of the sentence. Take the following:

# You didn't spare me a day at the seaside; you deprived me of one.

In this case, the truth-conditions of the claim expressed by the antecedent in the sentence are not being denied by the proposition expressed after the clause. Instead, what is being denied is the way that the antecedent is framed.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

Finally, with the frame-semantic paradigm's analytical tools, the linguist is able to explain a wider range of semantic phenomena than they would be able to with only necessary and sufficient conditions. Some words have the same definitions or intensions, and the same extensions, but have subtly different domains. For example, the lexemes ''land'' and ''ground'' are synonyms, yet they naturally contrast with different things -- ''sea'' and ''air'', respectively.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; 

As we have seen, the frame semantic account is by no means limited to the study of lexemes—with it, researchers may examine expressions at more complex levels, including the level of the sentence (or, more precisely, the utterance). The notion of framing is regarded as being of the same cast as the pragmatic notion of ''background assumptions''. Philosopher of language [[John Searle]] explains the latter by asking readers to consider sentences like "The cat is on the mat". For such a sentence to make any sense, the interpreter makes a series of assumptions: i.e., that there is gravity, the cat is parallel to the mat, and the two touch. For the sentence to be intelligible, the speaker supposes that the interpreter has an idealized or default frame in mind.

==== Langacker: profile and base ====

An alternate strain of Fillmore's analysis can be found in the work of [[Ronald Langacker]], who makes a distinction between the notions of ''profile'' and ''base''. The profile is the concept symbolized by the word itself, while the base is the encyclopedic knowledge that the concept presupposes. For example, let the definition of "radius" be "a line segment that joins the center of a circle with any point on its circumference". If all we know of the concept ''radius'' is its profile, then we simply know that it is a line segment that is attached to something called the "circumference" in some greater whole called the "circle". That is to say, our understanding is fragmentary until the base concept of ''circle'' is firmly grasped.

When a single base supports a number of different profiles, then it can be called a "''domain''". For instance, the concept profiles of ''arc, center, and circumference'' are all in the domain of ''circle'', because each uses the concept of ''circle'' as a base. We are then in a position to characterize the notion of a frame as being either the base of the concept profile, or (more generally) the domain that the profile is a part of.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

=== Categorization and cognition ===
{{Main|Prototype theory}}

[[File:Prototype membership.gif|left|thumb|Membership of a graded class]]

A major divide in the approaches to cognitive semantics lies in the puzzle surrounding the nature of category structure. As mentioned in the previous section, semantic feature analyses fall short of accounting for the frames that categories may have. An alternative proposal would have to go beyond the minimalistic models given by classical accounts, and explain the richness of detail in meaning that language speakers attribute to categories.

''Prototype theories'', investigated by [[Eleanor Rosch]], have given some reason to suppose that many natural lexical category structures are graded, i.e., they have prototypical members that are considered to be "better fit" the category than other examples. For instance, [[American robin|robins]] are generally viewed as better examples of the category "[[bird]]" than, say, [[penguin]]s. If this view of category structure is the case, then categories can be understood to have central and peripheral members, and not just be evaluated in terms of members and non-members.

In a related vein, [[George Lakoff]], following the later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], noted that some categories are only connected to one another by way of ''family resemblances''. While some classical categories may exist, i.e., which are structured by necessary and sufficient conditions, there are at least two other kinds: ''generative'' and ''radial''. 

''Generative categories'' can be formed by taking central cases and applying certain principles to designate category membership. The principle of similarity is one example of a rule that might generate a broader category from given prototypes.

''Radial categories'' are categories motivated by conventions, but not predictable from rules. The concept of "mother", for example, may be explained in terms of a variety of conditions that may or may not be sufficient. Those conditions may include: being married, has always been female, gave birth to the child, supplied half the child's genes, is a caregiver, is married to the genetic father, is one generation older than the child, and is the legal guardian.&lt;ref name=Lakoff&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|author=Lakoff, George|pages=82–83, 70|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any one of the above conditions might not be met: for instance, a "single mother" does not need to be married, and a "surrogate mother" does not necessarily provide nurturance. When these aspects collectively cluster together, they form a prototypical case of what it means to be a mother, but nevertheless they fail to outline the category crisply. Variations upon the central meaning are established by convention by the community of language users.

For Lakoff, prototype effects can be explained in large part due to the effects of [[idealized cognitive model]]s. That is, domains are organized with an ideal notion of the world that may or may not fit reality. For example, the word "bachelor" is commonly defined as "unmarried adult male". However, this concept has been created with a particular ideal of what a bachelor is like: an adult, uncelibate, independent, socialized, and promiscuous. Reality might either strain the expectations of the concept, or create false positives. That is, people typically want to widen the meaning of "bachelor" to include exceptions like "a sexually active seventeen-year-old who lives alone and owns his own firm" (not technically an adult but seemingly still a bachelor), and this can be considered a kind of straining of the definition. Moreover, speakers would tend to want to exclude from the concept of ''bachelor'' certain false positives, such as those adult unmarried males that don't bear much resemblance to the ideal: i.e., the Pope, or Tarzan.&lt;ref name=Lakoff /&gt; Prototype effects may also be explained as a function of either [[basic-level categorization]] and typicality, closeness to an ideal, or stereotyping.

So viewed, prototype theory seems to give an account of category structure. However, there are a number of criticisms of this interpretation of the data. Indeed, Rosch and Lakoff, themselves chief advocates of prototype theory, have emphasized in their later works that the findings of prototype theory do not necessarily tell us anything about category structure. Some theorists in the cognitive semantics tradition have challenged both classical and prototype accounts of category structure by proposing the dynamic construal account, where category structure is always created "on-line"—and so, that categories have no structure outside of the context of use.

=== Mental spaces===
{{Main|Mental space}}
[[File:Prop-attitudes-example.gif|thumb|250px|right|Propositional attitudes in Fodor's presentation of truth-conditional semantics]]

In traditional semantics, the meaning of a sentence is the situation it represents, and the situation can be described in terms of the possible world that it would be true of. Moreover, sentence meanings may be dependent upon [[propositional attitude]]s: those features that are relative to someone's beliefs, desires, and mental states. The role of propositional attitudes in truth-conditional semantics is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy|author=Bunnin, Nicholas and E. P. Tsui-James|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by at least one line of argument, truth-conditional semantics seems to be able to capture the meaning of belief-sentences like "Frank believes that the [[Red Sox]] will win the next game" by appealing to propositional attitudes. The meaning of the overall proposition is described as a set of abstract conditions, wherein Frank holds a certain propositional attitude, and the attitude is itself a relationship between Frank and a particular proposition; and this proposition is the possible world where the Red Sox win the next game.&lt;ref name=Fodor&gt;{{cite book|title=Propositional Attitudes|author=Fodor, Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, many theorists have grown dissatisfied with the inelegance and dubious ontology behind possible-worlds semantics. An alternative can be found in the work of [[Gilles Fauconnier]]. For Fauconnier, the meaning of a sentence can be derived from "mental spaces". Mental spaces are cognitive structures entirely in the minds of interlocutors. In his account, there are two kinds of mental space. The ''base space'' is used to describe reality (as it is understood by both interlocutors). ''Space builders'' (or ''built space'') are those mental spaces that go beyond reality by addressing possible worlds, along with temporal expressions, fictional constructs, games, and so on.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; Additionally, Fauconnier semantics distinguishes between ''roles'' and ''values''. A semantic role is understood to be description of a category, while values are the instances that make up the category. (In this sense, the role-value distinction is a special case of the [[type-token distinction]].) 

Fauconnier argues that curious semantic constructions can be explained handily by the above apparatus. Take the following sentence:

# In 1929, the lady with white hair was blonde.

The semanticist must construct an explanation for the obvious fact that the above sentence is not contradictory. Fauconnier constructs his analysis by observing that there are two mental spaces (the present-space and the 1929-space). His ''access principle'' supposes that "a value in one space can be described by the role its counterpart in another space has, even if that role is invalid for the value in the first space".&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; So, to use the example above, the value in 1929-space is ''the blonde'', while she is being described with the role of ''the lady with white hair'' in present-day space.

== Conceptualization and construal ==
{{Main|Construal}}

As we have seen, cognitive semantics gives a treatment of issues in the construction of meaning both at the level of the sentence and the level of the lexeme in terms of the structure of concepts. However, it is not entirely clear what cognitive processes are at work in these accounts. Moreover, it is not clear how we might go about explaining the ways that concepts are actively employed in conversation. It appears to be the case that, if our project is to look at ''how'' linguistic strings convey different semantic content, we must first catalogue ''what'' cognitive processes are being used to do it. Researchers can satisfy both requirements by attending to the ''construal operations'' involved in language processing—that is to say, by investigating the ways that people ''structure their experiences'' through language.

Language is full of conventions that allow for subtle and nuanced conveyances of experience. To use an example that is readily at hand, framing is all-pervasive, and it may extend across the full breadth of linguistic data, extending from the most complex utterances, to tone, to word choice, to expressions derived from the composition of [[morpheme]]s. Another example is ''[[Image schema|image-schemata]]'', which are ways that we structure and understand the elements of our experience driven by any given sense.

According to linguists [[William Croft (linguist)|William Croft]] and [[D. Alan Cruse]], there are four broad cognitive abilities that play an active part in the construction of construals. They are: attention/[[salience (language)|salience]], [[judgment]]/comparison, [[situatedness]], and constitution/[[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]].&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; Each general category contains a number of subprocesses, each of which helps to explain the ways we encode experience into language in some unique way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6704">The '''Council on Social Work Education''' (CSWE) is a nonprofit national association representing more than 2,500 individual members, as well as graduate and undergraduate programs of professional social work education. Founded in 1952, this partnership of educational and professional institutions, social welfare agencies, and private citizens is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation as the sole accrediting agency for social work education in this country.

== History ==

The Summer School of Philanthropy was founded in 1898 by the Charity Organization Society of New York and was soon followed by additional training schools for social workers in Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Philadelphia. In 1919 the Association of Training Schools for Professional Social Workers was established (later the American Association of Schools of Social Work, or AASSW). It established formal accrediting procedures in 1932, although the American Association of Medical Social Workers and the American Association of Psychiatric Social Workers had accrediting processes in place for their particular specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1953|volume=1|number=2|page=1|title=[Accrediting] historical development|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 AASSW's move to limit its membership to graduate schools caused state higher education institutions to form the National Association of Schools of Social Administration (NASSA). NASSA representatives felt that social worker shortages demanded a more generalist approach to social work education. The two systems, however, frustrated the education community and resulted in the removal of accreditation authority from both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M. J.|last=Monti|year=2002|volume=50|number=2|pages=12–15|title=50th anniversary: Assessing council history and future|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move led AASSW, NASSA, and others to establish the National Council on Social Work Education in 1946. This group studied the issues and produced ''Social Work Education in the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollis|first1=E. V.|last2=Taylor|first2=A. L.|year=1951|title=Social work education in the United States|location=New York, NY|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report recommended that a sole organization be founded that would permit the many elements within the social work profession to participate in setting and maintaining accreditation criteria. Thus, AASSW and NASSA were dissolved, and CSWE was born in January 1952 with the following statement of purpose: “to promote the development of sound programs of social work education in the United States, its territories and possessions, and Canada”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendall|first=K. A.|year=2002|title=Council on Social Work Education: Its antecedents and first twenty years|location=Alexandria, Virginia|publisher=Council on Social Work Education|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen R. Wright, dean of the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, became CSWE’s first president, and Katherine A. Kendall, who had worked for the Children’s Bureau, the United Nations, and AASSW, was appointed CSWE’s executive secretary.

In the beginning CSWE accredited only master’s programs in social work, because a perception existed—although it was not universally supported—that preparation for professional social work practice was the province of master’s programs. CSWE also accredited Canadian master’s of social work programs until the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (now known as the Canadian Association for Social Work Education) took over accreditation of those programs in 1970. However, CSWE continued to accredit Canadian MSW programs on request until 1983.

In October 1961 the CSWE board adopted Social Welfare Content in Undergraduate Education as an aid to higher education institutions that wished to develop such programs. In 1973, CSWE issued accreditation standards covering content in the social work curriculum, staffing, and organization of social welfare programs at the undergraduate level, and in 1974, the National Commission on Accrediting formally authorized CSWE to accredit baccalaureate social work programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1973|volume=21|number=3|pages=13–16|title=Standards for the accreditation of baccalaureate degree programs in social work.|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1974|volume=22|number=2|page=1|title=NCA and USOE approve move to baccalaureate program accreditation|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; It issued a revised curriculum policy statement in 1982 that included curriculum policy for BSW programs (CSWE, 1982). The CSWE Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards were last revised in 2008. Because CSWE’s focus has been on the quality of education for individuals intending to engage in professional social work practice, it never has accredited social work programs at the associate’s or doctoral level.

The CSWE is the only organization that provides accreditation for all online CSWE programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-schools.html|title=Online MSW Programs: 2018's Full List of CSWE Accredited Schools|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was originally based in New York City, moving to Washington, DC, in 1984 and to Alexandria, Virginia, in 1990.

==Conferences==
In September 2013, Darla Coffey, CSWE President, organized the first White House Briefing for Social Work Education coordinated through the [[Office of Public Liaison|White House Office of Public Engagement]]. Presentations were given by federal officials from the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6717">'''Diauxie''' is a Greek word coined by [[Jacques Monod]] to mean two growth phases. The word is used in English in [[cell biology]] to describe the growth phases of a [[microorganism]] in [[batch culture]] as it [[metabolism|metabolizes]] a mixture of two sugars. Rather than metabolizing the two available sugars simultaneously, microbial cells commonly consume them in a sequential pattern, resulting in two separate growth phases.

==Growth phases== 
[[File:Monod's Diauxic growth.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Monod's original results on Diauxie. Time in hours is plotted on the horizontal axis. Optical density (equivalent to cell concentration) is plotted on the vertical axis.]]

[[Jacques Monod]] discovered diauxic growth in 1941 during his experiments with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''.   While growing these bacteria on various combination of sugars during his doctoral thesis research, Monod observed that often two distinct growth phases are clearly visible in batch culture, as seen in Figure 1.

During the first phase, cells preferentially metabolize the sugar on which it can grow faster (often [[glucose]] but not always). Only after the first sugar has been exhausted do the cells switch to the second. At the time of the "diauxic shift", there is often a lag period during which cells produce the [[enzymes]] needed to metabolize the second sugar.

Monod later put aside his work on diauxic growth and focused on the [[lac operon|''lac'' operon]] model of [[gene expression]], which led to a Nobel prize.

Diauxie occurs because organisms use [[operons]] or multiple sets of [[genes]] to control differently the expression of enzymes needed to metabolize the different nutrients or sugars they encounter. If an organism allocates its energy and other resources (e.g. amino acids) to synthesize enzymes needed to metabolize a sugar that can only support a slower growth rate and not use all or most of its available resources to synthesize the enzymes that metabolize a different sugar providing a faster growth rate, such an organism will be at a reproductive disadvantage compared to those that choose to grow on the faster growth supporting sugar. Through [[evolution]], organisms have developed the ability to regulate their genetic control mechanisms so as to only express those genes resulting in the fastest growth rate. For example, when grown in the presence of both glucose and maltose, ''[[Lactococcus lactis]]'' will produce enzymes to metabolize glucose first, altering its gene expression to use maltose only after the supply of glucose has been exhausted.

In the case of the baker's or brewer's [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' growing on glucose with plenty of aeration, the diauxic growth pattern is commonly observed in batch culture.  During the first growth phase, when there is plenty of glucose and oxygen available, the yeast cells prefer [[glucose]] [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to [[aerobic respiration]] even though aerobic respiration is  the more efficient pathway to grow on glucose.  Contrary to the more commonly invoked [[Pasteur effect]], this phenomenon of preferring the faster growth supporting fermentation is closer to the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]] observed in faster growing tumors. The intracellular genetic regulatory mechanisms have evolved to enforce this choice, as fermentation provides a faster growth rate for the yeast cells than the aerobic respiration of glucose.  After glucose is depleted, the fermentative product ethanol is oxidised in a noticeably slower second growth phase, if oxygen is available.

== Proposed mechanism ==
In the 1940s, Monod hypothesized that a single enzyme could adapt to metabolize different sugars. It took 15 years of further work to show that this was incorrect. During his work on the [[lac operon]] of ''E. coli'', [[Joshua Lederberg]] isolated [[β-galactosidase]] and found it in greater quantities in colonies grown on lactose compared to other sugars. [[Melvin Cohn]] in Monod's lab at the Pasteur Institute then found that β-galactosides induced enzyme activity. The idea of enzyme adaptation was thus replaced with the concept of [[enzyme induction]], in which a molecule induces expression of a gene or operon, often by binding to a repressor protein and preventing it from attaching to the operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Mulligan|first = Martin|title = Induction|url=https://www.mun.ca/biochem/courses/4103/topics/induction.html|accessdate = 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the bacterial diauxic shift from glucose to lactose metabolism, a proposed mechanism suggested that glucose initially inhibits the ability of the enzyme [[adenylate cyclase]] to synthesize [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP). cAMP, in turn, is required for the [[Catabolite Activator Protein|catabolite activator protein]] (CAP) to bind to DNA and activate the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the lac operon, which includes genes necessary for lactose metabolism. The presence of allolactose, a metabolic product of lactose, is sensed through the activity of the [[lac repressor]], which inhibits transcription of the lac operon until lactose is present. Thus, if glucose is present, cAMP levels remain low, so CAP is unable to activate transcription of the lac operon, regardless of the presence or absence of lactose. Upon the exhaustion of the glucose supply, cAMP levels rise, allowing CAP to activate the genes necessary for the metabolism of other food sources, including lactose if it is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Brown|first = T.A.|title = Transient Changes in Gene Activity|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=genomes.section.7882|accessdate = 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research however suggests that the cAMP model is not correct in this instance since cAMP levels remain identical under glucose and lactose growth conditions, and a different model has been proposed and it suggests that the lactose-glucose diauxie in ''E. coli'' may be caused mainly by inducer exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Current Opinion in Microbiology |year=1999 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=195–201 |title= Carbon catabolite repression in bacteria |author=Stülke J, Hillen W. |pmid= 10322165 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5274(99)80034-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this model, glucose transport via the [[PEP group translocation|EIIA&lt;sup&gt;Glc&lt;/sup&gt;]] shuts down lactose permease when glucose is being transported into the cell, so lactose is not transported into cell and used. While the cAMP/CAP mechanism may not play a role in the glucose/lactose diauxie, it is a suggested mechanism for other diauxie .

{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}
The bibliographical definition of an '''edition''' includes all copies of a [[book]] printed “from substantially the same setting of [[typesetting|type]],” including all minor [[typography|typographical]] variants.

The numbering of book editions is a special case of the wider field of [[revision control]]. The traditional conventions for numbering book editions evolved spontaneously for several centuries before any greater [[applied science]] of revision control became important to humanity, which did not occur until the era of widespread [[computing]] had arrived (when [[software]] and [[electronic publishing]] came into existence). The old and new aspects of book edition numbering (from before and since the advent of computing) are discussed below. 

=={{anchor|first}} First edition &lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt;==
{{Redirect|First edition}}
[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|thumb|rioght|180px|Title-page illustration by [[Hammatt Billings]] for ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', First Edition: Boston: [[John P. Jewett]] and Company, 1852]]

According to the definition of ''edition'' above, a book printed today, by the same [[publisher]], and from the same type as when it was first published, is still the ''first edition'' of that book to a [[bibliographer]]. However, [[book collector]]s generally use the term ''first edition'' to mean specifically the first [[#Print run|print run]] of the first edition (aka "first edition, first impression"). Since World War II, books often include a number line ([[printer's key]]) that indicates the print run.

A "first edition" per se is not a valuable collectible book. A popular work may be published and reprinted over time by many publishers, and in a variety of formats. There will be a first edition of each, which the publisher may cite on the copyright page, such as: "First mass market paperback edition". The first edition of a facsimile reprint is the reprint publisher's first edition, but not the first edition of the work itself.

The Independent Online Booksellers Association has a [http://www.ioba.org/pages/resources/first-edition-primer/ A First Edition Primer ] which discusses several aspects of identifying first editions including publishing and specific publishers way of designating first editions.

===Bibliographical definition===
The classic explanation of edition was given by [[Fredson Bowers]] in ''Principles of Bibliographical Description'' (1949). Bowers wrote that an edition is “the whole number of copies printed at any time or times from substantially the same setting of type-pages,” including “all issues and variant states existing within its basic type-setting, as well as all impressions.”

Publishers often use the same typesetting for the [[hardcover]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] versions of a book. These books have different covers, the [[title page]] and copyright page may differ, and the page margin sizes may differ (same ''type area'', smaller ''trim''), but to a bibliographer they are the same edition.

From time to time, readers may observe an error in the text (or, in the days of metal type, a piece of broken type), and report these to the publisher. The publisher typically keeps these "reprint corrections" in a file pending demand for a new print run of the edition, and before the new run is printed, they will be entered.

The method of entry, obviously, depends on the method of typesetting. For [[Letterpress printing|letterpress metal]], it typically meant resetting a few characters or a line or two. For [[Linotype machine|linotype]], it meant casting a new line for any line with a change in it. With film, it involved cutting out a bit of the film and inserting a new bit. In an electronic file, it means entering the changes digitally.

Such minor changes do not constitute a new edition, but introduce typographical variations within an edition, which are of interest to collectors.

===Collectors' definition===
[[File:Tristram Shandy First edition spines.jpg|thumb|First editions of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]] ]]
A common complaint of book collectors is that the bibliographer's definition is used in a book-collecting context. For example, [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' {{asof|2016|lc=y}} remains in print in hardcover. The type is the same as the 1951 first printing, therefore all hardcover copies are, for the bibliographer, the first edition. Collectors would use the term for the first printing only.

First edition most often refers to the first commercial publication of a work between its own covers, even if it was first printed in a periodical: the complete text of [[Ernest Hemingway]]’s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' appeared in the September 1, 1952 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', yet the generally accepted “first” edition is the hardcover book [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]’s published on September 8, 1952.

The term "first trade edition," refers to the earliest edition of a book offered for sale to the general public in book stores. For example, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' was published in two variant forms. A "Sustainers' Edition", published by the Jungle Publishing Company, was sent to subscribers who had advanced funds to Sinclair. The first trade edition was published by [[Doubleday, Page]] to be sold in bookstores.

Many book collectors place maximum value on the earliest bound copies of a book—promotional [[advance copy|advance copies]], bound galleys, uncorrected proofs, and advance reading copies sent by publishers to book reviewers and [[bookstore|booksellers]]. It is true that these are rarer than the production copies; but given that these were not printed from a different setting of type (just the opposite; the main purpose of galleys and proofs is to double-check the typeset matter that will be used for production), they are not different editions.

===Publishers' definitions===
Publishers use "first edition" according to their own purposes, and consequently among them the designation is used very inconsistently. The "first edition" of a trade book may be the first iteration of the work printed by the publisher in question or the first iteration of the work that includes a specific set of illustrations or editorial commentary.

Publishers of non-fiction, academic works, and [[textbook]]s generally distinguish between revisions of the text of the work, by typically citing the dates of the first and latest editions of the work in the copyright page. Exceptions to this [[rule of thumb]] include denominating as a "second edition" a new textbook that has a different format, title, and/or author(s) because a previous textbook that shares only the same subject matter as the "second edition" is considered the first edition. The reason for this stretch of the definition is often for the short-term marketing advantage of the new textbook, because, although first editions are often considered more valuable than later editions to book collectors, being a subsequent edition of a previous textbook gives the impression that the textbook denominated as a subsequent edition is more authoritative.

==Other types of editions==

=== Revised edition ===
Publishers sometimes denominate a new iteration of a work a "revised edition" or the "(N)th edition, revised" when the previous iteration has been editorially revised or updated yet the author or publisher does not want to denominate it the "(N+1)th edition" ("N" being the number of the previous edition) for some subjective reason. Conversely, a new iteration of a work that is not substantially different may be denominated a "new edition" or the "(N+1)th edition".

The qualitative difference between a "revised edition" and a "new edition" is subjective. This is analogous to the way that software publishers may denominate an iteration "version 3.7" and the subsequent updated iteration "version 4" instead of "version 3.8". The subjective judgment of the ''degree'' of [[Software versioning#Change significance|the significance of the change]] made with the new iteration or the perceived marketing advantage of designating the new iteration as a specific number determines how the new iteration is numbered.

Therefore, the designation "revised edition" does not designate any quality or quantity of revision with certainty.

===Revised and updated edition===
When a non-fiction book is first published it sometimes instigates more research on its subject. The author may determine that new information justifies the revision of the book. A new iteration of the book would be published as a new edition, which may be denominated a "revised and updated edition". However, as with the denomination of "revised edition", the use of "revised and updated edition" manifests only the subjective choice of the publisher, which may be different from the publisher of a previous "revised edition" of the same work.

=== Co-edition &lt;!-- Section linked from Horus Heresy (novels) --&gt; ===
The basic definition of a ''co-edition'' is when two publishing houses publish the same edition of a book (or equivalent versions of an edition, for example, translated versions), simultaneously or near-simultaneously, usually in different countries. English and American editions may [[American and British English spelling differences|differ in spelling]], and they [[list of works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States|sometimes have different titles]]. Some examples:
* An English-language edition, from the same plates, films, or files, may be published in different anglophone countries by different publishing companies. For example, Arms &amp; Armour Press in the UK and Stackpole Books in the U.S. published co-editions of various monographs on military matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leventhal|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A French-language novel published in France this year by a French publisher could become an English-language translation published in the U.S. next year by a U.S. publisher.

The logic of co-editions has often been to use the existing distribution systems of the different publishers in each country rather than establishing new distribution systems.

Advancing [[Information technology|IT]] and the globalization of publishing have been blurring the lines of what ''co-edition'' means. For example, anything published online is effectively published worldwide. Also, large multinational publishers now have existing distribution systems for their hardcopy books in many countries, so they don't need to partner with other companies. They may issue a book under a different imprint for each country, but the imprints are parts of the same parent corporation. The actual manufacturing of the books may be done in China regardless of where the copies will be sold.

=== e-dition ===
The term ''e-dition'', a play on the [[Internet-related prefixes#"E-"|''e-''for-electronic prefix]], has been used by various publishers to refer to various ideas, which include:
* The hardcopy book's content posted online, fully searchable
* Supplemental online-only content for buyers of the hardcopy book
* Online-only publishing (no hardcopy distribution)
* Proprietary-format digital publication ([[e-book]]s) for use in specialized hardware for reading the book ([[e-book reader]]s)

===Library edition===
A library edition may appear to be the same as copies appearing in shops and almost certainly uses the same setting. However, the binding and hinges are made extra strong to allow for the greater wear and tear in library books. This is analogous to the "police and taxi" packages for automobiles, in which heavier brakes and other upgrades are made to withstand harsher-than-standard use and longer [[duty cycle]]s.

===Book club edition===
A popular book is sometimes re-issued under the imprint of a [[Book sales club|book club]]. Often it is a new setting and with cheaper paper and binding. Any photographic illustrations in the original are either absent or reduced in number. Book club editions are sold to members at a good discount compared with the original issue price.

===Cheap edition===
After a book has exhausted the market at the high original price a publisher may issue a cheap edition themselves or sell the rights on to another publisher who will produce the book. A cheap edition typically uses a low-cost paper and is a paperback but they can be hardback. Also typically the size of the font is reduced to fit more words on a page to reduce the overall cost of the book. Naturally, for a cheap edition the author will receive a lower royalty but that may be compensated for by a greater volume of sales.

===Colonial edition===

During the peak of the [[British Empire]], cheap editions of novels published in Britain would often be produced for sale in the colonies before other editions of the books were sold. The rationale was that books took a long time to export to the colonies, that readership in those settlements was avid, and that books were an effective means to disseminate British values. Australia was by far the largest consumer of colonial editions. [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] (London) published the largest number of colonial edition titles. They began in 1843 and persisted (in terms of pricing and trade) until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Johanson, ''A study of colonial editions in Australia, 1843-1972''. Elibank Press, Wellington, New Zealand. {{ISBN|0958349630}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cadet edition===
A cadet edition is a cut down version of a book which is more simply written. It is intended for young readers rather than adults.

===Large print edition===
These editions are typically library editions but the font size of the text is much larger than usual so that persons with poor eyesight (often older persons) can more easily read the book. The [[large print]] books tend to be of a uniform size.

===Critical edition===
A critical edition is a scholarly publication, containing commentary, critique, and sometimes a full developmental history of the work from all available sources.

== Printing, print run, impression, et cetera ==
&lt;!-- This heading is the target of multiple anchor-linked redirects: [[Print run]], [[Printing run]], [[Impression (book)]], [[Impression (books)]], [[Impression (publishing)]], and [[Press run]]. --&gt;
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Krishnamurti's Notebook#Publication history]] [[The First and Last Freedom#Publication history]] ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
A batch of identical copies of an iteration/edition of a work that is printed in the same, single execution of the production set-up is denominated a "print run", "printing run", "printing", "impression", or "press run" according to the subjective choice of the publisher. All these denominations denote the action of applying pressure to paper in order to produce the book, and therefore are interchangeable. One edition of a work may have any number of printings, e. g. first edition, first impression; first edition, second impression; and second edition, first impression. Books that sell poorly may have only one. Very successful books may have 50 or more. If present, the [[printer's key]] in the copyright page of a book can be used to identify the number of the printing in which it was produced. In [[printmaking]], however, an "impression" only denotes an individual copy of a specific printing of the work.

A publisher hopes to recoup a large amount of the initial costs of publishing a book from the sale of the copies/impressions produced in the first printing of the book. A variety of commercial and logistic factors are thus considered in deciding the number of books to be produced in a specific printing and their individual price.

Demand for additional printings after the first is always hoped for, because they increase a book's profitability. Once the [[fixed costs]] of developing, editing, typesetting, etc. have been covered by the revenue of the first sales, any additional revenue tends to add to the profit margin, minus, of course, the costs of the additional materials, printing, binding, and distribution.

Sometimes a printing will be unsatisfactory for various reasons, especially printings of artistic and photography books in which the quality of reproduction is paramount. A defective printing is usually destroyed by being [[Pulping|pulped]], yet occasionally a defective printing is shipped to a distant overseas market and there sold cheaply, contingent on the costs of shipping.

If sales of a book do not meet expectations, the remaining stock of a printing will be [[Remaindered book|remaindered]]. When all copies/impressions of a printing are sold, the book is either [[reprint]]ed or becomes [[out of print]]. Some [[print on demand]] and [[e-book]] publishers keep all their books perpetually "in print".

A "second" is an imperfect or damaged copy/impression which is set aside from the other copies/impressions of a printing. These will usually have their [[dust jacket]] clipped or marked in some way to designate their inferiority.

Sometimes readers may observe an error in the text of a book and report it to the publisher. The publisher usually records these '''reprint corrections''' in a file pending demand for a new printing, before which they are incorporated into the revised text. This is one of the factors that inserts the "substantially" into the definition of "substantially the same setting of type".

== Republication == &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Republication]] redirects here. --&gt;
Many commercially successful books have been republished, either by their original or other imprints. For this reason if a popular book is searched for in a large bookseller such as [[Amazon.com]] or a large library catalog such as WorldCat, often an array of different copyright years, publishers, editions, formats (hardcover, softcover, trade, and mass market), and so forth are observed. Because no universal authority or convention determines the exact distinction between a "reprinting" and "republishing" and whether a republishing is a different "edition", the denotation of such denominations is ambiguous, at least at first glance.

==Legal status==

===UK===
Since 1956, typographical arrangements of published editions are protected by copyright law. ''[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]'' defines a published edition to mean ''a published edition of the whole or any part of one or more literary, dramatic or musical works''.{{efn|Duration [[Directive (European Union)|Directive of the EU]] permits member states to create a publishers' right in critical and scientific works which have fallen into the [[public domain]].}}

It thus protects the publisher's investment in typesetting, as well as the processes of design and selection that are reflected in the appearance of the text.{{efn|See ''[[Newspaper Licensing Agency]] v. [[Marks &amp; Spencer]]'' [2000].}} It also covers modern editions of public domain works (such as the complete works of Shakespeare), and prohibits the reproduction of the layout (but not the work itself).

'''''Eisengarn''''', meaning "iron yarn" in English, is a light-reflecting, strong, waxed-cotton thread. It was invented and manufactured in Germany in the mid-19th century, but is now most well known for its use in cloth woven for the tubular-steel chairs designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] while he was a teacher at the [[Bauhaus]] design school.

The yarn is also known as '''''Glanzgarn''''' ('gloss' or 'glazed' yarn). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitlos-berlin.de/aktuelles/eisengarn-eine-material-geschichte zeitlos-berlin.de], ''Eisengarn – Eine Material Geschichte''. Retrieved 27 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Manufacture ==
Despite the name, there is no iron in ''eisengarn''. The name refers to its strength and metallic shine. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch and [[paraffin wax]] solution.

== History ==
[[File:Barmen (1870).jpg|thumb|Barmen (1870)]]
[[File:Netz.jpg|thumb|150px|Eisengarn string bag]]
The ''eisengarn'' manufacturing process was invented in the mid-19th century in a factory in [[Barmen]], now part of the city of [[Wuppertal]], east of the river [[Rhine]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

It was used as a sewing thread and for making lace, shoe laces, hat strings, ribbons, lining materials and in the cable industry.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The manufacture of the yarn gave a considerable boost to the textile industry of Barmen and the surrounding region. By 1875, the Wuppertal company Barthels &amp; Feldhoff employed more than 300 people in eisengarn production.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 1927 the weaver and textile designer [[Margaretha Reichardt]] (1907–1984), then a student at the Bauhaus design school, experimented and improved the quality of the thread and developed cloth and strapping material made from ''eisengarn'' for use on Marcel Breuer's tubular steel chairs, such as the [[Wassily Chair]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.de/en/past/people/students/margaretha-reichardt/ Bauhaus100.

[Kreis Weimarer Land/Angermuseum Erfurt]:[Erfurt], p19&lt;/ref&gt; 

Light-weight tubular steel seating was also used in aircraft seating in the 1930s and Reichardt's improved version of ''eisengarn'' was used as a covering for the seats.&lt;ref&gt;Stutterheim, Kerstin; Bolbrinker, Niels.

A more prosaic use for the strong eisengarn thread was, and still is, for making colourful [[String bag|string shopping bags]], which were popular in the former [[East Germany]], and are now an [[Ostalgie]] item.&lt;ref name=Tagesspiegel&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/geschichte/aus-der-mode-aus-dem-sinn/1501512.html Wiebrecht V., Skuppin, R.

]]
As a form of biological asymmetry, '''fluctuating asymmetry''' ('''FA'''), along with anti-symmetry and direction asymmetry, refers to small, random deviations away from perfect [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]].&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valen1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valen|first=Leigh Van|title=A Study of Fluctuating Asymmetry|journal=Evolution|date=June 1962|volume=16|issue=2|pages=125–142|jstor=2406192|doi=10.2307/2406192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fluctuating Asymmetry|last=Tomkins|first=J. L.|last2=Kotiaho|first2=J. S.|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Ltd.|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deviation from perfection is thought to reflect the genetic and environmental pressures experienced throughout development, with greater pressures resulting in higher levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref name="Valen1962" /&gt; Examples of FA in the human body include unequal sizes (asymmetry) of bilateral features in the face and body, such as left and right eyes, ears, wrists, [[breast]]s, [[testicle]]s, and thighs.

Research has exposed multiple factors that are associated with FA. As measuring FA can indicate developmental stability, it can also suggest the genetic fitness of an individual. This can further have an effect on mate attraction and sexual selection, as less asymmetry reflects greater developmental stability and subsequent fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Human [[Health|physical health]] is also associated with FA. For example, young men with greater FA report more medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA.&lt;ref name="Fluctuating asymmetry and physical health among young adults" /&gt; Multiple other factors can be linked to FA, such as intelligence&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and personality traits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Measurement ==
Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) can be measured by the equation: Mean FA = mean absolute value of left sides - mean absolute value of right sides.

The closer the mean value is to zero, the lower the levels of FA, indicating more symmetrical features. By taking many measurements of multiple traits per individual, this increases the accuracy in determining that individual's developmental stability. However, these traits must be chosen carefully, as different traits are affected by different selection pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patrice|first=D.|last2=Hingle|first2=A.|last3=Fowler|first3=K.|last4=Pomiankowski|first4=A.|date=1999|title=Measurement bias and fluctuating asymmetry estimates.|url=|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=57|issue=1|pages=251–253|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.0977|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This equation can further be used to study the distribution of asymmetries at population levels, to distinguish between traits that show FA, directional asymmetry, and anti-symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swaddle|first=J. P.|date=2003|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, animal behaviour, and evolution.|url=|journal=Advances in the study of behaviour.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=R.|last2=Strobeck|first2=C.|date=1992|title=Fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of developmental stability: Implications of non-normal distributions and power of statistical tests.|url=|journal=Acta Zoologica Fennica|pages=57–72|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of FA around a mean point of zero suggests that FA is not an adaptive trait, where symmetry is ideal. Directional asymmetry of traits can be distinguished by showing significantly biased measurements towards traits being larger on either the left or right sides, for example, human [[testicle]]s (where the right is more commonly larger), or handedness (85% are right handed, 15% are left handed). Anti-symmetry can be distinguished by the bimodal distributions, due to some adaptive functions.

== Causes ==
Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often considered to be the product of [[Developmental biology|developmental]] stress and instability, caused by both genetic and environmental stressors. The notion that FA is a result of genetic and environmental factors is supported by [[C. H. Waddington|Waddington's]] notion of [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]], which implies that FA is a measure of the [[genome|genome's]] ability to successfully buffer development to achieve a normal [[phenotype]] under imperfect environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WADDINGTON|first=C. H.|title=Canalization of Development and the Inheritance of Acquired Characters|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/150563a0|journal=Nature|volume=150|issue=3811|pages=563–565|doi=10.1038/150563a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various factors causing developmental instability and FA include [[infection]]s, [[mutation]]s, and [[toxin]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolutionary biology of human female sexuality|last=Thornhill, Gangestad|first=Randy, Steven W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0195340981|location=Oxford, England|pages=162–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic factors ===
Research on [[twin]]s suggests that there are genetic influences on FA,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Wendy|last2=Segal|first2=Nancy L.|last3=Bouchard Jr.|first3=Thomas J.|date=2008-05-01|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and general intelligence: No genetic or phenotypic association|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000967|journal=Intelligence|volume=36|issue=3|pages=279–288|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased levels of mutations and perturbations is also linked to greater asymmetry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

FA may also result from a lack of genetic immunity to diseases, as those with higher FA show less effective immune responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is further supported by evidence showing an association between FA and the number of respiratory infections experienced by an individual, such that those with higher levels of FA experience more infections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Increased prevalence of parasites and diseases in an organism is also seen more in individuals with greater levels of FA.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fink|first=Bernhard|last2=Neave|first2=Nick|last3=Manning|first3=John T.|last4=Grammer|first4=Karl|date=2006-08-01|title=Facial symmetry and judgements of attractiveness, health and personality|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000973|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=3|pages=491–499|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the research in this field is predominantly correlational, so caution must be taken when inferring causation. For example, rather than a lack of immunity causing FA, FA may weaken the immune responses of an organism, or there may be another factor involved.

There is some speculation that [[inbreeding]] contributes towards FA. One study on young Turkish males demonstrated that, although inbred individuals show more asymmetry in observed bilateral traits, the differences were not significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özener|first=Bariş|date=2010-07-01|title=Effect of inbreeding depression on growth and fluctuating asymmetry in Turkish young males|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.21046/abstract|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=557–562|doi=10.1002/ajhb.21046|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, ant colonies created by an inbreeding queen do not show significantly higher FA than those produced by a non-inbreeding queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Laurent|last2=Passera|first2=Luc|date=1993-09-01|title=Incest avoidance, fluctuating asymmetry, and the consequences of inbreeding in Iridomyrmex humilis, an ant with multiple queen colonies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00216600|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=191–199|doi=10.1007/BF00216600|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental factors ===
Multiple sources provide information on environmental factors that are correlated with FA. A meta-analysis of related studies suggests that FA is an appropriate marker of environmental stress during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beasley|first=De Anna E.|last2=Bonisoli-Alquati|first2=Andrea|last3=Mousseau|first3=Timothy A.|date=2013-07-01|title=The use of fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of environmentally induced developmental instability: A meta-analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X13000988|journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=30|pages=218–226|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence suggests that [[poverty]] and [[Malnutrition|lack of food]] during development may contribute to greater levels of FA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ozener|first=Bariş|date=2011-12-01|title=Does urban poverty increase body fluctuating asymmetry?|journal=Collegium Antropologicum|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1001–1005|issn=0350-6134|pmid=22397230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallard|first=Samantha T.|last2=Barnard|first2=C. J.|date=2004-02-01|title=Food stress, fluctuating asymmetry and reproductive performance in the gryllid crickets Gryllus bimaculatus and Gryllodes sigillatus|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853904322890825|journal=Behaviour|volume=141|issue=2|pages=219–232|doi=10.1163/156853904322890825|issn=1568-539X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infection|Infectious diseases]] can also lead to FA, as studies have repeatedly shown that those with higher FA report more infections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=Anders Pape|date=2006-03-01|title=A review of developmental instability, parasitism and disease: Infection, genetics and evolution|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713480500064X|journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution|volume=6|issue=2|pages=133–140|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2005.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, this association between levels of FA and infections may be due to a lack of immunity to diseases, as mentioned earlier (see 'Genetic factors'). Fluctuating asymmetry in human males is also seen to positively correlate with levels of [[oxidative stress]]. This process occurs when an organism creates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to ROS-neutralising antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gangestad|first=Steven W.|last2=Merriman|first2=Leslie A.|last3=Emery Thompson|first3=Melissa|date=2010-12-01|title=Men’s oxidative stress, fluctuating asymmetry and physical attractiveness|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210003416|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=80|issue=6|pages=1005–1013|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative stress may mediate the association seen between high FA and infection amounts during development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Toxins and poisons are considered to increase FA. [[Morning sickness|Pregnancy sickness]] is argued to be an [[adaptation]] for avoiding toxins during [[Prenatal development|foetal development]]. Research has reported that when a mother has no sickness or a sickness that extends beyond week 12 of gestation, the offspring shows higher FA (as demonstrated by measuring thigh circumferences). This suggests that when a mother fails to expel environmental toxins, this creates stress and developmental instability for the foetus, later leading to increased asymmetry in that individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Devendra|last2=Rosen|first2=Valerie C.|title=Effects of maternal body morphology, morning sickness, gestational diabetes and hypertension on fluctuating asymmetry in young women|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513801000824|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|issue=6|pages=373–384|doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(01)00082-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater exposure to [[pollution]] may also be a fundamental cause of FA. Research on skull characteristics of [[Grey seal|Baltic grey seals]] (''Halichoerus grypus'') demonstrated that those born after 1960 (marking an increase in environmental pollution) had increased levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zakharov|first=Vladmir M.|last2=Yablokov|first2=Alexay V.|date=1990-01-01|title=Skull Asymmetry in the Baltic Grey Seal: Effects of Environmental Pollution|journal=Ambio|volume=19|issue=5|pages=266–269|jstor=4313708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Greater white-toothed shrew|shrews]] (''Crocidura russula)'' from more polluted areas show higher levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sánchez-Chardi|first=Alejandro|last2=García-Pando|first2=Marián|last3=López-Fuster|first3=María José|date=2013-10-01|title=Chronic exposure to environmental stressors induces fluctuating asymmetry in shrews inhabiting protected Mediterranean sites|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513008023|journal=Chemosphere|volume=93|issue=6|pages=916–923|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.056|pmid=23800592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radioactive contamination may also increase FA levels, as [[Yellow-necked mouse|mice]] (''Apodemus flavicollis'') living closer to the failed [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl reactor]] show greater asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oleksyk|first=Taras K|last2=Novak|first2=James M|last3=Purdue|first3=James R|last4=Gashchak|first4=Sergiy P|last5=Smith|first5=Michael H|date=2004-01-01|title=High levels of fluctuating asymmetry in populations of Apodemus flavicollis from the most contaminated areas in Chornobyl|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X03002224|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2003.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developmental stability ==
Developmental stability is achieved when an organism is able to withstand genetic and environmental stress, to display the bilaterally symmetrical traits determined by its developmentally programmed phenotype.&lt;ref name="Valen1962" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markow|first=Therese Ann|date=1995-01-01|title=Evolutionary Ecology and Developmental Instability|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.000541|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=40|issue=1|pages=105–120|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.000541|pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; To measure an individual's developmental stability, the FA measurements of 10 traits are added together, including ear width, elbows, ankles, wrists, feet, length of ears and fingers. This is achieved by: (L - R)trait 1 + (L - R)trait 2 + ......(L - R)trait 10. This provides a good overall measure of body FA, as every individual has some features that are not perfectly symmetrical.

Common environmental pressures leading to lower developmental stability include exposure to toxins, poison and infectious diseases, low food quality and malnutrition. Genetic pressures include spontaneous new mutations, and "bad genes" (genes that once had adaptive functions, but are being removed through evolutionary selection). A large fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and a low developmental stability suggests that an organism is unable to develop according to the ideal state of bilateral symmetry. The energy required for bilateral symmetry development is extremely high, making perfect bilateral symmetry rare. Energy is invested into survival in spite of the genetic and environmental pressures, before making bilaterally symmetrical traits. Research has also revealed links between FA and depression, genetic or environmental stress and measures of mate quality for sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = J.

==Health==

===Susceptibility to diseases===

Research has linked higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) to poorer outcomes in some domains of physical health in humans.

For example, studies have found that higher levels of facial asymmetry are associated with poorer overall health in female rhesus macaques (''Macaca mulatta''),&lt;ref name="FA and health in female macaques"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Anthony C.|last2=Paukner|first2=Annika|last3=Woodward|first3=Ruth A.|last4=Suomi|first4=Stephen J.|title=Facial asymmetry is negatively related to condition in female macaque monkeys|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=21 July 2012|volume=66|issue=9|pages=1311–1318|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1386-4|url=http://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/2748861961/fmt/pi/rep/NONE?hl=&amp;cit%3Aauth=Little%2C+Anthony+C%3BPaukner%2C+Annika%3BWoodward%2C+Ruth+A%3BSuomi%2C+Stephen+J&amp;cit%3Atitle=Facial+asymmetry+is+negatively+related+to+condition+in+female+macaque+monkeys&amp;cit%3Apub=Behavioral+Ecology+and+Sociobiology&amp;cit%3Avol=66&amp;cit%3Aiss=9&amp;cit%3Apg=1311&amp;cit%3Adate=Sep+2012&amp;ic=true&amp;cit%3Aprod=PsycINFO&amp;_a=ChgyMDE2MDMzMDEyMTM1MzM3NjozMTAxNTASBTk1MDY0GgpPTkVfU0VBUkNIIg0yLjIxOC4xNzMuMTkzKgU1NDA1NTIKMTAzNzI3NTU1NDoNRG9jdW1lbnRJbWFnZUIBMFIGT25saW5lWgJGVGIDUEZUagoyMDEyLzA5LzAxcgoyMDEyLzA5LzMwegCCATJQLTEwMDcwMjUtMTQ4ODgtQ1VTVE9NRVItMTAwMDAxODQvMTAwMDAxNDctNDQ0NjUyN5IBBk9ubGluZcoBbE1vemlsbGEvNS4wIChXaW5kb3dzIE5UIDYuMzsgV09XNjQpIEFwcGxlV2ViS2l0LzUzNy4zNiAoS0hUTUwsIGxpa2UgR2Vja28pIENocm9tZS80OS4wLjI2MjMuODcgU2FmYXJpLzUzNy4zNtIBElNjaG9sYXJseSBKb3VybmFsc5oCB1ByZVBhaWSqAihPUzpFTVMtUGRmRG9jVmlld0Jhc2UtZ2V0TWVkaWFVcmxGb3JJdGVtygIPQXJ0aWNsZXxGZWF0dXJl0gIBWeICAPICAA%3D%3D&amp;_s=MAMCvAoYUz1EfxAJfVCgE6akFXY%3D|accessdate=30 March 2016|pmc=3649767}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that higher FA is also linked to more health issues in chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'').&lt;ref name="FA and health in chimpanzees"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sefcek|first1=Jon A.|last2=King|first2=James E.|title=Chimpanzee facial symmetry: A biometric measure of chimpanzee health.|journal=American Journal of Primatology|date=2007|volume=69|issue=11|pages=1257–1263|doi=10.1002/ajp.20426|pmid=17387675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between FA and health has also been investigated in non-primates. In three gazelle species (''Gazella cuvieri; Gazella dama; Gazella dorcas''), for instance, FA has been linked to a range of blood parameters associated with health in mammals, although the specific relevance of these blood parameters for these gazelle species was not examined.&lt;ref name="FA and blood parameters in gazelles"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuervo|first1=José Javier|last2=Dhaoui|first2=Mohamed|last3=Espeso|first3=Gerardo|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and blood parameters in three endangered gazelle species|journal=Mammalian Biology|date=July 2011|volume=76|issue=4|pages=498–505|doi=10.1016/j.mambio.2011.01.007|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1616504711000085/1-s2.0-S1616504711000085-main.pdf?_tid=fd3356e4-f67e-11e5-a5a0-00000aab0f26&amp;acdnat=1459346278_36c5ab2b6d055a31818b2842befb9983|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that, among Iberian red deer (''Cervus elaphus hispanicus''), higher FA was slightly negatively related to both antler size and overall body mass (traits thought to indicate overall condition). Antlers more involved in fighting were found to be more symmetrical than those not involved, and antler asymmetry at reproductive age was lower than in development or at post-reproductive age.&lt;ref name="FA and antler size/body mass"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mateos|first1=Concha|last2=Alarcos|first2=Susana|last3=Carranza|first3=Juan|last4=Sánchez-Prieto|first4=Cristina B.|last5=Valencia|first5=Juliana|title=Fluctuating asymmetry of red deer antlers negatively relates to individual condition and proximity to prime age|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=May 2008|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1629–1640|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.10.016}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

FA and health outcomes have been examined within insect populations. For instance, it has been found that Mediterranean field crickets (''Gryllus bimaculatus'') with higher levels of FA in three hind-limb traits have lower encapsulation rates, but do not differ from low-FA crickets in lytic activity (both are measures of immunocompetence).&lt;ref name="FA and immune function in field crickets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rantala|first1=Markus J.|last2=Ahtiainen|first2=Jari J.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and immune function in a field cricket.|journal=Oikos|date=December 2004|volume=107|issue=3|pages=479–484|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12776.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While research on the relationship between FA and longevity is sparse in humans, some studies using non-human populations have suggested an association between the symmetry of an organism and its lifespan. For instance, it has been found that flies whose wing veins showed more bilateral symmetry live longer than less symmetrical flies. This difference was greatest for male flies.&lt;ref name="Flies' symmetry and longevity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harshman|first1=Lawrence G|last2=Müller|first2=Hans-Georg|last3=Liu|first3=Xueli|last4=Wang|first4=Yue|last5=Carey|first5=James R|title=The symmetry of longevity|journal=Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences|date=October 2005|volume=60|issue=10|pages=1233–1237|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2611956/pdf/nihms47754.pdf|pmc=2611956|accessdate=19 February 2016|pmid=16282553|doi=10.1093/gerona/60.10.1233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual selection in non-human animals===
Many non-human animals have been shown to be able to distinguish between potential partners, based upon levels of FA. As with humans, lower levels of FA are seen in the most reproductively successful members of species. For instance, FA of male forewing length seem to have an important role in successful mating for many insect species, such as dark-wing damselflies and Japanese [[Mecoptera|scorpionflies]].  In the dark-winged [[damselfly]] (''Calopteryx maculate''), successfully mating male flies showed significantly lower levels of FA in their forewings than unsuccessful males,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Michelle L.|last2=Pruett-Jones|first2=Stephen|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, sexual selection, and survivorship in male dark-winged damselflies.|journal=Ethology|date=2002|volume=108|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1046/j.1439-0310.2002.00814.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while for Japanese scorpionflies, FA levels are a good predictor for the outcome of fights between males in that more symmetrical males won significantly more fights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thornhill|first1=R.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and the mating system of the japanese scorpionfly, panorpa japonica.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1992|volume=44|issue=5|pages=867–879|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80583-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals also show similar patterns, for example, many species of butterfly, males with lower levels of FA tended to live longer and flew more actively, allowing them to have more reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsubaki|first1=Y.|last2=Matsumoto|first2=K.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and male mating success in a sphragis-bearing butterfly luehdorfia japonica (lepidoptera: Papilionidae).|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|date=1998|volume=11|issue=4|pages=571–582|doi=10.1023/a:1022371531263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female swallows have been shown to prefer longer, and more symmetrical tails as a cue for mate choice. Therefore, the males with longer and more symmetrical tails show higher levels of reproductive success with more attractive females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møller|first1=A. P.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry in male sexual ornaments may reliable reveal male quality.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1990|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1185–1187|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80187-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In red deer, sexual selection has effected antler development, in that larger and more symmetrical antlers are favoured in males at prime mating age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mateos|first1=C.|last2=Alarcos|first2=S.|last3=Carranza|first3=J.|last4=Sánchez-Prieto|first4=C.

However, some evidence for the effects of sexual selection of FA levels have been inconsistent, suggesting that the relationship between FA and sexual selection may be more complex than originally thought. For instance, in the lekking black grouse and red junglefowl, no correlations were found between FA and mating success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rintamäki|first1=P. T.|last2=Alatalo|first2=R.

==Other associated factors ==

=== Intelligence ===
Through research, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been found to have a negative [[correlation]] to [[psychometrics|measurements of human traits]] such as [[working memory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeo|first=RA|author2=Hill, D |author3=Campbell, R |author4=Vigil, J |author5=Brooks, WM |title=Developmental instability and working memory ability in children: a magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigation.|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=2000|volume=17|issue=2|pages=143–59|doi=10.1207/S15326942DN1702_01|pmid=10955200|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a784400620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intelligence]], such that individuals showing greater asymmetry have lower IQ scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlow|first=FB|author2=Armijo-Prewitt, T |author3=Gangestad, SW |author4=Thornhill, R |title=Fluctuating asymmetry and psychometric intelligence.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=1997-06-22|volume=264|issue=1383|pages=823–9|doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0115|pmid=9265189|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/264/1383/823.short |pmc=1688437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=T|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and intelligence|journal=Intelligence|date=1 January 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=41–46|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.03.013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606000353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prokosch|first=M|author2=Yeo, R |author3=Miller, G |title=Intelligence tests with higher -loadings show higher correlations with body symmetry: Evidence for a general fitness factor mediated by developmental stability|journal=Intelligence|date=1 April 2005|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–213|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As FA links with both intelligence and facial attractiveness, it is possible that our perceptions of attractiveness have evolved based upon developmental quality, which includes traits such as intelligence and health.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; However, some literature shows no such correlations between FA and intelligence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A meta-analysis of the research covering this topic demonstrated that whilst published studies largely report negative correlations, unpublished studies often find no association between FA and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banks|first=George C.|last2=Batchelor|first2=John H.|last3=McDaniel|first3=Michael A.|date=2010-07-01|title=Smarter people are (a bit) more symmetrical: A meta-analysis of the relationship between intelligence and fluctuating asymmetry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289610000310|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=4|pages=393–401|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===
Research into FA suggests that there may be some correlation to specific personality factors, in particular, the [[Big Five personality traits]]. From a general view, one would expect someone who is more symmetrical (usually meaning greater attractiveness), to be high on agreeableness, [[conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]] and openness, and low on [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Tartaglia|first = Stefano|last2 = Rollero|first2 = Chiara|date = 2015-11-27|title = The Effects of Attractiveness and Status on Personality Evaluation|url = http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/view/896|journal = Europe’s Journal of Psychology|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 677–690|doi = 10.5964/ejop.v11i4.896|issn = 1841-0413}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most consistent findings reported is that low FA is positively associated with measures of extraversion, suggesting that more symmetrical people tend to be more extraverted than less symmetrical individuals, particularly when specifying to symmetry within the face.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fink|first = Bernhard|last2 = Neave|first2 = Nick|last3 = Manning|first3 = John T.|last4 = Grammer|first4 = Karl|date = 2005-08-01|title = Facial symmetry and the ‘big-five’ personality factors|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886905000541|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 39|issue = 3|pages = 523–529|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Pound|first = Nicholas|last2 = Penton-Voak|first2 = Ian S.|last3 = Brown|first3 = William M.|date = 2007-10-01|title = Facial symmetry is positively associated with self-reported extraversion|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690700164X|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 43|issue = 6|pages = 1572–1582|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2007.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fink|first = Bernhard|last2 = Neave|first2 = Nick|last3 = Manning|first3 = John T.|last4 = Grammer|first4 = Karl|date = 2006-08-01|title = Facial symmetry and judgements of attractiveness, health and personality|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000973|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 41|issue = 3|pages = 491–499|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has also been reported between FA and human [[Dominance hierarchy|social dominance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlow|first=B |author2=Gangestad, SW |author3=Armijo-Prewitt, T|title=Developmental stability and human violence.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |date=1998-01-07|volume=265|issue=1390|pages=1–6|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0255|pmid=9470212|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/265/1390/1.short|pmc=1688754}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research is proving less consistent with other personality factors, with some finding some weak correlations between low FA and conscientiousness and openness to experience, and others finding no significant differences between those with high or low FA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hope|first = David|last2 = Bates|first2 = Timothy|last3 = Penke|first3 = Lars|last4 = Gow|first4 = Alan J.|last5 = Starr|first5 = John M.|last6 = Deary|first6 = Ian J.|date = 2011-01-01|title = Fluctuating Asymmetry and personality|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910004228|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 50|issue = 1|pages = 49–52|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antisocial behaviours ===
Some studies suggest a link between FA and [[aggression]], but the evidence is mixed. In humans, criminal offenders show greater FA than nonoffenders.&lt;ref name="FA and psychopathy" /&gt; However, other studies report that human males with higher FA show less physical aggression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manning|first=J.

For example, one study found that females with higher FA demonstrated higher levels of reactive aggression in response to high levels of provocation, whereas high FA males showed more reactive aggression under low levels of provocation.&lt;ref name="FA and reactive aggression"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benderlioglu|first1=Zeynep|last2=Sciulli|first2=Paul W.|last3=Nelson|first3=Randy J.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry predicts human reactive aggression|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2004|volume=16|issue=4|pages=458–469|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20047}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is also mixed in other animals. In Japanese [[Panorpa|scorpionflies]] (''Panorpa nipponensis'' and ''Panorpa ochraceopennis''), FA differences between members of the same sex competing for food determines the outcome of [[Interspecific competition|interspecific contests]] and aggression better than body size or ownership of food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thornhill|first=Randy|date=1992-05-01|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, interspecific aggression and male mating tactics in two species of Japanese scorpionflies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00170603|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=357–363|doi=10.1007/BF00170603|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, cannibalistic laying [[Chicken|hens]] (''Gallus gallus domesticus'') demonstrate more asymmetry than normal hens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yngvesson|first=Jenny|last2=Keeling|first2=Linda J.|date=2001-03-01|title=Body size and fluctuating asymmetry in relation to cannibalistic behaviour in laying hens|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347200916166|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=61|issue=3|pages=609–615|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1616}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this link between FA and aggression in hens is questionable, as victimised hens also showed greater asymmetry. Furthermore, when [[Prenatal development|prenatally]] injecting hen eggs with excess [[serotonin]] (5-HT), the hens later exhibited more FA at 18 weeks of age, but displayed less aggressive behaviours. It is suggested that the stress introduced during early embryonic stages via certain factors (such as excess serotonin) may create developmental instability, causing phenotypic and behavioural variations (such as increased or decreased aggression).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Rachel L.|last2=Fahey|first2=Alan G.|last3=Cheng|first3=Heng W.|date=2013-03-01|title=Alterations to Embryonic Serotonin Change Aggression and Fearfulness|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.21459/abstract|journal=Aggressive Behavior|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=91–98|doi=10.1002/ab.21459|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ageing===

In old age, facial symmetry has been associated with better [[Aging brain|cognitive aging]], as lower levels of FA have been associated with higher intelligence and more efficient information processing in older men.&lt;ref name="FA and cognitive aging"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penke|first1=Lars|last2=Bates|first2=Timothy C|last3=Gow|first3=Alan J|last4=Pattie|first4=Alison|last5=Starr|first5=John M|last6=Jones|first6=Benedict C|last7=Perrett|first7=David I|last8=Deary|first8=Ian J|title=Symmetric faces are a sign of successful cognitive aging|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=November 2009|volume=30|issue=6|pages=429–437|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.06.001|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1090513809000543/1-s2.0-S1090513809000543-main.pdf?_tid=e47f5726-d723-11e5-b37a-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1455898666_db9300ce5bbce8595f8dd1bde41f0277|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it has been found that risk of mortality cannot be predicted accurately from levels of FA in photographs of older adults.&lt;ref name="Predicting mortality from human faces"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dykiert|first1=Dominika|last2=Bates|first2=Timothy C|last3=Gow|first3=Alan J|last4=Penke|first4=Lars|last5=Starr|first5=John M|last6=Deary|first6=Ian J|title=Predicting mortality from human faces|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|date=2012|volume=74|issue=6|pages=560–566|doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e318259c33f}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other factors ===
Additionally, FA has been shown to predict atypical asymmetry of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=J. T|last2=Gangestad|first2=S. W|last3=Lewine|first3=J. D|last4=Thoma|first4=R.

A|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and the human brain|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|date=2002|volume=7|pages=45–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that growth rates after birth positively correlate with FA. For example, increased FA has been found in people who were currently obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A trade-off between early growth rate and fluctuating asymmetry in Brazilian boys|journal = Annals of Human Biology|date = 2006-02-01|issn = 0301-4460|pmid = 16500816|pages = 112–124|volume = 33|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/03014460500480391|first = Jonathan C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8430">'''Handling qualities''' is one of the two principal regimes in the science of [[flight test]] (the other being performance). Handling qualities involves the study and evaluation of the stability and control characteristics of an aircraft. They have a critical bearing on the safety of flight and on the ease of controlling an airplane in steady flight and in maneuvers.

==Relation to stability==
To understand the discipline of handling qualities, the concept of stability should be understood. Stability can be defined only when the vehicle is in trim; that is, there are no unbalanced forces or moments acting on the vehicle to cause it to deviate from steady flight. If this condition exists, and if the vehicle is disturbed, stability refers to the tendency of the vehicle to return to the trimmed condition. If the vehicle initially tends to return to a trimmed condition, it is said to be statically stable. If it continues to approach the trimmed condition without overshooting, the motion is called a subsidence. If the motion causes the vehicle to overshoot the trimmed condition, it may oscillate back and forth. If this oscillation damps out, the motion is called a damped oscillation and the vehicle is said to be dynamically stable. On the other hand, if the motion increases in amplitude, the vehicle is said to be dynamically unstable.

The theory of stability of airplanes was worked out by G. H. Bryan in [[England]] in 1904. This theory is essentially equivalent to the theory taught to aeronautical students today and was a remarkable intellectual achievement considering that at the time Bryan developed the theory, he had not even heard of the Wright brothers' first flight. Because of the complication of the theory and the tedious computations required in its use, it was rarely applied by airplane designers. Obviously, to fly successfully, pilotless airplanes had to be dynamically stable. The airplane flown by the Wright brothers, and most airplanes flown thereafter, were not stable, but by trial and error, designers developed a few planes that had satisfactory flying qualities. Many other airplanes, however, had poor flying qualities, which sometimes resulted in crashes.

==Historical development==
Bryan showed that the stability characteristics of airplanes could be separated into longitudinal and lateral groups with the corresponding motions called modes of motion. These modes of motion were either aperiodic, which means that the airplane steadily approaches or diverges from a trimmed condition, or oscillatory, which means that the airplane oscillates about the trim condition. The longitudinal modes of a statically stable airplane following a disturbance were shown to consist of a long-period oscillation called the [[phugoid]] oscillation, usually with a period in seconds about one-quarter of the airspeed in miles per hour and a short-period oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The lateral motion had three modes of motion: an aperiodic mode called the spiral mode that could be a divergence or subsidence, a heavily damped aperiodic mode called the roll subsidence, and a short-period oscillation, usually poorly damped, called the Dutch roll mode.

Some early airplane designers attempted to make airplanes that were dynamically stable, but it was found that the requirements for stability conflicted with those for satisfactory flying qualities. Meanwhile, no information was available to guide the designer as to just what characteristics should be incorporated to provide satisfactory flying qualities.

By the 1930s, there was a general feeling that airplanes should be dynamically stable, but some aeronautical engineers were starting to recognize the conflict between the requirements for stability and flying qualities. To resolve this question, Edward Warner, who was working as a consultant to the Douglas Aircraft Company on the design of the DC-4, a large four-engine transport airplane, made the first effort in the United States to write a set of requirements for satisfactory flying qualities. Dr. Warner, a member of the main committee of the [[NACA]], also requested that a flight study be made to determine the flying qualities of an airplane along the lines of the suggested requirements. This study was conducted by [[Hartley A. Soulé]] of Langley. Entitled ''Preliminary Investigation of the Flying Qualities of Airplanes'', Soulé's report showed several areas in which the suggested requirements needed revision and showed the need for more research on other types of airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-ctX2Q-CSIC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Floyd+L.+Thompson&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fkprTOStEoH6lwethskX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Floyd%20L.%20Thompson&amp;f=false| title=Airplane stability and control: a history of the technologies that made aviation possible| authors=Malcolm J. Abzug, E. Eugene Larrabee| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year= 2002| isbn= 978-0-521-80992-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a program was started by [[Robert R. Gilruth]] with [[Melvin N. Gough]] as the chief test pilot.

==Evaluation of handling qualities==
The technique for the study of flying qualities requirements used by Gilruth was first to install instruments to record relevant quantities such as control positions and forces, airplane angular velocities, linear accelerations, airspeed, and altitude. Then a program of specified flight conditions and maneuvers was flown by an experienced test pilot. After the flight, data were transcribed from the records and the results were correlated with pilot opinion. This approach would be considered routine today, but it was a notable original contribution by Gilruth that took advantage of the flight recording instruments already available at Langley and the variety of airplanes available for tests under comparable conditions.

An important quantity in handling qualities measurements in turns or pull-ups is the variation of control force on the control stick or wheel with the value of acceleration normal to the flight direction expressed in g units. This quantity is usually called the force per g.

==Relation to Spacecraft==
Handling qualities are those characteristics of a flight vehicle that govern the ease and precision with which a pilot is able to perform a flying task.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, G.E. and Harper, R.P., “The Use of Pilot Rating in the Evaluation of Aircraft Handling Qualities,” NASA TN D-5153, April 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  The way in which particular vehicle factors affect handling qualities has been studied in aircraft for decades,&lt;ref&gt; Gilruth, R.R., “Requirements for Satisfactory Flying Qualities of Airplanes,” NACA TR 755, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; and reference standards for the handling qualities of both fixed-wing aircraft&lt;ref&gt; “Military Standard, Flying Qualities of Piloted Airplanes,” MIL-STD-1797, March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and rotary-wing aircraft&lt;ref&gt;Aeronautical Design Standard, Performance Specification: Handling Qualities Requirements for Military Rotorcraft,” ADS-33, May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed and are now in common use. These standards define a subset of the dynamics and control design space that provides good handling qualities for a given vehicle type and flying task.  A new generation of spacecraft now under development by NASA to replace the Space Shuttle and return astronauts to the Moon will have a manual control capability for several mission tasks, and the ease and precision with which pilots can execute these tasks will have an important effect on performance, mission risk and training costs. No reference standards currently exist for handling qualities of piloted spacecraft.

== Diversity ==
Formins have been found in all eukaryotes studied.&lt;ref name="Chalkia"/&gt;  In humans, 15 different formin proteins are present that have been classified in 7 subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Higgs HN, Peterson KJ | title = Phylogenetic analysis of the formin homology 2 domain | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15509653 | pmc = 539145 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E04-07-0565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, yeasts contain only 2-3 formins.&lt;ref name="Baarlink"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baarlink C, Brandt D, Grosse R | title = SnapShot: Formins | journal = Cell | volume = 142 | issue = 1 | pages = 172, 172.e1 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20603022 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2010.06.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and interactions ==
Formins are characterised by the presence of three formin homology (FH) [[protein domain|domains]] (FH1, FH2 and FH3), although members of the formin family do not necessarily contain all three [[protein domains|domains]].&lt;ref name="pmid12538772"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitayama C, Uyeda TQ | title = ForC, a novel type of formin family protein lacking an FH1 domain, is involved in multicellular development in Dictyostelium discoideum | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 116 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 711–23 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12538772 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallar BJ, Alberts AS | title = The formins: active scaffolds that remodel the cytoskeleton | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 435–46 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12888296 | doi = 10.1016/S0962-8924(03)00153-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other domains are usually present, such as PDZ, DAD, WH2, or FHA domains.

The [[proline]]-rich FH1 domain mediates [[Protein interactions|interactions]] with a variety of proteins, including the [[actin-binding protein]] [[profilin]], [[SH3 domain|SH3]] (Src homology 3) domain proteins,&lt;ref name="Uetz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uetz P, Fumagalli S, James D, Zeller R | title = Molecular interaction between limb deformity proteins (formins) and Src family kinases | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 271 | issue = 52 | pages = 33525–30 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8969217 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.271.52.33525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[WW domain]] proteins. The actin nucleation-promoting activity of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' formins has been localized to the FH2 domain.&lt;ref name="pmid17373907" /&gt; The FH2 domain is required for the self-association of formin proteins through the ability of FH2 domains to directly bind each other, and may also act to [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] actin polymerisation.&lt;ref name="pmid14576350"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takeya R, Sumimoto H | title = Fhos, a mammalian formin, directly binds to F-actin via a region N-terminal to the FH1 domain and forms a homotypic complex via the FH2 domain to promote actin fiber formation | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 116 | issue = Pt 22 | pages = 4567–75 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14576350 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14992721"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shimada A, Nyitrai M, Vetter IR, Kühlmann D, Bugyi B, Narumiya S, Geeves MA, Wittinghofer A | title = The core FH2 domain of diaphanous-related formins is an elongated actin binding protein that inhibits polymerization | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 511–22 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14992721 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(04)00059-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FH3 domain is less well [[conserved sequence|conserved]] and is required for directing formins to the correct [[intracellular]] location, such the [[mitotic spindle]], or the projection tip during [[Covalent bond|conjugation]].&lt;ref name="pmid11171383"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kato T, Watanabe N, Morishima Y, Fujita A, Ishizaki T, Narumiya S | title = Localization of a mammalian homolog of diaphanous, mDia1, to the mitotic spindle in HeLa cells | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 114 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 775–84 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11171383 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9606213"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petersen J, Nielsen O, Egel R, Hagan IM | title = FH3, a domain found in formins, targets the fission yeast formin Fus1 to the projection tip during conjugation | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 141 | issue = 5 | pages = 1217–28 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9606213 | pmc = 2137179 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.141.5.1217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some formins can contain a [[GTPase]]-binding domain (GBD) required for [[Binding (molecular)|binding]] to [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho small GTPases]], and a [[C-terminal]] [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] DRF autoregulatory domain (Dia-autoregulatory domain) (DAD). The GBD domain is a bifunctional autoinhibitory domain that [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]]s with and is regulated by activated Rho family members. [[Mammalia]]n Drf3 contains a CRIB-like [[protein motif|motif]] within its GBD for [[Binding (molecular)|binding]] to [[Cdc42]], which is required for Cdc42 to activate and guide Drf3 towards the [[cell cortex]] where it remodels the actin skeleton.&lt;ref name="pmid12676083"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peng J, Wallar BJ, Flanders A, Swiatek PJ, Alberts AS | title = Disruption of the Diaphanous-related formin Drf1 gene encoding mDia1 reveals a role for Drf3 as an effector for Cdc42 | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = 534–45 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12676083 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00170-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DRF autoregulatory domain binds the N-terminal GTPase-binding domain; this link is broken when GTP-bound Rho binds to the GBD and activates the [[protein]]. The addition of the DAD to [[mammalia]]n [[Cell (biology)|cells]] induces [[actin filament]] formation, stabilises [[microtubules]], and activates serum-response mediated [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="pmid12676083" /&gt; Another commonly found domain is an [[Armadillo repeats|armadillo repeat region]] (ARR) located in the FH3 domain.

The FH2 domain, has been shown by [[X-ray crystallography]] to have an elongated, crescent shape containing three [[Helix|helical]] subdomains.&lt;ref name="pmid15006353"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Y, Moseley JB, Sagot I, Poy F, Pellman D, Goode BL, Eck MJ | title = Crystal structures of a Formin Homology-2 domain reveal a tethered dimer architecture | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 5 | pages = 711–23 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15006353 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00210-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson ME, Heimsath EG, Gauvin TJ, Higgs HN, Kull FJ | title = FMNL3 FH2-actin structure gives insight into formin-mediated actin nucleation and elongation | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 111–8 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23222643 | pmc = 3876896 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formins also directly bind to [[microtubules]] via their FH2 domain. This interaction is important in promoting the capture and stabilization of a subset of microtubules oriented towards the leading edge of migrating cells. Formins also promote the capture of microtubules by the [[kinetochore]] during [[mitosis]] and for aligning microtubules along actin filaments.&lt;ref name="PMID11483957"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palazzo AF, Cook TA, Alberts AS, Gundersen GG | title = mDia mediates Rho-regulated formation and orientation of stable microtubules | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | pages = 723–9 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11483957 | doi = 10.1038/35087035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID19631698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartolini F, Gundersen GG | title = Formins and microtubules | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1803 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–73 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19631698 | pmc = 2856479 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2009.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich A. Kittler''' (June 12, 1943 &amp;ndash; October 18, 2011) was a literary scholar and a media theorist. His works relate to [[Mass media|media]], [[technology]], and the [[military]].

==Biography==
Friedrich Adolf Kittler was born in 1943 in [[Rochlitz]] in [[Saxony]]. His family fled with him to [[West Germany]] in 1958, where from 1958 to 1963 he went to a [[natural sciences]] and [[modern languages]] ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in [[Lahr]] in the [[Black Forest]], and thereafter, until 1972, he studied [[German studies]], [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[philology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]] in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. During his studies, he was especially influenced by the writings of [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

In 1976, Kittler received his doctorate in philosophy after a thesis on the poet [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]]. Between 1976 and 1986 he worked as academic assistant at the university's ''Deutsches Seminar''. In 1984, he earned his [[Habilitation]] in the field of Modern German Literary History.

He had several stints as a Visiting Assistant Professor or Visiting Professor at universities in the [[United States]], such as the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and [[Stanford University]].

From 1986 to 1990, he headed the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG's]] ''Literature and Media Analysis'' project in [[Kassel]] and in 1987 he was appointed Professor of Modern German Studies at the [[Ruhr University]]. In 1993 he was appointed to the chair for Media Aesthetics and History at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

In 1993, Kittler was awarded the "Siemens Media Arts Prize" (''Siemens-Medienkunstpreis'') by [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM Karlsruhe]] (''Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie'', or "Centre for Art and Media Technology") for his research in the field of media theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%241107 Siemens Medienkunstpreis 1993/ Friedrich Kittle] ZKM. Museum für Neue Kunst.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was recognized in 1996 as a Distinguished Scholar at [[Yale University]] and in 1997 as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Kittler was a member of the Hermann von Helmholtz Centre for Culture and the research group ''Bild Schrift Zahl'' ("Picture Writing Number") (DFG).  

Among Kittler's theses was his tendency to argue, with a mixture of polemicism, apocalypticism, erudition, and humor, that technological conditions were closely bound up with epistemology and ontology itself. This claim and his style of argumention is aptly summed up in his dictum "Nur was schaltbar ist, ist überhaupt"—a phrase that could be translated as "Only that which is switchable, exists" or more freely, "Only that which can be switched, can be." This phrase plays both on the concept that in principle any representation can be presented according to the on/off binary logic of computing. Kittler goes one step further by suggesting that, conversely, anything that can't be "switched" can't really "be," at least under current technical conditions. He invoked this doctrine on his deathbed in 2011. Dying in a hospital in Berlin and sustained only by a medical instruments, his final words were "Alle Apparate ausschalten", which translates as "switch off all apparatuses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2011/11/09/tom-mccarthy/kittler-and-the-sirens/ London Review of Books article].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Friedrich Kittler is influential in the new approach to [[media influence|media theory]] that grew popular starting in the 1980s, [[new media]] ({{lang-de|technische Medien}}, which translates roughly to "technical media"). Kittler's central project is to "prove to the human sciences [...] their technological-media ''a priori''" ([[Hartmut Winkler]]), or in his own words: "Driving the human out of the humanities",&lt;ref&gt;This loses something in the translation, since "spirit" is "Geist" in [[German language|German]], and "[[humanities]]" is "Geisteswissenschaften", or "spiritual sciences".&lt;/ref&gt; a title that he gave a work that he published in 1980.

Kittler sees an autonomy in technology and therefore disagrees with [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s reading of the media as "extensions of man": "Media are not pseudopods for extending the human body. They follow the logic of escalation that leaves us and written history behind it. (Kittler in ''Geschichte der Kommunikationsmedien''. In: Jörg Huber, Alois Martin Müller (publishers): ''Raum und Verfahren''.)

Consequently, he sees in writing literature, in writing programmes and in burning structures into [[silicon chip]]s a complete continuum: "As we know and simply do not say, no human being writes anymore. [...] Today, human writing runs through inscriptions burnt into silicon by electronic lithography [...]. The last historic act of writing may thus have been in the late seventies when a team of Intel engineers [plotted] the hardware architecture of their first integrated microprocessor." (Kittler, ''Es gibt keine Software''. In: ders.: ''Draculas Vermächtnis. Technische Schriften''.)

{{cquote|And Kittler is a good friend of mine – I sponsored a chair at the Humboldt University for two years. He is not mainstream. Historians of music come and say, “But he did not write his thesis on [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].” And all the professors of philosophy say, “But did he write a thesis on [[Kant]] or Heidegger?” No, Kittler is a mixture: Kittler is in between philosophy, the history of music, computer science, and media theory. That’s why he is completely outstanding. We have some fundamental heroes in Germany, really outstanding people on the level of [[Deleuze]], [[Derrida]], Lacan, [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]] … Among these are [[Bazon Brock]], Friedrich Kittler, [[Peter Sloterdijk|Sloterdijk]], [[Horst Bredekamp|Bredekamp]], or [[Hans Belting]]. These people will last longer than I will in this book. In 50 years, each of them will be known as people who had been very sensitive to changes of the media.—[[Hubert Burda]], 2011&lt;ref&gt;[[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], "In Media Res," ''[[032c]]'', Sum 2011, [http://032c.com/2012/in-media-res/ pp. 180–189].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180–189}}}}

[[File:Logo HCM.jpg|thumb|The official logo of the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics.]]

The '''Hausdorff Center for Mathematics''' ('''HCM''') is a research center in [[Bonn]], formed by the four mathematical institutes of the [[Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn]] (Mathematical Institute, Institute for Applied Mathematics, Institute for Numerical Simulation, Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics), the [[Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]] (MPIM), and the Institute for Social and Economic Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/about-hcm/organization/participating-institutes/ Participating institutes] at the website of the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics, retrieved 2017-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Hausdorff Center was established in 2006 as one of the seventeen national [[German Universities Excellence Initiative#Winners: Clusters of Excellence|Clusters of Excellence]] that were part of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|German government's Excellence Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfg.de/service/presse/pressemitteilungen/2006/pressemitteilung_nr_54/index.html Press release No. 54], at the Website of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (English: German Research Foundation), retrieved 2017-10-24&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially opened with a colloquium on 19 and 20 January 2007. In 2012, a second funding period was granted. The Hausdorff Center is the only cluster of excellence in the area of mathematics in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/list/index.jsp?id=EXC List of the Clusters of Excellence] at the Website of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (English: German Research Foundation), retrieved 2017-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group''' ('''HoMBRG''') is an academic organisation specialising in recording and publishing the [[oral history]] of twentieth and twenty-first century [[biomedicine]]. It was established in 1990 as the Wellcome Trust's '''History of Twentieth Century Medicine Group''',&lt;ref name="MHL2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalheritage.org/2013/03/13/the-mhl-welcomes-a-new-content-contributor-2/|title=The MHL Welcomes a New Content Contributor|date=13 March 2013|publisher=[[Medical Heritage Library]]|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reconstituted in October 2010 as part of the School of History &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.qmul.ac.uk/research/research-centres|title=Research Centres - School of History|website=www.history.qmul.ac.uk|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Queen Mary University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trust|first1=Wellcome|title=History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group celebrates 21 years of innovation|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/hss/140113.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trust|first1=Wellcome|title=History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group celebrates 21 years of innovation|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/2014/WTP057432.htm |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |accessdate=29 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project originated as The [[Wellcome Trust]]'s History of Twentieth Century Medicine Group, and later functioned as the Academic Unit of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. It was originally established at the Royal College of Physicians in 1990 and comprised Sir [[Christopher Booth]] (the Harveian Librarian) and Professor [[Tilli Tansey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aronson|first1=Jeff |title=Wellcome witnesses to twentieth-century medicine |journal=Cambridge Journal Medical History |date=July 1998 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=404–405 |pmc=1044055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to devise ways of stimulating historians, scientists &amp; clinicians to discuss, preserve and write the history of recent biomedicine. The Group's activities were originally overseen by a Programme Committee, which included professional historians of medicine, practising scientists and clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pickstone|first1=John V.|title=A brief history of medical history|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/history_of_medicine.html |publisher=Making History|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2010 it was a constituent part of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London. In October 2010 it moved to the School of History, Queen Mary’s University, London.  In 2011 the Group received a Strategic Award from the Wellcome Trust to embark upon a new project, "Makers of Modern Biomedicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Society|first1=The Physiological|title=Hidden voices and human stories|url=https://www.physoc.org/news/2012/hidden-voices-and-human-stories |publisher=The Physiological Society|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/search/C__SHistory+of+Biomedicine+Research+Group.+__Orightresult;jsessionid=F0C74ABF559F644E711241B44A7FAD7E?lang=eng&amp;suite=cobalt|title=Wellcome Library Encore -- History+of+Biomedicine+Research+Group.+|website=search.wellcomelibrary.org|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture24-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/science-and-nature/medicine/art375045|title=Five-year, £1.4 million project to reveal "unsung heroes" of biomedicine|date=31 January 2012|work=Culture24|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genmedhist.eshg.org/news-events/|title=News &amp; Events|work=Genetics and Medicine Historical Network|publisher=[[Cardiff University]]|accessdate=6 May 2017 |quote=The History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group, based at Queen Mary, University of London, continue to build upon their work documenting the recent history of clinical genetics research and practice. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UniOfSurrey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/features/pioneering-work-biomedicine-celebrated|title=Pioneering work in biomedicine celebrated|date=25 August 2015|publisher=[[University of Surrey]]|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outputs ==

An archive of oral and written history, plus videoed interviews, has been compiled by the HoMBRG and consists of three projects: Witness Seminars, Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History and SAD at 30. All material and documentation related to the project is deposited with the Wellcome Library.  The resultant publications are open access,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medical Humanities|first1=Centre for|title=New Open Access Publication – The Development of Narrative Practices in Medicine c.1960–c.2000|url=http://centreformedicalhumanities.org/new-open-access-publication-the-development-of-narrative-practices-in-medicine-c-1960-c-2000/ |publisher=[[Durham University]] |accessdate=31 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made freely available online via the HoMBRG website, a partnership with the Medical Heritage Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library|first1=Medical History|title=The MHL Welcomes a New Content Contributor|url=http://www.medicalheritage.org/2013/03/the-mhl-welcomes-a-new-content-contributor-2/|website=Medical History Library|publisher=Medical History Library|accessdate=29 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iTunes.&lt;ref name="apple.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/todays-neuroscience-tomorrows/id557520467?mt=10|title=Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History - Professor Sir Peter Mansfield - Free Podcast by Queen Mary University of London on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources from the archive are online at The History of Modern Biomedicine Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Modern Biomedicine|url=http://histmodbiomed.org/article/projects |publisher=Queen Mary, University of London|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the internet archive&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/search.php?query=publisher%3A%22London%3A+The+History+of+Modern+Biomedicine+Research+Group+at+UCL%22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History ===

The Group's 'Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History' initiative (2006-2008) was funded by a Wellcome Trust Public Engagement grant. It recorded interviews on three themes, [[neuropharmacology]], [[psychiatry]]/[[neuropsychology]], and [[neuroimaging]], with twelve neuroscientists, including [[Geoffrey Burnstock]], [[Salvador Moncada]], [[Michael Rutter]] and [[Uta Frith]].&lt;ref name="TNTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histmodbiomed.org/article/about-todays-neuroscience-tomorrows-history|title=About Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History|publisher=HoMBRG|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Witness Seminars ===

A series of [[witness seminar]]s began in 1993, with regular meetings being held, about four per year.  These recorded the voices of those who have contributed, in diverse ways, to the development of modern [[biomedicine]], using oral history methodology.  The aim is to make the series widely available for education, research and outreach purposes.&lt;ref name=JonesEM&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=E.M.|editor2-last=Tansey|editor2-first=E.M.|title=Monoclonal Antibodies to Migraine: Witnesses to Modern Biomedicine, An A-Z|date=2014|publisher=Queen Mary, University of London|location=London|isbn=978 0 90223 895 4|pages=223|ref=none|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patient.info/forums/discuss/migraine-diagnosis-treatment-and-understanding-270038|title=Migraine: Diagnosis, Treatment and Understanding  - Migraine - Patient|website=patient.info|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Emma M.|year=2016|title=A witness seminar on the history of the Human Gene Mapping Workshops|journal=Gene|volume=589|issue=2|pages=123–126|issn=0378-1119|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2016.02.030|pmc=4925380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Messenger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://waste-management-world.com/a/an-oral-history-of-waste-management-by-university-historians-in-london|title=An Oral History of Waste Management by University Historians in London|last=Messenger|first=Ben|date=15 January 2016|work=Waste Management World|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tansey2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tansey|first1=T  |first2=A. |last2=Wilkinson |first3=A. |last3=Yabsley |first4=A. |last4=Zarros |year=2016|title=Physiology at the heart of modern biomedicine: Evidence through oral testimonies|journal=Proceedings of the Physiological Society|publisher=[[The Physiological Society]]|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are published online,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-134-70170-4| last1 = McConville| first1 = Sean| last2 = Bryson| first2 = Anna| title = The Routledge Guide to Interviewing: Oral History, Social Enquiry and Investigation |year=2013 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most edited transcripts appearing within 18 months.&lt;ref name=JonesEM/&gt;

The first two volumes were reviewed in ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' in 1999, with the comment, "Few books are so intellectually stimulating or uplifting."&lt;ref name="BlauJN"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blau|first=J N|year=1999|title=Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine, Vols 1 and 2|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=92|pages=206–8}} &lt;!--PMC1297150 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the series in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 2002, medical historian [[Irvine Loudon]] wrote, "This is oral history at its best...all the volumes make compulsive reading...they are, primarily, important historical records&lt;ref name="Loudon2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loudon|first=I.|year=2002|title=Book: Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine|journal=BMJ|volume=325|issue=7372|pages=1119a–1119|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7372.1119/a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a seminar, chaired by Professor Sir Brian Follett, with [[Norman Rosenthal]] and [[Alfred Lewy]], entitled 'The Recent History of [[Seasonal Affective Disorder]] (SAD): 30 Years of SAD' was undertaken on the topic of Seasonal Affective Disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Association|first1=SAD|title=Wellcome Trust Wtness Seminar:An Important New Publication|url=http://www.sada.org.uk/sada_get_news_item.php?action=show&amp;id=34-3-News |publisher=SAD Association|accessdate=31 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a number of podcasts,&lt;ref name="apple.com"/&gt; and Volume 51 of the Witness Seminar publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Overy|editor1-first=C|editor2-last=Tansey|editor2-first=E.M.|title=The Recent History Of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)|date=2014|publisher=Queen Mary, University of London|location=London|isbn=978 0 90223 897 8|url=http://ischronobiology.org/Joomla_1.5.26-Stable-Full_Package/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109:the-recent-history-of-seasonal-affective-disorder&amp;catid=45:books&amp;Itemid=68|accessdate=29 May 2015|ref=none|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clips and Conversations ===

In 2015 the Group began producing oral history interviews with notable scientists and clinicians. This material is made freely available on YouTube (in the case of video interviews) and the Group’s website, as are the transcripts of both audio and video interviews.&lt;ref name="OHHEN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ohhen.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/makers-of-modern-biomedicine-testimonies-and-legacy/|title=Makers of Modern Biomedicine: Testimonies and Legacy|publisher=Oral History in Higher Education Network|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">An '''interpolation''', in relation to [[literature]] and especially ancient [[manuscript]]s, is an entry or passage in a text that was not written by the original author. As there are often several generations of copies between an extant copy of an ancient text and the original, each handwritten by different scribes, there is a natural tendency for extraneous material to be inserted into such documents over time.

Interpolations originally may be inserted as an authentic explanatory note (for example, {{bracket|[[sic]]}}), but may also be included for fraudulent purposes. The forged passages and works attributed to the [[Pseudo-Isidore]] are an example of the latter. Similarly, the letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] were interpolated by Apollinarian heretics, three centuries after the originals were written. Charters and legal texts are also subject to [[forgery]] of this kind.  In the 13th century a medieval romance, the ''[[Prose Tristan]]'', inserted another prose romance, the [[Vulgate]] ''Queste del Saint Graal'', in its entirety in order to reinterpret the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]] through the optics of the Tristan story.&lt;ref&gt;On the Medieval technique of manuscript ''[[interpolation]]'' and the ''Prose Tristan'', see Emmanuèle Baumgartner, "La préparation à la ''Queste del Saint Graal'' dans le ''Tristan'' en prose" in Norris Lacy, ed. ''Conjunctures'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1994), pp. 1-14, Fanni Bogdanow, "L'Invention du texte, intertextualité et le problème de la transmission et de la classification de manuscrits" ''Romania'' 111 (190): 121-40 and Janina P. Traxler, "The Use and Abuse of the Grail Quest" ''Tristania'' 15 (1994): 23-31.  Gaston Paris, in 1897, also noted the interpolation of a verse romance on [[Brunor]] in ''Prose Tristan''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, most interpolations result from the errors and inaccuracies which tend to arise during hand-copying, especially over long periods of time. For example, if a [[scribe]] made an error when copying a text and omitted some lines, he would have tended to include the omitted material in the margin. However, margin notes made by readers are present in almost all manuscripts. Therefore, a different scribe seeking to produce a copy of the manuscript perhaps many years later could find it very difficult to determine whether a margin note was an omission made by the previous scribe (which should be included in the text) or simply a note made by a reader (which should be ignored or kept in the margin).

Conscientious scribes tended to copy everything which appeared in a manuscript, but in all cases scribes needed to exercise personal judgement. Explanatory notes would tend to find their way into the body of a text as a natural result of this subjective process.

Modern scholars have developed techniques{{Which|date=August 2010}} for recognizing interpolation, which are often apparent to modern observers, but would have been less so for medieval copyists.

The [[Comma Johanneum]], for example, is commonly regarded as interpolation. The specific problem of Christian transmission of Jewish texts outside the Jewish and Christian canons is often described as [[Christian interpolation]].

'''Joseph Nicolosi''' (January 24, 1947 &amp;ndash; March 8, 2017) was an American clinical [[psychologist]], founder and director of the Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic in [[Encino, California]], and a founder and president of the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality|National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH).&lt;ref name=officers/&gt; Nicolosi advocated and practiced [[Conversion therapy#Reparative therapy|reparative therapy]], a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] and controversial practice that he claimed could help people overcome or mitigate their homosexual desires and replace them with heterosexual ones.

== Biography ==
Nicolosi described his theories in ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach'' (1991) and three other books. Nicolosi proposed that [[homosexuality]] is often the product of a condition he described as gender-identity deficit caused by an alienation from, and perceived rejection by, individuals of the subject's gender.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Joseph Nicolosi, Ph.D., ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7657-0142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all forms of [[conversion therapy]], reparative therapy is [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], based on faulty assumptions, opposed by mainstream medical and psychological practitioners, and potentially harmful to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Haldeman|first = Douglas C.|year = 1999|title = The Pseudo-science of Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy|volume = 4|issue = 1|journal = Angles: The Policy Journal of the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies|url = http://drdoughaldeman.com/doc/Pseudo-Science.pdf|quote = [T]he term "reparative therapy" ... inaccurately implies "broken-ness" as the distinctive feature of homosexuality and bisexuality. ... Since mainstream mental health organizations have rejected this position, the more accurate term for therapeutic efforts to change homosexual orientation is sexual orientation conversion therapy, or simply, conversion therapy. ... Theorists such as Nicolosi and Socarides maintain that homosexuals suffer from an arrest of normal development ... [but their theories] have never been empirically validated. ... [R]eviews show that no study claiming success for conversion therapy meets the research standards that would support such a claim. ... Conversion therapy is not just an individual mental health issue but has implications for society. This discredited and ineffective psychological treatment harms people and reinforces the notion that homosexuality is bad. In this regard, it is not a compassionate effort to help homosexuals in pain, but a means of exploiting unhappy people and of reinforcing social hostility to homosexuality. Herein lies the real "reparative therapy:" helping refugees of conversion therapy reconstruct their sense of identity and rediscover their capacity to love, as well as repairing a society still affected by the myth that lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are mentally ill. Reparative efforts are best directed toward a broken social context, not the individual who has been victimized by it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ford|first = Jeffry G.|year = 2001|title = Healing homosexuals: A psychologist's journey through the ex-gay movement and the pseudo-science of reparative therapy|journal = [[Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Psychotherapy]]|volume = 5|issue = 3–4|pages = 69–86|doi = 10.1300/J236v05n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = [[Australian Psychological Society]]|year = 2015|title = APS Position Statement on the use of psychological practices that attempt to change sexual orientation|website = psychology.org.au|publisher = [[Australian Psychological Society]]|url = https://www.psychology.org.au/getmedia/95cfcca4-009c-4a75-a0e7-597d68e5a55c/Position_statement_on_psychological_practices_that_attempt_to_change_sexual_orientation_members.pdf|accessdate = March 17, 2018|deadurl = no|archive-date = March 17, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317021307/https://www.psychology.org.au/getmedia/95cfcca4-009c-4a75-a0e7-597d68e5a55c/Position_statement_on_psychological_practices_that_attempt_to_change_sexual_orientation_members.pdf|quote = [S]ome organisations and individuals practicing outside the remit of professional bodies such as the American Psychiatric Association or the Australian Psychological Society continue to advocate for therapeutic approaches that treat homosexuality and bisexuality as disorders. These are most commonly referred to as ‘reparative’ or ‘conversion’ therapies. Many such approaches are guided by particular interpretations of religious texts ...&lt;br /&gt;'''The APS strongly opposes any approach to psychological practice or research that treats lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people as disordered. The APS also strongly opposes any approach to psychological practice or research that attempts to change an individual’s sexual orientation.''' ...&lt;br /&gt;[T]he Code of Ethics [of the Society] states: "psychologists avoid discriminating unfairly against people on the basis of age, religion, sexuality, ethnicity, gender, disability, or any other basis proscribed by law” [and that] "in the course of their conduct, psychologists: a) communicate respect for other people through their actions and language, b) do not behave in a manner that, having regard to the context, may reasonably be perceived as coercive or demeaning, and c) respect the legal rights and moral rights of others". It should be noted, however, that this requirement not to discriminate and to respect clients’ moral rights does not equate to a justification to treat homosexuality or bisexuality as a disorder requiring treatment [as the Code also states that] "psychologists only provide psychological services within the boundaries of their professional competence. This includes but is not restricted to... b) basing their service on established knowledge of the discipline and profession of psychology".&lt;br /&gt;'''There is no peer-reviewed empirical psychological research objectively documenting the ability to ‘change’ an individual’s sexual orientation. Furthermore, there is no peer-reviewed empirical psychological research demonstrating that homosexuality or bisexuality constitutes a disorder.''' ...&lt;br /&gt;Psychologists are responsible for the professional decisions they make and may be liable to investigation for professional misconduct in the event a client makes a claim of maleficence. It is, of course, appropriate for psychologists to provide clinical services to clients who experience distress in regards to their sexual orientation. It is also appropriate for psychological research to be undertaken on this topic. However, the Australian Psychological Society advises that such practice and research should seek to understand ''the reasons for'' distress and how it may be alleviated. Evidence-based strategies to alleviate distress do not include attempts at changing sexual orientation, but could include challenging negative stereotypes, seeking social support, and self-acceptance, among others. (emphases in original)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He held a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[California School of Professional Psychology]]. Nicolosi was a founding member of the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH) and was its president for some time. NARTH is a professional association that promotes the acceptance of [[conversion therapy]]. He was an advisor to, and officer of, NARTH.&lt;ref name=officers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narth.com/menus/officers.html |title=NARTH Officers |accessdate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803174911/http://www.narth.com/menus/officers.html |archivedate=2004-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narth.com/menus/advisors.html |title=NARTH Advisors |accessdate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617025223/http://www.narth.com/menus/advisors.html |archivedate=2008-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, California passed a law that [[List of U.S. jurisdictions banning conversion therapy for minors|banned the provision of conversion therapy to minors]], including some of Nicolosi's existing patients. Nicolosi was named as a plaintiff in a [[Pickup v. Brown and Welch v. Brown|lawsuit challenging the law on constitutional grounds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Lawsuit Filed against Calif. Gay Therapy Ban|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2012/October/Second-Lawsuit-Filed-against-Calif-Gay-Therapy-Ba/|accessdate=23 August 2015|agency=CBN|date=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the law, effectively barring Nicolosi's clinic from taking on patients under the age of 18, was subsequently upheld. The Supreme Court later explicitly referenced this case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1140_5368.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A high quality physical education programs consists of these attributes:&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201493/|title=Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School Environment|last=|first=|date=2013|website=National Academy of Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Physical education teachers are certified
* Students in elementary school have physical education class for a minimum of 150 minutes per week, while students in high school have it for at least 225 minutes per week
* Concrete and achievable standards for students to meet (often for high school graduation)

==Causes==
The causes of lack of physical education vary from country to country.  These include a shortage in facilities and [[Sports equipment|equipment]], a paucity of [[Gym teacher|physical education teachers]], large [[Student–teacher ratio|class sizes]], and budgetary constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some African countries such as [[Botswana]] and [[Malawi]], where children attend school for a minimal amount of time, the budgets allocated for physical education are instead used to concentrate on subjects such as [[language]]s and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A lack of physical education also arises from cultural views: in parts of [[Central America]] (such as the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]) and [[Asia]] (such as [[Pakistan]]), exercise is seen as a form of leisure that should not be featured in an academic [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example exists in [[India]], where girls are often discouraged from engaging in [[sport]]s because such activity is viewed as "unfeminine", as is the possibility of them becoming too muscular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, a lack of governmental [[legislation]] and intervention can be to blame. In parts of [[South America]] (with the exception of [[Chile]] and [[Colombia]]), there are no laws that make physical education compulsory: thus, it is omitted from many schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, such as in areas of the [[United States]], the mandated physical education hours are simply not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/education/even-as-schools-battle-obesity-physical-education-is-sidelined.html|title=Even as Obesity Concerns Rise, Physical Education Is Sidelined|last=Baker|first=Al|date=2012-07-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 33 states, students are permitted to be exempt from physical education courses by replacing them with other activities such as marching band practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/2012-shape-of-the-nation-_n_2130115.html|title=Physical Education Programs Stalled By State Loopholes: 2012 Shape Of The Nation Report|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of school, children often fail to engage in physical activity due to lack of [[physical literacy]], inadequate [[Sleep deprivation|sleep]], the increasing attractiveness of rival pastimes such as [[video game]]s, and parents that do not play their part. It is important that parents allow their children the full opportunity to participate in both formal and informal sports and promote healthy physical activity levels. Also, in achievement-oriented populations such as those seen in [[China]], there is an increased emphasis on [[Test (assessment)|academic results]] which also detracts from physical activity time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/05/30/lack_of_physical_education_weighs_heavily_on_many/ |title=Lack of physical education weighs heavily on many |publisher=The Boston Globe |author=Lisa Wangsness |author2= April Simpson |date=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterioration of physical education in schools combined with the elimination of playgrounds and other play facilities forces children to stay inactive and inside for most of the school day which can have serious long-term consequences.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiler|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Is the Lack of Physical Activity Strategy for Children Complicit Mass Child Neglect?|url=|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
[[File:Medical complications of obesity.png|thumb|Physical consequences of obesity]]
An increase in [[sedentary lifestyle]] due to a lack of physical education at home and at school has many physical and psychological consequences on a child in the short and long term.

=== Physical ===
According to a Portuguese study, children with sedentary lifestyles have nine times poorer [[motor coordination]] than active children of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Luís|last2=Santos|first2=Rute|last3=Pereira|first3=Beatriz|last4=Lopes|first4=Vítor Pires|date=2012-11-01|title=Associations between sedentary behavior and motor coordination in children|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.22310/abstract|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|pages=746–752|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22310|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have worsened [[bone density]], [[Physical strength|strength]], and [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/being-active-etre-actif/tips-conseils-eng.php|title=Children and physical activity|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, they are more likely to use [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[drug]]s than their active peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/being-active-etre-actif/tips-conseils-eng.php|title=Children and physical activity|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Health Canada and the Public health Agency of|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedentary behaviour is strongly associated with [[obesity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2011001/article/11397-eng.htm|title=Physical activity of Canadian children and youth: Accelerometer results from the 2007 to 2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this imparts a great health risk. Obese children are more likely to have [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], high [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[sleep apnea]], [[menstrual cycle]] abnormalities, [[bone]] and [[joint]] problems, increased [[cancer]] risk, and reduced balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/surgery/bariatric/weight-loss-surgery/adolescent-weight-loss/Pages/health-risks.aspx|title=Health Risks of Childhood Obesity - Bariatric and Metabolic Institute {{!}} UC San Diego Health|website=UC Health - UC San Diego|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also more likely to be obese adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childhood physical inactivity has been correlated to cholesterol and fatty streaks in the aorta in the first decade of life and moves to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body in the second and third decade of life, causing health issues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A lack of physical activity is one of the main causes for obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other physical health issues among children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guedes|first=Claudia|date=2007|title=Physical Education and Physical Activity: A Historical Perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|volume=78|pages=31-48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a direct correlation between active participation in physical activity and the health of school age children, therefore a lack of physical education would cause a lack in physical activity in children, leading to worse health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

As exercise is known to improve well-being and reduce [[Stress (biology)|stress]], physical inactivity is correlated with poor psychological health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Donna L|year=1996|title=Cut-backs to physical education consulting services: consequences and concerns.|url=|journal=CAHPER Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as an increase of major [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Win|first=Sithu|last2=Parakh|first2=Kapil|last3=Eze-Nliam|first3=Chete M.|last4=Gottdiener|first4=John S.|last5=Kop|first5=Willem J.|last6=Ziegelstein|first6=Roy C.|date=2011-03-15|title=Depressive symptoms, physical inactivity and risk of cardiovascular mortality in older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study|url=http://heart.bmj.com/content/97/6/500|journal=Heart|language=en|volume=97|issue=6|pages=500–505|doi=10.1136/hrt.2010.209767|issn=1468-201X|pmc=3044493|pmid=21339320}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a link between obesity and psychiatric illness and the two feed on each other in a vicious cycle.

A lack of physical activity is associated with poorer [[Concentration (psychology)|concentration]] and [[Academic achievement|academic performance]], particularly in [[mathematics]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201501/|title=Physical Activity, Fitness, and Physical Education: Effects on Academic Performance|last=Harold W.

Obesity induced from lack of exercise also contributes to a decrease in general mental health. Overweight children and teens are more likely to suffer from poor [[self-esteem]], negative [[body image]], [[teasing]], and [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher levels of sedentary and lower levels of physical education are linked to worse mental health and lower cognitive function among children.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== In Canada ==

=== Current trends ===
The majority of Canadian children aged 5 to 17 years old (91%) do not meet the daily physical activity recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Canadian physical education programs are improving significantly, with 61-80% of schools offering a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education classes per week in 2016, and participation levels in [[organized sport]] are on the rise, Canadian school programs are ineffective in encouraging healthy habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, most Canadian children (56%) lack physical literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they face many issues related to lifestyle. These include sedentary behaviours such as increased screen time averaging 176 minutes a day from TVs and video games to the detriment of active play. There is also the inevitable decrease in [[Human-powered transport|active transportation]], more [[sleep deprivation]], and a poor quality of [[Dieting|diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These lifestyle trends have caused youth obesity rates to nearly triple over the past 30 years. In 2013, this consisted of 28% of Canadian children ages 5–19 that were classified as [[overweight]] or [[Obesity|obese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/about/|title=About - Childhood Obesity Foundation|newspaper=Childhood Obesity Foundation|access-date=2016-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

==== Recommendations and Regulations ====
The Canadian Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (CAHPERD) has recommended that Canadian schools and [[Board of education|school boards]] take action through specific academic initiatives to ensuring that their physical education [[curriculum]] is effective at encouraging and instilling healthy exercise habits in young Canadians. CAHPERD has suggested that schools focus on checking the quality (adequate facilities, budget and research-verified techniques) and quantity (minimum 30 minutes a day) of a school's physical education courses as well as the professional qualifications of the educators. The consultants should check that classes meet the needs of all students irrespective of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sex]], [[gender]], and [[Agility|ability level]]. The courses should also encourage participation and [[skill]] development, with a healthy balance of [[Competitiveness|competitive]] and noncompetitive activities. Moreover, it is of utmost importance that [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] and [[physical education]] be encouraged by the [[teacher]]: they should never be used to [[Punishment|punish]] a student (such as what is seen through the common practice of making children run if they misbehave). Outside of class hours, CAHPERD recommends that schools provide opportunities for [[Intramural sports|intramural]] activities and involve [[parent]]s in the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phecanada.ca/advocacy/advocacy-tools/making-case-physical-education-canada-presentation-kit-leaders|title=Making the Case for Physical Education in Canada: A Presentation Kit for Leaders {{!}} PHE Canada|date=2010-07-23|website=www.phecanada.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pan-Canadian Public Health Network first decided to prioritize the issue of childhood obesity in September 2010 by creating the framework ''Curbing Childhood Obesity: An overview of the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights.'' In this project, federal, provincial and territorial Ministers of Health agreed to focus on three goals: increasing the predominance of [[Nutrition|nutritious]] food choices, addressing obesity at an early age, and creating better spaces for children that favour physical activity and [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]]. This has allowed the [[action plan]] ''Towards a Healthier Canada'' to be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hp-ps/hl-mvs/framework-cadre/intro-eng.php|title=Curbing Childhood Obesity: An Overview of the FPT Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights - Public Health Agency of Canada|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Public Health Agency of|website=www.phac-aspc.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Physical Activity guidelines for children ages 5 to 17 consist of at least 1 hour of daily physical activity. Their exercise should range in intensity from [[Moderate exercise|moderate]] (inducing light [[perspiration]] and harder [[breathing]]) to vigorous (inducing heavy perspiration and heavy breathing). Examples of moderate exercise include [[Bicycle|bike]] riding and [[playground]] activities, and examples of vigorous exercise include [[running]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming.]] It is recommended that they engage in both vigorous activities and activities strengthening bone and muscles at least three times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csep.ca/en/guidelines/24-hour-movement-guidelines|title=Guidelines|website=www.csep.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology also recommends that children ages 5 to 17 limit their sedentary activities, such as [[television]] and video games, [[Transport|sedentary transport]], and extensive [[sitting]]. It is advised that children limit their recreational screen time to a maximum of 120 minutes a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csep.ca/en/guidelines/24-hour-movement-guidelines|title=Guidelines|website=www.csep.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Childhood Obesity]] Foundation'', a Canadian initiative, has invented the 5-2-1-0 [[mnemonic]] to remember the national lifestyle recommendations. This consists of 5 [[Serving size|servings]] or more of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]] per day, no more than 2 hours of screen time a day, 1 hour of [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] or more per day, and 0 [[sugary drink]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/about/|title=About - Childhood Obesity Foundation|newspaper=Childhood Obesity Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of ''Towards a Healthier Canada'', many initiatives have been launched to meet the three goals, and they vary from [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] to province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phn-rsp.ca/thcpr-vcpsre-2015/index-eng.php|title=Towards a Healthier Canada : Compilation of Initiatives|last=|first=|date=|website=towardsahealthiercanada.ca|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are projects made in the name of a framework or jurisdictional approach/governmental department that are either targeted at schools, at a community, or in partnership with other organizations or companies.

== In the United States ==

=== Current Trends ===
Nearly 10 million [[Child|children]] and [[Adolescence|adolescents]] in the United States ages 6–19 are considered [[overweight]] because the lack of physical education in schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Physical Education in Schools|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3010854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children aged 6–11 have also more than doubled in rate of [[obesity]] over the last twenty years. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Leslie Haub|title=Childhood obesity and the lack of physical education programs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGNXNAAACAAJ|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual states have set requirements for physical education in their schools, but how physical education is conducted across the country has not been established. Yet, physical education has been a common practice of the K-12 education curriculum in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Thomas|date=2017|title=Studies of Physical Education in the United States Using SOFIT: A Review|url=|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume=88|pages=492-502|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The No Child Left Behind Act has created an environment in which physical education, art and music have been left behind, viewed as "nonessential" courses. Federal funding is more dependent on schools enhancing their math and reading programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sallis|first=James|date=2012|title=Physical Education's Role in Public Health|url=|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume=83|pages=125-135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
One program the United States has adopted to decrease obesity are before-school exercise programs with elementary aged children. One in particular consists of reaching 100 miles before the end of the school year. Each milestone of 25 miles the child will earn a check mark on a tee-shirt. They will then be rewarded at 100 miles with a trophy and an announcement over the school loudspeaker. Walking is supervised by teachers and done around school grounds or inside the school. This is a great way for a child to improve health, concentration, confidence and happiness.

Throughout the past two decades, federal support for physical education in the public health sector has increased dramatically. Since 1992, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has funded state education agencies to get them to partner with state health departments to promote physical activity and healthy eating in schools among young people. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In February 2010, first lady Michelle Obama started the "Let's Move" initiative to address the childhood obesity epidemic. Efforts to engage in schools to fight against childhood obesity were taken within 1 year of establishing the program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Budget cuts in the United States have led to less funding and support for physical education because it is not a "core" subject.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== In China ==

=== Current Trends ===
Even though obesity has increased among most of the population in China, the burden of obesity has shifted onto the lower educated population, likely due to a lack of physical education or health education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Huijun|date=2013|title=Program and Policy Options for Preventing Obesity in China|url=|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=14|pages=134-140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students in China are beginning to gain equal opportunities to physical education and sports to further improve their physical health and strength.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Chiung-Tzu Lucetta|date=2017|title=The History of Sports and Physical Education in China|url=|journal=World Leisure Journal|volume=59|pages=326-337|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport and physical education in China is extremely influenced by Confucianism which emphasizes collectivism. The values it holds emphasizes self-sacrifice and subordination of one's interests to those of others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
In 2011, The Chinese Ministry of Education has developed standards for physical education in schools. These emphasize enhancing children's health development is the primary goal of physical education in schools.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ding|first=Haiyong|date=2014|title=A Review of Scholarly and Research Work in Physical Education in China During the First Decade of the 21st Century|url=|journal=Quest|volume=66|pages=117-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards include: 

* "Standard 1: Physical activity participation—Students participate in physical activities and are able to enjoy exercise and experience success."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 2: Mastery of knowledge, skill, and safe exercise methods—Students learn knowledge about exercise, perform physical skills, understand safe exercise principles, and learn self-defense."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 3: Developing physical health—Students learn and master knowledge and method of maintaining health, develop and sustain healthy posture and bodily shape, develop and maintain physical fitness, and improve adaptive ability in natural environments."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 4: Developing mental health—Students learn to develop mental strength, control emotions, develop ability to collaborate and cooperate, and follow ethical norms of physical activity."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The General Administration of Sport in China has been one of the leading government agencies that promotes the development of physical education and physical health in the elementary and college levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The government has for the most part supported physical education and sport in school, but has often abused it as a political tool which leads to ignoring its importance and the needs of individual students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In European (EU) Countries ==

=== Current Trends ===
In the EU, physical education is a mandatory subject in general education. The time dedicated to physical education varies greatly from country to country.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2016|title=Physical Education in EU Schools|url=|journal=Briefing European Parliamentary Research Service|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About half of EU countries devote 10% of their school curriculum to physical education. Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia devote 15%, while Ireland only 4%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matejek|first=Črtomir|date=2014|title=Physical Education in Primary Education in EU Countries|url=|journal=Revija za Elementarno Izobraževanje|volume=7|pages=57-165|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of all EU countries, France devotes the most time to physical education in elementary school, a total of 108 hours, which is only 10% of the total teaching time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The primary education designers in European countries view physical education as less important than other subjects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Physical inactivity is responsible for over 500,000 deaths per year in the European Union and accounts for economic costs of over €80 billion per year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Funding for physical education in EU schools is poor, which has led to poor quality physical education. This lack of funding is reflected in poor quality and lack of equipment at EU schools in respectively 26% and 38% of EU countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
In 2007, the European Parliament's Resolution on the Role of Sport in Education helped parliament conclude that physical education is “the only school subject which seeks to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle and focuses on their overall physical and mental development, as well as imparting important social values such as fairness, self-discipline, solidarity, team spirit, tolerance and fair play…” and one of the most important tools for social integration.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardman|first=Ken|date=2008|title=Physical Education in Schools: A Global Perspective|url=|journal=University of Worcester, UK|volume=1|pages=5-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Parliament's Resolution places physical education on the European political agenda, highlighting its importance.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The European Physical Education Association recommends daily physical education in elementary grades up to 11 or 12 years of age and 3 hours per week in post-elementary and high school grades.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Also known as [[Elements of Algebra]], Euler's textbook on elementary algebra is one of the first to set out algebra in the modern form we would recognize today.  The first volume deals with determinate equations, while the second part deals with [[Diophantine equation]]s.  The last section contains a proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] for the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, making some valid assumptions regarding '''Q'''({{radic|−3}}) that Euler did not prove.&lt;ref name=Weil239&gt;{{Cite book| last = Weil | first = André  | title = Number Theory: An approach through history From Hammurapi to Legendre | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1984 | pages = 239–242 | isbn = 0-8176-3141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Group (mathematics)|Group theory]]====

=====''Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations''=====
*[[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (1770)
The title means "Reflections on the algebraic solutions of equations". Made the prescient observation that the roots of the [[Lagrange resolvent]] of a polynomial equation are tied to permutations of the roots of the original equation, laying a more general foundation for what had previously been an ad hoc analysis and helping motivate the later development of the theory of [[permutation groups]], [[group theory]], and [[Galois theory]]. The Lagrange resolvent also introduced the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of order 3.

====''Articles Publiés par Galois dans les Annales de Mathématiques''====

* Journal de Mathematiques pures et Appliquées, II (1846)
Posthumous publication of the mathematical manuscripts of [[Évariste Galois]] by [[Joseph Liouville]].  Included are Galois' papers ''Mémoire sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations par radicaux'' and ''Des équations primitives qui sont solubles par radicaux''.

The first comprehensive work on [[transformation group]]s, serving as the foundation for the modern theory of [[Lie group]]s.

====''Solvability of groups of odd order''====

*[[Walter Feit]] and [[John Griggs Thompson|John Thompson]] (1960)
'''Description:''' Gave a complete proof of the [[Feit–Thompson theorem|solvability of finite groups of odd order]], establishing the long-standing Burnside conjecture that all finite non-abelian simple groups are of even order. Many of the original techniques used in this paper were used in the eventual [[classification of finite simple groups]].

====[[Homological algebra]]====

====''Homological Algebra''====

* [[Henri Cartan]] and [[Samuel Eilenberg]] (1956)
Provided the first fully worked out treatment of abstract homological algebra, unifying previously disparate presentations of homology and cohomology for [[associative algebra]]s, [[Lie algebra]]s, and [[group (mathematics)|group]]s into a single theory.

===="Sur Quelques Points d'Algèbre Homologique"====

* [[Alexander Grothendieck]] (1957)
Revolutionized [[homological algebra]] by introducing [[abelian category|abelian categories]] and providing a general framework for Cartan and Eilenberg's notion of [[derived functor]]s.

==[[Algebraic geometry]]==

==="Theorie der Abelschen Functionen"===

* [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1857)
'''Publication data:''' ''Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik''

Developed the concept of Riemann surfaces and their topological properties beyond Riemann's 1851 thesis work, proved an index theorem for the genus (the original formulation of the [[Riemann–Hurwitz formula]]), proved the Riemann inequality for the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles (the original formulation of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]]), discussed birational transformations of a given curve and the dimension of the corresponding moduli space of inequivalent curves of a given genus, and solved more general inversion problems than those investigated by [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] and [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]].  [[André Weil]] once wrote that this paper "''is one of the greatest pieces of mathematics that has ever been written; there is not a single word in it that is not of consequence.''" &lt;ref name=Krieger2007&gt;

===''Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents''===

* [[Jean-Pierre Serre]]
'''Publication data:''' ''Annals of Mathematics'', 1955

''FAC'', as it is usually called, was foundational for the use of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] in algebraic geometry, extending beyond the case of [[complex manifold]]s.  Serre introduced [[Čech cohomology]] of sheaves in this paper, and, despite some technical deficiencies, revolutionized formulations of algebraic geometry.  For example, the [[long exact sequence]] in sheaf cohomology allows one to show that some surjective maps of sheaves induce surjective maps on sections; specifically, these are the maps whose kernel (as a sheaf) has a vanishing first cohomology group.  The dimension of a vector space of sections of a [[coherent sheaf]] is finite, in [[projective geometry]], and such dimensions include many discrete invariants of varieties, for example [[Hodge number]]s.  While Grothendieck's [[derived functor]] cohomology has replaced Čech cohomology for technical reasons, actual calculations, such as of the cohomology of projective space, are usually carried out by Čech techniques, and for this reason Serre's paper remains important.

===''[[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry|Géométrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique]]''===

* [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1956)
In [[mathematics]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[analytic geometry]] are closely related subjects, where ''analytic geometry'' is the theory of [[complex manifold]]s and the more general [[analytic geometry|analytic space]]s defined locally by the vanishing of [[analytic function]]s of [[several complex variables]]. A (mathematical) theory of the relationship between the two was put in place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from [[Hodge theory]]. (''NB'' While [[analytic geometry]] as use of Cartesian coordinates is also in a sense included in the scope of algebraic geometry, that is not the topic being discussed in this article.) The major paper consolidating the theory was ''Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique'' by [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]], now usually referred to as ''GAGA''. A ''GAGA-style result'' would now mean any theorem of comparison, allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and their morphisms, and a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects and holomorphic mappings.

==="Le théorème de Riemann–Roch, d'après A. Grothendieck"===

* [[Armand Borel]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1958)
Borel and Serre's exposition of Grothendieck's version of the [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem|Riemann–Roch theorem]], published after Grothendieck made it clear that he was not interested in writing up his own result.  Grothendieck reinterpreted both sides of the formula that [[Hirzebruch]] proved in 1953 in the framework of [[morphisms]] between varieties, resulting in a sweeping generalization.&lt;ref name=Jackson2004&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Jackson  | first = Allyn  |date=October 2004 | title = Comme Appelé du Néant — As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck  | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 51  | issue = 9  | pages = 1045–1046

===''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]''===

* [[Alexander Grothendieck]] (1960–1967)
Written with the assistance of [[Jean Dieudonné]], this is [[Grothendieck]]'s exposition of his reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry.  It has become the most important foundational work in modern algebraic geometry.  The approach expounded in EGA, as these books are known, transformed the field and led to monumental advances.

===''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]''===

* [[Alexander Grothendieck]] et al.
These seminar notes on Grothendieck's reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry report on work done at [[IHÉS]] starting in the 1960s. SGA 1 dates from the seminars of 1960–1961, and the last in the series, SGA 7, dates from 1967 to 1969. In contrast to EGA, which is intended to set foundations, SGA describes ongoing research as it unfolded in Grothendieck's seminar; as a result, it is quite difficult to read, since many of the more elementary and foundational results were relegated to EGA. One of the major results building on the results in SGA is [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the last of the open [[Weil conjectures]] in the early 1970s. Other authors who worked on one or several volumes of SGA include [[Michel Raynaud]], [[Michael Artin]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Jean-Louis Verdier]], [[Pierre Deligne]], and [[Nicholas Katz]].

==[[Number theory]]==

===''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]''===

*[[Brahmagupta]] (628)
Brahmagupta's [[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]] is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. The current system of the four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) based on the Hindu-Arabic number system also first appeared in Brahmasphutasiddhanta. It was also one of the first texts to provide concrete ideas on positive and negative numbers.

*[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1801)
The ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' is a profound and masterful book on [[number theory]] written by [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and first published in 1801 when Gauss was 24. In this book Gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as [[Fermat]], [[Euler]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and adds many important new results of his own.  Among his contributions was the first complete proof known of the [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], the first two published proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], a deep investigation of binary [[quadratic forms]] going beyond Lagrange's work in Recherches d'Arithmétique, a first appearance of [[Gauss sums]], [[cyclotomy#Cyclotomic fields|cyclotomy]], and the theory of [[constructible polygon]]s with a particular application to the constructibility of the regular [[Heptadecagon|17-gon]].  Of note, in section V, article 303 of Disquisitiones, Gauss summarized his calculations of [[Class number (number theory)|class numbers]] of imaginary quadratic number fields, and in fact found all imaginary quadratic number fields of class numbers 1, 2, and 3 (confirmed in 1986) as he had [[Class number problem|conjectured]].&lt;ref name=irelandrosen&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Ireland | first1 = K. |last2 = Rosen | first2 = M. | title = A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1993  | location = New York, New York  | pages = 358–361  | isbn = 0-387-97329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In section VII, article 358, Gauss proved what can be interpreted as the first non-trivial case of the Riemann Hypothesis for curves over finite fields (the [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves#Hasse-Weil Bound|Hasse–Weil theorem]]).&lt;ref name=silvermantate&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Silverman | first1 = J. |last2 = Tate | first2 = J. | title = Rational Points on Elliptic Curves  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1992 | location = New York, New York  | isbn = 0-387-97825-9  | page = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Bernhard Riemann]] (1859)
"Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse" (or "On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude") is a seminal 8-page paper by Bernhard Riemann published in the November 1859 edition of the ''Monthly Reports of the Berlin Academy''. Although it is the only paper he ever published on number theory, it contains ideas which influenced dozens of researchers during the late 19th century and up to the present day. The paper consists primarily of definitions, heuristic arguments, sketches of proofs, and the application of powerful analytic methods; all of these have become essential concepts and tools of modern [[analytic number theory]].  It also contains the famous [[Riemann Hypothesis]], one of the most important open problems in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Edwards (mathematician)|H. M.

===''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]''===

* [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] and [[Richard Dedekind]]
''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]'' (''Lectures on Number Theory'') is a textbook of [[number theory]] written by [[Germany|German]] mathematicians P. G. Lejeune Dirichlet and R. Dedekind, and published in 1863.
The ''Vorlesungen'' can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of [[Fermat]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], and the modern number theory of Dedekind, [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. Dirichlet does not explicitly recognise the concept of the [[group theory|group]] that is central to [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]], but many of his proofs show an implicit understanding of group theory

Unified and made accessible many of the developments in [[algebraic number theory]] made during the nineteenth century.

===''Fourier Analysis in Number Fields and Hecke's Zeta-Functions''===

* [[John Tate]] (1950)
Generally referred to simply as ''[[Tate's Thesis]]'', Tate's [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Ph.D. thesis, under [[Emil Artin]], is a reworking of [[Erich Hecke]]'s theory of zeta- and ''L''-functions in terms of [[Fourier analysis]] on the [[Adele ring|adeles]]. The introduction of these methods into number theory made it possible to formulate extensions of Hecke's results to more general ''L''-functions such as those arising from [[automorphic form]]s.

==="[[Automorphic Forms on GL(2)]]"===

* [[Hervé Jacquet]] and [[Robert Langlands]] (1970)
This publication offers evidence towards Langlands' conjectures by reworking and expanding the classical theory of [[modular form]]s and their ''L''-functions through the introduction of representation theory.

Proved the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields, settling the last of the open [[Weil conjectures]].

==="Endlichkeitssätze für abelsche Varietäten über Zahlkörpern"===

* [[Gerd Faltings]] (1983)
Faltings proves a collection of important results in this paper, the most famous of which is the first proof of the [[Mordell conjecture]] (a conjecture dating back to 1922). Other theorems proved in this paper include an instance of the [[Tate conjecture]] (relating the [[homomorphism]]s between two [[abelian varieties]] over a [[number field]] to the homomorphisms between their [[Tate module]]s) and some finiteness results concerning abelian varieties over number fields with certain properties.

==="Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat's Last Theorem"===

* [[Andrew Wiles]] (1995)
This article proceeds to prove a special case of the [[Modularity theorem|Shimura–Taniyama conjecture]] through the study of the [[Galois deformation theory|deformation theory]] of [[Galois representations]]. This in turn implies the famed [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The proof's method of identification of a [[deformation ring]] with a [[Hecke operator|Hecke algebra]] (now referred to as an ''R=T'' theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory.

Some of its important developments in calculus include: the fundamental ideas of [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[Integral|integration]], the [[derivative]], [[differential equation]]s, term by term integration, numerical integration by means of infinite series, the relationship between the area of a curve and its integral, and the [[mean value theorem]].

====''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''====

*[[Isaac Newton]]
The '''''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''''' ([[Latin]]: "mathematical principles of natural philosophy", often ''Principia'' or ''Principia Mathematica'' for short) is a three-volume work by [[Isaac Newton]] published on 5 July 1687. Perhaps the most influential scientific book ever published, it contains the statement of [[Newton's laws of motion]] forming the foundation of [[classical mechanics]] as well as his [[Gravity|law of universal gravitation]], and derives [[laws of Kepler|Kepler's laws]] for the motion of the [[planet]]s (which were first obtained empirically). Here was born the practice, now so standard we identify it with science, of explaining nature by postulating mathematical axioms and demonstrating that their conclusion are observable phenomena.  In formulating his physical theories, Newton freely used his unpublished work on calculus.  When he submitted Principia for publication, however, Newton chose to recast the majority of his proofs as geometric arguments.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{Cite web| last = Gray | first = Jeremy| title=MAA Book Review: Reading the Principia: The Debate on Newton's Mathematical Methods for Natural Philosophy from 1687 to 1736 by Niccolò Guicciardini|url=http://www.maa.org/reviews/readnewton.html| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mathematical monograph on the subject of [[linear space|linear]] [[metric space]]s, bringing the abstract study of [[functional analysis]] to the wider mathematical community.  The book introduced the ideas of a [[normed space]] and the notion of a so-called ''B''-space, a [[complete metric space|complete]] normed space.  The ''B''-spaces are now called [[Banach space]]s and are one of the basic objects of study in all areas of modern mathematical analysis.

Introduced [[Fourier analysis]], specifically [[Fourier series]]. Key contribution was to not simply use [[trigonometric series]], but to model ''all'' functions by trigonometric series.
{{cquote|&lt;math&gt;\varphi(y)=a\cos\frac{\pi y}{2}+a'\cos 3\frac{\pi y}{2}+a''\cos5\frac{\pi y}{2}+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;\cos(2i+1)\frac{\pi y}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and then integrating from &lt;math&gt;y=-1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y=+1&lt;/math&gt; yields:

&lt;math&gt;a_i=\int_{-1}^1\varphi(y)\cos(2i+1)\frac{\pi y}{2}\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;}}
When Fourier submitted his paper in 1807, the committee (which included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Laplace]], [[Étienne-Louis Malus|Malus]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], among others) concluded: ''...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and [...]  his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour''. Making Fourier series rigorous, which in detail took over a century, led directly to a number of developments in analysis, notably the rigorous statement of the integral via the [[Dirichlet integral]] and later the [[Lebesgue integral]].

It laid the foundations of [[Indian mathematics]] and was influential in [[South Asia]] and its surrounding regions, and [[Indian mathematics#Charges of Eurocentrism|perhaps even Greece]]. Among the important geometrical discoveries included in this text are: the earliest list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, the earliest statement of the Pythagorean theorem,  geometric solutions of linear equations, several approximations of [[π]], the first use of irrational numbers, and an accurate computation of the [[square root of 2]], correct to a remarkable five decimal places. Though this was primarily a geometrical text, it also contained some important algebraic developments, including the earliest use of quadratic equations of the forms ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c and ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + bx = c, and integral solutions of simultaneous [[Diophantine equation]]s with up to four unknowns.

This was a Chinese [[mathematics]] book, mostly geometric, composed during the [[Han Dynasty]], perhaps as early as 200 BC. It remained the most important textbook in [[China]] and [[East Asia]] for over a thousand years, similar to the position of Euclid's ''Elements'' in Europe. Among its contents: Linear problems solved using the principle known later in the West as the ''[[rule of false position]]''. Problems with several unknowns, solved by a principle similar to [[Gaussian elimination]]. Problems involving the principle known in the West as the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The earliest solution of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] using a method equivalent to the modern method.

* Unknown (400 CE)
Contains the roots of modern trigonometry. It describes the archeo-astronomy theories, principles and methods of the ancient Hindus. This siddhanta is supposed to be the knowledge that the Sun god gave to an Asura called Maya. It uses sine (jya), cosine (kojya or "perpendicular sine") and inverse sine (otkram jya) for the first time, and also contains the earliest use of the tangent and secant. Later Indian mathematicians such as Aryabhata made references to this text, while later Arabic and Latin translations were very influential in Europe and the Middle East.

===''[[Aryabhatiya]]''===

*[[Aryabhata]] (499 CE)
This was a highly influential text during the Golden Age of mathematics in India. The text was highly concise and therefore elaborated upon in commentaries by later mathematicians. It made significant contributions to geometry and astronomy, including introduction of sine/ cosine, determination of the approximate value of pi and accurate calculation of the earth's circumference.

==[[Category theory]]==

==="General Theory of Natural Equivalences"===

* [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (1945)
The first paper on category theory. Mac Lane later wrote in ''Categories for the Working Mathematician'' that he and Eilenberg introduced categories so that they could introduce functors, and they introduced functors so that they could introduce natural equivalences. Prior to this paper, "natural" was used in an informal and imprecise way to designate constructions that could be made without making any choices. Afterwards, "natural" had a precise meaning which occurred in a wide variety of contexts and had powerful and important consequences.

===''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]''===

* [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (1971, second edition 1998)
Saunders Mac Lane, one of the founders of category theory, wrote this exposition to bring categories to the masses.  Mac Lane brings to the fore the important concepts that make category theory useful, such as [[adjoint functor]]s and [[universal properties]].

===''[[Higher Topos Theory]]''===
* [[Jacob Lurie]] (2010)
''This purpose of this book is twofold: to provide a general introduction to higher category theory (using the formalism of "quasicategories" or "weak Kan complexes"), and to apply this theory to the study of higher versions of Grothendieck topoi. A few applications to classical topology are included.'' (see arXiv.)

==[[Set theory]]==

==="Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen"===

* [[Georg Cantor]] (1874)
'''Online version:''' [http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002155583 Online version]

Contains the first proof that the set of all real numbers is uncountable; also contains a proof that the set of algebraic numbers is countable. (See [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article]].)

===''[[Grundzüge der Mengenlehre]]''===

* [[Felix Hausdorff]]
First published in 1914, this was the first comprehensive introduction to set theory. Besides the systematic treatment of known results in set theory, the book also contains chapters on [[measure theory]] and topology, which were then still considered parts of set theory. Here Hausdorff presents and develops highly original material which was later to become the basis for those areas.

==="The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory"===

* [[Kurt Gödel]] (1938)
Gödel proves the results of the title.  Also, in the process, introduces the [[constructible universe|class L of constructible sets]], a major influence in the development of axiomatic set theory.

==="The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis"===

* [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul J. Cohen]] (1963, 1964)
Cohen's breakthrough work proved the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] and axiom of choice with respect to [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].  In proving this Cohen introduced the concept of ''[[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]'' which led to many other major results in axiomatic set theory.

==[[Logic]]==

===''[[The Laws of Thought]]''===

* [[George Boole]] (1854)
Published in 1854, [[The Laws of Thought]] was the first book to provide a mathematical foundation for logic. Its aim was a complete re-expression and extension of Aristotle's logic in the language of mathematics. Boole's work founded the discipline of algebraic logic and would later be central for [[Claude Shannon]] in the development of digital logic.

===''[[Begriffsschrift]]''===

* [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879)
Published in 1879, the title '''''Begriffsschrift''''' is usually translated as ''concept writing'' or ''concept notation''; the full title of the book identifies it as "''a [[formula]] [[language]], modelled on that of [[arithmetic]], of pure [[thought]]''". Frege's motivation for developing his [[formal logical system]] was similar to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s desire for a ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]''. Frege defines a logical calculus to support his research in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. '''''Begriffsschrift''''' is both the name of the book and the calculus defined therein.  It was arguably the most significant publication in [[logic]] since [[Aristotle]].

===''[[Formulario mathematico]]''===

* [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1895)
First published in 1895, the '''Formulario mathematico''' was the first mathematical book written entirely in a [[formal language|formalized language]]. It contained a description of [[mathematical logic]] and many important theorems in other branches of mathematics. Many of the notations introduced in the book are now in common use.

===''[[Principia Mathematica]]''===

* [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (1910–1913)
The '''''Principia Mathematica''''' is a three-volume work on the foundations of [[mathematics]], written by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and published in 1910–1913. It is an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]]. The questions remained whether a contradiction could be derived from the Principia's axioms, and whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system. These questions were settled, in a rather surprising way, by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] in 1931.

*  [[Kurt Gödel]] (1931)
'''Online version:''' [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p03501kn35215860/ Online version]

In [[mathematical logic]], '''[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]''' are two celebrated theorems proved by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1931.
The first incompleteness theorem states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For any formal system such that (1) it is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistent ([[omega-consistent]]), (2) it has a [[recursively definable]] set of [[axioms]] and [[rules of derivation]], and (3) every [[computable function#Computable sets and relations|recursive]] relation of natural numbers is definable in it, there exists a formula of the system such that, according to the intended interpretation of the system, it expresses a truth about natural numbers and yet it is not a [[theorem]] of the system.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==[[Combinatorics]]==

==="On sets of integers containing no k elements in arithmetic progression"===

*[[Endre Szemerédi]] (1975)
Settled a conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán]] (now known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]]) that if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.  Szemerédi's solution has been described as a "masterpiece of combinatorics"&lt;ref name=Steele2008&gt;{{Cite journal|date=April 2008 | title = 2008 Steele Prizes; Seminal Contribution to Research: Endre Szemerédi  | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 55  | issue = 4  | page = 488  | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200804/tx080400486p.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it introduced new ideas and tools to the field including a weak form of the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]].&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{Cite journal|date=April 2013 | title = Interview with Endre Szemerédi  | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 60  | issue = 2  | page = 226  | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/201302/rnoti-p221.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 27 January 2013 | doi=10.1090/noti948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nash equilibrium]]

===''[[On Numbers and Games]]''===

*[[John Horton Conway]]
The book is in two, {0,1&lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, parts. The zeroth part is about numbers, the first part about games – both the values of games and also some real games that can be played such as [[Nim]], [[Hackenbush]], [[map-coloring games#Col and Snort|Col and Snort]] amongst the  many described.

===''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''===

*[[Elwyn Berlekamp]], [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]]
A compendium of information on [[mathematical games]].  It was first published in 1982 in two volumes, one focusing on [[Combinatorial game theory]] and [[surreal numbers]], and the other concentrating on a number of specific games.

==[[Fractal]]s==

===''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]''===

*[[Benoît Mandelbrot]]
A discussion of self-similar curves that have fractional dimensions between 1 and 2. These curves are examples of fractals, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975.
Shows Mandelbrot's early thinking on fractals, and is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work.

==[[Numerical analysis]]==

===[[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]]===

====''Method of Fluxions''====

* [[Isaac Newton]]
''[[Method of Fluxions]]'' was a book written by [[Isaac Newton]]. The book was completed in 1671, and published in 1736.  Within this book, Newton describes a method (the [[Newton's method|Newton–Raphson method]]) for finding the real zeroes of a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

====''Essai d'une nouvelle méthode pour déterminer les maxima et les minima des formules intégrales indéfinies''====

* [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (1761)
Major early work on the [[calculus of variations]], building upon some of Lagrange's prior investigations as well as those of [[Euler]].  Contains investigations of minimal surface determination as well as the initial appearance of [[Lagrange multipliers]].

===="Математические методы организации и планирования производства"====

* [[Leonid Kantorovich]] (1939) "[The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization]" (in Russian).
Kantorovich wrote the first paper on production planning, which used Linear Programs as the model. He received the Nobel prize for this work in 1975.

===="Decomposition Principle for Linear Programs"====

* [[George Dantzig]] and P. Wolfe
* Operations Research 8:101–111, 1960.
Dantzig's is considered the father of [[linear programming]] in the western world. He independently invented the [[simplex algorithm]]. Dantzig and Wolfe worked on decomposition algorithms for large-scale linear programs in factory and production planning.

===="How Good is the Simplex Algorithm?"====

* [[Victor Klee]] and George J. Minty
* {{cite book|title=Inequalities&amp;nbsp;III (Proceedings of the Third Symposium on Inequalities held at the University of California, Los Angeles, Calif., September&amp;nbsp;1–9,&amp;nbsp;1969, dedicated to the memory of Theodore&amp;nbsp;S.

==Early manuscripts==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[History of mathematics]] --&gt;
{{Globalize|date=November 2009}}
These are publications that are not necessarily relevant to a mathematician nowadays, but are nonetheless important publications in the [[history of mathematics]].

===''[[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]''===

* [[Ahmes]] ([[scribe]])

One of the oldest mathematical texts, dating to the [[Second Intermediate Period]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was copied by the scribe [[Ahmes]] (properly ''Ahmose'') from an older [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] [[papyrus]]. It laid the foundations of [[Egyptian mathematics]] and in turn, later influenced [[Greek mathematics|Greek and Hellenistic mathematics]]. Besides describing how to obtain an approximation of π only missing the mark by less than one per cent, it is describes one of the earliest attempts at [[squaring the circle]] and in the process provides persuasive evidence against the theory that the [[Egyptians]] deliberately built their [[pyramid]]s to enshrine the value of π in the proportions. Even though it would be a strong overstatement to suggest that the papyrus represents even rudimentary attempts at analytical geometry, Ahmes did make use of a kind of an analogue of the [[cotangent]].

===''[[Archimedes Palimpsest]]''===

*[[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]
Although the only mathematical tools at its author's disposal were what we might now consider secondary-school [[geometry]], he used those methods with rare brilliance, explicitly using [[infinitesimal]]s to solve problems that would now be treated by integral calculus.  Among those problems were that of the [[center of gravity]] of a solid hemisphere, that of the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and that of the area of a region bounded by a [[parabola]] and one of its secant lines.  For explicit details of the method used, see [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals]].

===''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''===

*[[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]

'''Online version:''' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045847/http://web.fccj.org/~ethall/archmede/sandreck.htm Online version]

The first known (European) [[numeral system|system of number-naming]] that can be expanded beyond the needs of everyday life.

==Textbooks==

===''[[Synopsis of Pure Mathematics]]''===

* [[G. S. Carr]]
Contains over 6000 theorems of mathematics, assembled by George Shoobridge Carr for the purpose of training his students for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams. Studied extensively by [[Ramanujan]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FTgAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=george+shoobridge+carr#PPR7,M1 (first half here)]

===''[[Éléments de mathématique]]''===

* [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]
One of the most influential books in French mathematical literature. It introduces some of the notations and definitions that are now usual (the symbol ∅ or the term bijective for example). Characterized by an extreme level of rigour, formalism and generality (up to the point of being highly criticized for that), its publication started in 1939 and is still unfinished today.

===''[[Arithmetick: or, The Grounde of Arts]]''===

* [[Robert Recorde]]
Written in 1542, it was the first really popular arithmetic book written in the English Language.

===''[[Cocker's Arithmetick]]''===

* [[Edward Cocker]] (authorship disputed)
Textbook of arithmetic published in 1678 by John Hawkins, who claimed to have edited manuscripts left by Edward Cocker, who had died in 1676.  This influential mathematics textbook used to teach arithmetic in schools in the United Kingdom for over 150 years.

===''[[The Schoolmaster's Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical]]''===

* [[Thomas Dilworth]]
An early and popular English arithmetic textbook published in [[United States of America|America]] in the 18th century. The book reached from the introductory topics to the advanced in five sections.

===''Geometry''===

*[[Andrei Petrovich Kiselyov|Andrei Kiselyov]]
'''Publication data:''' 1892

The most widely used and influential textbook in Russian mathematics. (See Kiselyov page and [http://www.maa.org/reviews/KiselevGeomI.html MAA review].)

===''[[A Course of Pure Mathematics]]''===

* [[G. H. Hardy]]

A classic textbook in introductory [[mathematical analysis]], written by [[G. H. Hardy]]. It was first published in 1908, and went through many editions. It was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the [[University of Cambridge]], and in schools preparing pupils to study mathematics at Cambridge.  As such, it was aimed directly at "scholarship level" students — the top 10% to 20% by ability. The book contains a large number of difficult problems. The content covers introductory [[calculus]] and the theory of [[infinite series]].

===''[[Moderne Algebra]]''===

* [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B. L. van der Waerden]]
The first introductory textbook (graduate level) expounding the abstract approach to algebra developed by Emil Artin and Emmy Noether.  First published in German in 1931 by Springer Verlag.  A later English translation was published in 1949 by [[Frederick Ungar Publishing Company]].

===''[[Algebra (book)|Algebra]]''===

* [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and [[Garrett Birkhoff]]
A definitive introductory text for abstract algebra using a [[Category theory|category theoretic]] approach. Both a rigorous introduction from first principles, and a reasonably comprehensive survey of the field.

===''Calculus, Vol. 1''===

* [[Tom M. Apostol]]

===''[[Algebraic Geometry (book)|Algebraic Geometry]]''===

* [[Robin Hartshorne]]
The first comprehensive introductory (graduate level) text in algebraic geometry that used the language of schemes and cohomology.  Published in 1977, it lacks aspects of the scheme language which are nowadays considered central, like the [[hom functor|functor of points]].

===''[[Naive Set Theory (book)|Naive Set Theory]]''===

* [[Paul Halmos]]
An undergraduate introduction to not-very-naive set theory which has lasted for decades.  It is still considered by many to be the best introduction to set theory for beginners.  While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects.  Where it differs from a "true" axiomatic set theory book is its character: There are no long-winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about topics like [[large cardinal]]s.  Instead it aims, and succeeds, in being intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.

===''[[Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers]]''===

* [[Wacław Sierpiński]]
The ''nec plus ultra'' reference for basic facts about cardinal and ordinal numbers.  If you have a question about the cardinality of sets occurring in everyday mathematics, the first place to look is this book, first published in the early 1950s but based on the author's lectures on the subject over the preceding 40 years.

===''[[Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs]]''===

* [[Kenneth Kunen]]
This book is not really for beginners, but graduate students with some minimal experience in set theory and formal logic will find it a valuable self-teaching tool, particularly in regard to [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. It is far easier to read than a true reference work such as Jech, ''Set Theory''. It may be the best textbook from which to learn forcing, though it has the disadvantage that the exposition of forcing relies somewhat on the earlier presentation of Martin's axiom.

===''Topologie''===

* [[Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov]]
* [[Heinz Hopf]]
First published round 1935, this text was a pioneering "reference" text book in topology, already incorporating many modern concepts from set-theoretic topology, homological algebra and homotopy theory.

===''General Topology''===

* [[John L. Kelley]]
First published in 1955, for many years the only introductory graduate level textbook in the US, teaching the basics of point set, as opposed to algebraic, topology. Prior to this the material, essential for advanced study in many fields, was only available in bits and pieces from texts on other topics or journal articles.

===''Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint''===

* [[John Milnor]]
This short book introduces the main concepts of differential topology in Milnor's lucid and concise style.  While the book does not cover very much, its topics are explained beautifully in a way that illuminates all their details.

===''[[Number Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre]]''===

* [[André Weil]]
An historical study of number theory, written by one of the 20th century's greatest researchers in the field.  The book covers some thirty six centuries of arithmetical work but the bulk of it is devoted to a detailed study and exposition of the work of Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre.  The author wishes to take the reader into the workshop of his subjects to share their successes and failures. A rare opportunity to see the historical development of a subject through the mind of one of its greatest practitioners.

===''An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers''===

* [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[E. M. Wright]]
''[[An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers]]'' was first published in 1938, and is still in print, with the latest edition being the 6th (2008). It is likely that almost every serious student and researcher into number theory has consulted this book, and probably has it on their bookshelf. It was not intended to be a textbook, and is rather an introduction to a wide range of differing areas of number theory which would now almost certainly be covered in separate volumes. The writing style has long been regarded as exemplary, and the approach gives insight into a variety of areas without requiring much more than a good grounding in algebra, calculus and complex numbers.

===''[[Foundations of Differential Geometry]]''===

*[[Shoshichi Kobayashi]] and [[Katsumi Nomizu]]

===''Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I''===

===''Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry II''===

* [[Claire Voisin]]

==Popular writings==

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach''===

* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]
''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]: an Eternal Golden Braid'' is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, first published in 1979 by Basic Books.
It is a book about how the creative achievements of logician Kurt Gödel, artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach interweave. As the author states: "I realized that to me, Gödel and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in different directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the central object, and came up with this book."

===''The World of Mathematics''===

*  [[James R. Newman]]
''[[The World of Mathematics]]'' was specially designed to make mathematics more accessible to the inexperienced. It comprises nontechnical essays on every aspect of the vast subject, including articles by and about scores of eminent mathematicians, as well as literary figures, economists, biologists, and many other eminent thinkers. Includes the work of Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Gregor Mendel, Edmund Halley, Jonathan Swift, John Maynard Keynes, Henri Poincaré, Lewis Carroll, George Boole, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, John von Neumann, and many others. In addition, an informative commentary by distinguished scholar James R. Newman precedes each essay or group of essays, explaining their relevance and context in the history and development of mathematics. Originally published in 1956, it does not include many of the exciting discoveries of the later years of the 20th century but it has no equal as a general historical survey of important topics and applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1269">[[Image:Lung chamber 042.jpg|thumb|A lung counter]]

A '''Lung counter''' is a system consisting of a [[radiation detector]], or detectors, and associated electronics that is used to measure [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]] emitted from [[radioactive material]] that has been inhaled by a person and is sufficiently insoluble as to remain in the [[lung]] for weeks, months, or years.

Often, such a system is housed in a [[low background counting chamber]] whose thick walls will be made of [[low-background steel]] (~20&amp;nbsp;cm thick) and will be lined with ~1&amp;nbsp;cm of lead, then perhaps thin layers of cadmium, or tin, with a final layer of copper.  The purpose of the lead, cadmium (or tin), and copper is to reduce the background in the low energy region of a [[gamma ray|gamma spectrum]] (typically less than 200 keV)

== Calibration ==

As a lung counter is primarily measuring radioactive materials that emit low energy [[gamma ray]]s or [[x-ray]]s, the [[imaging phantom|phantom]] used to calibrate the system must be [[anthropometric]]. An example of such a phantom is the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] Torso Phantom.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Festkörperforschung'') was founded in 1969 and is one of the 82 Max Planck Institutes of the [[Max Planck Society]]. It is located on a campus in Stuttgart, together with the [[Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems]].

== Research Focus ==
Research at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research is focused on the physics and chemistry of condensed matter, including especially complex materials and nanoscale science. In both of these fields, electronic and ionic transport phenomena are of particular interest.

== Organization ==
The institute currently has eight departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.fkf.mpg.de/3721/10_Departments|title=Departments|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic Structure Theory===
Led by Ali Alavi, the Department of Electronic Structure Theory is concerned with the development of [[ab initio]] methods for treating [[correlated electronic systems]], using [[Quantum Monte Carlo]], quantum chemical and many-body methodologies. Ab initio methods (including density functional theory) will be applied to problems of interest in heterogeneous catalysis, surface chemistry, electrochemistry, and photochemistry.

===Solid State Spectroscopy===
The Department of Solid State Spectroscopy is headed by Bernhard Keimer. [[Collective quantum phenomena]] in highly correlated electronic materials are studied by spectroscopic and scattering techniques. Topics of particular current interest include the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides, the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, and the control of electronic phase behavior in metal-oxide superlattices. The department also develops new spectroscopic methods such as high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and spectral ellipsometry.

===Nanoscale Science===
Research efforts in the Department of Nanoscale Science, directed by Klaus Kern, are centered on nanometer-scale science and technology with a focus on the bottom-up paradigm. The aim of the interdisciplinary research at the interface between physics, chemistry and biology is to gain control of materials at the atomic and molecular level, enabling the design of systems and devices with properties determined by quantum behavior on one hand and approaching functionalities of living matter on the other hand.

===Low Dimensional Electron Systems===
The main focus of the scientific work in the Department Low Dimensional Electron Systems is on electronic properties of 2-, 1-, and 0-dimensional electron systems, in particular the influence of quantum phenomena on the transport and optical response. It is headed by [[Klaus von Klitzing]].

===Physical Chemistry of Solids===
Under Joachim Maier, the Department of Physical Chemistry of Solids is concerned with [[electrochemistry]] and [[ion transport]]. Emphasis is laid on ion conductors (such as inorganic or organic proton, metal ion and oxygen ion conductors) and mixed conductors (typically perovskites). The research ranges from the exploration of basic mechanisms to the design of materials for electrochemical applications (batteries, fuel cells, sensors). Of special significance is the scientific foundation of the field Nanoionics.

===Solid State Quantum Electronics===
Induced by quantum mechanical phenomena, heterostructures grown from complex materials offer a fascinating potential to create novel electron systems. Many have outstanding properties that are not otherwise found in nature. The design, growth, and exploration of such electron systems are at the focus of the Department of Solid State Quantum Electronics spearheaded by [[Klaus von Klitzing]].

===Quantum Many-Body Theory===
Directed by Walter Metzner, Electronic properties of solids are analyzed and computed in the Department of Quantum Many-Body Theory with a main emphasis on systems where electronic correlations play a crucial role, such as [[cuprates]], [[manganites]] and other [[transition metal oxides]]. Besides symmetry-breaking phase transitions leading to [[magnetism]], orbital and charge order, or [[superconductivity]], correlations can also cause electron localization and many other striking many-body effects not described by the independent electron approximation.

===[[Quantum materials|Quantum Materials]]===
Entanglement of electrons in solids, in combination with details of the crystal lattice structure, produce a surprisingly rich variety of electronic phases, that are liquid, liquid-crystal and crystalline states of the charge and spin degrees of freedom. These complex electronic phases and the subtle competition among them very often give rise to novel functionality. The Department of Quantum Materials, led by Hidenori Takagi, is studying these interesting novel phases in transition metal oxides and related compounds where the narrow d-bands, which give rise to strong electron correlations, in combination with the rich chemistry of such materials provide excellent opportunities for new discoveries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="716">An '''Measured Environmental Concentration (MEC)''' relates to a chemical substance found in an environmental sample. The concentration of the compound may result from direct contamination, transformation and/or metabolization of a different chemical contaminant, natural origin or a combination of these sources. 

MEC is to be used as a reference in the context of [[Chemical Safety Assessment]]s (CSA) and should be compared with the respective [[Predicted Environmental Concentration]] (PEC) and  [[Predicted No-Effect Concentration]] (PNEC) in order to decide whether exposure model is valid and the compound related risk is controlled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">'''[[Microarchitecture]] simulation''' is an important technique in [[computer architecture]] research and [[computer science]] education. It is a tool for modeling the design and behavior of a [[microprocessor]] and its components, such as the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], [[CPU cache|cache memory]], [[control unit]], and data path, among others. The simulation allows researchers to explore the design space as well as to evaluate the performance and efficiency of novel microarchitecture features. For example, several microarchitecture components, such as [[branch predictors]], [[re-order buffer]], and [[trace cache]], went through numerous simulation cycles before they become common components in contemporary microprocessors of today. In addition, the simulation also enables educators to teach computer organization and architecture courses with hand-on experiences.

For system-level simulation of computer hardware, please refer to the [[full system simulation]].

==Classification==
Microarchitecture simulation can be classified into multiple categories according to input types and level of details. Specifically, the input can be a trace collected from an execution of program on a real microprocessor (so called trace-driven simulation) or a program itself (so called execution-driven simulation). 

A trace-driven simulation&lt;ref&gt;Uhlig, R. A., &amp; Mudge, T. N. (2004). Trace-Driven Memory Simulation: A Survey. ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 29(2), 128-170.&lt;/ref&gt; reads a fixed sequence of trace records from a file as an input. These trace records usually represent memory references, branch outcomes, or specific machine instructions, among others. While a trace-driven simulation is known to be comparatively fast and its results are highly reproducible, it also requires a very large storage space. On the other hand, an execution-driven simulation&lt;ref&gt;Burger, D., &amp; Austin, T. M. (1997). The Simplescalar Tool Set Version 2.0. ''Computer Architecture News'', 25(3), 13-25.&lt;/ref&gt; reads a program and simulates the execution of machine instructions on the fly. A program file is typically several magnitudes smaller than a trace file. However, the execution-driven simulation is much slower than the trace-driven simulation because it has to process each instruction one-by-one and update all statuses of the microarchitecture components involved. Thus, the selection of input types for simulation is a trade-off between space and time. In particular, a very detailed trace for a highly accurate simulation requires a very large storage space, whereas a very accurate execution-driven simulation takes a very long time to execute all instructions in the program. 

Apart from input types, the level of details can also be used to classify the simulation. In particular, a piece of software that simulates a microprocessor executing a program on a cycle-by-cycle basis is known as [[cycle-accurate simulator]], whereas [[instruction set simulator]] only models the execution of a program on a microprocessor through the eyes of an instruction scheduler along with a coarse timing of instruction execution. Most computer science classes in computer architecture with hand-on experiences adopt the instruction set simulators as tools for teaching, whereas the cycle-accurate simulators are deployed mostly for research projects due to both complexities and resource consumption.

==Usages==
Microarchitecture simulators are deployed for a variety of purposes. It allows researchers to evaluate their ideas without the need to fabricate a real microprocessor chip, which is both expensive and time consuming. For instance, simulating a microprocessor with thousand of cores along with multiple levels of cache memory incurs very little cost when comparing with the fabrication of a prototyping chip. The researchers can also play with several configurations of the cache hierarchy using different cache models in the simulator instead of having to fabricate a new chip every time they want to test something different.

Another usage of the microarchitecture simulator is in education.&lt;ref&gt;Skadron, K. (1996). A Microprocessor Survey Course for Learning Advanced Computer Architecture. In Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGCSE Conference, 152-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a course in computer architecture teaches students many different microprocessor's features and its architectures, the microarchitecture simulator is ideal for modeling and experimenting with different features and architectures over the course of a semester. For example, students may start with a microarchitecture simulator that models a simple microprocessor design at the beginning of a semester. As the semester progresses, additional features, such as [[instruction pipelining]], [[register renaming]], [[reservation stations]], [[out-of-order execution]], and [[scoreboarding]], can be modeled and added to the simulator as they are introduced in the classroom. Microarchitecture simulator provides the flexibility of reconfiguration and testing with minimal costs.

{{God |isms}}

'''Monism''' attributes oneness or singleness (Greek: μόνος) to a concept e.g., existence. Various kinds of monism can be distinguished:
* ''Priority monism'' states that all existing things go back to a source that is distinct from them; e.g., in [[Neoplatonism]] everything is derived from [[Neoplatonism#The One|The One]].{{sfn|Brugger|1972}} In this view only one thing is ontologically basic or prior to everything else.
* ''Existence monism'' posits that, strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing, the [[Universe]], which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things.&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, G. (2014 in press): "Nietzsche's metaphysics?". In: Dries, M. &amp; Kail, P. (eds): "Nietzsche on Mind and Nature". Oxford University Press. [http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30981598/Nietzsches_Metaphysics_June_2012_Strawson_draft_-libre.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1396293668&amp;Signature=Bji6%2FSyzFKV1jkuZRJfnLSB0Qko%3D PDF of draft]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Substance monism'' asserts that a variety of existing things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1974}} Substance monism posits that only one kind of stuff exists, although many things may be made up of this stuff, e.g., matter or mind.

==Definitions==
There are two sorts of definitions for monism:
# The wide definition: a philosophy is monistic if it postulates unity of origin of all things; all existing things return to a source that is distinct from them.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# The restricted definition: this requires not only unity of origin but also unity of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]].{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}

Although the term "monism" is derived from Western philosophy to typify positions in the [[mind–body problem]], it has also been used to typify religious traditions. In modern Hinduism, the term "absolute monism" is being used for [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Chande|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Dasgupta|1992|p=70}}

==History==
The term "monism" was introduced in the 18th century by [[Christian von Wolff]]&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt; in his work ''Logic'' (1728),&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/7886/Monism.html jrank.org, ''Monism'']&lt;/ref&gt; to designate types of philosophical thought in which the attempt was made to eliminate the dichotomy of body and mind&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and explain all phenomena by one unifying principle, or as manifestations of a single substance.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/monism.aspx#4 "monism"], Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition. Retrieved 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mind–body problem]] in philosophy examines the relationship between [[mind]] and matter, and in particular the relationship between [[consciousness]] and the brain. The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book  |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title= Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year= 1996 |pages= 702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind-body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author= Robert M. Young |edition=Paperback reprint of Routledge 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, Howard |title=Dualism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/dualism/ |date=Nov 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Avicennism|Avicennian philosophy]],&lt;ref name=Lagerlund&gt;{{cite book |title= Forming the Mind: Essays on the Internal Senses and the Mind/Body Problem from Avicenna to the Medical Enlightenment |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media]] |year= 2010 |edition=Paperback reprint of 2007 |isbn=  9048175305 |chapter=Introduction |page=3 |author=Henrik Lagerlund |editor= Henrik Lagerlund |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IV-dcQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in earlier Asian and more specifically Indian traditions.

It was later also applied to the theory of absolute identity set forth by [[Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]].{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} Thereafter the term was more broadly used, for any theory postulating a unifying principle.{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} The opponent thesis of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] also was broadened, to include pluralism.{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} According to Urmson, as a result of this extended use, the term is "systematically ambiguous".{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}

According to Jonathan Schaffer, monism lost popularity due to the emergence of [[Analytic philosophy]] in the early twentieth century, which revolted against the neo-Hegelians. Carnap and Ayer, who were strong proponents of [[positivism]], "ridiculed the whole question as incoherent [[mysticism]]".{{sfn|Schaffer|2010}}

The mind–body problem has reemerged in social psychology and related fields, with the interest in mind–body interaction{{sfn|Fiske|2010|p=195}} and the rejection of Cartesian mind–body dualism in the ''[[Type physicalism|identity thesis]]'', a modern form of monism.{{sfn|Fiske|2010|p=195-196}} Monism is also still relevant to the [[philosophy of mind]],{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} where various positions are defended.{{sfn|Mandik|2010}}{{sfn|McLaughlin|2009}}

===Types===
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|300px|A diagram with neutral monism compared to Cartesian dualism, physicalism and idealism.]]
Different types of monism include:{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}&lt;ref name=Schaffer&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, Monism: The Priority of the Whole, http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/monism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Substance theory|Substance]] monism, "the view that the apparent plurality of substances is due to different states or appearances of a single substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Attributive monism, "the view that whatever the number of substances, they are of a single ultimate kind"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Partial monism, "within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Existence monism, "the view that there is only one concrete object [[Type–token distinction|token]] (The One, "Τὸ Ἕν" or the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]])"&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, "Monism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/monism/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Priority monism, "the whole is prior to its parts" or "the world has parts, but the parts are dependent fragments of an integrated whole"&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;
# Property monism, "the view that all properties are of a single type (e.g., only physical properties exist)" 
# Genus monism, "the doctrine that there is a highest category; e.g., being"&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;

Views contrasting with monism are:
* Metaphysical dualism, which asserts that there are two ultimately irreconcilable substances or realities such as Good and Evil, for example, [[Manichaeism]],{{sfn|Brugger|1972}} 
* [[Pluralism (philosophy)|Metaphysical pluralism]], which asserts three or more fundamental substances or realities.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
* [[Nihilism|Metaphysical nihilism]], negates any of the above categories (substances, properties, concrete objects, etc.).

Monism in modern [[philosophy of mind]] can be divided into three broad categories:
# [[Idealism|Idealist]], mentalistic monism, which holds that only mind or spirit exists. {{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# [[Neutral monism]], which holds that one sort of thing fundamentally exists,{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}} to which both the mental and the physical can be reduced&lt;ref name="mastin"&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_monism.html Luke Mastin (2008), "Monism"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Material monism]] (also called [[Physicalism]] and [[materialism]]), which holds that the material world is primary, and consciousness arises through the interaction with the material world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Materialism and Empirio-criticism|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|year=1909|isbn=|location=World Socialist Web Site|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::a. [[Eliminativism|Eliminative Materialism]], according to which everything is physical and mental things do not exist{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::b. [[Reductive physicalism]], according to which mental things do exist and are a kind of physical thing{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}{{refn|group=note|Such as [[Behaviourism]],&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; [[Type-identity theory]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt;}}

Certain positions do not fit easily into the above categories, such as [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[anomalous monism]], and [[reflexive monism]]. Moreover, they do not define the meaning of "real".

===Monistic philosophers===

====Pre-Socratic====
While the lack of information makes it difficult in some cases to be sure of the details, the following [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]] thought in monistic terms:{{sfn|Abernethy|Langford|pp.1-7}}
* [[Thales]]: Water.
* [[Anaximander]]: Apeiron (meaning 'the undefined infinite'). Reality is some, one thing, but we cannot know what.
* [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]: Air.
* [[Heraclitus]]: Change, symbolized by fire (in that everything is in constant flux).
* [[Parmenides]] argued that Being or Reality is an unmoving perfect sphere, unchanging, undivided.{{sfn|Abernethy|Langford|pp.8,9}}

====Post-Socrates====
* Neopythagorians such as [[Apollonius of Tyana]] centered their cosmologies on the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] or One.
* [[Stoics]] taught that there is only one substance, identified as God.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a very broad generalization over a very diverse school of thought. Someone with time should seriously consider whether it is justified.|date=January 2018}}
* Middle Platonism under such works as those by [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]] taught that the Universe emanates from the Monad or One.
* [[Neoplatonism]] is monistic. [[Plotinus]] taught that there was an ineffable transcendent god, 'The One,' of which subsequent realities were emanations. From The One emanates the Divine Mind ([[Nous]]), the Cosmic Soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]), and the World ([[Cosmos]]).

===Pantheism===
{{Main article|Pantheism}}
Pantheism is the belief that everything composes an all-encompassing, [[immanence|immanent]] God,&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy ed. Paul Edwards |publisher=Macmillan and Free Press |year = 1967 |location = New York|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the [[universe]] (or [[nature]]) is identical with [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford | pages = 1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantheists thus do not believe in a [[personal god|personal]] or [[anthropomorphic]] god, but believe that interpretations of the term differ.

Pantheism was popularized in the modern era as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th century philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=Picton&gt;{{cite book|last=Picton|first=James Allanson|title=Pantheism: its story and significance|year=1905|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; CO LTD.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1419140082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_yjarZwEhoC&amp;pg=PP8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' was an answer to [[Descartes]]' famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate.&lt;ref name=Plumptre /&gt; Spinoza held that the two are the same, and this monism is a fundamental quality of his philosophy. He was described as a "God-intoxicated man," and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance.&lt;ref name=Plumptre&gt;{{cite book|last=Plumptre|first=Constance|title=General sketch of the history of pantheism, Volume 2|year=1879|publisher=Samuel Deacon and Co|location=London|isbn=9780766155022|pages=3–5, 8, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term pantheism was not coined until after his death, Spinoza is regarded as its most celebrated advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoham|first=Schlomo Giora|title=To Test the Limits of Our Endurance|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=1443820687|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Huw Owen|H. P. Owen]] claimed that
{{quote|Pantheists are "monists" ... they believe that there is only one Being, and that all other forms of reality are either modes (or appearances) of it or identical with it.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Owen, 1971, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pantheism is closely related to monism, as pantheists too believe all of reality is one substance, called Universe, God or Nature. [[Panentheism]], a slightly different concept (explained below), however is dualistic.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Donald A. (2008). Living with Ambiguity: Religious Naturalism and the Menace of Evil. New York: State University of New York Press. pp. 124. {{ISBN|0-7914-7519-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous pantheists are the [[Stoics]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].

===Panentheism===
{{Main article|Panentheism}}
Panentheism (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πᾶν}} (pân) "all"; {{lang|grc|ἐν}} (en) "in"; and {{lang|grc|θεός}} (theós) "God"; "all-in-God") is a belief system that [[postulate|posits]] that the divine (be it a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[God]], [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[gods]], or an eternal cosmic animating force) interpenetrates every part of nature, but is not one with nature. Panentheism differentiates itself from [[pantheism]], which holds that the divine is synonymous with the universe.&lt;ref name="Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sCY4sAjTGIYC&amp;pg=PA21|title= The Encyclopedia of Christianity pg. 21|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|author1=Erwin Fahlbusch |author2=Geoffrey William Bromiley |author3=David B. Barrett |year = 1999|isbn = 0-8028-2416-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In panentheism, there are two types of substance, "pan" the [[universe]] and God. The universe and the divine are not [[ontology|ontologically]] equivalent. God is viewed as the eternal animating force within the universe. In some forms of panentheism, the [[cosmos]] exists within God, who in turn "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]]", "pervades" or is "in" the cosmos.

While pantheism asserts that 'All is God', panentheism claims that God animates all of the universe, and also transcends the universe. In addition, some forms indicate that the universe is contained within God,&lt;ref name="Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999"/&gt;  like in the concept of [[Tzimtzum]]. Much [[Hindu thought]] is highly characterized by panentheism and pantheism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441533/pantheism/38168/Pantheism-and-panentheism-in-non-Western-cultures] Britannica - Pantheism and Panentheism in non-Western cultures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Robert. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_UfRgCZThWYC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=shakti+panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jz7nT6-kF8P3rQejn_GDCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shakti%20panentheism&amp;f=false Religions for Today] Stanley Thomes (Publishers) Ltd. P. VIII. {{ISBN|0-7487-0586-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasidic Judaism]] merges the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical transcendent Divine Panentheism, through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of [[Kabbalah]], with the populist emphasis on the panentheistic [[Divine immanence]] in everything and deeds of kindness.

[[Paul Tillich]] has argued for such a concept within Christian theology, as has [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] biblical scholar [[Marcus Borg]] and [[Christian mysticism|mystical]] theologian [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], an Episcopal priest.{{refn|group=note|See [[Creation Spirituality]]}}

===Pandeism===
{{Main article|Pandeism}}
Pandeism or pan-deism (from {{lang-grc|πᾶν|pan|[[The All|all]]}} and {{lang-la|[[deus]]}} meaning "[[god]]" in the sense of [[deism]]), is a term describing beliefs coherently incorporating or mixing [[logic]]ally reconcilable elements of pantheism (that "God", or a metaphysically equivalent [[creator deity]], is identical to [[Nature]]) and [[Deism#History of classical deism|classical deism]] (that the creator-god who designed the universe no longer exists in a status where it can be reached, and can instead be confirmed only by reason). It is therefore most particularly the belief that the creator of the universe actually became the universe, and so ceased to exist as a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The History of Science: A Beginner's Guide p. 90 |author = Sean F. Johnston |year = 2009 |ISBN = 1-85168-681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Ashman, ''[[BBC News]]'', "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A25172309 Metaphysical Isms]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this [[synergy]] pandeism claims to answer primary objections to deism (why would God create and then not interact with the universe?) and to pantheism (how did the universe originate and what is its purpose?).

===Brahmanic faiths===

====Characteristics====
The central problem in Asian (religious) philosophy is not the body-mind problem, but the search for an unchanging Real or Absolute beyond the world of appearances and changing phenomena,{{sfn|Nakamura|1991}} and the search for liberation from [[dukkha]] and the liberation from the [[Reincarnation|cycle of rebirth]].{{sfn|Puligandla|1997}} In Hinduism, [[Substance theory|substance-ontology]] prevails, seeing [[Brahman]] as the unchanging real beyond the world of [[Maya (illusion)|appearances]].{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=50}} In Buddhism [[process ontology]] is prevalent,{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=50}} seeing reality as [[sunyata|empty]] of an unchanging essence.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}

Characteristic for various Asian religions is the discernment of levels of truth,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9-11}} an emphasis on [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|intuitive-experiential understanding]] of the Absolute{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}{{sfn|Hawley|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|renard|2010|p=59}} such as [[jnana]], [[bodhi]]  and [[kensho]], and an emphasis on the integration of these levels of truth and its understanding.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=31}}{{sfn|Maezumi|2007}}

=====Vedanta=====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|''[[Adi Shankara]] with Disciples'', by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1904)|right|thumb|x216px]]
{{Main article|Vedanta}}
Vedanta is the inquiry into and systematisation of the Vedas and Upanishads, to harmonise the various and contrasting ideas that can be found in those texts. Within Vedanta, different schools exist:&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1995), Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791425824}}, pages 137-143&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Advaita Vedanta]], absolute monism, of which [[Adi Shankara]] is the best-known representative;{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=239}}
* [[Vishishtadvaita]], qualified monism, is from the school of [[Ramanuja]];&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, page xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shuddhadvaita]], in-essence monism, is the school of [[Vallabha]]; 
* [[Dvaitadvaita]], differential monism, is a school founded by [[Nimbarka]]; 
* [[Dvaita]], dualism, is a school founded by [[Madhvacharya]] is probably the only Vedantic System that is opposed to all types of monism. It believes that God is eternally different from souls and matter in both form and essence.
* [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]], a school of [[Vedanta]] representing the philosophy of ''inconceivable one-ness and difference''.

=====Advaita Vedanta=====
{{main article|Advaita Vedanta}}
Monism is most clearly identified in [[Advaita Vedanta]],{{sfn|Momen|2009|p=191}} though Renard points out that this may be a western interpretation, bypassing the intuitive understanding of a nondual reality.{{sfn|renard|2010}}

In Advaita Vedanta, [[Brahman]] is the eternal, unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe. The nature of Brahman is described as transpersonal, personal and impersonal by different philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="Brodd, Jefferey 2003"&gt;Brodd, Jefferey (2003). World Religions. Winona, MN: Saint Mary's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-88489-725-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta gives an elaborate path to attain moksha. It [[logical consequence|entails]] more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature. Practice, especially Jnana Yoga, is needed to "destroy one’s tendencies [[Vāsanā|(vAasanA-s)]]" before real insight can be attained.&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/trad_neo/neo_vedanta_swartz.htm James Swartz, ''What is Neo-Advaita?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} but Shankara uses [[Advaita vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
* {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
* {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref  name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

=====Vaishnava=====
{{Main article|Vaishnavism}}
All [[Vaishnava]] schools are [[panentheistic]] and view the universe as part of [[Krishna]] or [[Narayana]], but see a plurality of souls and substances within [[Brahman]]. Monistic theism, which includes the concept of a personal god as a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], [[omnipotent]] [[Supreme Being]] who is both [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], is prevalent within many other schools of Hinduism as well.

=====Tantra=====
{{Main article|Tantra}}
[[Tantra]] sees the Divine as both immanent and transcendent. The Divine can be found in the concrete world. Practices are aimed at transforming the passions, instead of transcending them.

=====Modern Hinduism=====
{{Main article|Hindu reform movements}}
The colonisation of India by the British had a major impact on Hindu society.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} In response, leading Hindu intellectuals started to study western culture and philosophy, integrating several western notions into Hinduism.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} This modernised Hinduism, at its turn, has gained popularity in the west.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

A major role was played in the 19th century by [[Swami Vivekananda]] in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called [[Neo-Vedanta]].{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}} In Advaita, Shankara suggests meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of ''Brahman'' and ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'',{{sfn|Comans|1993}} not the highest goal itself:
{{quote|[Y]oga is a meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness. This approach is different from the classical Yoga of complete thought suppression.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}}}

Vivekananda, according to [[Gavin Flood]], was "a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} Central to his philosophy is the idea that the divine exists in all beings, that all human beings can achieve union with this "innate divinity",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} and that seeing this divine as the essence of others will further love and social harmony.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Vivekananda, there is an essential unity to Hinduism, which underlies the diversity of its many forms.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Flood, Vivekananda's view of Hinduism is the most common among Hindus today.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=259}} This monism, according to Flood, is at the foundation of earlier Upanishads, to theosophy in the later Vedanta tradition and in modern Neo-Hinduism.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=85}}

====Buddhism====
{{Main article|Buddhism}}
According to the [[Pāli Canon]], both pluralism (''nānatta'') and monism (''ēkatta'') are speculative [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. A [[Theravada]] commentary notes that the former is similar to or associated with [[nihilism]] (''ucchēdavāda''), and the latter is similar to or associated with eternalism (''[[sassatavada]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 88. The passage is SN 2.77.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[middle way]].

In the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], the ultimate nature of the world is described as ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' or "emptiness", which is inseparable from sensorial objects or anything else. That appears to be a monist position, but the Madhyamaka views - including variations like ''[[rangtong]]'' and ''[[shentong]]'' - will refrain from asserting any ultimately existent entity. They instead deconstruct any detailed or conceptual assertions about ultimate existence as resulting in absurd consequences. The [[Yogacara]] view, a minority school now only found among the Mahayana, also rejects monism.

=====Levels of truth=====

Within Buddhism, a rich variety of philosophical{{sfn|Williams|1994}} and pedagogical models{{sfn|Buswell|1994}} can be found. Various schools of Buddhism discern levels of truth:
* The [[Two truths doctrine]] of the [[Madhyamaka]]
* The [[Three natures|Three Natures]] of the [[Yogacara]]
* [[Essence-Function]], or [[Chinese Chán#Absolute-relative|Absolute-relative]] in Chinese and Korean Buddhism
* The [[Trikaya]]-formule, consisting of 
** The ''[[Dharmakāya]]'' or ''Truth body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries;
** The ''[[Sambhogakāya]]'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is a body of bliss or clear light manifestation;
** The ''Nirmāṇakāya'' or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space.&lt;ref name="Welwood, John 2007"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). [http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''], accessed January 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]] and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: "form is emptiness, emptiness is form", as the [[heart sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} In Chinese Buddhism this was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as Nagarjuna does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}}}
This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]],{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]], and [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Hakuin's Four ways of knowing]].{{sfn|Low|2006}}

==== Sikhism ====
{{Main|God in Sikhism}}
Sikhism complies with the concept of Priority&amp;nbsp;Monism. Sikh philosophy advocates that all that our senses comprehend is an illusion; God is the sole reality. Forms being subject to time shall pass away. God's Reality alone is eternal and abiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikhism-articles/the-idea-of-the-supreme-being-god-in-sikhism|title=The Idea Of The Supreme Being (God) In Sikhism - Sikhism Articles - Gateway to Sikhism|last=User|first=Super|work=Gateway to Sikhism|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The thought is that Atma (soul) is born from, and a reflection of, ParamAtma (Supreme Soul), and "will again merge into it", in the words of the Tenth guru of Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh, "just as water merges back into the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/metaphysics/atma|title=ATMA,|last=Gujral|first=Maninder S|work=The Sikh Encyclopedia -ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਕੋਸ਼|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abrahamic faiths===

====Judaism====
{{Main article|Judaism}}
Jewish thought considers God as separate from all physical, created things ([[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]) and as existing outside of time (eternal).{{refn|group=note|For a discussion of the resultant [[paradox]], see ''[[Tzimtzum]]''.}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]].}}

According to [[Hasidic philosophy|Chasidic Thought]] (particularly as propounded by the 18th century, early 19th century founder of [[Chabad]], [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]), God is held to be [[Immanence|immanent]] within [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] for two interrelated reasons:
# A very strong Jewish belief is that "[t]he Divine life-force which brings [the universe] into existence must constantly be present ... were this life-force to forsake [the universe] for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation ..."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/archive/LibraryArchive2.asp?AID=7988&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simultaneously, Judaism holds as [[axiom]]atic that [[Jewish principle of faith#God is One|God is an absolute unity]], and that he is [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|Perfectly Simple]]—thus, if his sustaining power is within nature, then his essence is also within nature.

The [[Vilna Gaon]] was very much against this philosophy, for he felt that it would lead to pantheism and [[heresy]]. According to some this is the main reason for the Gaon's ban on Chasidism.

According to [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''Foundations of the Law'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; God is an incorporeal being that caused all other existence.  In fact, God is defined as the necessary existent that caused all other existence. According to Maimonides, to admit corporeality to God is tantamount to admitting complexity to God, which is a contradiction to God as the First Cause and constitutes heresy.  While Hasidic mystics considered the existence of the physical world a contradiction to God's simpleness, Maimonides saw no contradiction.{{refn|group=note|See the "Guide for the Perplexed", especially chapter I:50.}}

====Christianity====
{{See also|Christian anthropology}}

=====Creator–creature distinction=====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
[[Christianity]] strongly maintains the creator–creature distinction as fundamental. Christians maintain that God created the universe ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and not from his own substance, so that the creator is not to be confused with creation, but rather [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it (metaphysical dualism) (cf. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]). Although, there is growing movement to have a "Christian Panentheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53880197|title=In whom we live and move and have our being : panentheistic reflections on God's presence in a scientific world|last=1956-|first=Clayton, Philip,|last2=Robert)|first2=Peacocke, A. R. (Arthur|date=2004|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Pub|isbn=0802809782|oclc=53880197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more immanent concepts and theologies are to be defined together with God's omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience, due to God's desire for intimate contact with his own creation (cf. Acts 17:27). Another use of the term "monism" is in [[Christian anthropology]] to refer to the innate nature of humankind as being [[holistic]], as usually opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] and [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] views.

=====Rejection of radical dualism=====
In ''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|On Free Choice of the Will]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] argued, in the context of [[the problem of evil]], that evil is not the opposite of good, but rather merely the absence of good, something that does not have existence in itself. Likewise, [[C. S. Lewis]] described evil as a "parasite" in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', as he viewed evil as something that cannot exist without good to provide it with existence. Lewis went on to argue against dualism from the basis of [[moral absolutism]], and rejected the dualistic notion that God and [[Satan]] are  opposites, arguing instead that God has no equal, hence no opposite. Lewis rather viewed Satan as the opposite of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the archangel]]. Due to this, Lewis instead argued for a more limited type of dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S, "God and Evil" in "God in the Dock: Essays in Theology and Ethics", ed. W. Hooper (Grand Rapids, Mich, Eerdsmans, 1970), p. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; Other theologians, such as [[Greg Boyd (theologian)|Greg Boyd]], have argued in more depth that the Biblical authors held a "limited dualism", meaning that God and Satan do engage in real battle, but only due to free will given by God, for the duration God allows.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Gregory. A, "God at War" (Downers Grove, IL, InterVarsity Press, 1971) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah 45:5-7
5 I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else.
7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.

=====Theosis=====
In [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], while human beings are not ontologically identical with the Creator, they are nonetheless capable with uniting with his Divine Nature via [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]], and especially, through the devout reception of the [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This is a supernatural union, over and above that natural union, of which [[St. John of the Cross]] says, "it must be known that God dwells and is present substantially in every soul, even in that of the greatest sinner in the world, and this union is natural." [[Julian of Norwich]], while maintaining the orthodox duality of Creator and creature, nonetheless speaks of God as "the true Father and true Mother" of all natures; thus, he indwells them substantially and thus preserves them from annihilation, as without this sustaining indwelling everything would cease to exist.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

However, in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] creation is united to God by grace and not by nature. This is what is known as the [[Essence-Energies distinction]], while in union with God, Orthodox Christians believe, the human person retains its individuality and is not swallowed up by the Monad.

=====Christian Monism=====
Some Christian theologians are avowed monists, such as [[Paul Tillich]]. Since God is he "in whom we live and move and have our being" ([[Book of Acts]] 17.28), it follows that everything that has being partakes in God.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Islam====
{{See also|Tawhid}}

=====Quran=====
[[Vincent Cornell]] argues that the [[Quran]] provides a monist image of God by describing reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things. But most argue that Semitic religious scriptures, especially the Quran, see creation and God as two separate existences. It explains that everything has been created by God and is under his control, but at the same time distinguishes creation as being dependent on the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yusuf |first1=Hamza |title=The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi |date=2009 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Creed-Imam-al-Tahawi-Hamza-Yusuf/dp/097028439X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sufism=====
{{See also|Sufism}}
Sufi mystics advocate monism. One of the most notable being the 13th-century Persian poet [[Rumi]] (1207–73) in his didactic poem ''[[Masnavi]]'' espoused monism.&lt;ref name="nicholson"&gt;[http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html Reynold Nicholson ''Rumi''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017141204/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html |date=2006-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rumi.org.uk/sufism/persian_sufism.htm Cyprian Rice (1964) ''The Persian Sufism'' George Allen, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Rumi says in the [[Masnavi]],
{{quote|In the shop for Unity (wahdat); anything that you see there except the One is an idol.&lt;ref name="nicholson" /&gt;}}

The most influential of the [[Islam|Islamic]] monists was the Sufi philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240). He developed the concept of 'unity of being' (Arabic: ''[[Sufi metaphysics|waḥdat al-wujūd]]''), a pantheistic monoist philosophy. Born in [[al-Andalus]], he made an enormous impact on the Muslim world, where he was crowned "the great Master". In the centuries following his death, his ideas became increasingly controversial.

===Bahá'í===
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
Although the [[Bahá'í teachings]] have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year = 1992|contribution = The Bahá'í Faith|title = Britannica Book of the Year
|isbn = 0-85229-486-7|editor1=Daphne Daume |editor2=Louise Watson |publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica|location = Chicago | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include statements of a monist nature (e.g., ''[[The Seven Valleys]]'' and the ''[[Hidden Words]]''). The differences between dualist and monist views are reconciled by the teaching that these opposing viewpoints are caused by differences in the observers themselves, not in that which is observed. This is not a 'higher truth/lower truth' position. God is unknowable. For man it is impossible to acquire any direct knowledge of God or the Absolute, because any knowledge that one has, is relative.&lt;ref name="momen1988"&gt;{{cite book | last =Momen | first = Moojan |year = 1988 | title = Studies in the Bábí and Bahá’í Religions vol. 5, chapter: A Basis For Bahá’í Metaphysics | publisher = Kalimat Press | pages = 185–217 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_relativism_bahai_metaphysics | isbn = 0-933770-72-3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-dualism===
{{Main article|Nondualism}}
According to nondualism, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of "the Real".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}} Nondualism, a modern reinterpretation of these religions, prefers the term "nondualism", instead of monism, because this understanding is "nonconceptual", "not graspable in an idea".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "Niet in een denkbeeld te vatten".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Renard, [[Alan Watts]] has explained the difference between "non-dualism" and "monism" in ''The Supreme Identity'', Faber and Faber 1950, p.69 and 95; ''The Way of Zen'', Pelican-edition 1976, p.59-60.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59, p.285 note 17}} According to Renard, Alan Watts has been one of the main contributors to thepopularisation of the notion of "nondualism".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}}

To these nondual traditions belong [[Hinduism]] (including [[Vedanta]], some forms of [[Yoga]], and certain schools of [[Shaivism]]), [[Taoism]], [[Pantheism]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and similar systems of thought.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Objectivity''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept of being [[wikt:true|true]] independently from [[subject (philosophy)|individual]] [[subjectivity]] caused by perception, emotions, or imagination. A proposition is considered to have '''objective truth''' when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a [[sentience|sentient]] subject. [[Objectivity (science)|Scientific objectivity]] refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence, sometimes used synonymously with ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]''.

== Objectivity of knowledge ==
&lt;!-- 'Rhetorical situation' points here --&gt;
[[Plato]] considered [[geometry]] a condition of [[Platonic idealism|idealism]] concerned with [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] truth. His contrasting between objectivity and [[doxa|opinion]] became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of [[reality]], [[truth]], and [[existence]]. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of [[sensibility|sensibilities]], as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable [[incorporeality]]. Where Plato distinguished between [[epistemology|how we know things]] and their [[ontology|ontological]] status, [[subjectivism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s depends on [[perception]]. In [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] knowledge.

Platonic idealism is a form of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] objectivism, holding that the [[idealism|ideas exist independently]] from the individual. Berkeley's [[empiricism|empirical]] idealism, on the other hand, holds that [[subjectivism|things only exist as they are perceived]]. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in [[Platonic epistemology|his epistemology]], which is based on [[mathematics]], and [[Universal_(metaphysics)#Platonic_realism|his metaphysics]], where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change.

In opposition to philosopher [[René Descartes]]' method of [[Cogito, ergo sum|personal deduction]], natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]] applied the relatively objective [[scientific method]] to look for [[scientific evidence|evidence]] before forming a hypothesis. Partially in response to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[rationalism]], logician [[Gottlob Frege]] applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of [[consciousness]], then it would logically include a plurality of [[intension|indescribable]] forms. Objectivity requires a definition of [[truth]] formed by propositions with [[truth value]]. An attempt of forming an objective [[world view|construct]] incorporates [[ontological commitment]]s to the reality of objects.

The importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the [[Observer_effect_(physics)#Quantum_mechanics|observer effect]] of quantum mechanics. [[Direct and indirect realism|Direct]] or [[Naïve realism|naïve realist]]s rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while [[instrumentalism|instrumentalists]] hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[philosophy of mind|Philosophies of mind]] explore whether objectivity relies on [[Consensus reality|perceptual constancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tyler Burge]], ''Origins of Objectivity'', Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectivity in ethics==

===Ethical subjectivism===
{{See also|David Hume|Non-cognitivism|Subjectivism}}
The term, "ethical subjectivism", covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth's [[ideal observer theory]] held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also [[ethical egoism]]). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer's]] emotivism, the statement, "Murder is wrong" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, "Murder, Boo!"

===Ethical objectivism===
{{Main|Moral realism}}
According to the ethical objectivist, the [[truth]] or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.

There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference—and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.

'''Rule-based modeling''' is a [[Conceptual model|modeling]] approach that uses a set of rules that indirectly specifies a mathematical model. The rule-set can either be translated into a model such as [[Markov chains]] or differential equations, or be treated using tools that directly work on the rule-set in place of a translated model, as the latter is typically much bigger. Rule-based modeling is especially effective in cases where the rule-set is significantly simpler than the model it implies, meaning that the model is a repeated manifestation of a limited number of patterns. An important domain where this is often the case is biochemical models of living organisms. Groups of mutually corresponding substances are subject to mutually corresponding interactions.

==For biochemical systems==

Early efforts to use rule-based modeling in simulation of biochemical systems include the stochastic simulation systems StochSim&lt;ref&gt;Morton-Firth CJ, Bray D (1998) Predicting temporal fluctuations in an intracellular signalling pathway. J Theor Biol. 1998 192(1):117-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A widely used tool for rule-based modeling of biochemical networks is BioNetGen &lt;ref&gt;[http://bionetgen.org BioNetGen]&lt;/ref&gt; It is released under the [[GNU GPL]], version 3. BioNetGen includes a language to describe chemical substances, including the states they can assume and the bindings they can undergo. These rules can be used to create a reaction network model or to perform [[computer simulation]]s directly on the rule set. The biochemical modeling framework [[Virtual Cell]] includes a BioNetGen interpreter.

A close alternative is the Kappa language&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kappalanguage.org/ Kappa]&lt;/ref&gt;. Another alternative is BioChemical Space language.&lt;ref&gt;Děd et al. (2016) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066116300615 Formal Biochemical Space with Semantics in Kappa and BNGL] ENTCS 326:27-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slow science''' is part of the broader [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]]. It is based on the belief that [[science]] should be a slow, steady, methodical process, and that scientists should not be expected to provide "quick fixes" to society's problems. Slow science supports [[curiosity]]-driven [[Scholarly method|scientific research]] and opposes [[Performance measurement|performance targets]].

'''Social history''', often called the '''new social history,''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at the lived experience of the past. In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 841 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/teachers "History Online:Teachers of History"] accessed 1/21/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old and new social history==
The older social history (before 1960) included numerous topics that were not part of the mainstream historiography of political, military, diplomatic and constitutional history. It was a hodgepodge without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. [[People's history]] was sometimes so [[Marxism|Marxist]] that non-Marxists were alienated by it. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=0-582-48488-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Social History movement==
The "new social history" exploded on the scene in the 1960s, quickly becoming one of the dominant styles of historiography in the U.S., Britain and Canada.  The French version, promulgated by the [[Annales School]], was very well organized and dominated French historiography, and influenced much of Europe and Latin America. [[Jürgen Kocka]] finds two meanings to "social history."  At the simplest level, it was the subdivision of historiography that focused on social structures and processes.  In this regard it stood in contrast to political or economic history.  The second meaning was broader, and the Germans called it "Gesellschaftsgeschichte."  It is the history of an entire society from a social-historical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society: Business, Labor, and Bureaucracy in Modern Germany, 1800-1918'' (New York: Berghahn Books, 1999) pp 275-97, at p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the "Gesellschaftsgeschichte" movement introduced a vast range of topics, as Kocka, a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] recalls:
:In the 1960s and 1970s, "social history" caught the imagination of a young generation of historians. It became a central concept -- and a rallying point -- of [[Historical revisionism|historiographic revisionism]]. It meant many things at the same time. It gave priority to the study of particular kinds of phenomena, such as classes and movements, urbanization and industrialization, family and education, work and leisure, mobility, inequality, conflicts and revolutions. It stressed structures and processes over actors and events. It emphasized analytical approaches close to the social sciences rather than by the traditional methods of historical hermeneutics. Frequently social historians sympathized with the causes (as they saw them) of the little people, of the underdog, of popular movements, or of the working class. Social history was both demanded and rejected as a vigorous revisionist alternative to the more established ways of historiography, in which the reconstruction of politics and ideas, the history of events and hermeneutic methods traditionally dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Americanist Paul E. Johnson recalls the heady early promise of the movement in the late 1960s:
:The New Social History reached UCLA at about that time, and I was trained as a quantitative social science historian. I learned that "literary" evidence and the kinds of history that could be written from it were inherently elitist and untrustworthy. Our cousins, the Annalistes, talked of ignoring heroes and events and reconstructing the more constitutive and enduring "background" of history. Such history could be made only with quantifiable sources. The result would be a "History from the Bottom Up" that ultimately engulfed traditional history and, somehow, helped to make a Better World. Much of this was acted out with mad-scientist bravado. One well-known quantifier said that anyone who did not know statistics at least through multiple regression should not hold a job in a history department. My own advisor told us that he wanted history to become "a predictive social science."  I never went that far. I was drawn to the new social history by its democratic inclusiveness as much as by its system and precision. I wanted to write the history of ordinary people—to historicize them, put them into the social structures and long-term trends that shaped their lives, and at the same time resurrect what they said and did. In the late 1960s, quantitative social history looked like the best way to do that.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Johnson, "Reflections: Looking Back at Social History," ''Reviews in American History'' Volume 39, Number 2, June 2011 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v039/39.2.johnson.html online at [[Project MUSE]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Science History Association]] was formed in 1976 to bring together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in social history. It is still active and publishes ''[[Social Science History]]'' quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The field is also the specialty of the ''[[Journal of Social History]]'', edited since 1967 by [[Peter Stearns]]&lt;ref&gt;. See [http://chnm.gmu.edu/jsh/ ''Journal of Social History'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It covers such topics as gender relations; race in American history; the history of personal relationships; consumerism; sexuality; the social history of politics; crime and punishment, and history of the senses. Most of the major historical journals have coverage as well.

However, after 1990 social history was increasingly challenged by [[cultural history]], which emphasizes language and the importance of beliefs and assumptions and their causal role in group behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Hunt]] and Victoria Bonnell, eds., ''Beyond the Cultural Turn'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfields==

===Historical demography===
{{main|Historical demography}}
The study of the lives of ordinary people was revolutionized in the 1960s by the introduction of sophisticated quantitative and demographic methods, often using individual data from the census and from local registers of births, marriages, deaths and taxes, as well as theoretical models from sociology such as [[social mobility]].  H-DEMOG is a daily email discussion group that covers the field broadly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~demog/ H-DEMOG]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical demography is the study of population history and demographic processes, usually using census or similar statistical data. It became an important specialty inside social history, with strong connections with the larger field of [[demography]], as in the study of the [[Demographic Transition]].

===Black history===
Black history or [[African-American history]] studies African Americans and Africans in American history. The [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]] was founded by [[Carter G. Woodson]] in 1915 and has 2500 members and publishes the ''[[Journal of African American History]],'' formerly the ''Journal of Negro History.'' Since 1926 it has sponsored [[Black History Month]] every February.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.asalh.org/ ASALH]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic history===
[[Ethnic history]] is especially important in the U.S. and Canada, where major encyclopedias helped define the field.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.  Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the history of ethnic groups (usually not including blacks or Native Americans). 
Typical approaches include critical ethnic studies; comparative ethnic studies; critical race studies; Asian-American, and Latino/a or Chicano/a studies.  In recent years Chicano/Chicana studies has become important as the Hispanic population has become the largest minority in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo F.

Kirk (2010) surveys labour historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labour history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labour, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labour historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal?

===Women's history===
[[Women's history]] exploded into prominence in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mtsu.edu/~kmiddlet/history/women.html American Women's History: A Research Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now well represented in every geographical topic; increasingly it includes gender history.&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1405149604 Teresa A. Meade and Merry Wiesner-Hanks, eds. ''A Companion to Gender History'' (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Social history uses the approach of women's history to understand the experiences of ordinary women, as opposed to "Great Women," in the past. [[Joan Kelly|Feminist women's historians]] have critiqued early studies of social history for being too focused on the male experience.

===Gender history===
Gender history focuses on the categories, discourses and experiences of femininity and masculinity as they develop over time. Gender history gained prominence after it was conceptualized in 1986 by [[Joan W. Scott]] in her article "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Joan W.|title=Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1986|volume=91|issue=5|pages=1053–1075|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1864376?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101570710027|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.2307/1864376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social historians use Scott's concept of "perceived differences" to study how gender relations in the past have unfolded and continue to unfold. In keeping with the [[cultural turn]], many social historians are also gender historians who study how discourses interact with everyday experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensu.ca/skhs/faculty-and-staff/faculty/mary-louise-adams |title=DR.

===History of the family===
{{see also|History of the family}}
The History of the family emerged as a separate field in the 1970s, with close ties to anthropology and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara K. Hareven, "The history of the family and the complexity of social change," ''American Historical Review,'' Feb 1991, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp. 95-124&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was especially pronounced in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Comacchio, "'The History of Us': Social Science, History, and the Relations of Family in Canada," ''Labour / Le Travail,'' Fall 2000, Vol. 46, pp. 167-220, with very thorough coverage.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes demographic patterns and public policy, but is quite separate from [[genealogy]], though often drawing on the same primary sources, such as censuses and family records.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jfh.sagepub.com/ ''Journal of Family History'', quarterly since 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The influential pioneering study ''Women, Work, and Family'' (1978) was done by [[Louise A. Tilly]] and [[Joan W. Scott]]. It broke new ground with their broad interpretive framework and emphasis on the variable factors shaping women's place in the family and economy in France and England. The study considered the interaction of production, or traditional labor, and reproduction, the work of caring for children and families, in its analysis of women's wage labor and thus helped to bring together labor and family history.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dublin, "Women, Work, and Family: The View from the United States," ''Journal of Women's History,'' Autumn 99, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Much work has been done on the dichotomy in women's lives between the private sphere and the public.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent worldwide overview covering 7000 years see Maynes and Waltner's 2012 book and ebook, ''The Family: A World History'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Maynes and Ann Beth Waltner, ''The Family: A World History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012) [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38304 online review]&lt;/ref&gt; For comprehensive coverage of the American case, see Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong, eds.

===History of education===
{{main|History of education|History of education in the United States#Historiography|History of childhood care and education}}
For much of the 20th century, the dominant American historiography, as exemplified by [[Ellwood Patterson Cubberley]] (1868-1941) at Stanford, emphasized the rise of American education as a powerful force for literacy, democracy, and equal opportunity, and a firm basis for higher education and advanced research institutions. It was a story of enlightenment and modernization triumphing over ignorance, cost-cutting, and narrow traditionalism whereby parents tried to block their children's intellectual access to the wider world.  Teachers dedicated to the public interest, reformers with a wide vision, and public support from the civic-minded community were the heroes.  The textbooks help inspire students to become public schools teachers and thereby fulfill their own civic mission.&lt;ref&gt;Sol Cohen, "The history of the history of American education, 1900-1976: The uses of the past." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 46#3 (1976): 298-330. online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence A. Cremin, ''The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis came in the 1960s, when a new generation of [[New Left]] scholars and students rejected the traditional celebratory accounts, and identified the educational system as the villain for many of America's weaknesses, failures, and crimes. Michael Katz (1939-2014) states they:
:tried to explain the origins of the Vietnam War; the persistence of racism and segregation; the distribution of power among gender and classes; intractable poverty and the decay of cities; and the failure of social institutions and policies designed to deal with mental illness, crime, delinquency, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Katz|title=Reconstructing American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpeeMe6o5jIC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2009|publisher=Harvard UP|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old guard fought back and bitter historiographical contests, with the younger students and scholars largely promoting the proposition that schools were not the solution to America's ills, they were in part the cause of Americans problems. The fierce battles of the 1960s died out by the 1990s, but enrollment in education history courses and never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;For a counterattack see Diane Ravitch, ''The Revisionists Revised: A Critique of the Radical Attack on the Schools'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, compromise had been worked out, with all sides focusing on the heavily bureaucratic nature of the American public schooling.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardin Best, ed. ''Historical inquiry in education: A research agenda'' (American Educational Research Association, 1983); The most comprehensive overview of the historiography of American education, with essays by 13 scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years most histories of education deal with institutions or focus on the ideas histories of major reformers,&lt;ref&gt;Three fourths of British studies are institutional, says William Richardson, "British Historiography of Education in International Context at the Turn of the Century, 1996-2006," ''History of Education'', July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 569-593,&lt;/ref&gt;  but a new social history has recently emerged, focused on who were the students in terms of social background and social mobility. In the U.S. attention has often focused on minority and ethnic students. In Britain, Raftery et al. (2007) looks at the historiography on social change and education in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with particular reference to 19th-century schooling. They developed distinctive systems of schooling in the 19th century that reflected not only their relationship to England but also significant contemporaneous economic and social change. This article seeks to create a basis for comparative work by identifying research that has treated this period, offering brief analytical commentaries on some key works, discussing developments in educational historiography, and pointing to lacunae in research.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Raftery, Jane McDermid, and Gareth Elwyn Jones, "Social Change and Education in Ireland, Scotland and Wales: Historiography on Nineteenth-century Schooling," ''History of Education'', July/Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 447-463&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have recently looked at the relationship between schooling and urban growth by studying educational institutions as agents in class formation, relating urban schooling to changes in the shape of cities, linking urbanization with social reform movements, and examining the material conditions affecting child life and the relationship between schools and other agencies that socialize the young.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Reeder, Schooling in the City: Educational History and the Urban Variable," ''Urban History,'' May 1992, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 23-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juergen Herbst, "The History of Education: State of the Art at the Turn of the Century in Europe and North America," ''Paedagogica Historica'' 35, no. 3 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most economics-minded historians have sought to relate education to changes in the quality of labor, productivity and economic growth, and rates of return on investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sanderson, "Educational and Economic History: The Good Neighbours," ''History of Education,'' July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 429-445&lt;/ref&gt;  A major recent exemplar is Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, ''The Race between Education and Technology'' (2009), on the social and economic history of 20th-century American schooling.

===Urban history===
{{main|Urban history}}
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1950s in Britain and in the 1960s in the U.S. It looked at the "city as process" and, often using quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A major early study was [[Stephan Thernstrom]]'s ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other exemplars of the new urban history included Kathleen Conzen,  ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860'' (1976); Alan Dawley, ''Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn'' (1975; 2nd ed. 2000); Michael B. Katz,  ''The People of Hamilton, Canada West'' (1976);&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/159740411X/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Henry Monkkonen|Eric H. Monkkonen]], ''The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus Ohio 1860-1865'' (1975); and Michael P. Weber, ''Social Change in an Industrial Town: Patterns of Progress in Warren, Pennsylvania, From Civil War to World War I.'' (1976).

Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''Journal of Early Modern History'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural history===
{{main|Rural history}}
[[Agricultural History]] handles the economic and technological dimensions, while [[Rural history]] handles the social dimension.  Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of modern English rural history and identifies an "orthodox" school, focused on the economic history of agriculture. This historiography has made impressive progress in quantifying and explaining the output and productivity achievements of English farming since the "agricultural revolution."&lt;ref&gt;On British rural history see Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?"  ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481. {{ISSN|0018-246X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebratory style of the orthodox school was challenged by a dissident tradition emphasizing the social costs of agricultural progress, notably enclosure, which forced poor tenant farmers off the land. Recently, a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History,'' has broken away from this narrative of agricultural change, elaborating a wider social history. The work of Alun Howkins has been pivotal in the recent historiography, in relation to these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''The Death Rural England'' (2003) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/041513885X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Howkins, like his precursors, is constrained by an increasingly anachronistic equation of the countryside with agriculture. Geographers and sociologists have developed a concept of a "post-productivist" countryside, dominated by consumption and representation that may have something to offer historians, in conjunction with the well-established historiography of the "rural idyll."  Most rural history has focused on the [[Southern United States|American South]]—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of [[Union (American Civil War)|the North]] as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old frontier history as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Historiography of religion}}
The historiography of religion focuses mostly on theology and church organization and development. Recently the study of the social history or religious behavior and belief has become important.&lt;ref&gt;John T. McGreevy,  "Faith and Morals in the Modern United States, 1865-Present." Reviews in American History 26.1 (1998): 239-254. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v026/26.1mcgreevy.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history in Europe==

===France===
{{main|Annales School}}
Social history has dominated French historiography since the 1920s, thanks to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{see also|Bielefeld School|Historiography of Germany}}
Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s-60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society" - ''Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' - has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] (1931-2014) and his [[Bielefeld School]] as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''[[German Studies Review]]'' 1984 7(3): 451-480. {{DOI|10.2307/1428885}} [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1428885 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s German historians of society, led by Wehler and [[Jürgen Kocka]] at the "Bielefeld school"  gained dominance in Germany by applying both modernization theories and social science methods. From the 1980s, however, they were increasingly criticized by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'? On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Modernization Theory for History." ''Rethinking History'' 2006 10(2): 171-200. {{ISSN|1364-2529}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Before World War II, political history was in decline and an effort was made to introduce social history in the style of the French [[Annales School]].  After the war only Marxist interpretations were allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Erős Vilmos|hu}}, "In the lure of Geistesgeschichte : the theme of decline in Hungarian historiography and historical thinking in the first half of the twentieth century". ''[[European Review of History]]'' (2015) 22#3 pp 411-432. {{doi|10.1080/13507486.2014.986435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|end of Communism in Hungary]] in 1989. [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed and social history came into its own, especially the study of the demographic patterns of the early modern period. Research priorities have shifted toward [[urban history]] and the conditions of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Gyáni Gábor|hu}}, "Trends in contemporary Hungarian historical scholarship," ''[[Social History (journal)|Social History]],'' (2009) 34#2 pp 250-260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
When [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Communism ended]] in 1991, large parts of the [[Soviet archives]] were opened.  The historians' data base leapt from a limited range of sources to a vast array of records created by modern bureaucracies. Social history flourished.  The old [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Fitzpatrick]],  "Impact of the Opening of Soviet Archives on Western Scholarship on Soviet Social History." ''[[Russian Review]]'' 74#3 (2015): 377-400. {{DOI|10.1111/russ.12021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{main|Social history of Canada}}
Social history had a "golden age" in Canada in the 1970s, and continues to flourish among scholars. Its strengths include demography, women, labour, and urban studies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S.  Cross, [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/social-history/ "Social History,"] ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (2008) online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Cross and Gregory S. Kealey, eds.

''Studies in Canadian Social History'' (1974). 480 pp. articles by scholars&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political history==
While the study of elites and political institutions has produced a vast body of scholarship, the impact after 1960 of social historians has shifted emphasis onto the politics of ordinary people—especially voters and collective movements. Political historians responded with the "new political history," which has shifted attention to political cultures. Some scholars have recently applied a cultural approach to political history.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Pasley, Andrew W. Robertson, and David Waldstreicher, eds. ''Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians complain that social historians are likely to put too much stress on the dimensions of class, gender and race, reflecting a leftist political agenda that assumes outsiders in politics are more interesting than the actual decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;Romain Huret, "All in the Family Again? Political Historians and the Challenge of Social History," ''Journal of Policy History'', July 2009, Vol. 21 Issue 3, pp 239-263&lt;/ref&gt;

Social history, with its leftist political origins, initially sought to link state power to everyday experience in the 1960s. Yet by the 1970s, social historians increasingly excluded analyses of state power from its focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parthasarathi|first=Prasannan|title=The State and Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=771–778|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3parthasarathi.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social historians have recently engaged with political history through studies of the relationships between state formation, power and everyday life with the theoretical tools of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[governmentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Simon|title=From Hegemony to Governmentality:  Changing Conceptions of Power in Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=705–720|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3gunn.html|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social stress''' is [[stress (biological)|stress]] that stems from one's relationships with others and from the social environment in general.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal]] theory of emotion, stress arises when a person evaluates a situation as personally relevant and perceives that s/he does not have the resources to cope or handle the specific situation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2015}} An event which exceeds the ability to cope does not necessarily have to occur in order for one to experience stress, as the threat of such an event occurring can be sufficient.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;

There are three main categories of social stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Life events are defined as abrupt, severe life changes that require an individual to adapt quickly (ex. sexual assault, sudden injury).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social Psychology of Stress, Health, and Coping|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-6772-0_16|publisher = Springer Netherlands|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 978-94-007-6771-3|pages = 465–487|series = Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research|doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-6772-0_16#page-1|first = Deborah|last = Carr|first2 = Debra|last2 = Umberson|editor-link1=John DeLamater|editor-first = John|editor-last = DeLamater|editor-first2 = Amanda|editor-last2 = Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chronic strains are defined as persistent events which require an individual to make adaptations over an extended period of time (ex. divorce, unemployment).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Daily hassles are defined as minor events that occur, which require adaptation throughout the day (ex. bad traffic, disagreements).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  When stress becomes chronic, one experiences emotional, behavioral, and physiological changes that can put one under greater risk for developing a [[mental disorder]] and physical illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreiger|first1=Nancy|title=Theories for social epidemiology in the 21st century: an ecosocial perspective|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=2001|volume=30|issue=4|pages=668–677|doi=10.1093/ije/30.4.668|pmid=11511581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans are social beings by [[human nature|nature]], as they typically have a fundamental need and desire to maintain positive social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Slavich | first=George M |author2=O'Donovan, Aoife |author3=Epel, Elissa S |author4= Kemeny, Margaret E  | title=Black sheep get the blues: a psychobiological model of social rejection and depression | journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | date=September 2010 | volume=35 | issue=1 | pages=39–45 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.01.003 | pmid=20083138 | pmc=2926175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they usually find maintaining positive social ties to be beneficial.

Springer US.&lt;/ref&gt; Social stress can arise from one's micro-environment (e.g., family ties) and macro-environment (e.g., hierarchical [[social structure|societal structure]]). Social stress is typically the most frequent type of stressor that people experience in their daily lives and affects people more intensely than other types of stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Almeida, D.M. | year=2005 | title=Resilience and vulnerability to daily stressors assessed via diary methods | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=64–68 | url=http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/116.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Researchers define social stress and social stressors in various ways.  Wadman, Durkin, and Conti-Ramsden (2011) defined social stress as "the feelings of discomfort or anxiety that individuals may experience in social situations, and the associated tendency to avoid potentially stressful social situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress in young people with specific language impairment|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197110001016|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2011-06-01|pages = 421–431|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2010.06.010|first = Ruth|last = Wadman|first2 = Kevin|last2 = Durkin|first3 = Gina|last3 = Conti-Ramsden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilfield (1977) defined social stressors as "circumstances of daily social roles that are generally considered problematic or undesirable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Current social stressors and symptoms of depression|journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry|date = 1977-02-01|issn = 0002-953X|pmid = 835737|pages = 161–166|volume = 134|issue = 2|doi = 10.1176/ajp.134.2.161|first = F. W.|last = Ilfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dormann and Zapf (2004) defined social stressors as "a class of characteristics, situations, episodes, or behaviors that are related to psychological or physical strain and that are somehow social in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Customer-Related Social Stressors and Burnout|last = Dormann|first = Christian|date = January 2004|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Zapf|first2 = Dieter|issue = 9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Social stress is typically measured through self-report questionnaires.  In the laboratory, researchers can induce social stress through various methods and protocols.

=== Self-reports ===
There are several questionnaires used to assess environmental and psychosocial stress.  Such self-report measures include the Test of Negative Social Exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ruehlman | first=Linda S. |author2=Karoly, Paul  | title=With a little flak from my friends: Development and preliminary validation of the Test of Negative Social Exchange (TENSE) | journal=Psychological Assessment | year=1991  | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=97–104 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.3.1.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Marital Adjustment Test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Locke | first=Harvey J. |author2=Wallace, Karl M.  | title=Short Marital-Adjustment and Prediction Tests: Their Reliability and Validity | journal=Marriage and Family Living| date=August 1959 | volume=21 | issue=3 | page=251 | doi=10.2307/348022 | jstor=348022}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Risky Families Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Shelley E |author2=Lerner, Jennifer S |author3=Sage, Rebecca M |author4=Lehman, Barbara J |author5= Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Early environment, emotions, responses to stress, and health | journal=Journal of Personality | date=December 2004 | volume=72 | issue=6 | pages=1365–1393 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00300.x | pmid=15509286 | url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/lernerlab/files/taylor_lerner_sage_lehman_seeman_2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Holmes–Rahe Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social readjustment rating scale|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022399967900104|journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research|pages = 213–218|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4|first = Thomas H.|last = Holmes|first2 = Richard H.|last2 = Rahe|pmid=6059863|date=August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trierer Inventar zur Erfassung von chronischem Streß (TICS): Skalenkonstruktion, teststatistische Überprüfung und Validierung der Skala Arbeitsüberlastung|url = http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|journal = Diagnostica|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 0012-1924|pages = 8–19|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|first = Peter|last = Schulz|first2 = Wolff|last2 = Schlotz}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Daily Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A daily stress inventory: Development, reliability, and validity|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00845128|journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine|date = 1987-02-01|issn = 0160-7715|pages = 61–73|volume = 10|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF00845128|first = Phillip J.|last = Brantley|first2 = Craig D.|last2 = Waggoner|first3 = Glenn N.|last3 = Jones|first4 = Neil B.|last4 = Rappaport}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Job Content Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ): An instrument for internationally comparative assessments of psychosocial job characteristics.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|pages = 322–355|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|first = Robert|last = Karasek|first2 = Chantal|last2 = Brisson|first3 = Norito|last3 = Kawakami|first4 = Irene|last4 = Houtman|first5 = Paulien|last5 = Bongers|first6 = Benjamin|last6 = Amick}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Perceived Stress Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Global Measure of Perceived Stress|journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date = 1983-12-01|pages = 385–396|volume = 24|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2136404|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Tom|last2 = Kamarck|first3 = Robin|last3 = Mermelstein|jstor=2136404|pmid=6668417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stress and Adversity Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Slavich, G.

Los Angeles: University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to self-report questionnaires, researchers can employ structured interview assessments. The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) is one of the most popular instruments used in research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Measuring Stress: A Guide for Health and Social Scientists|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6NDhBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 1997-11-17|isbn = 9780190283889|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Ronald C.|last2 = Kessler|first3 = Lynn Underwood|last3 = Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social origins of depression: A study of psychiatric disorder in women|last = Brown|first = George William|publisher = Tavistock|year = 1978|isbn = 0-422-76310-1|location = London|pages = |last2 = Harris|first2 = Tirril}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this type of measure is to probe the participant to elaborate on his/her stressful life events, rather than answering singular questions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UCLA Life Stress Interview (LSI), which is similar to the LEDS, includes questions about romantic partners, closest friendships, other friendships, and family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hammen Lab at UCLA|url = http://hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu/interview.html|website = hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Induction ===
In [[mouse model|rodent models]], [[social disruption]] and [[social defeat]] are two common social stress paradigms. In the social disruption paradigm, an aggressive rodent is introduced into a cage housing male rodents that have already naturally established a social hierarchy. The aggressive "intruder" disrupts the social hierarchy, causing the residents social stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress induces glucocorticoid resistance in macrophages|url = http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/280/6/R1799|journal = American Journal of Physiology.

In human research, the [[Trier social stress test|Trier Social Stress Task]] (TSST) is widely used to induce social stress in the laboratory. In the TSST, participants are told that they have to prepare and give a speech about why they would be a great candidate for their ideal job.  The experimenter films the participant while s/he gives the speech and informs the participant that a panel of judges will evaluate that speech.  After the public speaking component, the experimenter administers a mathematics task that involves counting backwards by certain increments.  If the participant makes a mistake, the experimenter prompts him/her to start again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kirschbaum | first=C |author2=Pirke, K M |author3=Hellhammer, D H  | title=The 'Trier Social Stress Test'—a tool for investigating psychobiological stress responses in a laboratory setting | journal=Neuropsychobiology | year=1993 | volume=28 | issue=1–2 | pages=76–81 | pmid=8255414 | url=http://p113367.typo3server.info/uploads/media/lit9304.pdf | doi=10.1159/000119004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of negative evaluation is the social stressor. Researchers can measure the stress response by comparing pre-stress salivary cortisol levels and post-stress salivary cortisol levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Other common stress measures used in the TSST are self-report measures like the [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] and physiological measures like heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;Spielberger, C.

In a laboratory conflict discussion, couples identify several specific areas of conflict in their relationship.  The couples then pinpoint a couple topics to discuss later on in the experiment (ex. finances, child-rearing).  Couples are told to discuss the conflict(s) for 10 minutes while being videotaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ditzen | first1 = B. | last2 = Schaer | first2 = M. | last3 = Gabriel | first3 = B. | last4 = Bodenmann | first4 = G. | last5 = Ehlert | first5 = U. | last6 = Heinrichs | first6 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication and reduces cortisol levels during couple conflict | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 9| pages = 728–731 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.10.011 | pmid=19027101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer and Hogervorst (2014) designed the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) to induce stress in the laboratory setting.  After viewing neutral images with subsequent 1-minute rest periods, the participant is instructed to sing a song after the next 1-minute rest period is complete.  Researchers found that skin conductance and heart rate are significantly higher during the post-song message interval than the previous 1-minute intervals.  The stress levels are comparable to that induced in the Trier Social Stress Task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A new paradigm to induce mental stress: the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) |journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience|date = 2014-07-29|issn = 1662-4548|pmc = 4114180|pmid = 25120425|volume = 8|doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00224|first = Anne-Marie|last = Brouwer|first2 = Maarten A.|last2 = Hogervorst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical indicators of stress in large groups===

A statistical indicator of stress, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]], was proposed for diagnosis of stress and successfully used in physiology and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T.

It was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==

Research has consistently demonstrated that social stress increases risk for developing negative [[mental health]] outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; One [[prospective study]] asked over fifteen hundred Finnish employees whether they had "considerable difficulties with [their] coworkers/superiors/inferiors during the last 6 months, 5 years, earlier, or never".&lt;ref name=romanov&gt;{{cite journal | last=Romanov | first=K |author2=Appelberg, K |author3=Honkasalo, M L |author4= Koskenvuo, M  | title=Recent interpersonal conflict at work and psychiatric morbidity: a prospective study of 15,530 employees aged 24-64 | journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research | date=February 1996 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=169–176 | pmid=8778399 | doi=10.1016/0022-3999(95)00577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on suicides, hospitalizations due to [[psychosis]], suicidal behavior, alcohol intoxication, depressive symptoms, and medication for chronic psychiatric disorders was then gathered from the national registries of mortality and morbidity. Those who had experienced conflict in the workplace with coworkers or supervisors in the last five years were more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric condition.&lt;ref name=romanov /&gt;

Research on the [[LGBT|LGB]] population has suggested that people who identify as LGB suffer more from mental health disorders, such as [[substance abuse]] and [[mood disorder]]s, compared to those who identify as heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prejudice, Social Stress, and Mental Health in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: Conceptual Issues and Research Evidence|journal = Psychological Bulletin|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 0033-2909|pmc = 2072932|pmid = 12956539|pages = 674–697|volume = 129|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674|first = Ilan H.|last = Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers deduce that the LGB people's higher risk of mental health issues derives from their stressful social environments.  [[Minority group]]s can face high levels of stigma, prejudice, and discrimination on a regular basis, therefore leading to the development of various mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"/&gt;

=== Anxiety ===
The biological basis for [[anxiety disorder]]s is rooted in the consistent activation of the stress response.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Fear, which is the defining emotion of an anxiety disorder, occurs when someone perceives a situation (a stressor) as threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = L.

If a person has difficulty regulating this stress response, it may activate inappropriately. Stress can therefore arise when a real stressor is not present or when something isn't actually threatening.  This can lead to the development of an anxiety disorder ([[panic attack]]s, [[social anxiety]], [[OCD]], etc.).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neuroscience|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=75NgwLzueikC|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780781760034|first = Mark F.|last = Bear|first2 = Barry W.|last2 = Connors|first3 = Michael A.|last3 = Paradiso}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anxiety disorder]] is defined as the fear of being judged or evaluated by others, even if no such threat is actually present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Anxiety Disorder {{!}} Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA|url = http://www.adaa.org/social-anxiety-disorder|website = www.adaa.org|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term effects ===
Social stress occurring early in life can have [[psychopathological]] effects that develop or persist in adulthood. One [[longitudinal study]] found that children were more likely to have a psychiatric disorder (e.g. anxiety, depressive, disruptive, personality, and substance use disorders) in late adolescence and early adulthood when their parents showed more maladaptive child-rearing behaviors (e.g., loud arguments between parents, verbal abuse, difficulty controlling anger toward the child, lack of parental support or availability, and harsh punishment). Child [[temperament]] and parental psychiatric disorders did not explain this association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=J G |author2=Cohen, P |author3=Kasen, S |author4=Smailes, E |author5= Brook, J S  | title=Association of maladaptive parental behavior with psychiatric disorder among parents and their offspring | journal=Archives of General Psychiatry | date=May 2001 | volume=58 | issue=5 | pages=453–460 | pmid=11343524 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.58.5.453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have documented the robust relationships between children’s social stress within the family environment and depression, [[aggression]], [[antisocial behavior]], [[anxiety]], [[suicide]], and hostile, oppositional, and delinquent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Repetti | first=Rena L |author2=Taylor, Shelley E |author3=Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Risky families: family social environments and the mental and physical health of offspring | journal=Psychological Bulletin | date=March 2002 | volume=128 | issue=2 | pages=330–366 | pmid=11931522 | url=http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/2002_%20Risky%20Families_Family%20Social%20Environments%20and%20the%20Mental%20and%20Physical%20Health%20of%20Offspring.pdf | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relapse and recurrence ===
Social stress can also exacerbate current psychopathological conditions and compromise recovery. For instance, patients recovering from depression or [[bipolar disorder]] are two times more likely to relapse if there is familial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miklowitz | first1 = D.

=== Mortality ===
Social status, a macro-social stressor, is a robust predictor of death. In a study of over 1700 British civil servants, [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) was inversely related to mortality. Those with the lowest SES have worse health outcomes and greater mortality rates than those with the greatest SES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marmot | first=M G |author2=Rose, G |author3=Shipley, M |author4= Hamilton, P J  | title=Employment grade and coronary heart disease in British civil servants | journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | date=December 1978 | volume=32 | issue=4 | pages=244–249 | pmid=744814 | pmc=1060958 | doi=10.1136/jech.32.4.244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have replicated this relationship between SES and mortality in a range of diseases, including infectious, digestive, and respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adler | first=N E |author2=Boyce, T |author3=Chesney, M A |author4=Cohen, S |author5=Folkman, S |author6=Kahn, R L |author7= Syme, S L  | title=Socioeconomic status and health.

Similarly, social stressors in the micro-environment are also linked to increased mortality. A seminal longitudinal study of nearly 7,000 people found that socially isolated people had greater risk of dying from any cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berkman | first=L F |author2=Syme, S L  | title=Social networks, host resistance, and mortality: a nine-year follow-up study of Alameda County residents | journal=American Journal of Epidemiology | date=February 1979 | volume=109 | issue=2 | pages=186–204 | pmid=425958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term effects ===
Exposure to social stress in childhood can also have long-term effects, increasing risk for developing diseases later in life.

== Physiology ==

Social stress leads to a number of physiological changes that mediate its relationship to physical health.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the short term, the physiological changes outlined below are adaptive, as they enable the stressed organism to cope better. Dysregulation of these systems or repeated activation of them over the long-term can be detrimental to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McEwen | first=B S |author2=Stellar, E  | title=Stress and the individual: Mechanisms leading to disease | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine | date=27 September 1993 | volume=153 | issue=18 | pages=2093–2101 | pmid=8379800 | url=http://yalerei.org/intmed/resources/docs/McEwen.pdf | doi=10.1001/archinte.153.18.2093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sympathetic nervous system ===
The [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) becomes activated in response to stress. Sympathetic arousal stimulates the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal glands|medulla]] to secrete [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] into the blood stream, which facilitates the [[fight-or-flight response]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating increase, [[vasoconstriction|veins constrict]] to allow the heart to beat with more force, arteries leading to muscles dilate, and blood flow to parts of the body not essential for the fight or flight response decreases. If stress persists in the long run, then blood pressure remains elevated, leading to hypertension and [[atherosclerosis]], both precursors to [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sapolsky, R. M. (1994). Why zebras don't get ulcers: A guide to stress, stress related diseases, and coping. New York: W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of animal and human studies have confirmed that social stress increases risk for negative health outcomes by increasing SNS activity. Studies of rodents show that social stress causes hypertension and atherosclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sgoifo | first=A | author2=Koolhaas, J; De Boer, S; Musso, E; Stilli, D; Buwalda, B; Meerlo, P | title=Social stress, autonomic neural activation, and cardiac activity in rats | journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | date=November 1999 | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=915–923 | pmid=10580306 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(99)00025-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of non-human primates also show that social stress clogs arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Manuck | first=S B |author2=Marsland, A L |author3=Kaplan, J R |author4= Williams, J K  | title=The pathogenicity of behavior and its neuroendocrine mediation: an example from coronary artery disease | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=June 1995 | volume=57 | issue=3 | pages=275–283 | pmid=7652128 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/57/3/275.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress, visceral obesity, and coronary artery atherosclerosis: product of a primate adaptation|journal = American Journal of Primatology|date = 2009-09-01|issn = 1098-2345|pmc = 3970187|pmid = 19452515|pages = 742–751|volume = 71|issue = 9|doi = 10.1002/ajp.20706|first = Carol A.|last = Shively|first2 = Thomas C.|last2 = Register|first3 = Thomas B.|last3 = Clarkson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although humans cannot be randomized to receive social stress due to ethical concerns, studies have nevertheless shown that negative social interactions characterized by conflict lead to increases in blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerin | first=W |author2=Pieper, C |author3=Levy, R |author4= Pickering, T G  | title=Social support in social interaction: a moderator of cardiovascular reactivity | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=June 1992 | volume=54 | issue=3 | pages=324–336 | pmid=1620808 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/54/3/324.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social stress stemming from perceived daily discrimination is also associated with elevated levels of blood pressure during the day and a lack of blood pressure dipping at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tomfohr | first=Lianne |author2=Cooper, Denise C |author3=Mills, Paul J |author4=Nelesen, Richard A |author5= Dimsdale, Joel E  | title=Everyday discrimination and nocturnal blood pressure dipping in black and white americans | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=April 2010 | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=266–272 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181d0d8b2 | pmid=20124424 | pmc=2894630}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smart Richman | first=Laura |author2=Pek, Jolynn |author3=Pascoe, Elizabeth |author4= Bauer, Daniel J  | title=The effects of perceived discrimination on ambulatory blood pressure and affective responses to interpersonal stress modeled over 24 hours | journal=Health Psychology| date=July 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=403–411 | doi=10.1037/a0019045 | pmid=20658828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis (HPA) ===
In response to stress, the [[hypothalamus]] releases [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), stimulating the [[anterior pituitary]] to release [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to secrete [[glucocorticoids]], including [[cortisol]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Social stress can lead to adverse health outcomes by chronically activating the HPA axis or disrupting the HPA system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are a number of studies that link social stress and indications of a disrupted HPA axis; for instance, monkey infants neglected by their mothers show prolonged cortisol responses following a challenging event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dettling | first=A |author2=Pryce, C R |author3=Martin, R D |author4= Döbeli, M  | title=Physiological Responses to parental separation and a strange situation are related to parental care received in juvenile Goeldi's monkeys (''Callimico goeldii'') | journal=Developmental Psychobiology | date=July 1998 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=21–31 | pmid=9664169 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2302(199807)33:1&lt;21::aid-dev3&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil respiration''' refers to the production of [[carbon dioxide]] when [[soil organism]]s respire. This includes respiration of [[plant root]]s, the [[rhizosphere]], [[microbe]]s and [[fauna]].

Soil respiration is a key [[ecosystem]] process that releases carbon from the soil in the form of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is acquired from the atmosphere and converted into organic compounds in the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Plants use these organic compounds to build structural components or respire them to release energy. When [[plant respiration]] occurs below-ground in the roots, it adds to soil respiration. Over time, plant structural components are consumed by [[heterotroph]]s. This heterotrophic consumption releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and when this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is released by below-ground organisms, it is considered soil respiration.

The amount of soil respiration that occurs in an ecosystem is controlled by several factors. The temperature, moisture, [[soil nutrient|nutrient]] content and level of oxygen in the soil can produce extremely disparate rates of respiration. These rates of respiration can be measured in a variety of methods. Other methods can be used to separate the source components, in this case the type of photosynthetic pathway ([[C3 pathway|C3]]/[[C4 pathway|C4]]), of the respired plant structures.

Soil respiration rates can be largely affected by human activity. This is because humans have the ability to and have been changing the various controlling factors of soil respiration for numerous years. Global [[climate change]] is composed of numerous changing factors including rising atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, increasing temperature and shifting precipitation patterns. All of these factors can affect the rate of global soil respiration. Increased [[nitrate|nitrogen]] [[fertilizer|fertilization]] by humans also has the potential to affect rates over the entire Earth.

Soil respiration and its rate across ecosystems is extremely important to understand. This is because soil respiration plays a large role in global [[carbon cycling]] as well as other [[nutrient cycle]]s. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. Soil respiration is also associated with positive feedbacks with global climate change. Positive feedbacks are when a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, soil respiration rates can be affected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change.

==Sources of carbon dioxide in soil==
[[File:SRS1000 being used to measure soil respiration in the field..jpg|thumb|A portable soil respiration system measuring soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux]]
All cellular respiration releases energy, water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from organic compounds. Any respiration that occurs below-ground is considered soil respiration. Respiration by plant roots, bacteria, fungi and soil animals all release CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in soils, as described below.

===Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle===
The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle – or [[citric acid cycle]] – is an important step in cellular respiration. In the TCA cycle, a six carbon sugar will be [[oxidized]].&lt;ref name="berg2002"&gt;Berg J, Tymoczko J, Stryer L. (2002). Biochemistry. WH Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; This oxidation produces the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from the sugar. Plants, fungi, animals and bacteria all use this cycle to convert organic compounds to energy. This is how the majority of soil respiration occurs at its most basic level. Since the process relies on oxygen to occur, this is referred to as aerobic respiration.

===Fermentation===
[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] is another process in which cells gain energy from organic compounds. In this metabolic pathway, energy is derived from the carbon compound without the use of oxygen. The products of this reaction are carbon dioxide and usually either ethyl alcohol or lactic acid.&lt;ref name="klein2005"&gt;Klein D, Prescott L, Harley J. (2005). Microbiology. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of oxygen, this pathway is described as [[anaerobic respiration]]. This is an important source of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in soil respiration in waterlogged  ecosystems where oxygen is scarce, as in [[peat bog]]s and [[wetland]]s. However, most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  released from the soil occurs via respiration and one of the most important aspects of belowground respiration occurs in the plant roots.

===Root respiration===
Plants respire some of the carbon compounds which were generated by photosynthesis. When this respiration occurs in roots, it adds to soil respiration. Root respiration usually accounts for approximately half of all soil respiration. However, these values can range from 10–90% depending on the dominate plant types in an ecosystem and conditions under which the plants are subjected. Thus the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced through root respiration is determined by the root biomass and specific root respiration rates.&lt;ref name="shibistova2002"&gt;Shibistova O, Lloyd J, Evgrafova S, Savushkina N, Zrazhevskaya G, Arneth A, Knohl A, Kolle O. (2002) Seasonal and spatial variability in soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; efflux rates for a central Siberian Pinus sylvestris forest. Tellus 54B, 552-567.&lt;/ref&gt; Directly next to the root is the area known as the rhizosphere, which also plays an important role in soil respiration.

===Rhizosphere respiration===
The [[rhizosphere]] is a zone immediately next to the root surface with its neighboring soil. In this zone there is a close interaction between the plant and microorganisms. Roots continuously release substances, or [[exudate]]s, into the soil. These exudates include sugars, amino acids, vitamins, long chain carbohydrates, enzymes and [[lysate]]s which are released when roots cells break. The amount of carbon lost as exudates varies considerably between plant species. It has been demonstrated that up to 20% of carbon acquired by photosynthesis is released into the soil as root exudates.&lt;ref name="hutsch2002"&gt;Hutsch B, Augustin J, Merbach W. (2002) Plant rhizodeposition – an important source for carbon turnover in soils. Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science. 165, 4, 397-407.&lt;/ref&gt; These exudates are [[decomposition|decomposed]] primarily by bacteria. These bacteria will respire the carbon compounds through the TCA cycle; however, fermentation is also present. This is due to the lack of oxygen due to greater oxygen consumption by the root as compared to the bulk soil, soil at a greater distance from the root.&lt;ref name="vance2001"&gt;Vance E, Chapin III F. (2001) Substrate limitations to microbial activity in [[taiga]] forest floors. Soil Biology and Biochemistry. 33, 2, 173-188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important organism in the rhizosphere are root-infecting fungi or [[mycorrhizae]]. These fungi increase the surface area of the plant root and allow the root to encounter and acquire a greater amount of soil nutrients necessary for plant growth. In return for this benefit, the plant will transfer sugars to the fungi. The fungi will respire these sugars for energy thereby increasing soil respiration.&lt;ref name="harrison2005"&gt;Harrison M. (2005) Peace Talks and Trade Deals. Keys to Long-Term Harmony in Legume-Microbe Symbioses. Plant Physiology. 137, 4, 1205-1210.&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi, along with bacteria and soil animals, also play a large role in the decomposition of [[Plant litter|litter]] and soil organic matter.

===Soil animals===
Soil animals graze on populations of bacteria and fungi as well as ingest and break up litter to increase soil respiration. [[Microfauna]] are made up of the smallest soil animals. These include [[nematode]]s and [[mites]]. This group specializes on soil bacteria and fungi. By ingesting these organisms, carbon that was initially in plant organic compounds and  was incorporated into bacterial and fungal structures will now be respired by the soil animal. [[Mesofauna]] are soil animals from {{convert|0.1|to|2|mm|in|sp=us}} in length and will ingest soil litter. The fecal material will hold a greater amount of moisture and have a greater surface area. This will allow for new attack by microorganisms and a greater amount of soil respiration. Macrofauna are organisms from {{convert|2|to|20|mm|in|sp=us}}, such as earthworms and termites. Most macrofauna fragment litter, thereby exposing a greater amount of area to microbial attack. Other macrofauna burrow or ingest litter, reducing soil bulk density, breaking up soil aggregates and increasing soil aeration and the infiltration of water.&lt;ref name="chapin2002"&gt;Chapin III F, Matson P, Mooney H. (2002) Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of soil respiration==
Regulation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  production in soil is due to various abiotic, or non-living, factors. Temperature, soil moisture and nitrogen all contribute to the rate of respiration in soil.

===Temperature===
[[File:Graph showing soil respiration increasing with temperature.jpg|thumb|right|Graph showing soil respiration vs. soil temperature]]
Temperature affects almost all aspects of respiration processes. Temperature will increase respiration exponentially to a maximum, at which point respiration will decrease to zero when enzymatic activity is interrupted. Root respiration increases exponentially with temperature in its low range when the respiration rate is limited mostly by the TCA cycle. At higher temperatures the transport of sugars and the products of metabolism become the limiting factor. At temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius, root respiration begins to shut down completely.&lt;ref name="atkin2000"&gt;Atkin O, Edwards E, Loveys B. (2000) Response of root respiration to changes in temperature and its relevance to global warming. New Phytologist. 147, 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms are divided into three temperature groups; [[cryophile]]s, [[mesophile]]s and [[thermophile]]s. Cryophiles function optimally at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, mesophiles function best at temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees Celsius and thermophiles function optimally at over 40 degrees Celsius. In natural soils many different cohorts, or groups of microorganisms exist. These cohorts will all function best at different conditions so respiration may occur over a very broad range.&lt;ref name="mikan2002"&gt;Mikan C, Schimel J, Doyle A. (2002) Temperature controls of microbial respiration in Arctic tundra soils above and below freezing. Soil Biology and Biochemistry. 34, 1785-1795.&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature increases lead to greater rates of soil respiration until high values retard microbial function, this is the same pattern that is seen with soil moisture levels.

===Soil moisture===
[[Soil moisture]] is another important factor influencing soil respiration. Soil respiration is low in dry conditions and increases to a maximum  at intermediate moisture levels until it begins to decrease when moisture content excludes oxygen. This allows anaerobic conditions to prevail and depress aerobic microbial activity. Studies have shown that soil moisture only limits respiration at the lowest and highest conditions with a large plateau existing at intermediate soil moisture levels for most ecosystems.&lt;ref name="xu2004"&gt;Xu L, Baldocchi D, Tang J. (2004) How soil moisture, rain pulses, and growth alter the response of ecosystem respiration and temperature. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many microorganisms possess strategies for growth and survival under low soil moisture conditions. Under high soil moisture conditions, many bacteria take in too much water causing their cell membrane to lyse, or break. This can decrease the rate of soil respiration temporarily, but the lysis of bacteria causes for a spike in resources for many other bacteria. This rapid increase in available labile substrates causes short-term enhanced soil respiration. Root respiration will increase with increasing soil moisture, especially in dry ecosystems; however, individual species root respiration response to soil moisture will vary widely from species to species depending on life history traits. Upper levels of soil moisture will depress root respiration with the exception of wetland plants, which have developed specific mechanisms for root aeration.&lt;ref name="lambers1998"&gt;Lambers H, Chapin III F, Pons T. (1998) Plant physiological ecology. Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Soil moisture levels regulate root respiration, which is essential for nitrogen uptake.

===Nitrogen===
[[Nitrogen]] directly affects soil respiration in several ways. Nitrogen must be taken in by roots in order to promote plant growth and life. Most available nitrogen is in the form of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which costs 0.4 units of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to enter the root because energy must be used to move it up a concentration gradient. Once inside the root the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; must be reduced to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This step requires more energy, which equals 2 units of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per molecule reduced. In plants with bacterial symbionts, which fix atmospheric nitrogen, the energetic cost to the plant to acquire one molecule of  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  from atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 2.36 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pate J, Layzell D. (1990) Energetics and biological costs of nitrogen assimilation. The biochemistry of plants. 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential that plants uptake nitrogen from the soil or rely on symbionts to fix it from the atmosphere in order to assure growth, [[plant reproduction|reproduction]] and long-term survival.

Another way nitrogen affects soil respiration is through litter [[decomposition]]. High nitrogen litter is considered high quality and is more readily decomposed by microorganisms than low quality litter. Degradation of [[cellulose]], a tough plant structural compound, is also a nitrogen limited process and will increase with the addition of nitrogen to litter.&lt;ref name="sinsabaugh2002"&gt;Sinsabaugh R, Carreiro M, Repert D. (2002) Allocation of extracellular enzymatic activity in relation to litter composition, N deposition, and mass loss. Biogeochemistry. 60, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of measurement==

Different methods exist for the measurement of soil respiration rate and the determination of sources.  The most common methods include: The use of long-term stand alone soil flux systems for measurement at one location at different times; survey soil respiration systems for measurement of different locations and at different times; and the use of stable isotope ratios.

===Long-term stand-alone soil flux systems for measurement at one location over time===
[[File:Automated CO2 Exchange system (ACE from ADC BioScientific Ltd) measuring soil respiration..JPG|thumb|An automated soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange system]]

These systems measure at one location over long periods of time. Since they only measure at one location, it is common to use multiple stations to reduce measuring error caused by soil variability over small distances. Soil variability may be tested with survey soil respiration instruments.

The long-term instruments are designed to expose the measuring site to ambient conditions as much as is possible between measurements.

Types of long-term stand-alone instruments:

*Closed mode systems, by definition, are closed without a vent. When making measurements, closed systems take a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; measurement of ambient air just after the soil sample chamber is sealed. This becomes the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reference. The system continues to take measurements at regular intervals over the next few minutes until a final CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is recorded at a predetermined end time over time. Closed systems have the advantages that they are used by more researchers, and they provide wind proof results. Since there is no vent, wind is not an issue. When using a closed mode system, it is important that the experimental design include a maximum measuring time for two reasons: First; if the measuring time is too long, an unacceptable positive partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure can build up in the chamber limiting the amount of additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from entering the chamber, causing a measuring artifact. The second reason is that if a chamber that is closed for too long, it can modify ambient conditions and cause measuring artifacts. Finding the optimal measuring time range is important. Tests on the soil in question can confirm the best time solution, and eliminate the partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure buildup from being a significant issue.

Both individual assay information and diurnal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respiration measuring information is accessible. It is also common for such systems to also measure soil temperature, soil moisture and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation). These variables are normally recorded in the measuring file along with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; values.

For determination of soil respiration and the slope of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increase, researchers have used linear regression analysis, the Pedersen (2001) algorithm, and exponential regression. There are more published references for linear regression analysis; however, the Pedersen algorithm and exponential regression analysis methods also have their following. Some systems offer a choice of mathematical methods.
&lt;ref name="wayson2006"&gt;Wayson C, Randolph J, Hanson P, Grimmond P, Schmid H. (2006) Comparison of soil respiration methods in a mid-latitude deciduous forest. Biogeochemistry. 80, 173-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using [[linear regression]], multiple data points are graphed and the points can be fitted with a linear regression equation, which will provide a slope. This slope can provide the rate of soil respiration with the equation &lt;math&gt;F=bV/A&lt;/math&gt;, where ''F'' is the rate of soil respiration, ''b'' is the slope, ''V'' is the volume of the chamber and ''A'' is the surface area of the soil covered by the chamber.&lt;ref name="field1989"&gt;Field C, Ball J, Berry J. (1989) Photosynthesis, Principles and field techniques. Plant physiological ecology, field methods and instrumentation. Chapman and Hall, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that the measurement is not allowed to run over a longer period of time as the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the chamber will also increase the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the porous top layer of the soil profile. This increase in concentration will cause an underestimation of soil respiration rate due to the additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being stored within the soil.&lt;ref name="conen2000"&gt;Conen F, and Smith K. (2000) An explanation of linear increases in gas concentration under closed chambers used to measure gas exchange between soil and the atmosphere. European Journal of Soil Science. 51, 111-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Open mode systems, are designed to find soil flux rates when measuring chamber equilibrium has been reached. Air flows through the chamber before the chamber is closed and sealed. This purges any non-ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels from the chamber before measurement. After the chamber is closed, fresh air is pumped into the chamber at a controlled and programmable flow rate. This mixes with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the soil, and after a time, equilibrium is reached. The researcher specifies the equilibrium point as the difference in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; measurements between successive readings, in an elapsed time. During the assay, the rate of change slowly reduces until it meets the customer's rate of change criteria, or the maximum selected time for the assay.  Soil flux or rate of change is then determined once equilibrium conditions are reached within the chamber. Chamber flow rates and times are programmable, accurately measured, and used in calculations. These systems have vents that are designed to prevent a possible unacceptable buildup of partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure discussed under closed mode systems. Since the air movement inside the chamber might cause increased chamber pressure, or external winds may produce reduced chamber pressure, a vent is provided that is designed to be as wind proof as possible.
 
Open systems are also not as sensitive to soil structure variation, or to boundary layer resistance issues at the soil surface. Air flow in the chamber at the soil surface, is designed to minimize boundary layer resistance phenomenon.

* A hybrid system also exists. It has a vent that is designed to be as wind proof as possible, and prevent possible unacceptable partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure buildup, but is designed to operate like a closed mode design system in other regards.

===Survey soil respiration systems – for testing the variation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respiration at different locations and at different times.===

[[File:SRS2000 soil respiration system.jpg|thumb|Measuring spatial variability of soil respiration in the field]]
These are either open or closed mode instruments that are portable or semi-portable. They measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; soil respiration variability at different locations and at different times. With this type of instrument, soil collars that can be connected to the survey measuring instrument are inserted into the ground and the soil is allowed to stabilize for a period of time. The insertion of the soil collar temporarily disturbs the soil, creating measuring artifacts. For this reason, it is common to have several soil collar inserted at different locations. Soil collars are inserted far enough to limit lateral diffusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  After soil stabilization, the researcher then moves from one collar to another according to experimental design to measure soil respiration.

Survey soil respiration systems can also be used to determine the number of long-term stand-alone temporal instruments that are required to achieve an acceptable level of error. Different locations may require different numbers of long-term stand-alone units due to greater or lesser soil respiration variability.

===Isotope methods===
Plants acquire CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and produce organic compounds with the use of one of three photosynthetic pathways. The two most prevalent pathways are the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; processes. C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants are best adapted to cool and wet conditions while C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants do well in hot and dry ecosystems. Due to the different photosynthetic enzymes between the two pathways, different [[carbon isotope]]s are acquired preferentially. [[Isotope]]s are the same element that differ in the number of neutrons, thereby making one isotope heavier than the other. The two stable carbon isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C. The C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; pathway will discriminate against the heavier isotope more than the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pathway. This will make the plant structures produced from C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants more enriched in the heavier isotope and therefore root exudates and litter from these plants will also be more enriched. When the carbon in these structures is respired, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will show a similar ratio of the two isotopes. Researchers will grow a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plant on soil that was previously occupied by a C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plant or vice versa. By taking soil respiration measurements and analyzing the isotopic ratios of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it can be determined whether the soil respiration is mostly old versus recently formed carbon. For example, maize, a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plant, was grown on soil where spring wheat, a C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plant, was previously grown. The results showed respiration of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SOM in the first 40 days, with a gradual linear increase in heavy isotope enrichment until day 70. The days after 70 showed a slowing enrichment to a peak at day 100.&lt;ref name="rochette1999"&gt;Rochette P, Flanagan L, Gregorich E. (1999) Separating soil respiration into plant and soil components using analysis of natural abundance of carbon-13. Soil Science Society of America Journal. 63, 1207-1213.&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing stable carbon isotope data it is possible to determine the source components of respired SOM that was produced by different photosynthetic pathways.

==Responses to human disturbance==

Throughout the past 160 years, humans have changed [[land use]] and industrial practices, which have altered the climate and global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s. These changes have affected the rate of soil respiration around the planet.

===Elevated carbon dioxide===
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], humans have been emitting vast amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere. These emissions have increased exponentially over time and have increased global atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels to their highest in over 750,000 years. Soil respiration increases when ecosystems are exposed to elevated levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Numerous free air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment (FACE) studies have been conducted to test soil respiration under predicted future elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions. Recent FACE studies have shown large increases in soil respiration due to increased root biomass and microbial activity.&lt;ref name="lipson2005"&gt;Lipson D, Wilson R, [[Walter_C._Oechel|Oechel W]]. (2005) Effects of Elevated Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Soil Microbial Biomass, Activity, and Diversity in a Chaparral Ecosystem. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 71, 12, 8573–8580&lt;/ref&gt; Soil respiration has been found to increase up to 40.6% in a sweetgum forest in Tennessee and poplar forests in Wisconsin under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions.&lt;ref name="king2004"&gt;King J, Hanson P, Bernhardt E, Deangelis P, Norby R, Pregitzer K. (2004) A multiyear synthesis of soil respiration responses to elevated atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from four forest FACE experiments. Global Change Biology. 10, 1027-1042.&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely likely that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels will exceed those used in these FACE experiments by the middle of this century due to increased human use of fossil fuels and land use practices.

===Climate warming===
Due to the increase in temperature of the soil, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in our atmosphere increase, the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to man's activities such as [[forest clearing]], soil denuding, developments that destroy [[autotrophic]] processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the infrared energy penetrates the soil heating it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles thus it dissolves into streams, rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased [[turbidity]] of surface waters causes biological oxygen demand and more autotrophic organisms die in the wake of man's destruction. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover. 
As mentioned earlier, temperature greatly affects the rate of soil respiration. This may have the most drastic influence in the Arctic. Large stores of carbon are locked in the frozen [[permafrost]]. With an increase in temperature, this permafrost is melting and aerobic conditions are beginning to prevail, thereby greatly increasing the rate of respiration in that ecosystem.&lt;ref name="oechel1995"&gt;[[Walter_C._Oechel|Oechel W]], Vourlitis G, Hastings S. (1995) Change in Arctic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux over two decades, Effects of climate change at Barrow, Alaska. Ecological Applications. 5, 3, 846-855.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in precipitation===
Due to the shifting patterns of temperature and changing oceanic conditions, precipitation patterns are expected to change in location, frequency and intensity. Larger and more frequent storms are expected when oceans can transfer more energy to the forming storm systems. This may have the greatest impact on [[xeric]], or arid, ecosystems. It has been shown that soil respiration in arid ecosystems shows dynamic changes within a [[raining cycle]]. The rate of respiration in dry soil usually bursts to a very high level after rainfall and then gradually decreases as the soil dries.&lt;ref name="xu2004"/&gt; With an increase in rainfall frequency and intensity over area without previous extensive rainfall, a dramatic increase in soil respiration can be inferred.

===Nitrogen fertilization===
Since the onset of the [[Green Revolution]] in the middle of the last century, vast amounts of nitrogen fertilizers have been produced and introduced to almost all agricultural systems. This has led to increases in plant available nitrogen in ecosystems around the world due to agricultural runoff and wind-driven [[fertilization]]. As discussed earlier, nitrogen can have a significant positive effect on the level and rate of soil respiration. Increases in soil nitrogen have been found to increase plant dark respiration, stimulate specific rates of root respiration and increase total root biomass.&lt;ref name="lutze2000"&gt;Lutze J, Gifford R, Adams H. (2000) Litter quality and decomposition in Danthonia richardsonii swards in response to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrogen supply over four years of growth. Global Change Biology. 6, 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because high nitrogen rates are associated with high plant growth rates. High plant growth rates will lead to the increased respiration and biomass found in the study. With this increase in productivity, an increase in soil activities and therefore respiration can be assured.

==Importance==
Soil respiration plays a significant role in the global carbon and nutrient cycles as well as being a driver for changes in climate. These roles are important to our understanding of the natural world and our own well being.

===Global carbon cycling===
Soil respiration plays a critical role in the regulation of [[carbon cycling]] at the ecosystem and global scales. Each year approximately 120 [[petagram]]s (Pg) of carbon are taken up by land plants and a similar amount is released to the atmosphere through ecosystem  respiration. The global soils contain up to 3150 Pg of carbon, of which 450 Pg exist in wetlands and 400 Pg in permanently frozen soils. The soils contain more than four times the carbon as the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="sabine2003"&gt;Sabine C, Hemann M, Artaxo P, Bakker D, Chen C, Field C, Gruber N, Le Quere C, Prinn R, Richey J, Romero-Lankao P, Sathaye J, Valentini R. (2003) Current status and past trends of the carbon cycle. Toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Stabilization: Issues, strategies, and consequences. Island Press. Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have estimated that soil respiration accounts for 77 Pg of carbon released to the atmosphere each year.&lt;ref name="raich1995"&gt;Raich J, and Potter C. (1995) Global patterns of carbon dioxide emissions from soils. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 9, 23-36.&lt;/ref&gt; This level of release is one order of magnitude greater than the carbon release due to [[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|anthropogenic]] sources (6 Pg per year) such as [[fossil fuel]] burning. Thus, a small change in soil respiration can seriously alter the balance of atmosphere CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration versus soil carbon stores. Much like soil respiration can play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, it can also regulate global nutrient cycling.

===Nutrient cycling===
A major component of soil respiration is from the decomposition of litter which releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the environment while simultaneously immobilizing or [[mineralizing]] nutrients. During decomposition, nutrients, such as nitrogen, are immobilized by microbes for their own growth. As these microbes are ingested or die, nitrogen is added to the soil. Nitrogen is also mineralized from the degradation of proteins and nucleic acids in litter. This mineralized nitrogen is also added to the soil. Due to these processes, the rate of nitrogen added to the soil is coupled with rates of microbial respiration. Studies have shown that rates of soil respiration were associated with rates of microbial turnover and nitrogen mineralization.&lt;ref name="vance2001"/&gt; Alterations of the global cycles can further act to change the climate of the planet.

===Climate change===
As stated earlier, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released by soil respiration is a [[greenhouse gas]] that will continue to trap energy and increase the global mean temperature if concentrations continue to rise. As global temperature rises, so will the rate of soil respiration across the globe thereby leading to a higher concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, again leading to higher global temperatures. This is an example of a positive feedback loop. It is estimated that a rise in temperature by 2 degrees Celsius will lead to an additional release of 10 Pg carbon per year to the atmosphere from soil respiration.&lt;ref name="friedlingstein2003"&gt;Friedlingstein P, Dufresne J, Cox P. (2003) How positive is the feedback between climate change and the global carbon cycle? Tellus. 55B, 692-700.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a larger amount than current anthropogenic carbon emissions. There also exists a possibility that this increase in temperature will release carbon stored in permanently frozen soils, which are now melting. Climate models have suggested that this positive feedback between soil respiration and temperature will lead to a decrease in soil stored carbon by the middle of this century.&lt;ref name="cox2000"&gt;Cox P, Betts R, Jones C, Spall S, Totterdell I. (2000) Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model. Nature. 408, 184-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Soil respiration is a key ecosystem process that releases carbon from the soil in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon is stored in the soil as organic matter and is respired by plants, bacteria, fungi and animals. When this respiration occurs belowground, it is considered soil respiration. Temperature, soil moisture and nitrogen all regulate the rate of this conversion from carbon in soil organic compounds to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Many methods are used to measure soil respiration; however, the closed dynamic chamber and utilization of stable isotope ratios are two of the most prevalent techniques. Humans have altered atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  levels, precipitation patterns and fertilization rates, all of which have had a significant role on soil respiration rates. The changes in these rates can alter the global carbon and nutrient cycles as well as play a significant role in climate change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33376">'''Wildlife observation''' is the practice of noting the occurrence or abundance of a dead or living animal [[species]] at a specific location and time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D. E. and R. L. Winstead, 1980. Estimating the numbers of wildlife populations. Pp. 221-247. In S.D. Schemnitz (editor). Wildlife Management and Techniques Manual. The Wildlife Society,Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of scientific wildlife observation includes the reporting of what ([[diagnosis]] of the species), where ([[geographical location]]), when (date and time), who (details about observer), and why (reason for observation, or explanations for occurrence). Wildlife observation can be performed if the animals are alive, with the most notable example being face-to-face observation and live cameras, or are dead, with the primary example being the notifying of where roadkill has occurred. This outlines the basic information needed to collect data for a wildlife observation; which can also contribute to scientific investigations of distribution, habitat relations, trends, and movement of wildlife species. One example of this type of activity is [[birdwatching|bird watching.]] Wildlife observation allows for the study of organisms with minimal disturbance to their ecosystem depending on the type of method or equipment used. The use of equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, may disturb and cause negative impacts on wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jarrod C.|last2=Koh|first2=Lian Pin|date=2016-05-23|title=Best practice for minimising unmanned aerial vehicle disturbance to wildlife in biological field research|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=R404–405|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.001|issn=1879-0445|pmid=27218843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized equipment can be used to collect more accurate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/policy/605fw4.html|title=605 FW 4, Wildlife Observation, Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service|website=www.fws.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Through wildlife observation, there are many important details that can be discovered about the environment. For instance, if a fisher in Taiwan discovers that a certain species of fish he/she frequently catches is becoming rarer and rarer, there might be a substantial issue in the water that fisher is fishing in. It could be that there is a new predator in the water that has changed the [http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/food-chain/ animal food chain], a source of pollution, or perhaps even a larger problem. Regardless of the reason, this process of observing animals can help identify potential issues before they become severe problems in the world.

Additionally, through animal observation, those who participate are also actively participating in the conservation of animal life. Oftentimes, the two subjects go hand-in-hand with one another because through the observation of animals, individuals are also discovering what issues animals around the world are currently facing and if there are any ways to put up a fight against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalwildlife.org|title=Global Wildlife Conservation|website=globalwildlife.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more observation, fewer species of animals will become extinct.

==Research==
Before one can get started observing wildlife and helping the environment, it is important to research the animal they are choosing to observe. If one simply went into the observation process and skipped the crucial process of obtaining knowledge about the animals, it would be difficult for them to determine if anything was out of the ordinary.&lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Watch-Wildlife|title=How to Watch Wildlife|newspaper=wikiHow|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before observing, it would be wise to find out simple information about the animal such as:
* What the animal eats - Is the animal a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore?
* What animals prey on the animal?
* Where does the animal live?
* Is the animal dangerous?
* Is it endangered?
* Does the animal travel in packs or alone?
* What are the animal's sleeping habits? &lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"/&gt;

==Projects and programs devoted to wildlife observation==

===Projects===
There are a variety of projects and websites devoted to wildlife observations. One of the most common projects are for bird observations (for example: [http://ebird.org e-bird]). For those who enjoy bird watching, there are a variety of ways one can contribute to this type of wildlife observation. The National Wildlife Refuge System has volunteer opportunities, citizen science projects, and if one is limiting in time; could purchase a Federal Duck Stamp that donates money to the wildlife refuge lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/refuges/birding/getinvolved.html|title=Get Involved {{!}} National Wildlife Refuge System|last=System|first=National Wildlife Refuge|website=www.fws.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years, websites dedicated to reporting wildlife across broad taxonomic ranges have become available. For example, the [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/california California Roadkill Observation System] provides a mechanism for citizen-scientists in California to report wildlife species killed by vehicles. The [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/maine Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch] allows reporting of observations of both dead and live animals along roads. A more recent addition to wildlife observation tools are the web sites that facilitate uploading and management of images from remote wildlife cameras. For example, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] supports the [http://eMammal.wordpress.com eMammal] and [http://siwild.si.edu Smithsonian Wild] programs, which provide a mechanism for volunteer deployment of wildlife cameras around the world.  Similarly, the [http://wildlifeobserver.net Wildlife Observer Network] hosts over a dozen wildlife-camera projects from around the world, providing tools and a database to manage photographs and camera networks.

===Monitoring programs===
Monitoring programs for wildlife utilize new and easier ways to monitor animal species for citizen scientists and research scientists alike. One such monitoring device is the automated recorder. Automated recorders are a reliable way to monitor species such as bird, bats, and amphibians as they provide ability to save and independently identify a specific animal call.&lt;ref name="Furnas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnas|first1=Brett J.|title=Using Automated Recorders and Occupancy Models to Monitor Common Forest Birds Across a Large Geographic Region|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|date=February 2015|volume= 79|pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;325–337.|doi=10.1002/jwmg.821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automated recorder analyzes the sounds of the species to identify the species and how many there are.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt; It was found that using the automated recorders produced larger quantity and even more quality data when compared with traditional, point-count data recording.&lt;ref name="Acevedo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acevedo|first1=Miguel A.and |last2=Villanueva-Rivera|first2=Luis J.|title=Using Automated Digital Recording Systems as Effective Tools for the Monitoring of Birds and Amphibians|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin|date=2006|volume= 34 | issue = 1 |pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–214. |doi=10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[211:uadrsa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While providing better quality, it also provides a permanent record of the census which can be continually reviewed for any potential bias.&lt;ref name="Acevedo" /&gt; This monitoring device can improve wildlife observation and potentially save more animals. Using this device can allow for continued tracking of populations, continued censusing of individuals within a species, and allow for faster population size estimates.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt;

==Live watching and observation==

===Birdwatching===
One of the most popular forms of wildlife observation, [[birdwatching]], is typically performed as a recreational pleasure. Those looking to birdwatch typically travel into a forest or other wooded area with a pair of binoculars in hand to aid the process. Birdwatching has become all the more important with the amount of deforestation that has been occurring in the world. Birds are arguably the most important factor in the balance of environmental [[system]]s: "They pollinate plants, disperse seeds, scavenge carcasses and recycle nutrients back into the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2013/why-do-birds-matter|title=Why Do Birds Matter?|date=2013-03-06|newspaper=Audubon|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in the total number of birds would cause destruction to much of the environmental system. The plants and trees around the world would die at an alarming rate which would, in turn, set off a chain reaction that would cause many other animals to die due to the environment change and [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. 
[[File:Birdwatching on beach.jpg|thumb|244x244px|Birdwatchers on a beach]]

One of the ways that birdwatching has an effect on the environment as a whole is that through consistent birdwatching, an observer would be able to identify whether they are seeing less of a certain species of bird. If this happens, there typically is a reasons for the occurrence, whether it be because of an increase in pollution in the area or possibly an increase in the population of predators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://birding.about.com/od/birdconservation/a/importconserve.htm|title=bird wildlife conservation protect protection conserve environment|newspaper=About.com Home|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a watcher were to take notice of a change in what they typically see, they could notify the city or park and allow them to investigate into the cause a bit further. Through this action, birdwatchers are preserving the future for both animal and human life.

Subsequently, by taking children birdwatching it is allowing the future generation to understand the importance of animal observation. If children learn at a young age how the environmental system works and that all life is intertwined, the world will be in much better hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These children will be the ones pioneer conservation movements and attempt to protect the habit for all animals.

===Livestreams===
Live streams of animal exhibits at various zoos and aquariums across the United States have also become extremely popular. The [[Tennessee Aquarium]] has a webcam that allows online viewers to take a look into the happening so their Secret Reef exhibit which consists of reef fish, sharks, and a rescued green sea turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tnaqua.org/animals-exhibits/secret-reef-cam/|title=Secret Reef Cam {{!}} Tennessee Aquarium|last=Aquarium|first=Tennessee|website=www.tnaqua.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most popular animals cams in the United States though come from, naturally, the largest zoo in the United States: [[San Diego Zoo|The San Diego Zoo]]. The San Diego Zoo features eight live cams on their website – A panda, elephant, ape, penguin, polar bear, tiger, condor, and koala. The purpose of the live streams is to help educate the public about the behaviors of several different animals and to entertain those who might not be able to travel to a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/content/video-more|title=Video &amp; More|date=2013-12-03|newspaper=San Diego Zoo|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other notable zoos that have webcams are the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]], [[Woodland Park Zoo]], [[Houston Zoo]], and [[Zoo Atlanta|Atlanta Zoo]].

Additionally, the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] has opened a butterfly and plant observation pavilion. Visitors walk into a large tent and experience a one-of-a-kind situation in which hundreds of rare butterflies from all across the world are inches from their faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturalhistory.si.edu/butterflies/|title=Butterflies + Plants: Partners in Evolution, Home Page|website=naturalhistory.si.edu|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collecting data===
As is the case with a majority of subjects, one of the best and most effective ways to observe live animals is through data collection. This process can be done through a livestream or in the wild but it is more useful if the data is collected on animals that are in currently in the wild.&lt;ref name="study.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/how-to-observe-measure-describe-animal-behavior.html|title=How to Observe, Measure &amp; Describe Animal Behavior {{!}} Study.com|newspaper=Study.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways the data can be collected are endless and it really just depends on what purpose an individual has as to what data would be the most useful.

For example, if someone is interested in how deer interact with other animals in a certain location, it would be beneficial for them to take notes and record all of the animals that are native to the area where the deer are located. From there, they can describe any scenarios in which the deer had a positive or negative interaction with the other species of animals. In this instance, it would not really be helpful for the observer to collect data pertaining to the types of food the deer eat because the study is only focusing on the interaction amongst animals.

Another example of how collecting data on wildlife would be useful is keeping track of the total number of a certain species exists within a forest. Naturally, it will be impossible to get a definitive number but if an accurate approximation can be made, it could be beneficial in determining if there has been a random increase or decrease in the population. If there is an increase, it could be due to a change in the species migration habits and if there is a decrease, it could be due to an external factor such as pollution or introduction of a new predator.&lt;ref name="study.com"/&gt;

==Deceased wildlife observation==
[[File:Wildlife crossing.jpg|thumb|244x244px|An example of a wildlife crossing sign]]

===Online systems and mobile apps===
Many states have already begun to set up websites and systems for the public. The main purpose behind the movement is so that they can notify other individuals about [[Roadkill|road-killed]] wildlife. If enough people fill out the forms located on the websites, the government will become notified that there have been occurrences of a loss of animal life and will take the steps required to prevent it. Typically, the step that is taken is the posting of a wildlife crossing sign that, in turn, allows the public to know where there are common animal crossings. Maine and California are the states that have been the pioneers of this movement and this process has become particularly important on heavily traveled roads as no one would like endanger the animals or themselves.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net {{!}} wildlife observation reporting|website=www.wildlifecrossing.net|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is an app (available on both iPhone and Android devices) made specifically for the purpose of identifying road-kill called [https://www.herpmapper.org/mobile/mapper “Mobile Mapper.”] The app is a partner of the HerpMapper website. The purpose of the website is to use the user recorded observations for research and conservation purposes.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"/&gt;

On average, the cost of repairing a car that has been damaged by a deer or other medium to large-sized animal is $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there is no way that accidents involving animals can completely be prevented, placing more signs about possible animal crossings zones would cause drivers to drive more carefully and therefore have fewer accidents. Economically, this means that more families will be saving money and it could be used in a different way to help contributed to society as a whole.

==Issues leading to the extinction of animals==

===Climate change===
[[Climate change]] is one of the most heavily discussed topics around the world today, both politically and scientifically. The climate that Earth is currently experiencing has been steadily changing over time due to both natural causes and human exploitation.&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/global-warming/climate-change-and-animals.html|title=Climate change - effects on animals|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change has the potential to be detrimental to wildlife across the world, whether that be through rising sea levels, changes in temperatures through the years, or [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; These are just a few of the examples of the contributing factors to climate change.

Climate change is not something that citizens can entirely prevent from happening even if they wanted to. There are many natural causes such as [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and the Earth's orbit around the sun that are strong contributing factors to the phenomena.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=65CD73F4-1|title=climatechange.gc.ca - Facts on Climate Change - Causes of Climate Change|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=www.climatechange.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, prevention measures that can be taken to prevent climate change from happening as quickly. The primary way to prevent climate change is for society to reduce the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that are present in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; This can be done through the improving of energy efficiency in many buildings, the stoppage of deforestation so more carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere, and mode switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cehtp.org/faq/climate_change/preventing_and_preparing_for_climate_change|title=Climate Change|website=cehtp.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rising sea levels====
One of the more notable effects climate change has on the environment is the rising of sea levels around the world. Over the past 100 years, the sea level has risen approximately 1.8 millimeters each year.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.actforlibraries.org/the-impact-of-rising-sea-levels-on-animal-life/|title=The Impact of Rising Sea Levels on Animal Life {{!}} Actforlibraries.org|website=www.actforlibraries.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steady rise in sea levels can be attributed to the steadily increasing temperatures the Earth faces each year which causes the ice caps and glaciers to melt.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; This increase in sea level is detrimental to the [[Coast|coastal ecosystems]] that exist around the world.
[[File:Polar bear after unlucky hunt for a seal.jpg|thumb|Polar bear hunting for food]]
The increase in sea level causes flooding on coastal wetlands, where certain animals will be unable to survive due to [http://eden.cce.cornell.edu/disasters/Documents/PDFs/saltwater%20innundation%20fact%20sheet.pdf saltwater inundation].&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; The increase in the total amount of saltwater present in these wetlands could prove to be problematic for many species. While some may simply have to migrate to other areas, smaller ecosystems within the wetlands could be destroyed which, once again, influences the animal food chain.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Polar bear]]s are animals that are specifically affected through the process of rising sea levels. Living near the Arctic region, polar bears find their food on ice caps and sheets of ice. As these sheets continue to become fewer in quantity, it is predicted that the polar bears will have a difficult time sustaining life and that by the year 2050, there could be less than 20,000 on Earth.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Coral reef]]s are the primary ecosystem that would be affected through a continuing increase in the sea level:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The coral reef ecosystem is adapted to thrive within certain temperature and sea level range. Corals live in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic [[zooxanthellae]]. Zooxanthellae need the sunlight in order to produce the nutrients necessary for the coral. Sea level rise may cause a decrease in solar radiation at the sea surface level, affecting the ability of photosynthetic zooxanthellae to produce nutrients for the coral, whereas, a sudden exposure of the coral reef to the atmosphere due to a low tide event may induce coral bleaching."&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Coral reefs with fishes.JPG|thumb|Coral reef with fish]]
The loss of coral would have a subsequent effect on the total number of fish that exist within these ecosystems. In the Indo-Pacific coral reefs alone, there are in-between 4000 and 5000 different species of fish that have a relationship with the species of coral.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eatlas.org.au/content/relationship-between-corals-and-fishes-great-barrier-reef|title=Relationship between corals and fishes on the Great Barrier Reef {{!}} eAtlas|website=eatlas.org.au|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the numerous different species of [[Butterflyfish|butterfly fish]] that feed on coral within these reefs would be affected if the coral was unable to live due to an increase in sea level.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"/&gt; Referring back to the food chain topic, this would then subsequently but directly affect species of snappers, eels, and sharks that use butterfly fish as a primary source of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://a-z-animals.com/animals/butterfly-fish/|title=Butterfly Fish (Chaetodontidae) - Animals - A-Z Animals - Animal Facts, Information, Pictures, Videos, Resources and Links|last=A-Z-Animals.com|website=a-z-animals.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the snappers cannot find any butterfly fish to eat because the butterfly fish are dying due to the lack of coral, it means that the snapper population will decrease as well.

The rising of sea level has the possibility to be catastrophic to the coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-coastal-areas|title=Climate Impacts on Coastal Areas|last=EPA,OA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
[[Pollution]] is another crucial threat to animal life, and human life, across the world. Every form of pollution has an effect on wildlife, whether it be through the air, water, or ground. While sometimes the origin and form of pollution is visible and easy to determine, other times it can be a mystery as to what exactly is causing the death of animals. Through constant and consistent observation of habitat analysis, humans can help prevent the loss of animal life by recognizing the early signs of pollution before the problem becomes too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ocean and water pollution====
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-02.png|thumb|Map of the area where fishing was affected because of the BP oil spill]]
Pollution can enter bodies of water in many different ways - Through toxic runoff from pesticides and fertilizers, containers of oil and other hazardous materials falling off of ships, or just from debris  from humans that has not been picked up.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter what the form of pollution is, the effects water pollution has on animal life can be drastic. For example, the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP oil spill]] which occurred in 2010 impacted over 82,000 birds, 6,000 sea turtles, approximately 26,000 marine animals, and hundreds of thousands of fish.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/a_deadly_toll.html|title=A Deadly Toll|website=www.biologicaldiversity.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the observation of how animal life was and has been affected by this spill is unique and definitely on the larger scale, it still represents an accurate depiction of how observation can be crucial to animal lives. For example, by observing that a certain species of sea turtle was affected by the oil spill, zoologists and their teams would be able to determine the effects the loss of that sea turtle would have.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"/&gt;

Another prominent example is how if one day a fisherman goes to a lake that he/she frequently visits and notices two or three dead fish on the surface. Knowing that that frequently does not happen, the fisherman tells his local city officials and park rangers about the occurrence and they find out that a farmer has been using a new pesticide that runs off into the lake. By simply observing what is common and what is not, the effects of some water pollution can be stopped before becoming too severe.

====Air pollution====
[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Smoke coming from a factory]]
Air pollution is commonly associated with the image of billowing clouds of smoke rising into the sky from a large factory. While the fumes and smoke previously stated definitely is a prominent form of air pollution, it is not the only one. Air pollution can come from the emission of cars, smoking, and other sources.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Air pollution does not just affect birds though, like one may have thought. Air pollution affects mammals, birds, reptiles, and any other organism that requires oxygen to live.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Frequently, if there is any highly dangerous air pollution, the animal observation process will be rather simple: There will be an abundance of dead animals located near the vicinity of the pollution.

The primary concern of air pollution is how widespread the pollution can become in a short period of time. [[Acid rain]] is one of the largest forms of pollution today. The issue with acid rain is that it affects literally every living organism it comes in contact with, whether that be trees in a forest, water in an ocean or lake, or the skin of humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/world-weather/acid-rain.html|title=Acid Rain|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are emitted from factories.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; If it is not controlled in a timely manner, it could lead to loss of life due to the dangerous nature of the composition of the rain.

===Deforestation===
Deforestation has become one of the most prevalent issues environmentally. With an continuously growing population and not having the space to contain all the humans on Earth, forests are frequently the first areas that are cleared to make more room.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation-overview/|title=Deforestation Facts, Deforestation Information, Effects of Deforestation - National Geographic|last=Society|first=National Geographic|newspaper=National Geographic|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to National Geographic, forests still cover approximately 30 percent of the land on Earth but each year large portions are cleared.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

With deforestation, there are numerous subsequent side effects. Most notably, the clearing of entire forests (in some instances) destroys the habitat for hundreds of species of animals and 70 percent of the animals that reside in the forest will die as a result.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, deforestation causes a reduction in the total [[Canopy (biology)|canopy cover]] which leads to more extreme temperature swings on the ground level because there are no branches and leaves to catch the sun's rays.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

The way to combat the severe effects on the loss of animal life would be to stop cutting trees and forests down. While this is unlikely and almost impossible to happen, there is another solution: the partial removal of forests. By only removing portions of the forest, it keeps the environment of the entire forest in tact which allows the animals to adapt to their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, it is recommended that for every tree that is cut down that another one be planted elsewhere in the forest.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Economic effects of animal observation==

===Costs of observation===
Typically, the costs of animal observation are minuscule. As previously stated, animal observation can be done on a small or large scale; it just depends what goal an individual has in mind. For example, animal observation can be performed in the backyard of a house or at a local state park at no charge. All one would have to do is take a notepad, phone, or other device to write down their data and observations. On a larger scale, animal observation could be performed at an animal reserve, where the associated costs would be those associated with keeping the animals happy inside the reserve.

While it is impossible to pinpoint exactly how much the zoos across the world spend on live streaming, it is estimated to be in the $1,000 range for every camera that is set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livestream.com/platform/pricing|title=Livestream {{!}} Plans &amp; Pricing|website=Livestream|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs that observation prevents===
Referring back to the example from the "Deceased Wildlife Observation" section, it becomes apparent how animal observation can save families and the government money. With the average cost of repairing a car that has damage from a large sized animal being $2,000, families and the government could save money by making the public aware that they should proceed with caution in areas where animals have been hit.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pollution in Maracaibo lake.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Water pollution at Maracaibo lake]]
Additionally, approximately $44 million of the $4.3 billion spent on water purity is spent each year on protecting aquatic species from nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"/&gt; It is encouraging that the government is willing to spend the money to help save animals' lives, sometimes the effects of the pollution take effect before they are able to stop them entirely.  One million seabirds and hundred thousand aquatic mammals and fish that are killed as a result of water pollution each year and that has its economic effects, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-pollution|title=11 Facts About Pollution {{!}} DoSomething.org {{!}} Volunteer for Social Change|website=www.dosomething.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly, the loss of aquatic mammals and fish has a direct impact on the sales of food. The EPA estimated recently that the effects of pollution cost the fishing industry tens of millions of dollars in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-economy|title=The Effects: Economy|last=EPA,OW,OWOW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly, the loss of birds causes humans to spend more money on pest control because the food chain is out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatdobirdseat.info|title=What do Birds Eat?|website=www.whatdobirdseat.info|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small rodents and insects that some birds prey upon are no longer being killed if the birds die. This means more of these pests find their ways into homes which causes more people to call exterminators, therefore setting off a chain reaction. The exterminators then must use insecticides to kill the animals which can have harmful runoff into the ground and local water systems, instead of allowing it to be done naturally by the animal food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toxicsaction.org/problems-and-solutions/pesticides|title=The Problem with Pesticides {{!}} Toxics Action Center|website=www.toxicsaction.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The standard deviation of wind direction is a measure of lateral [[turbulence]] and is used in a method for estimating the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#The Pasquill atmospheric stability classes|Pasquill stability category]] in air pollution dispersion.

The simple method for calculating standard deviation requires two passes through the list of values. The first pass determines the average of those values; the second pass determines the sum of the squares of the differences between the values and the average. This double-pass method requires access to all values. A [[Standard deviation#Rapid calculation methods|single-pass method]] can be used for normal data but is unsuitable for [[Polar coordinate system|angular]] data such as wind direction where the 0°/360° (or ±180°) discontinuity forces special consideration. For example, the directions 1°, 0°, and 359° (or −1°) should not average to the direction 180°.

The Yamartino method, introduced by Robert J. Yamartino in 1984, solves both problems. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has chosen it as the preferred way to compute the standard deviation of wind direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidance/met/mmgrma.pdf Meteorological Monitoring Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications (section 6.2.1)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A further discussion of the Yamartino method, along with other methods of estimating the standard deviation of wind direction can be found in Farrugia &amp; Micallef.

It is possible to calculate the exact standard deviation in one pass. However, that method needs slightly more calculation effort.

==Algorithm==
Over the time interval to be averaged across, ''n'' measurements of wind direction (''θ'') will be made and two totals are accumulated without storage of the ''n'' individual values. At the end of the interval the calculations are as follows: with the average values of sin&amp;nbsp;''θ'' and cos&amp;nbsp;''θ'' defined as

:&lt;math&gt;s_a = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \sin \theta_i,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_a = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \cos \theta_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the average wind direction is given via the four-quadrant arctan(x,y) function as

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_a=\arctan(c_a,s_a).&lt;/math&gt;

From twenty different functions for ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; using variables obtained in a single-pass of the wind direction data, Yamartino found the best function to be

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \arcsin (\varepsilon) \left[1+\left(\tfrac 2 {\sqrt 3} -1\right) \varepsilon^3\right], &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\sqrt{1-(s^2_a+c^2_a)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The key here is to remember that sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ'' + cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ'' = 1 so that for example, with a constant wind direction at any value of ''θ'', the value of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; will be zero, leading to a zero value for the standard deviation.
 
The use of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; alone produces a result close to that produced with a double-pass when the dispersion of angles is small (not crossing the discontinuity), but by construction it is always between 0 and 1.  Taking the [[arcsine]] then produces the double-pass answer when there are just two equally common angles: in the extreme case of an oscillating wind blowing backwards and forwards, it produces a result of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians, i.e. a [[right angle]].  The final factor adjusts this figure upwards so that it produces the double-pass result of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt; radians for an almost uniform distribution of angles across all directions, while making minimal change to results for small dispersions.

The theoretical maximum error against the correct double-pass ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore about 15% with an oscillating wind. Comparisons against Monte Carlo generated cases indicate that Yamartino's algorithm is within 2% for more realistic distributions.

A variant might be to weight each wind direction observation by the wind speed at that time.
