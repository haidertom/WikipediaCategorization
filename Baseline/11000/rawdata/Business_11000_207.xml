'''''Business Center''''' is a former primetime business news show on [[CNBC Asia]].  It debuted in mid-October 2000 to replace the Asian Edition of Global Market Watch.  The show took its name from CNBC US' flagship evening show, ''Business Center'' and while it shared the same lower-thirds, the background for the charts remained the same as the ones used during other daytime shows.

The show reviewed all the action from the Asian trading day, crossed-over to Europe to see the midday action there and previewed the session in the US.  It also featured updates and analysis of the currency markets from [[Dow Jones Newswires]].  World news updates are also featured and the show ends by telling viewers the business events or the kinds of economic data across the region scheduled to be released the following day.

It was initially presented by Martin Soong and Grace Phan.

Regular contributors to the show included Maria Bartiromo (CNBC US) and Nick Hastings (Dow Jones Newswires).  Various reporters from CNBC Europe also gave updates on the European trading day.

The show was ultimately replaced in February 2005 by [[CNBC Tonight]].

'''Business and Professional Women's Foundation (BPW)''' is an organization focused on creating successful workplaces. 

The work of BPW Foundation is supporting workforce development programs and workplace policies that recognize the needs of working women, communities and businesses. 

BPW Foundation houses The Rawalt Online Resource Center, a clearinghouse for information focused on working women and families.

==Current issues==
* Successful Workplaces Movement
* [[Pay equity]]
* Support for women veterans
* [[Contraceptive]] equity
* Family time flexible leave
* [[Equal Rights Amendment]]

==Structure==
The work of BPW Foundation is supported through corporate partnerships, grants and individual philanthropic donations.  Its Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) number is 10506. It is governed by a Board of Trustees.

==History==
The legacy of Business and Professional Women/USA began in 1919.

While mobilizing for [[World War I]], the U.S. Government recognized the need for a cohesive group to coordinate identification of women's available skills and experience. A [[Women's War Council]], financed through a federal grant, was established by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to organize the resources of professional women. It was guided principally by executives of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA). The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs was founded on July 16, 1919, at a meeting led by [[Lena Madesin Phillips]] of Kentucky. In the 1930s it became a charter member of the [[International Federation of Business and Professional Women]].

BPW/USA became the first organization created to focus on the issues of working women. BPW worked throughout the 1930s to prohibit legislation or directives denying jobs to married women and lobbied successfully to legislatively end the legal practice of workplace preference for unmarried persons and, in the case of married persons, preference for males. BPW/USA was one of the first women's organizations to endorse the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1937. 

At the advent of [[World War II]], BPW developed a classification system for women with specialized skills critical to the war effort and supported the formation of women's branches of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]]. While [[wage discrimination]] has existed in the U.S. since women and minorities first entered the paid workforce, its prevalence was not felt until the massive influx of women sought work during World War II. Immediately following the war, the [[Women's Pay Act of 1945]] - the first ever legislation to require equal pay - was introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]]. It was another 18 years before an equal pay bill made its way to the [[President of the United States|President]]'s desk to be signed into law.

BPW Foundation was incorporated in 1956 as the first foundation dedicated to providing resources to and about working women.  It included research, information, career development programs, workshops and other training opportunities.  The '''Marguerite Rawalt Resource Center''', established in 1980 and put on-line 2006, is a major resource for information and documents on the history of women and women in the workplace.
 
The establishment of "Status of Women" commissions in the U.S. in 1963 was due largely to BPW efforts. President [[John F. Kennedy]] recognized BPW's leading role in securing passage of the Equal Pay Act by giving BPW's National President the first pen he used when signing the Act into law.

[[Virginia Allan]] initiated the "Young Careerist" Program to develop the business and presentation skills of young women between 25–35 years of age. The first National Legislative Conference, held in 1963 in D.C., later developed into BPW's current Policy &amp; Action Conference, where members lobby Congress and the Administration on BPW's legislative issues.

BPW tackled "comparable worth" by calling for newspapers to stop the occupational segregation in classified ads (clustering of women in a few restricted occupations of low-paying, dead-end jobs). Numerous state and municipal governments revamped their pay scales, recognizing dissimilar jobs may not be identical, but may be composed of tasks, educational requirements, experience and other characteristics that are equivalent or comparable. In 1986, [[San Francisco]] became the first city in the nation to approve a pay equity referendum, implementing $34 million in increases for employees in female and minority-dominated jobs.  Continuing with BPW's focus on workplace issues, BPW lobbied Congress for passage of the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], which finally passed in 1993.
     
Discussions on [[comparable worth]] were expanded to include enforcement and strengthening of existing Equal Pay legislation. The [[Pay Equity Employment Act of 1994]], followed by the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] (introduced in 1994) and the [[Paycheck Fairness Act]] (introduced in 1997) became BPW's focus legislation through the '90s. Then-Secretary of Labor, [[Elizabeth Dole]], and First Lady [[Barbara Bush]] addressed BPW's members at the White House Briefing during the 1990 "Lobby Day" event. Subsequent speakers have included Senator [[Tom Harkin]], First Lady (Senator) [[Hillary Clinton]] and Congresswomen [[Rosa DeLauro]] and [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]].

In 2005, BPW used its grassroots power to continue the [[Bureau of Labor and Statistics]]' (BLS) Working Women Series and to re-instate [[Lifetime TV]] on the [[DISH Network]] programming.  During this same year in October, BPW/USA launched Women Joining Forces:Closing Ranks, Opening Doors (WJF), a program to support women veterans as they transition from military to civilian life. This commitment made BPW/USA the first and only non-governmental agency to offer programming that supports women veterans. 

 
Workplace equity issues including [[sexual harassment]], opportunities for women [[veteran]]s, [[work-life balance]], [[health care reform]], [[dependent care]], [[tort reform]], increasing the [[minimum wage]], lifetime economic security and pay equity continue to be BPW's targeted issues.

In 2009 BPW Foundation merged with its sister organization BPW/USA.

'''Business as usual''' ('''BAU''') - the normal execution of standard functional operations within an [[organization]] - forms a possible contrast to [[project]]s or programmes which might introduce change.{{fact|date=August 2016}}
BAU may also stand in contradistinction to external events which may have the effect of unsettling or distracting those inside an organisation.{{clarifyme|date=August 2016}}{{fact|date=August 2016}}

In [[management]], '''business transformation''' involves making fundamental changes in how [[commerce | business]] is conducted in order to help cope with shifts in [[market environment]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://hbr.org/2007/01/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail/ar/1 Harvard Business Review] January 2007 Kotter
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Business Transformation is the process of fundamentally changing the systems, processes, people and technology across a whole business or business unit, to achieve measurable improvements in efficiency, effectiveness and stakeholder satisfaction. As such, a business transformation project is likely to include any number of change management projects, each focused on an individual process, system, technology, team or department."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.changeassociates.com/blog/post/what-is-business-transformation|title=Business Transformation|last=Cruise|first=David|date=14 Sep 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==When business transformation is used==
The need for business transformation may be caused by external changes in the market such as an organisation's products or services being out of date, funding or income streams being changed, new regulations coming into force or market competition becoming more intense. This management approach also incorporates [[Business Process Reengineering]] and is widely used:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/What_successful_transformations_share_McKinsey_Global_Survey_results_2550 McKinsey Survey] 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* to increase [[revenue]] or [[market share]]
* to improve [[customer satisfaction]]
* to [[cost-cutting|cut costs]]

==Components==
Business transformation is achieved by one or more of: realigning the way staff work, how the organisation is structured, the core product or service portfolio of the business and how technology is used. Typically organisations go through several stages in transforming themselves:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/2007/01/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail/ar/1 Harvard Business Review] January 2007 Kotter&lt;/ref&gt;
* recognising the need to change and gaining consensus amongst stakeholders that change is necessary
* agreeing what form the change should take, the objectives of the change and a [[vision (business)|vision]] that describes a better future
* understanding what the organization is changing from and what needs to change in detail 
* designing the new organisational way of working and its support and management
* testing and implementing changes, usually in waves, typically over a number of years
* bedding in the change so that the organisation cannot move back to how it was and achieves the intended benefits. 
Business transformation can lead to developing new competencies and making better use of existing competencies.&lt;ref&gt;Bak, O. (2016). Investigating Organizational Transformation in Automotive Supply Chains: A Case Study on B2B and Extranet. Strategic Change, 25(3), 299-314. &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''celebrity-industrial complex''' is a social and economic construct which involves a symbiotic relationship between [[celebrity|celebrities]] and business corporations. First proposed by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' [[columnist]] [[Maureen Orth]] in her book, ''[[The Importance of Being Famous]]'' (2003), it is fueled both by the celebrities' seemingly continual search for fame and attention and the business corporations' search for catchy headlines and viable name brands that could be sustained by such celebrities.

In the celebrity-industrial complex, the celebrity either has a particular feature that is attractive to a public audience or is a victim of an occurrence that wins sympathy or condemnation from that same audience; this celebrity, for an initial period of time, becomes a subject of media scrutiny or marketing by properly funded media publication distributors. This media scrutiny, however, can often become a source of income for the celebrity, or the media scrutiny becomes an outlet of promotion for future manufactured publications or initiatives by the celebrities, and the media scrutiny around the celebrity expands to include coverage of such products.

The term "celebrity-industrial complex" is an homage to the much older term [[military–industrial complex]], which refers to a similar bilateral relationship between national militaries and industrial corporations which profit from each other.

The '''Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform''' ('''BERR''') was a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|United Kingdom government department]]. The department was created on 28 June 2007 on the disbanding of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI), and was itself disbanded on 6 June 2009 on the creation of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19525 Number10: Changes to the machinery of Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608051333/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19525 |date=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BERR had a wide range of responsibilities. The main areas covered were essentially those previously covered by the DTI: company law, trade, energy, business growth, employment law, regional economic development and consumer law.  The principal machinery of government changes affecting the department on creation were the removal of the [[Office of Science and Innovation]] to the new [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] and the arrival of the [[Better Regulation Executive]] from the [[Cabinet Office]]. Subsequently, in October 2008, responsibility for [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom|energy policy]] was removed to the new [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]]. It merged with the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] in the June 2009 reshuffle to become the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].

BERR was responsible for the implementation of the [[Companies Act 2006]] and for promoting [[entrepreneurship]] in the UK.  In this context, it supported initiatives such as:

* Make Your Mark,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makeyourmark.org.uk Welcome to Make Your Mark Entrepreneurs]. Makeyourmark.org.uk. Retrieved on 2014-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; the UK's national campaign to give people the confidence, skills and ambition to be more enterprising.
* [[Global Entrepreneurship Week]], the world's first global celebration and promotion of the entrepreneurial spirit amongst young people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7319">'''Distributed manufacturing''' also known as '''distributed production''', '''cloud producing''' and '''local manufacturing''' is a form of decentralized manufacturing practiced by enterprises using a network of geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities that are coordinated using [[information technology]]. It can also refer to local manufacture via the historic [[cottage industry]] model, or manufacturing that takes place in the homes of consumers.

==Consumer==
Within the [[maker movement]] and [[DIY]] culture, small scale production by consumers often using [[peer to peer]] resources is being referred to as distributed manufacturing. Consumers download digital designs from an [[open design]] repository website like [[Youmagine]] or [[Thingiverse]] and produce a product for low costs through a distributed network of 3D printing services such as [[3D Hubs]] or at home with an [[open-source 3-D printer]] such as the [[RepRap]].&lt;ref&gt;Sells, Ed, Zach Smith, Sebastien Bailard, Adrian Bowyer, and Vik Olliver. "Reprap: the replicating rapid prototyper: maximizing customizability by breeding the means of production." HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH IN MASS CUSTOMIZATION AND PERSONALIZATION, (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R., Haufe, P., Sells, E., Iravani, P., Olliver, V., Palmer, C., &amp; Bowyer, A. (2011). Reprap??? the replicating rapid prototyper. Robotica, 29(1), 177-191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Enterprise==
The primary attribute of distributed manufacturing is the ability to create value at geographically dispersed locations via manufacturing. For example, [[shipping]] costs could be minimized when products are built geographically close to their intended markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durach|first=Christian F.|last2=Kurpjuweit|first2=Stefan|last3=Wagner|first3=Stephan M.|date=2017-09-25|title=The impact of additive manufacturing on supply chains|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/IJPDLM-11-2016-0332|journal=International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management|volume=47|issue=10|pages=954–971|doi=10.1108/ijpdlm-11-2016-0332|issn=0960-0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, products manufactured in a number of small facilities distributed over a wide area can be customized with details adapted to individual or regional tastes.

{{Psychology sidebar}}

In the field of [[psychology]], the '''Dunning–Kruger effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] in which people of low ability have [[illusory superiority]] and mistakenly assess their [[cognition|cognitive ability]] as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the [[self-awareness]] of [[metacognition]], low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;

As described by social psychologists [[David Dunning]] and [[Justin Kruger]], the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, "the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others."&lt;ref name="Kruger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kruger|first=Justin|author-link=Justin Kruger|last2=Dunning|first2=David|author2-link=David Dunning|date=1999|title=Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1121–1134|citeseerx=10.1.1.64.2655|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121|pmid=10626367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original study==
The psychological phenomenon of illusory superiority was identified as a form of cognitive bias in Kruger and Dunning's 1999 study "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments".&lt;ref name="Kruger" /&gt; The identification derived from the cognitive bias evident in the criminal case of McArthur Wheeler, who robbed banks with his face covered with lemon juice, which he believed would make it invisible to the surveillance cameras. This belief was based on his misunderstanding of the chemical properties of lemon juice as an [[invisible ink]].&lt;ref name="post2010"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/23/why-losers-have-delusions-of-grandeur/|title=Why losers have delusions of grandeur|date=23 May 2010|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other investigations of the phenomenon, such as "Why People Fail to Recognize Their Own Incompetence" (2003), indicate that much incorrect self-assessment of competence derives from the person's ignorance of a given activity's standards of performance.&lt;ref name=psymq&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunning|first=David|author-link=David Dunning|last2=Johnson|first2=Kerri|last3=Ehrlinger|first3=Joyce|last4=Kruger|first4=Justin|author4-link=Justin Kruger|date=1 June 2003|title=Why People Fail to Recognize Their Own Incompetence|journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=83–87|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunning and Kruger's research also indicates that training in a task, such as solving a logic puzzle, increases people's ability to accurately evaluate how good they are at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/11/revisiting-why-incompetents-think-theyre-awesome/|title=Revisiting why incompetents think they’re awesome|last=Lee|first=Chris|date=5 November 2016|work=[[Ars Technica]]|page=3|accessdate=11 January 2014|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Self-insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself'' (2005), Dunning described the Dunning–Kruger effect as "the [[anosognosia]] of everyday life", referring to a neurological condition in which a disabled person either denies or seems unaware of his or her disability. He stated: "If you're incompetent, you can't know you're incompetent&amp;nbsp;... The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is."&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/the-anosognosics-dilemma-1/|title=The Anosognosic's Dilemma: Something's Wrong but You'll Never Know What It Is (Part 1)|last=Morris|first=Errol|author-link=Errol Morris|date=20 June 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="selfinsight"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56066405|title=Self-insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself|last=Dunning|first=David|author-link=David Dunning|date=2005|pages=14–15|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=1841690740|location=New York|oclc=56066405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later studies==
Dunning and Kruger tested the hypotheses of the cognitive bias of illusory superiority on undergraduate students of introductory courses in psychology by examining the students' self-assessments of their intellectual skills in [[logical reasoning]] ([[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[deductive]], [[abductive]]), English grammar, and personal sense of humor. After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class. The competent students underestimated their class rank, and the incompetent students overestimated theirs, but the incompetent students did not estimate their class rank as higher than the ranks estimated by the competent group. Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/07/07/What-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect-Is-and-Isnt/|title=What the Dunning-Kruger effect Is and Isn't|last=Yarkoni|first=Tal|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform. Incompetent students improved their ability to correctly estimate their class rank after receiving minimal tutoring in the skills they previously lacked, regardless of any objective improvement gained in said skills of perception.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt; The study ''Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-estimated Ability'' (2004) extended the cognitive-bias premise of [[illusory superiority]] to test the subjects' emotional sensitivity toward other people and their perceptions of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ames|first=Daniel R.|last2=Kammrath|first2=Lara K.|date=September 2004|title=Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-Estimated Ability|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_kammrath_mindreading.pdf|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=187–209|doi=10.1023/b:jonb.0000039649.20015.0e|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance'' (2003) indicated a shift in the participants' view of themselves when influenced by external cues. The participants' knowledge of geography was tested; some tests were intended to positively affect the participant's self-view and some were intended to affect it negatively. The participants then were asked to rate their performances; the participants given tests with a positive intent reported better performance than did the participants given tests with a negative intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ehrlinger|first=Joyce|last2=Dunning|first2=David|author2-link=David Dunning|title=How chronic self-views influence (and potentially mislead) estimates of performance.|date=January 2003|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher=American Psychological Association|volume=84|issue=1|pages=5–17|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.5|pmid=12518967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test Dunning and Kruger's hypotheses, "that people, at all performance levels, are equally poor at estimating their relative performance", the study ''Skilled or Unskilled, but Still Unaware of It: How Perceptions of Difficulty Drive Miscalibration in Relative Comparisons'' (2006) investigated three studies that manipulated the "perceived difficulty of the tasks, and, hence, [the] participants' beliefs about their relative standing". The investigation indicated that when the experimental subjects were presented with moderately difficult tasks, there was little variation among the best performers and the worst performers in their ability to accurately predict their performance. With more difficult tasks, the best performers were less accurate in predicting their performance than were the worst performers. Therefore, judges at all levels of skill are subject to similar degrees of error in the performance of tasks.&lt;ref name="Burson2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burson|first=Katherine A.|last2=Larrick|first2=Richard P.|last3=Klayman|first3=Joshua|title=Skilled or unskilled, but still unaware of it: How perceptions of difficulty drive miscalibration in relative comparisons.|date=2006|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|volume=90|issue=1|pages=60–77|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.1.60|pmid=16448310|hdl=2027.42/39168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In testing alternative explanations for the cognitive bias of illusory superiority, the study ''Why the Unskilled are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-insight Among the Incompetent ''(2008) reached the same conclusions as previous studies of the Dunning–Kruger effect: that, in contrast to high performers, "poor performers do not learn from feedback suggesting a need to improve".&lt;ref name="unskilledunaware"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrlinger|first=Joyce|last2=Johnson|first2=Kerri|last3=Banner|first3=Matthew|last4=Dunning|first4=David|author4-link=David Dunning|last5=Kruger|first5=Justin|author5-link=Justin Kruger|title=Why the unskilled are unaware: Further explorations of (absent) self-insight among the incompetent|year=2008|journal=[[Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes]]|volume=105|issue=1|pages=98–121|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.05.002|pmc=2702783|pmid=19568317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying issues of ''Numeracy'' ==
Two unique papers in ''[[National Numeracy Network|Numeracy]]'' reveal problems with the graphic introduced in the 1999 Kruger and Dunning paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuhfer|first=Edward|last2=(retired)|first2=California State University|last3=Cogan|first3=Christopher|last4=Fleischer|first4=Steven|last5=Gaze|first5=Eric|last6=Wirth|first6=Karl|last7=Consultant|first7=Independent|last8=Islands|first8=California State University - Channel|last9=College|first9=Bowdoin|date=2016|title=Random Number Simulations Reveal How Random Noise Affects the Measurements and Graphical Portrayals of Self-Assessed Competency|journal=Numeracy|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.9.1.4|issn=1936-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuhfer|first=Edward|last2=(retired)|first2=California State University|last3=Fleischer|first3=Steven|last4=Cogan|first4=Christopher|last5=Wirth|first5=Karl|last6=Gaze|first6=Eric|last7=Islands|first7=California State University - Channel|last8=College|first8=Ventura|last9=College|first9=Macalester|date=2017|title=How Random Noise and a Graphical Convention Subverted Behavioral Scientists' Explanations of Self-Assessment Data: Numeracy Underlies Better Alternatives|journal=Numeracy|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.10.1.4|issn=1936-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent researchers used it, (''y'' − ''x'') ''versus'' (''x'') scatter plots, and related variants for nearly two decades. The authors show how a major part of the body of literature that used these approaches seem to have mistaken and interpreted mathematical artifacts as the products of human behavior. The two papers employed paired, well-aligned instruments of known reliability to examine the evaluation of self-assessment measures from the perspective of signal and noise. They show how the mathematical problems inherent in the Kruger–Dunning type graph can be overcome by other kinds of graphing that attenuate noise or employ categorical data from known novices and experts. When artifacts are eliminated, the evidence is strong that humans are generally correct in their self-assessments, with only a small percentage of the participants who were studied exhibiting performance that might merit the label "unskilled and unaware of it". The authors' findings refute the claim that humans, in general, are prone to having greatly inflated views of their abilities, but they support two other tenets of the original Kruger and Dunning research: (1) that self-assessment skill can be learned and (2) experts usually self-assess themselves with better accuracy than do novices. The researchers noted that metacognitive self-assessment skill is of great value, and that it can be taught together with any disciplinary content in college courses.

==Cultural differences in self-perception==
Studies of the Dunning–Kruger effect usually have been of North Americans, but studies of Japanese people suggest that cultural forces have a role in the occurrence of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate.aspx|title=Why We overestimate Our Competence|last=DeAngelis|first=Tori|date=February 2003|journal=Monitor on Psychology|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|volume=34|issue=2|page=60|issn=1529-4978|access-date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self-improving Motivations and Malleable Selves'' (2001) indicated that Japanese people tended to underestimate their abilities, and tended to see underachievement (failure) as an opportunity to improve their abilities at a given task, thereby increasing their value to the social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heine|first=S.

==Historical antecedents==
Although the Dunning–Kruger effect was formulated in 1999, the [[cognitive bias]] of [[illusory superiority]] has been known throughout history and identified by [[intellectual]]s, such as: 
*the philosopher [[Confucius]] (551–479 BC), who said, "Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance"&lt;ref name=psymq/&gt; 
*the philosopher [[Socrates]] (470–399 BC), who interpreted a prophecy from the [[Pythia|Delphic oracle]] that he was wise despite feeling that he did not fully understand anything, as the wisdom of [[I know that I know nothing|being aware that he knew nothing]]
*the playwright [[William Shakespeare]] (1564–1616), who said, "The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool" (''[[As You Like It]]'', V.&amp;nbsp;i.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuller|first=Geraint|date=2011|title=Ignorant of ignorance?|journal=[[Practical Neurology]]|volume=11|issue=6|pages=365–365|doi=10.1136/practneurol-2011-000117|issn=1474-7758|pmid=22100949}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*the poet [[Alexander Pope]] (1688–1744), who wrote in ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', 1709: "A little learning is a dangerous thing"
*the novelist [[Henry Fielding]] (1707–1754), who, in the novel ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'', wrote: "For men of true learning, and almost universal knowledge, always compassionate [pity] the ignorance of others; but fellows who excel in some little, low, contemptible art, are always certain to despise those who are unacquainted with that art."
*the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), who said, "Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge"&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;
*the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), who wrote in ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (aphorism 483), "The Enemies of Truth. — Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |translator-last=Zimmern |translator-first=Helen |date=1910 |title=Human, All Too Human |url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/main/b20790001_v_1_B000773557.pdf |location=Edinburgh |publisher=T. N. FOULIS |page=355 |isbn=978-1591026785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the poet [[W. B. Yeats]] (1865–1939), who, in the poem ''[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]'', said: "The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."&lt;ref name=unskilledunaware/&gt;
*the philosopher and mathematician [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), who said, "One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision."&lt;ref name=unskilledunaware/&gt;

'''Ferdinand Christian Salling''' (10 May 1880 – 22 June 1953) was a Danish [[merchant]] and entrepreneur who founded one of the largest warehouse chains and companies in [[Denmark]]. Ferdinand Salling founded the [[Salling]] warehouse chain and the company that would later own most of [[Dansk Supermarked]]. Hans Christian Salling married Karen Marie Jensen (1838–1919) on 30 July 1918 and the couple had the son [[Herman Salling]].&lt;ref name="DSD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Handel_og_industri/Direkt%C3%B8r/Ferdinand_Salling |title=Ferdinand Salling |publisher=[[Gyldendal]]s Encyclopedia ''Den Store Danske'' |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kj6U0aLI?url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Handel_og_industri/Direkt%C3%B8r/Ferdinand_Salling |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Frederik_Ferdinand_Salling |title=Frederik Ferdinand Salling |publisher=Aarhus City Archives |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kj6UTjtK?url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Frederik_Ferdinand_Salling |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdinand Salling's parents were Hans Christian Salling (1841–1923) and Karen Marie Jensen (1838–1919). After completing school Ferdinand was given an apprenticeship at ''Ulrich Marcussen'' [[Fredericia]]. Salling later moved on to work for ''P. Sieburg'' [[Odense]] and Alfred Zacho in [[Randers]]. In Randers Ferdinand had to manage the store for some time during the illness of his boss. His time in Randers may have given him the experience and confidence his own business. On 19 October 1906 he opened the store "Ferdinand Salling" in [[Aarhus]]. Initially he sold furniture for bedrooms and appliances but the stock soon expanded. In 1912 he moved to larger rooms in ''Søndergade'' 27 and later had the building at ''Søndergade'' 29 added. The business grew gradually and over time he bought more properties in the vicinity. During the [[Second World War]] expansion was stymied but in 1946 they were resumed.

In 1948 the beginnings of ''[[Salling|Salling Stormagasin]]'' was established. The company was changed to a [[limited company]] and at the time it was the largest retail outlet in the city. When Salling died the company was taken over byhs 33 yyear old son [[Herman Salling]].&lt;ref name="Salling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sallingfondene.dk/fondene/historie/ |title=Historie |publisher=[[Salling]] |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kj6V1aDA?url=http://sallingfondene.dk/fondene/historie/ |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravsted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=ferdinandsalling |title=FerdinandSalling |publisher=Gravsteder |language=Danish |accessdate=12 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923180207/http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=ferdinandsalling |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organisations issue template format opinions to indicate issues which are intended to be covered by such opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.citysolicitors.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=162&amp;Itemid=471| title=Draft Foreign Legal Opinion on Transactions Relating to Property In England and Wales| publisher=City of London Law Society| accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or standard form checklists for contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/5-238-3952 |title=Contents of a foreign legal opinion on security: checklist| publisher=Thompson Reuters (Practical Law)| accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The original purpose of foreign legal opinion is grounded in the historical doctrine of ''[[ultra vires]]''.  The concern was that when doing business with a [[corporation]] formed in a foreign country, proper due diligence required that a legal opinion be sought to ensure that the relevant foreign company had the necessary [[Capacity (law)#Business entities|capacity and power]] to enter into the transaction, and that it would be binding upon it.&lt;ref&gt;''Banco de Bilbao v Sancha''; ''Banco de Bilbao v Rey'' [1938] 2 KB 176, CA&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time opinions expanded to cover related aspects of foreign law, such as whether payments might be subject to [[Foreign exchange controls|exchange controls]] or [[Usury#Usury law|usury laws]], whether it was necessary for any of the other parties to hold any licences or permits under the [[Regulation|regulatory laws]] of the foreign country, whether there would be adverse [[tax]] consequences under the laws of the foreign country, whether foreign judgments were recognised and enforced in that country other collateral matters.

During the 1970s and 1980s with the expansions in cross-border lender by financial institutions, [[bank]]s became increasingly concerned to ensure that foreign companies to whom they lent money provided a foreign legal opinion certifying the legal validity of the [[loan agreement|loan transaction]] and the enforceability of the banks' rights (including any [[security interest]]s).&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;  In time these requires came to be reflected in the [[Basel Accords|Basel capital adequacy requirements]] for banks, resulting in different, more favourable, capital weighting for loans supported by opinions.

==Format==

Foreign legal opinions are now highly standardised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Loans, Bonds, Guarantees, Legal Opinions |author=Philip R. Wood |url=https://books.google.vg/books?id=Lu3Hkc348loC&amp;pg=PT487&amp;lpg=PT487&amp;dq=foreign+legal+opinions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MB--J7F85y&amp;sig=IUV2jlMhQps6a29eoZVpnU9Nzac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cGXyU_GzLq3KsQSqhYHQDw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=foreign%20legal%20opinions&amp;f=false |at=26-094|isbn=1847032087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically such opinions will confirm the jurisdiction which they relate to, confirm the documents that they reviewed, list certain assumptions of fact, and then set out various opinion statements.  After the opinion statements, they will typically make certain standard, generally applicable qualifications.

The opinion will ordinarily state the conclusions of law, but will not provide reasoning.  This reflects the role of the foreign law opinion as a risk assessment tool.  The opinion is normally issued in the format of an unqualified favourable statement of the effectiveness of the transaction (hedged in by appropriate assumptions of fact and general qualifications of law).&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;  Where there are areas of legal uncertainty, or issues which require clarification and analysis, the foreign legal opinion will often remain in the standardised format, but will be supplemented with a second, reasoned, opinion.  In cross border transactions the negotiation and discussion of the format of the foreign law opinions elucidates areas of legal stress or risk in relation to the proposed transaction and foreign legal systems.&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;

Standard assumptions normally include assuming that documents and records reviewed by the law firm giving the opinion are accurate, that all copies they review are true copies, and that no provision of any other law (i.e. the laws of any country other than the country on whose laws the opinion is being given) adversely affects the opinion being expressed.  In certain countries it is also standard to assume the genuineness of signatures and [[company seal|seals]], but in other countries the foreign law firm may be expected to verify the accuracy of such signatures.

The substantive opinion statements a foreign legal opinion will make will ordinarily include:
# that the relevant obligations be recognised as constituting valid and binding obligations of the foreign party;
# which person or organ has power on behalf of the foreign entity to enter into the transaction;
# the proper method of execution of documents by the foreign party;
# that the transaction does not breach the constitutional documents of the foreign entity, or the laws of the foreign country (and, sometimes, any agreements which are binding upon the foreign entity and its assets);
# that no approvals or licences are required in the foreign country in relation to the transaction;
# that the transaction documents are not subject to stamp duty or registration requirements in the foreign country;
# that no withholding or other taxes apply to the transaction in the foreign country;
# that the foreign entity does not have [[sovereign immunity]] under the laws of the foreign country;
# that there are no exchange control regulations in the foreign country which would affect the transaction;
# that the foreign entity is in good standing, and is not subject to winding-up or dissolution;
# to what extent judgments or [[arbitral award]]s from another country would be recognised and enforced in the foreign country (without re-examination of the merits);
# the efficacy of [[choice of law clause]]s and [[jurisdiction clause]]s in the foreign jurisdiction;
# whether any terms of the transaction contravene [[public policy]] in the foreign country; and
# whether any of the other parties to the transaction (other than the foreign entity) would be treated as carrying on business or subject to tax in the foreign country by entering into the transaction.

Standard qualifications are usually matters of general law which it is impractical to advise upon in the abstract, but which might undermine the effectiveness of the enforceability of the transaction.  For example most opinions will indicate that if the foreign party goes into bankruptcy that will limit the ability to enforce obligations against it.  Similarly, rights may be lost when statutory [[limitation period]]s expire.  In certain countries enforcement of obligations may be subject to obligations of good faith and fair dealing, and the foreign legal opinion will normally point this out by way of qualification.

==Conflicts of laws==
The foreign legal opinion will typically express opinions on various issues which might not ordinarily be governed by the laws of the foreign country under its own [[conflict of laws]] system.  Because a cross border transaction might end up being considered by the courts of any of a number of countries, the addressee(s) of the opinion will wish to be assured that all relevant issues, if determined by that foreign law, would likely be resolved satisfactorily.  The courts of a third country may apply different choice of law rules to determine the ''[[lex causae]]'' of a particular issue to the courts of the foreign country.

'''Franco Belgiorno-Nettis''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC|CBE}} (20 June 1915 – 8 July 2006) was an [[Australia]]n industrialist and patron of the arts. He founded the construction and engineering company [[Transfield]] and also helped establish the Australian Biennale subsequently known as the [[Biennale of Sydney]].&lt;ref name=NPG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt;

==Biography==
Belgiorno-Nettis was born in [[Cassano delle Murge]] in the [[Province of Bari]] in [[Apulia]], [[Italy]] in 1915 and attended the Turin Military Academy before joining the Italian army and serving in [[North Africa]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/an-achiever-whose-dreams-came-true/2006/07/10/1152383674252.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=11 July 2006 |title=An achiever whose dreams came true |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109012742/http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/an-achiever-whose-dreams-came-true/2006/07/10/1152383674252.html?page=fullpage |archivedate=9 January 2016 |first=Tony |last=Stephens}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 3 years at an allied [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]] in [[India]]. After the war he returned to Italy to complete his studies in engineering at the [[University of Turin]]. In 1951 he came to Australia as the employee of Italian engineering firm Electric Power Transmission, (an offshoot of Milan-based Societa' Anonima Elettrificazione), which was constructing powerlines.

Franco Belgiorno-Nettis and Amina Cerino-Zegna wed by proxy in 1951 &amp;ndash; Belgiorno-Nettis' brother represented him at the altar of Turin Cathedral for the marriage.  Amina soon after joined her husband in Australia, and their three sons, Marco Belgiorno-Zegna, Luca Belgiorno-Nettis and Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, were born between 1953 and 1959.&lt;ref name=NPG&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.portrait.gov.au/people/amina-belgiorno-nettis |publisher= National Portrait Gallery |title= Amina Belgiorno-Nettis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 he and his professional partner, [[Carlo Salteri]], set up [[Transfield Services|Transfield]] which became the largest construction and engineering firm in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/the-deal-magazine/transfields-luca-belgiornonettis-branches-into-information-technology/news-story/be2114283dbc9ec64ac853687425d933 |newspaper=The Australian |date=15 May 2015 |title=Transfield’s Luca Belgiorno-Nettis branches into information technology |first=Tom |last=Dusevic |publisher=News Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also prominent as a patron of the arts. In 1961 he set up the [[Transfield Art Prize]].&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt; He also helped to found the [[Biennale of Sydney]] in 1973.

Franco Belgiorno-Nettis died in 2006 aged 91 either after a fall while on holiday in Italy,&lt;ref name=Stephens/&gt; and/or of a terminal brain stroke while attending to home maintenance in Italy.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6120">In [[United States labor law]], a '''hostile work environment''' exists when one's behavior within a workplace creates an environment that is difficult or uncomfortable for another person to work in, due to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eeolaws.blogspot.com/2017/12/establishing-hostile-work-environment.html Berry, John, Establishing a Hostile Work Environment (EEO Law Blog 2017)]"&lt;/ref&gt; Common complaints in [[sexual harassment]] lawsuits include fondling, suggestive remarks, sexually-suggestive photos displayed in the workplace, use of sexual language, or [[Off-color humor|off-color jokes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Human Resource Management|date=October 4, 2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|isbn=978-0073530468|pages=78|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small issues, annoyances, and isolated incidents typically are not considered illegal. To be unlawful, the conduct must create a work environment that would be [[intimidation|intimidating]], [[hostility|hostile]], or offensive to a [[reasonable person]]. An employer can be held liable for failing to prevent these workplace conditions, unless it can prove that it attempted to prevent the [[workplace harassment|harassment]] and that the employee failed to take advantage of existing harassment counter-measures or tools provided by the employer.&lt;ref name="EEOCharass"&gt;{{cite web |title=Harassment |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm |publisher=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hostile work environment may also be created when management acts in a manner designed to make an employee [[resignation|quit]] in [[Organizational retaliatory behavior|retaliation]] for some action. For example, if an employee reported safety violations at work, was injured, attempted to join a [[trade union|union]], or reported regulatory violations by management, and management's response was to harass and pressure the employee to quit. Employers have tried to force employees to quit by imposing unwarranted discipline, reducing hours, cutting wages, or transferring the complaining employee to a distant work location.

The [[United States Supreme Court]] stated in ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/75/case.html], Oncale v. Sundowner, Case Text&lt;/ref&gt; that Title VII is "not a general civility code." Thus, federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not extremely serious. Rather, the conduct must be so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the individual's employment. The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminates in a [[tangibility|tangible]] [[employment action]] or is sufficiently severe or pervasive.

==Burdens of proof==
Where a hostile environment is alleged, the legality of behaviors must be determined on a case by case basis. In the workplace, such a claim focuses on the working conditions that must be endured by the victim as a condition of employment, rather than on tangible job changes. To establish whether the situation is actionable the "totality of circumstances" must be weighed with an eye to determining "that the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment in that it was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment".&lt;ref&gt;Pellicciotti, Joseph M. ''Title VII Iiability for sexual harassment in the workplace''. Alexandria, Va. International Personnel Management Association, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other laws ==
In many United States jurisdictions, a hostile work environment is not an independent legal claim. That is, an employee can not file a lawsuit on the basis of a hostile work environment alone. Instead, an employee must prove they have been treated in a hostile manner ''because'' of their membership in a protected class, such as gender, age, race, national origin, disability status, and similar protected traits.&lt;ref name="EEOCharass"/&gt; Importantly, the hostile work environment is gender neutral, that is, men can sexually harass men or women and women can sexually harass men or women.

Likewise, a hostile work environment can be considered the "adverse employment action" that is an element of a [[Whistleblower protection in the United States|whistleblower claim]] or a reprisal (retaliation) claim under a civil rights statute. When an employee claims that a hostile work environment is an adverse employment action, the legal analysis is similar to the burdens of proof described above. However, to recover damages, the employee must also establish all other elements of the claim, such as that the employee engaged in protected conduct such as making a report of discrimination or reporting an employer's violation of law, and also establish that the employer created the hostile work environment, at least in part, because the employee engaged in the protected activity.

:''See also [[Voucher]]: an invoice is within the [[European union]] primarily legally defined by the EU VAT directive as an [[accounting]] [[voucher]] (to verify tax and VAT reporting) and secondly as a [[Civil law (common law)]] document.
An '''invoice''', '''bill''' or '''tab''' is a [[commerce|commercial]] document issued by a [[sales|seller]] to a [[buyer]], relating to a sale transaction and indicating the [[product (business)|products]], quantities, and agreed [[price]]s for products or [[Service (economics)|services]] the seller had provided the buyer.

[[Discounts and allowances|Payment terms]] are usually stated on the invoice. These may specify that the buyer has a maximum number of days in which to pay and is sometimes offered a discount if paid before the due date. The buyer could have already paid for the products or services listed on the invoice.

In the rental industry, an invoice must include a specific reference to the duration of the time being billed.{{cn|date=June 2018}} So in addition to quantity, price, and discount, the invoice amount is also based on duration. Generally, each line of a rental invoice will refer to the actual hours, days, weeks, months, etc., being billed.

From the point of view of a seller, an invoice is a ''sales invoice''. From the point of view of a buyer, an invoice is a ''purchase invoice''. The document indicates the buyer and seller, but the term ''invoice'' indicates money is owed ''or'' owing.

In countries where [[wire transfer]] is the preferred method of settling debts, the printed bill will contain the [[bank account number]] of the creditor and usually a reference code to be passed along the transaction identifying the payer.

The US [[Defense Logistics Agency]] requires an [[employer identification number]] on invoices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtc.dla.mil/dsbusiness/Info/ConAdmin3.htm US Defense Logistics Agency  - Required information in invoices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710164204/http://www.dtc.dla.mil/dsBusiness/Info/ConAdmin3.htm |date=10 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union requires a [[value added tax identification number|VAT (value added tax) identification number]].

In Canada, the registration number for [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|GST]] purposes must be furnished for all supplies over $30 made by a registered supplier in order to claim input tax credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-91-45/FullText.html Input Tax Credit Information (GST/HST) Regulations, SOR/91-45], at s. 3(b)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

* (11a) where the customer is liable for the payment of the VAT, the mention ‘reverse charge’;
* (12) in the case of the supply of a new [[means of transport]] made in accordance with the conditions specified in Article 138(1) and (2)(a), the characteristics as identified in point (b) of Article 2(2);

* (14) where one of the special arrangements applicable to [[second-hand goods]], [[works of art]], collectors’ items and antiques is applied, the mention ‘margin scheme — second-hand goods’; ‘margin scheme — works of art’ or ‘margin scheme — collector’s items and antiques’ respectively;
* (15) where the person liable for payment of VAT is a tax representative for the purposes of Article 204, the ([[VAT identification number]], referred to in Article 214, of that tax representative, together with his full name and address.

====EU VAT union receipt (simple invoice) definition====
Article 226b of the EU VAT Directive is a concise definition of [[receipts]] within the union member states.

As regards simplified invoices issued pursuant to Article 220a and Article 221(1) and (2), Member States shall require at least the following details:

* (a) the date of issue;
* (b) identification of the taxable person supplying the goods or services ([[VAT identification number]]);
* (c) identification of the type of goods or services supplied;
* (d) the VAT amount payable or the information needed to calculate it;
* (e) where the invoice issued is a document or message treated as an invoice pursuant to Article 219, specific and unambiguous reference to that initial invoice and the specific details which are being amended.

They may not require details on invoices other than those referred to in Articles 226, 227 and 230.

===Australian Tax Office Tax invoice definition===

Details about the [[Australian Tax Office]] (ATO) requirements for a tax invoice can be found on their website.&lt;ref&gt;Requirements of tax invoices https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/GST/Issuing-tax-invoices/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How
to set out tax invoices and invoices {{cite web |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Bus/How-to-set-out-tax-invoices-and-invoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209145851/https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Bus/How-to-set-out-tax-invoices-and-invoices/ |archivedate=9 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all GST purposes, a seller must issue a tax invoice to the buyer regardless the sale being in cash or credit. Hence, a tax invoice in Australia serves as an invoice as well as a receipt in the conventional sense. The words 'paid' or 'payable' will differentiate meaning. The tax invoice must contain seven facts as per the GST Tax Law.

==Variations==
There are different types of invoices:

* '''[[Pro forma]]''' invoice — In [[foreign trade]], a ''pro forma'' invoice is a document that states a commitment from the seller to provide specified goods to the buyer at specific prices. It is often used to declare value for [[customs]]. It is not an actual invoice, and thus the seller does not record a ''pro forma'' invoice as an [[accounts receivable|account receivable]] and the buyer does not record a ''pro forma'' invoice as an [[accounts payable|account payable]]. A ''pro forma'' invoice is not issued by the seller until the seller and buyer have agreed to the terms of the [[order (business)|order]]. In a few cases, a ''pro forma'' invoice is issued to request advance payments from the buyer, either to allow production to start or for security of the goods produced.
* '''[[Credit memo]]''' - If the buyer returns the goods, the seller usually issues a credit memo for the same or lower amount than the invoice, and then refunds the money to the buyer, or the buyer can apply that credit memo to another invoice.
* '''[[Commercial invoice]]''' - a [[customs declaration]] form used in international trade that describes the parties involved in the shipping transaction, the goods being transported, and the value of the goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhl.com/en/express/shipping/customs_support/customs_paperwork.html DHL | Global | Customs Paperwork&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417111615/http://www.dhl.com/en/express/shipping/customs_support/customs_paperwork.html |date=17 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary document used by customs, and must meet specific customs requirements, such as the [[Harmonized System]] number and the country of manufacture. It is used to calculate [[tariff]]s.
* '''Debit memo''' - When a company fails to pay or short-pays an invoice, it is common practice to issue a ''debit memo'' for the [[Balance (accounting)|balance]] and any late fees owed. In function, debit memos are identical to invoices.
* '''Self-billing invoice''' - A ''self billing invoice'' is used when a buyer issues the invoice to themselves (e.g. according to the consumption levels he is taking out of a [[vendor-managed inventory]] stock).&lt;ref&gt;ControlPay, [https://www.controlpay.com/services/freight-audit-solutions Self-billing], accessed 26 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The buyer (i.e. the issuer) should treat the invoice as an account payable and the seller should treat it as an account receivable. If there is tax on the sale, e.g. VAT or GST, then the buyer and seller may need to adjust their tax accounts in accordance with tax legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=HMRC|title=Self-billing and VAT|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/charging/self-billing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 224 of the EU VAT Directive, self-billing processes may only be used "if there is a prior agreement between the two parties and provided that a procedure exists for the acceptance of each invoice" by the supplier.&lt;ref&gt;Consolidated VAT Directive, 2006, Article 224&lt;/ref&gt; A Self-Billing Agreement will usually provide for the supplier NOT to issue their own sales invoices as well. For further information on UK tax requirements for self-billing see HMRC's [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/self-billing-notice-70062 Notice 700/62 - Self-billing)].
* '''Evaluated receipt settlement (ERS)''' - ERS is a process of paying for goods and services from a [[packing slip]] rather than from a separate invoice document. The payee uses data in the packing slip to apply for the payments. "In an ERS transaction, the supplier ships goods based upon an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN), and the purchaser, upon [[receipt]], confirms the existence of a corresponding purchase order or contract, verifies the identity and quantity of the goods, and then pays the supplier."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scm.ncsu.edu/public/facts/facs041014.html SCM | What is Evaluated Receipt Settlement?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Timesheet''' - Invoices for hourly services issued by businesses such as [[lawyer]]s and [[consultant]]s often pull data from a [[Wiktionary:timesheet|timesheet]]. A timesheet invoice may also be generated by [[Operated equipment rental|Operated equipment rental companies]] where the invoice will be a combination of timesheet based charges and equipment rental charges.
* '''Statement''' - A periodic customer statement includes opening balance, invoices, payments, credit memos, debit memos, and ending balance for the customer's account during a specified period. A monthly statement can be used as a summary invoice to request a single payment for accrued monthly charges.
* '''Progress billing''' used to obtain partial payment on extended contracts, particularly in the construction industry (see [[Schedule of values]])
* '''Collective Invoicing''' is also known as monthly invoicing in [[Japan]]. Japanese businesses tend to have many orders with small amounts because of the outsourcing system ([[Keiretsu]]), or of demands for less inventory control ([[Kanban]]). To save the administration work, invoicing is normally processed on monthly basis.
*'''Continuation or Recurring Invoicing''' is standard within the equipment rental industry, including tool rental. A recurring invoice is one generated on a cyclical basis during the lifetime of a rental contract. For example, if you rent an excavator from 1 January to 15 April, on a calendar monthly arrears billing cycle, you would expect to receive an invoice at the end of January, another at the end of February, another at the end of March and a final Off-rent invoice would be generated at the point when the asset is returned. The same principle would be adopted if you were invoiced in advance, or if you were invoiced on a specific day of the month.
*'''Electronic Invoicing''' is not necessarily the same as EDI invoicing. Electronic invoicing in its widest sense embraces EDI as well as XML invoice messages as well as other formats such as pdf. Historically, other formats such as pdf were not included in the wider definition of an electronic invoice because they were not machine readable and the process benefits of an electronic message could not be achieved. However, as data extraction techniques have evolved and as environmental concerns have begun to dominate the business case for the implementation of electronic invoicing, other formats are now incorporated into the wider definition.

==Electronic==
Some invoices are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over the Internet. It is still common for electronic remittance or invoicing to be printed in order to maintain paper records. Standards for electronic invoicing vary widely from country to country. [[Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI) standards such as the United Nation's [[EDIFACT]] standard include message encoding guidelines for electronic invoices. The [[EDIFACT]] is followed up in the [[UN/CEFACT]] [[ebXML]] syntax cross industry invoice.

===EDIFACT===
The United Nations standard for electronic invoices ("INVOIC") includes standard codes for transmitting header information (common to the entire invoice) and codes for transmitting details for each of the line items (products or services). The "INVOIC" standard can also be used to transmit credit and debit memos.

In the European Union legislation was passed in 2010 in the form of directive 2010/45/EU to facilitate the growth of Electronic Invoicing across all its member states. This legislation caters for varying VAT and inter-country invoicing requirements within the EU, in addition to legislating for the authenticity and integrity of invoices being sent electronically. It is estimated that in 2011 alone roughly 5 million EU businesses will have sent Electronic Invoices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softco.ie/solutions/electronic_invoicing.asp?s=D05A&amp;m=SoftCo.com- The European Electronic Invoicing Experts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111050617/http://www.softco.ie/solutions/electronic_invoicing.asp?s=D05A&amp;m=SoftCo.com- |date=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open Application Group Integration Specification (OAGIS) from OAGi===
The [[XML]] message format for electronic invoices has been used since the inception of XML in 1998. Open Application Group Integration Specification (OAGIS) has included an invoice since 2001. [http://www.oagi.org/dnn2/ OAGi (Open Applications Group)] has a working relationship with UN/CEFACT where OAGi and its members participate in defining many of the Technology and Methodology specifications. OAGi also includes support for these Technology and Methodology specifications within OAGIS.

===UBL===
The [[XML]] message format for electronic invoices has been used in recent years. There are two standards currently being developed. One is the cross industry invoice under development by the United Nations standards body [[UN/CEFACT]] and the other is [[Universal Business Language|UBL (Universal Business Language)]] which is issued by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards)]]. Implementations of invoices based on UBL are common, most importantly in the public sector in [[Denmark]] as it was the first country where UBL is mandated by law for all the invoices of the public sector. Further implementations are underway in the Scandinavian countries as result of the [[Universal Business Language|NES (North European Subset) project]]. Implementations are also underway in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]] (UBL 2.0)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/digitale-overheid/elektronisch-factureren|title=Elektronisch factureren|publisher=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl|language=Dutch|accessdate=5 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122221456/http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/digitale-overheid/elektronisch-factureren|archivedate=22 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[European Commission]] itself.

The NES work has been transferred to [[European Committee for Standardisation|CEN (European Committee for Standardization)]], (the standards body of the European Union) workshop CEN/BII, for public procurement in Europe. The result of that work is a pre-condition for PEPPOL, pan European pilots for public procurement, financed by the European Commission. There UBL procurement documents will be implemented in cross-border pilots between European countries.

Agreement has been made between UBL and UN/CEFACT for convergence of the two XML messages standards with the objective of merging the two standards into one before end of 2009 including the provision of an upgrade path for implementations started in either standard.

===ISDOC===
[http://www.isdoc.org/ ISDOC] is a standard that was developed in the Czech Republic as a universal format for electronic invoices. On 16 October 2008, 14 companies and the Czech government signed a declaration to use this format within one year in their products.

==Payment==
Organizations purchasing goods and services usually have a process in place for approving payment of invoices based on an employee's confirmation that the goods or services have been received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invoicetemplate.ca/MDO_BTP_Invoice_flowchart_123954_7.pdf Michigan state Bureau of Transportation Invoice processing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacy.navy.mil/noticenumber/N07240-1.asp US Department of the Navy Commercial Invoice Payments History System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703144851/http://privacy.navy.mil/noticenumber/N07240-1.asp |date=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://guidebook.dcma.mil/18/commer.htm Commercial Contracting Guidelines - US Defense Contract Management Agency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626102249/http://guidebook.dcma.mil/18/commer.htm |date=26 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acquisition.gov/bestpractices/bestpcont.html US Office of Federal Procurement Policy - Best Practices for Contract Administration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612211853/http://www.acquisition.gov/bestpractices/bestpcont.html |date=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, when paying an invoice, a [[remittance advice]] will be sent to the supplier to inform them their invoice has been paid.

==Standardisation==
Invoices are different from [[receipts]]. Both invoices and receipts are ways of tracking purchases of goods and services. In general the content of the invoices can be similar to that of receipts including tracking the amount of the sale, calculating sales tax owed and calculating any discounts applied to the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workingpoint.com/help/en/searchable/WorkingPoint_Help.htm |title=WorkingPoint Help |publisher=Workingpoint.com |accessdate=2013-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819082014/http://www.workingpoint.com/help/en/searchable/WorkingPoint_Help.htm |archivedate=19 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Invoices differ from receipts in that invoices serve to notify customers of payments owed, whereas receipts serve as proof of completed payment.

==Invoice finance==
Invoice finance is effectively a line of credit for a business that is secured on the business's portfolio of invoices.

There are several benefits in terms of choosing invoice financing for your business:
* Lower cost
* Flexibility
* Confidentiality

[[Malay styles and titles|Tan Sri Dato' Seri]] '''Abdul Khalid bin Ibrahim''' (born 14 December 1946) is a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] politician who served as the 14th [[Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) of the state of [[Selangor]] from 2008 to 2014. He was elected to the [[Selangor State Assembly]] and the [[Dewan Rakyat|Parliament of Malaysia]] in 2008 and 2013 as a member of the [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]] (PKR), but became an [[independent (politician)|independent]] in August 2014, coinciding with his resignation as Menteri Besar. He was sacked from the party for his refusal to vacate his Selangor Menteri Besar post.

==Early life and business career==
Khalid was born in the village of Kampung Jalan Raja Abdullah in [[Kuala Selangor]] district, Selangor. He graduated from the [[University of Malaya]] with a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in Economics and later obtained an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref name = "khalid"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Fact boxes on Ijok (subscription required)| publisher = malaysiakini.com| date = 19 April 2007| url = http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/66177| accessdate = 20 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalid began his career as a university lecturer. In 1979 he joined the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the leading party in Malaysia's ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sacked-from-party-khalid-set-to-join-past-selangor-mbs-who-fell-from-grace |title=Sacked from party, Khalid set to join past Selangor MBs who fell from grace |date=10 August 2014 |work=Malaysian Insider |accessdate=27 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083529/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sacked-from-party-khalid-set-to-join-past-selangor-mbs-who-fell-from-grace |archivedate= 6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he became the chief executive of the government-controlled [[fund management]] firm [[Permodalan Nasional Berhad]] (PNB), a position he held until 1994.&lt;ref name = "khalid"/&gt; In 1981, he became famous for leading the "dawn raid" on the [[London Stock Exchange]], which resulted in PNB gaining a 51% share in British [[plantation]] concern Guthrie in less than two hours. He later became the CEO of the Malaysianized Guthrie, now known as [[Guthrie (Malaysia)|Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd]], from 1995 to 2003.&lt;ref name = "khalid"/&gt;

==Political career==
In 2006, Khalid joined the opposition PKR, founded by the former deputy prime minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]], and became the party's treasurer-general. The party selected him as its candidate for a [[Ijok by-election, 2007|by-election]] for the [[Selangor State Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Ijok]], which he lost to [[K. Parthiban]] of the [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC), a component party of the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/node/170632|title=Khalid is Keadilan's pick for Ijok|date=18 April 2007|work=The Sun (Malaysia)|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], he contested the federal parliamentary seat of [[Bandar Tun Razak]] and re-contested the Selangor State Assembly seat of [[Ijok]]. He won both seats, while the opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]] coalition made unprecedented gains and took a majority in the Selangor State Assembly. Khalid was appointed as the Menteri Besar of Selangor and was sworn in on 13 March 2008. He was the first person not of the BN coalition to hold the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New Straits Times |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Thursday/NewsBreak/20080313173454/Article/index_html |title=Khalid Ibrahim sworn-in as new Selangor Mentri Besar |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314043108/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Thursday/NewsBreak/20080313173454/Article/index_html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first term, Khalid's government implemented a policy of delivering to each Selangor household an initial 20 cubic metres of water each year free of charge. The State Assembly also passed the country's first freedom of information legislation. It was in these areas—social policy and government transparency—that his administration was able to make the most progress. But in some cases, differences between the partners in the governing coalition, which included (the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP)) and the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS)), proved difficult to reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=Andrew|title=The Constitution of Malaysia: A Contextual Analysis|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=1847319831|chapter=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2009 Khalid rejected a move by PAS to draft legislation banning the sale of alcohol in Muslim-majority neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20090808-159869.html|title=Khalid: Alcohol sales to continue|last=Mazlinda Mahmood|date=8 August 2009|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 general election]], Khalid's Pakatan Rakyat coalition increased its majority in the Selangor State Assembly, winning 44 out of its 56 seats. Though Khalid's PKR won fewer seats than the DAP and PAS, he retained the position of Menteri Besar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fz.com/content/ge13-pakatan-retains-selangor-44-seats|title=GE13: Pakatan retains Selangor with 44 seats|date=6 May 2013|work=fz.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, PKR's national leader, Anwar Ibrahim, then a federal parliamentarian, sought to contest the Selangor State Assembly seat of [[Kajang]] in a [[Kajang by-election, 2014|by-election]]. The so-called "[[Kajang Move]]" would have allowed Anwar to oust Khalid as Menteri Besar with PKR's support. Anwar's conviction on a charge of sodomy caused Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]], to take over Anwar's presidency of PKR and the nomination as PKR candidate in the by-election instead, which she won. In July, the party nominated Wan Azizah as its preferred Menteri Besar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/no-surprise-as-pkr-endorses-wan-azizah-for-selangor-mb-post |title=No surprise as PKR endorses Wan Azizah for Selangor MB post |date=22 July 2014 |work=Malaysian Insider |accessdate=27 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724035056/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/no-surprise-as-pkr-endorses-wan-azizah-for-selangor-mb-post |archivedate=24 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Khalid was expelled from the party after he refused to comply with its direction for him to resign as the state's premier and make way for Wan Azizah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.astroawani.com/news/show/khalid-ibrahim-expelled-from-pkr-effective-immediately-41585|title=Khalid Ibrahim expelled from PKR effective immediately|date=9 August 2014|work=Astro Awani|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid sacked the PKR and DAP members of Selangor's [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]-like Executive Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/khalid-flexes-muscle-sacks-pkr-dap-excos|title=Khalid flexes muscle, sacks PKR, DAP excos|last=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal|date=12 August 2014|work=Malay Mail|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to administer the state as an independent assemblyman with the remaining four councillors from PAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/08/20/Selangor-MB-crisis-PAS-exco/|title=Selangor MB crisis: PAS exco member throws support behind Khalid|last=Ruban|first=A.|date=20 August 2014|work=The Star|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid ultimately resigned on 26 August 2014, as it being clear that he could no longer command the confidence of the State Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/node/26959|title=S’gor Sultan defers Khalid’s resignation until Pakatan names more candidates|last=Nuradilla Noorazam|date=26 August 2014|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in office while [[Sharafuddin of Selangor|Sultan Sharafuddin]] deliberated on whom to appoint as his replacement, before settling on PKR's deputy president [[Azmin Ali]], who was sworn in on 23 September 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15796">[[Management]] consists of the planning, prioritizing, and organizing work efforts to accomplish objectives within a business organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=103937&amp;xtid=44682|title=Management Styles Explained|last=|first=|date=|website=Films on Demand|publisher=Films Media Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''management style''' is the particular way managers go about accomplishing these objectives. It encompasses the way they make decisions, how they plan and organize work, and how they exercise authority.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.managers.org.uk/~/media/Files/PDF/Checklists/CHK-256-Understanding-management-and-leadership-styles.pdf|title=Understanding Management and Leadership Styles|last=|first=|date=|website=Chartered Management Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management styles vary by company, level of management, and even from person to person. A good manager is one that can adjust their management style to suit different environments and employees. An individual’s management style is shaped by many different factors including internal and external business environments, and how one views the role of work in the lives of employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Factors that shape the management style ==

=== Internal factors ===
Internal company factors that determine a management style include, but are not limited to, policies, priorities, and corporate culture, staff skill levels and motivation, and management structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In order to be effective a manager’s style and outlook must fit into the businesses [[organizational culture]]. Their style must adhere to the policies and procedures set forth by the organization, and they must be able to achieve company objectives. They are responsible for controlling an effective work team and must uphold organizational beliefs within that team. A manager who cannot do this would likely be deemed ineffective and removed from the position.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Staff skill levels and motivation greatly affect management styles as it is necessary for a manager to accomplish objectives while maintaining a content and effective work team. Less skilled or motivated employees would require a style that is more controlling and fosters consistent supervision to ensure productivity. Highly motivated or skilled employees require less supervision and direction as they are typically more technically skilled than management and have the ability, and desire, to make more autonomous decisions. These employees would benefit from a management style that is less controlling or hands-off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Hierarchical organization|Hierarchical management structures]] call for decision to be made solely by upper management, and within the scope of a manager’s position in the hierarchy. These types of organizations require more controlling management styles in order to meet objectives and get things done as specified. Fatter structures with more [[decentralized decision-making]] benefit from management styles that encourage team communication and employee’s contribution with regard to decision-making.

=== External factors ===
External factors affecting management styles are those that are outside of the control of the organization. These include, but are not limited to consumers, suppliers, competitors, the economy, and the law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some examples of these factors are a competitor who offers a more autonomous environment for skilled employees and control the job pool; the economy for a specific manufactured good results in a spike in demand causing a production crisis; the laws for a specific industry change and require employees who have extensive knowledge and certification causing the company employees talent and motivation to change.

=== Theory X and Theory Y ===
Douglas McGregor introduced Theory X and Theory Y in 1957.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gannon I, Bougszak II|first=Dave I, Anna II|date=2013|title=Douglas Mcgregor's Theory X and Theory Y.|url=|journal=CRIS - Bulletin of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinary Study|volume=|pages=85–93|via=De Gruyter Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; This psychological concept proposed that how one viewed human relationships to those of an enterprise determined their style of management.

Theory X proposes that people inherently lack the motivation and desire for responsibility and need to be closely supervised, directed, and tightly controlled in order to achieve team objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Without it, workers may become unwilling to work. This is considered the more conventional theory and results in management styles that have high degrees of control over employees.

Theory Y conversely suggests that it is human nature to be motivated by objectives and gain satisfaction through the completion of work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those who believe in Theory Y believe that it is the responsibility of management to foster environments where employees can develop potential and utilize their skills to achieve objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This perspective leads to management styles that give the workers more decision making control and provide less supervision.

== Types of management styles ==
All management styles can be categorized by three major types: Autocratic, Democratic, and Laissez-Faire, with Autocratic being the most controlling and Laissez-Faire being the least controlling.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

=== Autocratic ===
Autocratic management is the most controlling of the management styles. Variations of this style are authoritative, persuasive, and paternalistic. Autocratic managers make all of the decisions in the workplace. Communication with this type of management is one way, top-down to the employees. Employee ideas and contributions are not encouraged or necessary.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=103937&amp;xtid=128526|title=Leadership and Management: Introduction and Case Study|last=|first=|date=|website=Films on Demand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles and tasks are clearly defined, and workers are expected to follow these directions without question while being consistently checked and supervised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This type of style is particularly useful in organizations with hierarchical structures where management makes all of the decisions based on positioning in the hierarchy. Employees that benefit from this style of management include those who are new, unskilled, or unmotivated, as they need the supervision and clear direction. Managers can benefit greatly from using this style in times of crises or serious time constraints.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=103937&amp;xtid=49852|title=Management Styles: Authoritarian and Delegative—Training Point Issues in Management #2|last=|first=|date=|website=Films on Demand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages of the autocratic management style are little uncertainty, clearly defined roles and expectations for employees, and the speed of decision-making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All decisions are made by the manager and employees are expected to be compliant leaving little room for variation or confusion. Decision-making speed is ideal and is not slowed by conflicting thought or agendas.

Disadvantages include lack of staff input with ideas are not encouraged or shared. This can lead to job dissatisfaction, absenteeism, and employee turnover. Because managers make all of the decisions, the employees is not inclined to act autonomously and may become too dependent on the manager. Not all employees want or need supervision, and as a result can become resentful and unhappy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Too many dissatisfied employees and the separation of power with an autocratic management style can lead to an ‘us vs them’ mentality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Authoritative style ====
With this management style there is little trust or confidence in employees. This manager dictates orders to employees and expect that they do exactly as required. These employees are unskilled. This requires constant teaching and coaching of the staff as well as consistent supervision.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Persuasive style ====
Using this management style, the manager still makes all decisions for employees but then convinces employees that these decisions were made in the best interest of the team. The only real difference here is that it can establish a higher level of trust between management and staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Paternalistic or Exploitative/Authoritative style ====
The manager still makes all of the decisions in this style of management and treats the employees in a condescending or paternalistic way.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The decisions are made in the best interest of the employees and the manager explains these decision and the importance of them to the employees. These employees may feel well taken care of and looked after by the paternalistic manager but may become resentful of not being taken seriously. This style breeds highly dependent employees.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=103937&amp;xtid=49851|title=Management Styles: Paternalistic and Collaborative—Training Point Issues in Management #1|last=|first=|date=|website=Films on Demand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratic ===
The democratic management style involves managers reaching decisions with the input of the employees but being responsible for making the final decision.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are many variations of this style of management including consultative, participative, and collaborative styles. Employee ideas and contributions are encouraged, but not necessary. Communication is both top-down and bottom-up and makes for a cohesive team.

This type of style is versatile with the advantages being more diverse perspectives involved in decision making. As employees are being taken into account before the manager makes decisions, the employees feel valued which increases motivation and productivity.

Disadvantages of the democratic management style are the time it takes to make a decision due to the gathering of ideas and opinions. There is also the potential conflict of different viewpoints playing a role in the decision making and as a result, employees can feel less valued if their input is not taken, leading to decreased morale and productivity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Consultative style ====
With this management style trust and confidence is place in the employees and management actively seeks out their opinions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Participative style ====
Similar to consultative, management trusts the employees, but trusts them completely and not only seeks out their opinions and ideas, but they act on them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They work together to make decisions as a group and the staff is highly involved. As a result the employees feel valued, and show increased motivation and productivity. However a drawback to this style is that some employees do not want to be involved in decision making and can come to resent a manager with this style &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Collaborative style ====
Managers with the collaborative style communicated extensively with employees and make decisions by the majority. The manager believes that involving everyone and making the team take ownership will result in the best decisions made. The main disadvantage of this style is that it is time-consuming, and sometimes the majority decision is not the best decision for the business entity, in which case, the manager should take control of the final choice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Laissez-faire ===
The laissez-faire management style involves little or no interference from management. The staff do not need supervision and are highly skilled which allows management to take the hand’s off approach and leave the problem solving, and decision making to the staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Variations of this style include the delegative style and what is referred to as bossless environments or self-managed teams.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=David|date=1991|title=Managing the bossless team: Lessons in distributed leadership|url=|journal=Organizational Dynamics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=31–47|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of style works best in organizations with flatter decentralized management. Typically, the staff is highly skilled, more so than the management, and is trusted with setting the bar for innovation and setting the objectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The advantages of the Laissez faire are increased innovation and creativity through the autonomy of expert staff.  Some examples of this type of employee are be teachers, creatives, and designers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Disadvantages include the risk of low productivity by unsupervised staff, loss of direction due to the hands-off style of management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Delegative style ====
A delegative management style allows employees to take full responsibility of their work areas. The manager assigns tasks with little or no direction and expects the staff to achieve results of their own accord. The manager retains responsibility for meeting objectives. The major drawbacks of this style are lack of uniformity among team members and uncoordinated efforts toward productivity. Also because little direction and guidance is given the team can lack direction and focus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Bossless or self-managed teams ==
Although self managed teams (SMT) and bossless environments are not management styles, they are a style of management chosen by an organization.  Like the Laissez-Faire management style, employees in these environments are highly skilled and motivated, but take it a step further as they are also highly educated, self directed, and know a great deal more about the work than management. SMT’s can report directly to directors or can have managers who follow the delegative, or participative style,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; but these teams require more [[leadership]] than management to remain productive.

== Management by walking around (MBWA) ==
[[Management by wandering around|Management by walking around]] is not an actual management style, it is more of a practice, but still it is labeled as such. Managers who practice MBWA place importance on rich levels of interpersonal communication. They believe that managers have a tendency to become separated from staff and should focus efforts on understanding employees’ work and being visible and accessible. Managers walk around the premises checking with employees and on the status of ongoing projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1996|title=Management by walking around|url=http://libproxy.umassd.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.umassd.edu/docview/211186639?accountid=14573|journal=Management Matters|publisher=CCH Canadian Limited|volume=|issue=16|pages=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice can be helpful in maintaining contact with employees and offering guidance as well as mitigating problems, however MBWA may also lower productivity levels by distracting employees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2740">The '''Marvin L. Manheim Award For Significant Contributions in the Field of Workflow''' is an industry recognition created by the [[Workflow Management Coalition]] in honor of the late [[Marvin Manheim|Marvin L. Manheim]]. Manheim was a co-founder of the Workflow Management Coalition and was the William A. Patterson Distinguished Professor of Transportation at the [[Kellogg Graduate School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]] from 1983 until his death in August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=9884&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Before joining the [[Kellogg School of Management|Kellogg School]], he held faculty positions at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Prof. Manheim's major area of interest was information technology and its uses strategically, competitively, and organizationally. It included strategy formulation and implementation processes; the management of globally competing organizations; and international transportation and logistics. He was also interested in computer assistance to human problem-solving and decision-making, including decision support systems (DSS) and artificial intelligence.

==Award==
The workflow award is given annually, since 2002, to recognize an individual or a specific group for their "influence, contribution, or distinguished use of workflow systems." The criteria for consideration is based on any significant contribution and not limited to members of the coalition. Both software developers and software end users have finalists and award recipients.

Manheim was a founder of [[Cambridge Systematics]], who in 2001 established a separate awards program called the "Marvin L. Manheim Award" to honor his memory and promote innovation in the field of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camsys.com/com_news_awards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328165631/http://camsys.com/com_news_awards.htm |archivedate=2014-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a separate program and not related to the workflow award.

==Personal life==

Niels Jacobsen Aall had been  born in [[London]], but moved to [[Porsgrunn|Porsgrund]] in 1712. Benedicte Henrikke was the second of three wives. Nicolai Benjamin's younger half-brother Jacob Aall, Sr. became a noted wholesaler, whereas his youngest half-sister Benedicte Henrica Aall  married Severin Løvenskiold (1743–1818). Their son, [[Severin Løvenskiold]], was his nephew.&lt;ref name="storgaden155"&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/fck/ep/storgata-155.html Storgaden 155], in ''Eidanger–Porsgrund'', by [[Finn Christian Knudsen|Finn C.

 |title=   Aall|publisher =  Store norske leksikon |author=  Jon Gunnar Arntzen|accessdate= August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt; They had four sons; [[Niels Aall]], [[Jacob Aall]], [[Jørgen Aall]] and Nicolai Benjamin, Jr., and three daughters Benedicte Henricka, Inger and Constance. Benedicte Henricka married [[Ulrich Fredrich von Cappelen]] of the influential Cappelen family, and Inger married [[Hans Eleonardus Møller, Sr.|Hans Eleonardus Møller, Sr]].&lt;ref name="aall"/&gt; Through these marriages Nicolai Benjamin Aall was the grandfather of later parliament member [[Hans Eleonardus Møller]], political figures [[Ulrik Frederik Cappelen]] and [[Nicolai Benjamin Cappelen]] and publishing house founder [[Jørgen Wright Cappelen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Nicolai_Benjamin_Aall |title=   Nicolai Benjamin Aall|publisher =  Store norske leksikon |author= Magne Njåstad
|accessdate= August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Aall graduated from the [[University of Copenhagen]] and took examination as a [[theologian]] in 1759, but later turned to work in his father's business. He acquired burghership as a merchant in 1772.&lt;ref name="tønnessen"/&gt; He bought the sawmill at  [[Ulefoss]] from the Anker family in 1782, having been a co-owner (one eighth part) since 1775. He also bought various real estate. In 1777 he took over two sawmills in [[Skien]] and forested property near the border of  [[Telemark]].

In 1796 he and [[Diderik von Cappelen]], brother of his son-in-law Ulrich Fredrich von Cappelen, established a rope factory (''Reperbane'') at [[Porsgrunn|Vestre Porsgrunn]] to meet the needs of the  shipbuilding industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://snl.no/Diderik_von_Cappelen |title=   Diderik von Cappelen|publisher =  Store norske leksikon |author=  Knut Dørum|accessdate= August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year he was registered as the owner of eleven ships,&lt;ref name="aall"/&gt; having coped through the [[American Revolutionary War]] which had a negative impact on business. He was described as hard-working and self-sacrificing, and handled his business with "superior proficiency", according to one historian.&lt;ref name="tønnessen"/&gt;

'''Nouthetic counseling''' (Greek: ''noutheteo'', to admonish) is a form of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[pastoral counseling]] based solely upon the Bible and focused on Christ.  It repudiates mainstream [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] as [[humanistic]], fundamentally opposed to [[Christianity]], and radically [[secular]].   Its viewpoint was originally articulated by [[Jay E. Adams]], in ''Competent to Counsel'' (1970) and further books, and has led to the formation of a number of organizations and seminary courses promoting it.&lt;ref name = Collins /&gt; The viewpoint is opposed to those seeking to synthesize Christianity with secular psychological thought, but has failed to win them over to a purely Biblical approach.  Since 1993, the movement has renamed itself '''Biblical counseling''' to emphasize its central emphasis on the Bible.&lt;ref name = Collins&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Gary R | last1 = Collins | first2= Eric L | last2= Johnson| first3 = Stanton L | last3 = Jones | title = Psychology &amp; Christianity| publisher = InterVarsity Press | location = Downers Grove, IL, USA | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8308-2263-1 | pages = 36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology and Counseling'' states that "The aim of Nouthetic Counseling is to effect change in the counselee by encouraging greater conformity to the principles of Scripture."{{Sfn | Benner | Hill | 1999 | p = 249}}

==Debate within the Christian community==
Nouthetic counseling has been criticized as narrowly conceived, with a confrontational focus upon [[sin]] and behavior, which fails to deal adequately with emotion, grief, and suffering, and which lacks understanding of complex human motivations.{{Sfn | Clinton | Ohlschlager | 2002 | p = 46}}

Clinton and Ohlschlager describe what they call the historic debate between nouthetic counselors and integrationists. Nouthetic counselors, they say, argue that truth can only be known as revealed in [[the Scriptures]]. According to an article published by the Spring Christian Counseling Center, secular counseling and psychology are primarily [[pseudoscience]]s which only can be [[Transformation (disambiguation)|transformed]]{{by whom?|date=May 2015}} into "true" sciences within the framework of faith-based Christian dialog.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Integrationists argue that God reveals his truth universally. This includes [[general revelation]], or what they define as truth known by scientific investigation, as well as truth known by [[special revelation]] in Christ. Clinton and Ohlschlager express their belief that "shrill criticism and rancorous debate" are ill-suited to the mission of uplifting Christ as the model for counseling.{{Sfn | Clinton | Ohlschlager | 2002 | pp = 52, 53}}

Christian counselor and psychologist, and leading proponent of the rival "community model",{{Sfn | Clinton | Ohlschlager | 2002 | p = 46}} [[Larry Crabb]], states that Adams compares behavior patterns "with his understanding of biblical behavior patterns, and commands change".  Crabb agrees with Adams that obedience to God's commands is "absolutely necessary for effective Christian living", but takes issue with what he sees as Adams' apparent belief that this is the "single key ingredient for spiritual growth". Crabb believes that this neglects what he refers to as the "'insides' of the behaving person", particularly "the person's assumption system and his evaluation of situations based on his assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Crabb | first = L | title = Effective Biblical Counseling: A Model for Helping Caring Christians Become Capable Counselors | publisher = Zondervan | year = 1977 | location = Grand Rapids, MI | pages = 150–51 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HOin3PV2c3gC&amp;pg=PA151 | isbn = 0-310-22570-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians also debate the causes of [[mental illness]] and the extent of [[Demonic possession | demonic influence]] on counselees. Three different views as to the origin of mental illness emphasize respectively:

# disease occurring in the natural realm,
# habitual sin, and/or
# influence by "demonic forces"&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{Cite book | last = Benner | first = David G | title = Encyclopedia of Psychology | publisher = Baker |date= July 1985 | isbn = 978-0-8010-0865-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, "[i]n the counseling field, many nouthetic counselors have said that Satan and his demons were bound, bruised, curtailed and restrained at the time of Christ's death and resurrection.  They assert that human beings today primarily struggle with their own sin natures rather than directly with Satan and his emissaries."&lt;ref name = Baker /&gt;

==Relationship to contemporary psychology==
[[Eric Johnson (theologian)|Eric Johnson]] points out that nouthetic counseling has tended to be "very skeptical of contemporary psychology" and "the efforts of [[Christian counseling|integrationist Christians]] who seek to combine their faith with that psychology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = 2009-06-01 | authorlink = Eric Johnson (theologian) | first = Eric | last = Johnson | title= A Momentous Evening Forum with ABC| url= http://christianpsych.org/wp_scp/2009/06/01/a-momentus-evening-forum-with-abc/ | publisher= Society for Christian Psychology| accessdate= 2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 800, The Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology and Counseling describes Nouthetic Counselors as "zealous to return God and the Bible to positions of authority in the hearts and lives of people", but criticises them as “failing to see the validity in alternative approaches.”{{Sfn | Benner | Hill | 1999 | p = 800}}  Donn Arms, a Nouthetic Counselor and associate of [[Jay E. Adams]] wrote a response to the Encyclopedia's criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nouthetic.org/blog/?p=3669 | title = Nouthetic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouthetic counseling has been criticized for the way its "rational and certain approach can come across as impersonal, emotionally distant, and insensitive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King|first=SD|title=Dictionary of pastoral care and counseling|year=2005|publisher=[[Abingdon Press]]|page=450 | editor-last =Hunter|editor-first=Rodney J | chapter =Fundamentalist Pastoral Care}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouthetic counseling is viewed as highly controversial by secular psychologists who believe that it is unethical to counsel that the Bible has the answers for all people of all backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url = http://www.nanc.org/Resources/NANC-Library/General-Counseling/General-Cousenling-Documents/07biblical_counceling--rowe.aspx | publisher = NANC | last = Rowe | title = Biblical counseling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some counselors believe that nouthetic counseling can do considerable harm to patients. In addition to techniques which critics consider ineffective, patients who are not helped by nouthetic counseling often consider themselves to be "unfaithful" or religious failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Winfrey | first = David | title = Biblical Therapy | journal = [[The Christian Century]] | volume = 124 | issue = 2 | pages = 25–26 | date = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plagiarism''' is the "wrongful appropriation" and "stealing and publication" of another [[author]]'s "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions" and the representation of them as one's own [[original work]].&lt;ref name="RandomHouse95"&gt;From the 1995 ''[[Random House Dictionary of the English Language|Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own original work&lt;/blockquote&gt; qtd. in {{cite book | title = Library plagiarism policies | first = Vera | last= Stepchyshyn | first2 = Robert S. |last2= Nelson | publisher = Assoc. of College &amp; Resrch Libraries | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8389-8416-9 | page = 65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHamIn5dPR8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OEDdef"&gt;From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The action or practice of taking someone else's work, idea, etc., and passing it off as one's own; literary theft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is considered [[academic dishonesty]] and a breach of [[journalistic ethics]]. It is subject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, and even [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] from school or work. Recently, cases of "extreme plagiarism" have been identified in academia.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2015"&gt;O'Connor, Z (2015) ''Extreme plagiarism: The rise of the e-Idiot?'', International Journal of Learning in Higher Education, 20 (1), pp1-11. {{ISSN|2327-7955}} [https://www.academia.edu/9975666/Extreme_plagiarism_The_rise_of_the_e-Idiot_2015_]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] emerged in Europe in the 18th century, particularly with the [[Romantic movement]].

Plagiarism is not in itself a [[crime]], but can constitute [[copyright infringement]]. In academia and industry, it is a serious [[Ethics|ethical]] offense.&lt;ref name="Lynch02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN315562" /&gt; Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts. Plagiarism is not defined or punished by law, but rather by institutions (including professional associations, educational institutions, and commercial entities, such as publishing companies).

== Etymology ==
In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word ''plagiarius'' (literally "kidnapper") to denote stealing someone else's work was pioneered by the Roman poet [[Martial]], who complained that another poet had "kidnapped his verses". ''Plagiary'', a derivative of ''plagiarus'', was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist [[Ben Jonson]] during the [[Jacobean Era]] to describe someone guilty of literary theft.&lt;ref name="Lynch02"&gt;Lynch (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valpy05"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Valpy | first=Francis Edward Jackson | date=2005 | title=Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language | page=345 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsWzg7rTEa4C&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=etymology+plaga+net&amp;ei=JVxXSq2_GIiEywS8mPSyBw | access-date= | quote=entry for ''plagium'', quotation: "the crime of kidnapping."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derived form ''plagiarism'' was introduced into English around 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plagiarism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] ''plagiārius'', "kidnapper", and ''plagium'', "kidnapping", have the root ''plaga'' ("snare", "net"), based on the [[Proto-Indo-European root|Indo-European root]] ''*-plak'', "to weave" (seen for instance in [[Greek language|Greek]] ''plekein'', Bulgarian "плета" ''pleta'', and Latin ''plectere'', all meaning "to weave").

== Legal aspects ==
Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense, although the use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may meet some legal definitions of [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Plagiarism" specifically is not mentioned in any current statute, either [[Criminal law|criminal]] or [[Civil law (common law)|civil]].&lt;ref name="Lands99"&gt;Lands, Robert (1999) [http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html ''Plagiarism is no Crime''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101213001/http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html |date=2011-01-01 }} published by The Association of Illustrators (AOI), December 1999. Quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;Plagiarism may be a taboo in academia, but in art is almost essential.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN315562" /&gt; Some cases may be treated as [[unfair competition]] or a violation of the doctrine of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]].&lt;ref name="SSRN315562"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Plagiarism, Norms, and the Limits of Theft Law: Some Observations on the Use of Criminal Sanctions in Enforcing Intellectual Property Rights | first = Stuart P. | last = Green | ssrn = 315562 | journal = Hastings Law Journal | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased availability of copyrighted material due to the development of information technology has furthered the debate as to whether copyright offences are criminal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In short, people are asked to use the guideline, "if you did not write it yourself, you must give credit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/education/02cheat.html | title = Plagiarism Lines Blur for Students in Digital Age | first = Trip | last = Gabriel | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is not the same as [[copyright infringement]]. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).

Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases,  acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for [[breach of contract|breach]] of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a [[Tort|civil wrong]].

== In academia and journalism ==
Within [[academia]], plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered [[academic dishonesty]] or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]]. Some institutions use [[Plagiarism detection|plagiarism detection software]] to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, and clearly articulated honor codes{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Indeed, there is a virtually uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Nevertheless, each year students are brought before their institutions’ disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipson|first=Abigail|year=2003|title=The Responsible Plagiarist|url=|journal=About Campus|volume=8- issue 3|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, known as [[rogeting]], has rapidly evolved as students and unethical academics seek to stay ahead of detection software.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Jack|title=Sinister buttocks? Roget would blush at the crafty cheek  Middlesex lecturer gets to the bottom of meaningless phrases found while marking essays|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/sinister-buttocks-roget-would-blush-at-the-crafty-cheek/2015027.article|accessdate=15 July 2015|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An extreme form of plagiarism, known as [[contract cheating]] involves students paying someone else, such as an [[essay mill]], to do their work for them.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com" /&gt;

In [[journalism]], plagiarism is considered a breach of [[journalistic ethics]], and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include [[quotation]]s or give the appropriate [[citation]]. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the [[Internet]], where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier.&lt;ref&gt;Susan D. Blum, ''My Word!: Plagiarism and College Culture'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Predicated upon an expected level of learning/comprehension having been achieved, all associated academic accreditation becomes seriously undermined if plagiarism is allowed to become the norm within academic submissions.&lt;ref&gt;Cully, P. Plagiarism avoidance in academic submissions. Dublin Institute of Technology, 2013. Full PDF available for download at: http://arrow.dit.ie/bescharcoth/4/&lt;/ref&gt;

For professors and researchers, plagiarism is punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination, along with the loss of credibility and perceived integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kock | first1 = N | authorlink = Ned Kock | doi = 10.1145/306549.306594 | title = A case of academic plagiarism | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 96–104 |date=July 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ned Kock|Kock, N.]], Davison, R.

''Interchange: A Quarterly Review of Education, 48''(3), 271-281. doi:10.1007/s10780-017-9300-7&lt;/ref&gt;; however, this section provides several definitions to exemplify the most common characteristics of academic plagiarism.

According to Bela Gipp&lt;ref name="Gipp14"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gipp | first = Bela |
url=https://www.springer.com/springer+vieweg/it+%26+informatik/k%C3%BCnstliche+intelligenz/book/978-3-658-06393-1 |title=Citation-based Plagiarism Detection: Detecting Disguised and Cross-language Plagiarism using Citation Pattern Analysis | publisher = Springer Vieweg | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-3-658-06393-1}} p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  academic plagiarism encompasses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of ideas, concepts, words, or structures &lt;br /&gt; without appropriately acknowledging the source &lt;br /&gt; to benefit in a setting where originality is expected."&lt;ref name="Gipp14" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition by B. Gipp is an abridged version of Teddi Fishman's definition of plagiarism, which proposed five elements characteristic of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Fishman09"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Teddi | url = http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/09-4apcei/4apcei-Fishman.pdf |format=PDF|title=We know it when we see it is not good enough:  toward a standard definition of plagiarism that transcends theft, fraud, and copyright | publisher = Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Educational Integrity |date=Sep 28–30, 2009}} p.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to T. Fishman, plagiarism occurs when someone:
#  Uses words, ideas, or work products
#  Attributable to another identifiable person or source
#  Without attributing the work to the source from which it was obtained
#  In a situation in which there is a legitimate expectation of original authorship
#  In order to obtain some benefit, credit, or gain which need not be monetary&lt;ref name="Fishman09" /&gt;

Furthermore, plagiarism is defined differently among institutions of higher learning and universities:

* [[Stanford University|Stanford]] sees plagiarism as the "use, without giving reasonable and appropriate credit to or acknowledging the author or source, of another person's original work, whether such work is made up of code, formulas, ideas, language, research, strategies, writing or other form."&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/judicialaffairs/integrity/plagiarism "What is Plagiarism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026061453/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/judicialaffairs/integrity/plagiarism |date=2012-10-26 }}. Stanford University. 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yale University|Yale]] views plagiarism as the "... use of another's work, words, or ideas without attribution," which includes "... using a source's language without quoting, using information from a source without attribution, and paraphrasing a source in a form that stays too close to the original."
* [[Princeton University|Princeton]] perceives plagiarism as the "deliberate" use of "someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpacouncil.org/positions/WPAplagiarism.pdf "Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices"]. Princeton University. 2012-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oxford College of Emory University]] characterizes plagiarism as the use of "a writer's ideas or phraseology without giving due credit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxford.emory.edu/audiences/current_students/Academic/academic-success/student-honor-code/ "Student Honor Code"]. Emory: Oxford College. 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brown University|Brown]] defines plagiarism as "... appropriating another person's ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/plagiarism.php "What is plagiarism?"]. Brown University Library. 2012-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States Naval Academy|The U.S. Naval Academy]] defines plagiarism as "the use of the words, information, insights, or ideas of another without crediting that person through proper citation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://libguides.usna.edu/c.php?g=410493&amp;p=2795948 USNA Statements on Plagiarism - Avoiding Plagiarism] US Naval Academy, Retrieved April 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Common forms of student plagiarism ====

According to a 2015 survey of teachers and professors by [[Turnitin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Plagiarism Spectrum |url=http://go.turnitin.com/paper/plagiarism-spectrum |publisher=Turnitin |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 10 main forms of plagiarism that students commit:
&lt;!--THERE ARE PUBLISHED WORKS ON THIS, WHY ARE WE CITING THIS LOCAL UNIVERSITY WEB INFORMATION? SEE LIPSON'S WORK AT https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Honest-Work-College-Plagiarism/dp/0226484777, AND OTHER SUCH SOURCES.--&gt;
# Submitting someone's work as their own.
# Taking passages from their own previous work without adding citations.
# Re-writing someone's work without properly citing sources.
# Using quotations, but not citing the source.
# Interweaving various sources together in the work without citing.
# Citing some, but not all passages that should be cited.
# Melding together cited and uncited sections of the piece.
# Providing proper citations, but fails to change the structure and wording of the borrowed ideas enough.
# Inaccurately citing the source.
# Relying too heavily on other people's work. Fails to bring original thought into the text.

==== Sanctions for student plagiarism ====
In the academic world, plagiarism by students is usually considered a very serious offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|journal = Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|first=Philip|last=Newton|date=2 April 2016|volume=41|issue=3|pages=482–497|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.

For cases of repeated plagiarism, or for cases in which a student commits severe plagiarism (e.g., purchasing an assignment), suspension or [[Expulsion (education)|expulsion]] may occur. There has been historic concern about inconsistencies in penalties administered for university student plagiarism, and a plagiarism tariff was devised in 2008 for UK higher education institutions in an attempt to encourage some standardization of approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.plagiarismadvice.org/BTariff.pdf |title=Benchmark Plagiarism Tariff |first1=Peter |last1=Tennant |first2=Gill |last2=Rowell |year=2009–2010 |website=plagiarism advice.org |publisher=iParadigms Europe |format=PDF |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be detected. Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include carefully reading students work and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, citation errors and providing plagiarism prevention education to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Colella-Sandercock, J. A., &amp; Alahmadi, H. W. (2015). Plagiarism education: Strategies for instructors. ''International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research, 13''(1), 76-84. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter/article/view/395/190&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that a significant share of (university) teachers do not use detection methods such as using text-matching software.&lt;ref name="Sattler2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/03075079.2015.1085007|title = The use frequency of 10 different methods for preventing and detecting academic dishonesty and the factors influencing their use| journal=Studies in Higher Education| volume=42| issue=6| pages=1126–1144|year = 2017|last1 = Sattler|first1 = Sebastian| last2=Wiegel| first2=Constantin| last3=Veen| first3=Floris van}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism, while the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected.&lt;ref name="Sattler2015" /&gt; There are checklists of tactics to prevent student plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Practical Prevention of Plagiarism for University Faculty &amp; Management – 14 Tactics|last=Dawes|first=John|date=20 July 2018|ssrn = 3209034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criminal and negative behaviour by diploma mills ====
{{one source|section|date=May 2017}}
There are allegations that some diploma mills{{discuss|diploma mills (sic)}} take students' money for essays, then produce a low standard essay or close their websites without providing the purchased essay.  Students then have little time to provide an essay before a deadline.  Also diploma mills have allegedly [[blackmail]]ed students demanding more money than was originally agreed and threatening to reveal plagiarism to the university unless more money is paid.  Sorana Vieru of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|NUS]] said, “We would urge those who are struggling to seek support through their unions and universities rather than looking to a quick fix, and be aware that using these websites could cost not only money but jeopardise their qualifications.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/19/students-warned-against-using-essay-mill-sites-to-write-dissertations Students warned against using 'essay mill' sites to write dissertations] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are calls for diploma mills to be made illegal in the United Kingdom, in New Zealand and some juristictions in the United States they are already illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45640236 University bosses call for ban on essay-writing companies] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plagiarism education ====
Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264452242_Let_Them_Plagiarise_Developing_Academic_Writing_in_a_Safe_Environment|title=Let Them Plagiarise: Developing Academic Writing in a Safe Environment|first1=Chris|last1=Ireland|first2=University of|last2=Huddersfield|first3=|last3=UK|first4=John|last4=English|first5=University of|last5=Huddersfield|first6=|last6=UK|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|volume=1|issue=1|pages=165–172|doi=10.18552/joaw.v1i1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leung, C.

==== Factors influencing student´s decision to plagiarize ====
Several studies investigated factors that influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = | issue = | pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Sattler, Peter Graeff, Sebastian Willen: ''Explaining the Decision to Plagiarize: An Empirical Test of the Interplay Between Rationality, Norms, and Opportunity.'' In: ''Deviant Behavior.'' 34, 2013, S.&amp;nbsp;444–463, [[doi:10.1080/01639625.2012.735909]].&lt;/ref&gt; When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.

=== Journalism ===
Since journalism relies on the public trust, a reporter's failure to honestly acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |title=Journalism  |website=Famous Plagiarists.com / War On Plagiarism.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226090147/http://famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |archivedate=26 February 2007|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-plagiarism ===
{{See also|Duplicate publication}}
The reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work is sometimes described as "self-plagiarism"; the term "recycling fraud" has also been used to describe this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dellavalle | first = Robert P. | last2 = Banks | first2 = Marcus A. | last3 = Ellis | first3 = Jeffrey I. |date=September 2007 | title = Frequently asked questions regarding self-plagiarism: How to avoid recycling fraud | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | page = 527 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.05.018 | pmid = 17707155 | pmc = 2679117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles of this nature are often referred to as duplicate or [[multiple publication]]. In addition there can be a copyright issue if copyright of the prior work has been transferred to another entity. Self-plagiarism is considered a serious ethical issue in settings where someone asserts that a publication consists of new material, such as in publishing or factual documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Attwood. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=402598 "Allow me to rephrase, and boost my tally of articles"]. Times Higher Education. 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not apply to public-interest texts, such as social, professional, and cultural opinions usually published in newspapers and magazines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In academic fields, self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses portions of their own published and copyrighted work in subsequent publications, but without attributing the previous publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hexham |first=Irving |year=2005 |title=The Plague of Plagiarism: Academic Plagiarism Defined |website=UCalgary.ca |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~hexham/content/articles/plague-of-plagiarism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Roig, M.

==== A contested definition ====
Miguel Roig has written at length about the topic of self-plagiarism&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M. (2005). Re-using text from one’s own previously published papers: An exploratory study of potential self-plagiarism. ''Psychological Reports, 2005''(97), 43-49. doi:10.2466/pr0.97.1.43-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M. (2011). ''Avoiding plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and other questionable writing practices: A guide to ethical writing''. U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services: Office of Research Integrity Retrieved from https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA728CA728&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M. (2015). On reusing our previously disseminated work. ''American Association for the Advancement of Science''. Retrieved from https://www.aaas.org/news/reusing-our-previously-disseminated-work&lt;/ref&gt; and his definition of self-plagiarism as using previously disseminated work is widely accepted among scholars of the topic. However, the "self-plagiarism" has been challenged as being self-contradictory, an [[oxymoron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Broome | first1 = M | title = Self-plagiarism: Oxymoron, fair use, or scientific misconduct? | doi = 10.1016/j.outlook.2004.10.001 | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 273–4 |date=November 2004 | pmid = 15614263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on other grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andreescu | first1 = Liviu | title = Self-Plagiarism in Academic Publishing: The Anatomy of a Misnomer | doi = 10.1007/s11948-012-9416-1 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics |date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Stephanie J. Bird&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bird | first1 = SJ | title = Self-plagiarism and dual and redundant publications: what is the problem? Commentary on 'Seven ways to plagiarize: handling real allegations of research misconduct' | doi = 10.1007/s11948-002-0007-4 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–4 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12501723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that self-plagiarism is a misnomer, since by definition plagiarism concerns the use of others' material. Bird identifies the ethical issues of "self-plagiarism" as those of "dual or redundant publication." She also notes that in an educational context, "self-plagiarism" refers to the case of a student who resubmits "the same essay for credit in two different courses." As David B. Resnik clarifies, "Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft."&lt;ref&gt;See Resnik, David B. (1998). ''The Ethics of Science: an introduction'', London: Routledge. p.177, notes to chapter six, note 3. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMn2KxPQyk8C&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22self-plagiarism%22&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA177 Online via Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Patrick M. Scanlon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.5240451.0002.007 | author = Scanlon, PM | year = 2007 | title = Song from myself: an anatomy of self-plagiarism | journal = Plagiary | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | accessdate=2010-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Self-plagiarism" is a term with some specialized currency. Most prominently, it is used in discussions of research and publishing integrity in biomedicine, where heavy publish-or-perish demands have led to a rash of duplicate and "salami-slicing" publication, the reporting of a single study's results in "[[least publishable unit]]s" within multiple articles (Blancett, Flanagin, &amp; Young, 1995; Jefferson, 1998; Kassirer &amp; Angell, 1995; Lowe, 2003; McCarthy, 1993; Schein &amp; Paladugu, 2001; Wheeler, 1989). Roig (2002) offers a useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called salami-slicing; text recycling; and copyright infringement.

==== Codes of ethics ====
Some academic journals have codes of ethics that specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the ''Journal of International Business Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lorraine Eden |url=http://palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |title=JIBS Code of Ethics |publisher=Journal of International Business Studies |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723212122/http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |archivedate=2010-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some professional organizations like the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 2010 | title = ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | url=http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism such as the American Political Science Association (APSA). The organization published a code of ethics that describes plagiarism as "...deliberate appropriation of the works of others represented as one's own." It does not make any reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or dissertation is published "in whole or in part", the author is "not ordinarily under an ethical obligation to acknowledge its origins."&lt;ref&gt;American Political Science Association (2008). [http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/ethicsguideweb.pdf "A Guide to Professional Ethics in Political Science"]. Second Edition. Section 21.1. {{ISBN|1-878147-05-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) also published a code of ethics that says its members are committed to: "Ensure that others receive credit for their work and contributions," but it makes no reference to self-plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Public Administration. [http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm "ASPA's Code of Ethics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124015330/http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm |date=2011-01-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors that justify reuse ====
[[Pamela Samuelson]], in 1994, identified several factors she says excuse reuse of one's previously published work, that make it not self-plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt; She relates each of these factors specifically to the ethical issue of self-plagiarism, as distinct from the legal issue of fair use of copyright, which she deals with separately. Among other factors that may excuse reuse of previously published material Samuelson lists the following:

# The previous work must be restated to lay the groundwork for a new contribution in the second work.
# Portions of the previous work must be repeated to deal with new evidence or arguments.
# The audience for each work is so different that publishing the same work in different places is necessary to get the message out.
# The author thinks they said it so well the first time that it makes no sense to say it differently a second time.

Samuelson states she has relied on the "different audience" rationale when attempting to bridge interdisciplinary communities. She refers to writing for different legal and technical communities, saying: "there are often paragraphs or sequences of paragraphs that can be bodily lifted from one article to the other. And, in truth, I lift them." She refers to her own practice of converting "a technical article into a law review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one substantive section" for a different audience.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt;

Samuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt; She also states "Although it seems not to have been raised in any of the self-plagiarism cases, copyrights law's fair use defense would likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their previous works."&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt;

=== Organizational publications ===
Plagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for originality to particular people. For example, the [[American Historical Association]]'s "Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct" (2005) regarding textbooks and reference books states that, since textbooks and encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars' work, they are not bound by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and may be allowed a greater "extent of dependence" on other works.&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.historians.org/PUBS/Free/ProfessionalStandards.cfm | title = Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct | date = 2005-01-06 | accessdate=2009-04-16 | publisher = American Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even such a book does not make use of words, phrases, or paragraphs from another text or follow too closely the other text's arrangement and organization, and the authors of such texts are also expected to "acknowledge the sources of recent or distinctive findings and interpretations, those not yet a part of the common understanding of the profession."&lt;ref name=AHA /&gt;

Through all of the [[history of literature]] and [[History of art|of the arts]] in general, works of art are for a large part repetitions of the [[Poetic tradition|tradition]]; to the entire history of [[artistic creativity]] belong plagiarism, literary theft, [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, [[thematic variation]], ironic retake, [[parody]], imitation, stylistic theft, [[pastiche]]s, [[collage]]s, and deliberate [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]].&lt;ref name="Derrida01p57"&gt; Derrida [1959] quotation: (p.40):{{full|date=April 2017}} "The boundaries between permissible and impermissible, imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery remain nebulous."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco90"&gt;Eco (1990) p. 95 quotation:
{{quotation|Each of the types of repetition that we have examined is not limited to the mass media but belongs by right to the entire history of artistic creativity; plagiarism, quotation, parody, the ironic retake are typical of the entire artistic-literary tradition. &lt;br /&gt; Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness," with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lands99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alfrey"&gt;Alfrey (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genette [1982] note 3 to ch. 7, p. 433. quotation: {{quotation|"transposition"... all the other possible terms (rewriting, rehandling, remake, revision, refection, recasting, etc.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98pp437-459" /&gt; There is no rigorous and precise distinction between practices like imitation, stylistic plagiarism, [[Copying|copy]], [[replica]] and [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="Derrida01p57" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haywood87p109Arnau"&gt;Haywood (1987) p.109, quoting Arnau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco87p202Arnau"&gt;Eco (1987) p.202, quoting Arnau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnau59p40"&gt;Arnau [1959] quotation: (p. 40) "The boundaries between permissible and impermissible, imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery remain nebulous."&lt;/ref&gt; These appropriation procedures are the main axis of a literate culture, in which the tradition of the canonic past is being constantly rewritten.&lt;ref name="Steiner98pp437-459"&gt;Steiner (1998) pp. 437, 459 quotation:
{{quotation|(p. 437) There is between 'translation proper' and 'transmutation' a vast terrain of 'partial transformation'. The verbal signs in the original message or statement are modified by one of a multitude of means or by a combination of means. These include [[Paraphrasing of copyrighted material|paraphrase]], graphic illustration, pastiche, imitation, thematic variation, parody, citation in a supporting or undermining context, false attribution (accidental or deliberate), plagiarism, collage, and many others. This zone of partial transformation, of derivation, of alternate restatement determines much of our sensibility and literacy. It is, quite simply, the matrix of culture.

(p. 459) We could, in some measure, at least, come closer to a verifiable gradation of the sequence of techniques and aims, which leads from literal translation through paraphrases, mimesis, and pastiche to thematic variation. I have suggested that this sequence is the main axis of a literate culture, that a culture advances, spiralwise, via translations of its own canonic past.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Graham quotes [[T.S. Eliot]]—"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal. Bad poets deface what they take."—she notes that despite the "taboo" of plagiarism, the ill-will and embarrassment it causes in the modern context, readers seem to often forgive the past excesses of historic literary offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham |first=Ruth |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/247130 |title=Word Theft |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Praisings of artistic plagiarism ===
A passage of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s 1767 ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' condemns plagiarism by resorting to plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Ford [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n23/mark-ford/love-and-theft Love and Theft] [[London Review of Books]] Vol. 26 No. 23 · 2 December 2004 pages 34–35 | 4103 words&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Goldsmith]] commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sterne's Writings, in which it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating plagiarist who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Goldsmith]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEMVAAAAYAAJ The vicar of Wakefield: a tale, Volume 5] p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In other contexts ==

=== On the Internet ===
Free online tools are becoming available to help identify plagiarism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-5663303-7.html "Apple accused of copyright wrongs"] CNET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/08/30/copyscape-searches-for-scraped-content|title=Copyscape Searches For Scraped Content|publisher=WebProNews|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221143230/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/08/30/copyscape-searches-for-scraped-content|archivedate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are a range of approaches that attempt to limit online copying, such as [[Digital rights management|disabling]] [[Right-click#Common mouse operations|right clicking]] and placing warning banners regarding copyrights on web pages. Instances of plagiarism that involve copyright violation may be addressed by the rightful content owners sending a [[DMCA]] removal notice to the offending site-owner, or to the [[ISP]] that is hosting the offending site. The term "content scraping" has arisen to describe the copying and pasting of information from websites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-07-31-net-plagiarism_x.htm | title = Authorship gets lost on Web | work = [[USA Today]] | date = August 1, 2006 | first = Del | last = Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2006/05/08/online_plagiarism_strikes_blog_world/ | title = Online plagiarism strikes blog world | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | first = Maura | last = Welch | date = May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poetaster''' {{IPAc-en|p|oʊ|ɪ|t|æ|s|t|ɚ}}, like '''rhymester''' or '''versifier''', is a derogatory term applied to bad or inferior poets. Specifically, ''poetaster'' has implications of unwarranted pretensions to artistic value. The word was coined in [[Latin]] by [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, ''Letters'' 25 March 1521 (see ''Oxford English Dictionary'' s.v. "Poetaster").&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used in [[English language|English]] by [[Ben Jonson]] in his 1600 play ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, ''[http://hollowaypages.com/jonson1692cynthia.htm Cynthia's Revels]'' act 2 scene 4.&lt;/ref&gt; immediately afterwards Jonson chose it as the title of his 1601 play ''[[Poetaster (play)|Poetaster]].'' In that play the "poetaster" character is a satire on [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], one of Jonson's rivals in the Poetomachia or [[War of the Theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ben Jonson'' ed. C. H. Herford, P. and E. Simpson, vol. 9 (Oxford, 1950) p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
While ''poetaster'' has always been a negative appraisal of a poet's skills, ''rhymester'' (or ''rhymer'') and ''versifier'' have held ambiguous meanings depending on the commentator's opinion of a writer's [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].  ''Versifier'' is often used to refer to someone who produces work in verse with the implication that while technically able to make lines rhyme they have no real talent for poetry.  '''Rhymer''' on the other hand is usually impolite despite attempts to salvage the reputation of rhymers such as the [[Rhymers' Club]] and Rhymer being a common last name.

The faults of a poetaster frequently include errors or lapses in their work's meter, badly rhyming words which jar rather than flow, oversentimentality, too much use of the [[pathetic fallacy]] and unintentionally [[Bathos|bathetic]] choice of subject matter.{{Original research?|date=February 2009}}  Although a mundane subject in the hands of some great poets can be raised to the level of art, such as ''[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]'' by [[John Keats]] or ''[[s: Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes|Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes]]'' by [[Thomas Gray]], others merely produce bizarre poems on bizarre subjects,  an example being [[James McIntyre (poet)|James McIntyre]], who wrote mainly of cheese.

Other poets often regarded as poetasters are [[William Topaz McGonagall]], [[Julia A. Moore]], [[Edgar Guest]], [[Dmitry Khvostov]], and [[Alfred Austin]].  Austin, despite having been a British [[poet laureate]], is nevertheless regarded as greatly inferior to his predecessor, [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]; he was frequently mocked during his career and is little read today. The American poet [[Joyce Kilmer]] (1886–1918), known for his 1913 poem [[Trees (poem)|"Trees"]], is often criticized for his overly sentimental and traditional verse written at the dawn of [[Modernist poetry]], although some of his poems are frequently anthologized and retain enduring popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Holliday, Robert Cortes. "Memoir", in Joyce Kilmer, edited by Holliday (New York: Doran, 1918), I: 17–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aiken, Conrad Potter. "Confectionery and Caviar: Edward Bliss Reed, John Cowper Powys, Joyce Kilmer, Theodosia Garrison, William Carlos Williams" in ''Scepticisms''. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1919), 178–86.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Trees" has been parodied innumerable times, including notably parody by [[Ogden Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Ogden. "Song of the Open Road" first published in ''Argosy''. Vol. 12 No. 8. (July 1951), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
Musician [[Joanna Newsom]] on the album [[The Milk-Eyed Mender|''The Milk-eyed Mender'']] uses the term to refer to a struggling narrator wracked with ambition to create beautiful poetry in a verse from "Inflammatory Writ":

:And as for my inflammatory writ?
:Well, I wrote it and I was not inflamed one bit.
:Advice from the master derailed that disaster;
:he said "Hand that pen over to me, poetaster"

Rapper [[Big Daddy Kane]] uses an adjectival form as an insult in his song "Uncut, Pure":

:Your poetasterous style it plain bore me
:Pardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story

The band [[Miracle Fortress]] has a song entitled "Poetaster".

==Variants==
In the sense that a poetaster is a pretended poet, John Marston coined the term ''parasitaster,'' for one who pretends to be a parasite or sycophant, in his play ''[[Parasitaster, or The Fawn]]'' (1604). Later in the 17th century (the earliest cited use is from 1684) appeared the term ''criticaster'' for an inferior and pretentious critic.

'''Rainer Rene Graf Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden''' (born '''Rene Freiherr von Godin''',&lt;ref name="Roots" /&gt;1948) is a former [[Germany|German]] [[lawyer]] best known for founding the ''Bund deutscher Legionäre'' ({{lang-en|Federation of German mercenaries}}), the ''Christliche Vereinigung zur Familienförderung'' (''English:Christian association for family development''), an agency dealing with the [[adoption]] of [[unborn babies]] and a business in dealing with [[organ donation]]s.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13514059.html SÖLDNER - Killen lernen] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 7 October 1985, accessed: 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeit"&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/1988/40/Trubel-im-Organbuero Trubel im Organbüro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008120330/http://www.zeit.de/1988/40/Trubel-im-Organbuero |date=2012-10-08 }} {{de icon}} ''[[Die Zeit]]'', published: 30 September 1988, accessed: 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He also operated a number of other business entities, like the ''Der Wettbewerbsbeobachter'' (''English:The competition monitor'') and the ''Zentralkomitee für die Allgemeinbefolgung obergerichtlicher Rechtssprechung in Wettbewerbssachen'', both targeting small businesses who made small clerical errors in advertisement by "fining" them or taking them to court for violating [[Competition law]].&lt;ref name="Herkunft" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14023531.html AFFÄREN - Neue Herkunft] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 28 February 1983, accessed: 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing his training as [[Catholic Church|catholic]] [[Deacon]] because he had been a member of the youth organisation of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]],&lt;ref name="Herkunft" /&gt; Adelman formed his own church, the ''Erzbistum München der heiligen katholischen orthodoxen evangelischen Kirche des heiligen Apostels Matthäus'' (English:''Archbishopric of Munich of the holy catholic orthodox church of the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]'') and awarded offices within the church.

==Biography==
Rainer Rene Graf Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden was born under the name Rene Freiherr von Godin as the son of a [[Bavaria]]n lawyer in 1948. He married Michaela Gräfin Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden (born 1953) in 1973 and the couple had ten children, born between 1974 and 1988. His wife is the niece of the late German federal [[Member of Parliament|MP]] (1957–1961) [[Raban Graf Adelmann]] (1912–1992).&lt;ref name="Roots"&gt;[http://worldroots.com/brigitte/theroff/adelmann.htm Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614055310/http://worldroots.com/brigitte/theroff/adelmann.htm |date=2011-06-14 }} {{de icon}} worldroots.com, accessed: 22 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Rene Freiherr von Godin assumed the title Graf Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden in 1980. During the mid-1980s, the couple resided in the village of [[Sentenhart]], near [[Wald, Baden-Württemberg|Wald]], between [[Lake Constance]] and [[Sigmaringen]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The Bavarian ministry of justice cancelled Graf Adelmann's registration as a lawyer in the state in 1982 for discrediting acts unworthy of a lawyer, however, Adelman took the case to the ''[[Bundesgerichtshof]]'' but eventually decided to discontinue his registration himself.&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herkunft" /&gt;

==Federation of German mercenaries==
Graf Adelmann, in the early 1980s, founded the ''Federation of German mercenaries'' for the purpose of recruiting mercenaries in Germany for service in Asian and African countries.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

German law prohibits the recruitment of German citizens for military service in foreign countries and the very attempt is punishable with up to five years of jail. However, Graf Adelmann considered this law invalid as it, in his opinion, violates the freedom of employment specified in the [[German constitution]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

He operated his business through the company ''Terfina Vermögensverwaltungs-GmbH'', and contacted foreign, mainly Asian and African embassies and governments for the purpose of building a clientele. By 1985, Graf Adelmann had over 400 job applications, targeting former ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' soldiers and unemployed adventurers through newspaper ads. In 1985, he claimed to have received interest from an undisclosed African country for the purpose of protecting an oil pipeline.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

He also claimed to have interests from [[Mozambique]] to provide personnel for the protection of the [[Cahora Bassa Dam]]. He saw an opportunity to provide personnel to developing countries who still "required adjustments to their borders and forms of government" but lacked qualified personnel to operate their modern weapons equipment. His initial plan was to recruit a [[platoon]] of 50 mercenaries, led by a number of retired ''Bundeswehr'' [[sergeant]]s.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

To join the ''Bund deutscher Legionäre'', BDL, one had to pay [[German mark|DM]] 20 as a joining fee, followed by another DM 20 as a yearly membership fee. For this, Graf Adelmann promised combat training in [[Belgium]] and shooting practise in [[Switzerland]], at the weapons manufacturers premises. His new recruits would have to "learn to kill" but he saw great potential in 18-year-olds in this regard. He also guaranteed that the bodies of fallen "heroes" would be returned to Germany and their memory adequately honoured.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Christian association for family development==
Another business Graf Adelmann operated was the ''Christian association for family development'', targeted at childless parents who were interested in adopting an as yet unborn or unconceived, baby. The association was officially shut down in the mid-1980s but continued to operate nevertheless. Adelman charged up to DM 32,000 for a successful adoption, with part of this money going to the mother of the child. The [[Prosecutors Office]] at [[Konstanz]] investigated against the business but was unable to prosecute as it violated no existing law at the time, declaring Adelmann had found a loop hole.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herkunft" /&gt;

He later opened an agency for adoption in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in early 1988 but had to close after the mayor of the city ordered it shut down.&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt; The business suffered a temporary setback when his aunt was arrested in [[Manila]] for [[kidnapping]] but later released.&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt;

==Organ donation business==
In the business of organ donations, Graf Adelmann would approach people who recently had to declare [[bankruptcy]], as published in the [[Bundesanzeiger]], a federal publication, and offered to help them to financial recovery by paying up to DM 80,000 for a [[kidney]], depending on the quality of the organ. Surgery would then be performed in [[France]], Adelman claiming that organ donation for money being legal there despite the fact that both French and German doctors had voluntarily outlawed such transactions. In France however at the time, donations from live donors were acceptable, providing no money was involved. Graf Adelmann just simply would keep the full truth from the performing clinic and thereby was able to carry out his business.&lt;ref name="Zeit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organselling.com/document.htm Organ Selling] organselling.com, accessed: 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Graf Adelmann later declared that no operations were carried out. In 1989, he tried to expand his business to the [[United Kingdom]] and was able to find a number of willing donors there, offering between US$30,000 and 50,000 per kidney, with the intention of making a 20% cut on every operation. The willing donors never heard from Graf Adelmann again after the initial contact. Shortly after, the [[British Parliament]] banned the sale of human organs for the purpose of transplants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/01/science/sales-of-kidneys-prompt-new-laws-and-debate.html?pagewanted=all Sales of Kidneys Prompt New Laws and Debate] ''[[The New York Times]]'', published: 1 August 1989, accessed; 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Graf Adelmann's activities even prompted a request in the German Parliament, the ''[[Bundestag]]'', in 1989, to tighten the organ donor law in the country and to shorten the lengthy donation process. A number of MP's of the Social Democratic Party of Germany posted the question what the federal government would do against Adelmann's activities.&lt;ref&gt;

==Name and title==
{{German title Graf}}
{{German title Freiherr}}
As royalty and its privileges have been abolished in Germany, the Name "Graf Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden" is one complex family name only and not a family name and a title. The part of "Graf" in this family name is only a part of this family name and not a legally valid title.

'''Robert Nivison, 1st Baron Glendyne''' (3 July 1849 &amp;ndash; 14 June 1930) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[stockbroker]].

Nivison was the son of John Nivison, a [[colliery]] manager of [[Sanquhar]] in [[Dumfriesshire]]. At the age of fifteen he joined the local branch of the [[British Linen Bank]] as a junior clerk. In 1869 he joined the [[London and Westminster Bank]], later moving to the head office in [[London]]. In 1881 he switched careers, becoming a junior partner of the stockbrokers T. P. Baptie, becoming a member of the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1883. In 1886, he established his own firm, R. Nivison &amp; Co. It became a very successful business, especially after 1891, when it began to act as stockbroker to the governments of the [[Dominion]]s.

For his services to the British and Dominion governments Nivison was created a [[Baronet]] in 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28854 |date=31 July 1914 |page=5963}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised to the peerage as [[Baron Glendyne]], of Sanquhar in the County of Dumfries,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32598 |date=3 February 1922 |page=954}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[1922 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32563 |date=30 December 1921 |page=10709 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Glendyne married Jane, daughter of John Wightman, of [[Sanquhar]], [[Dumfriesshire]], in 1877. He died in June 1930, aged 80, and was succeeded in his titles by his son [[John Nivison, 2nd Baron Glendyne|John]].

'''Rodin Alper Bingöl''' (May 22, 1984), is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[creative director]], [[entrepreneur]] and business leader known with his works in [[advertisement]], [[design]], digital campaigns and [[social responsibility]].

==Biography==
Bingöl was born in Istanbul in 1984. He had his first digital experiences in 1996 while he was building amateur web sites and web platforms which were the pioneers of the internet industry in Turkey. During his years in high school, becoming interested in acting, he took acting classes at the Stage of Kadıköy Public Training Center for two years.

In 2002, he graduated from the mechanical department of the Haydarpaşa Anatolian Technical High School.  He worked as a designer and instructor at the Bilge Adam Computer Education Center in his last year at high school. Excelling at his business life by becoming an art director, he decided to leave the Center in 2003.&lt;ref name="RAB - Röportaj" /&gt;

He continued his education at the Faculty of Visual Communication Design at the [[İstanbul Bilgi University]]. In his first year, he established Colors of Bilgi, one of the most active and efficient student clubs of the [[İstanbul Bilgi University]]. As the general coordinator and the art director of the magazine published by the Club, he organized photo shoots and interviews with public figures such as [[Cem Yılmaz]], [[Serdar Erener]], [[Metin Arolat]] ve [[Ali Nesin]] and got the chance to use his passion for photography. As the first student from the Faculty of Communication who participated in the elections, he was the leader and the creative director of the advertising campaigns of the team “Bilgistanbul” in the 2007 Student Union Elections.&lt;ref name="RAB - Röportaj"&gt;{{cite web|title = Sen Sor Rodin Alper Bingöl Yanıtlasın |url= http://www.onedergi.com/2010/04/sen-sor-rodin-alper-bingol-yanitlasin/|website=Onedergi.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2004 and 2006 he cofounded Colors of USA, the first online [[Work and Travel]] firm in Turkey. He traveled to many countries, including United States of America, England and Mexico for business and marketing purposes.&lt;ref name="RAB - Röportaj" /&gt;

Besides his education, he took part in many different projects as the art and project director. He worked with artists such as [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]], [[Cem Yılmaz]], [[Çağan Irmak]] and [[Zeki Demirkubuz]]; he designed and executed web sites, movie posters and advertising campaigns by creating unique concepts. He contributed to the projects of some of the biggest companies including Swiss Hotel, Bilge Adam, Aviva, [[TÜPRAŞ]] and [[Ülker]]. The official movie posters for [[Çağan Irmak]]’s [[Issız Adam]], [[Zeki Demirkubuz]]’s [[Envy (2009 film) Envy]] and [[Tuna Kiremitçi]]’s [[Adını Sen Koy]] were some of the creative works done by Bingöl in this period of time.&lt;ref name="RAB - IMDb"&gt;{{cite web|title = Rodin Alper Bingöl's IMDb Title |url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3648099/|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was still a student, he gave lectures at the Marmara University in the 2008-2009 academic year, focusing on Digital Marketing and Media Technologies. Described as a “Young Talent” by various media organizations, Bingöl gave interviews to widely read magazines such as Trensetter, Marketing Türkiye, Boxer and Cosmogirl.&lt;ref name="EKH Sabancı Vakfı"&gt;{{cite web|title = Engelleri Kaldır Hareketiyle Fark Yaratan Rodin Alper Bingöl |url= http://www.sabancivakfi.org/haber/engelleri-kaldir-hareketiyle-fark-yaratan-rodin-alper-bingol|website=Sabancivakfi.org|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from the [[İstanbul Bilgi University]] in 2009 by setting up and executing a social responsibility project, [[Removing Barriers Movement]] as his  thesis.

[[File:HP garage front.JPG|thumb|David Packard's garage in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded their company.]]

The '''rules of the garage''' are a set of eleven rules that attempt to encapsulate the work ethos that [[William Redington Hewlett|Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]] when they founded [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Since Hewlett-Packard was one of the earliest success stories of the information technology sector, it also used to more broadly describe the work ethos of [[Silicon Valley]].

== Etymology ==
The Rules were first articulated in 1999 by then HP CEO Carly Fiorina - during her tenure as then HP CEO - and they were later used in a Hewlett-Packard ad campaign.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/rules-of-the-ga/ |title=Rules of the Garage, And Then Some |work=Wired |first=John C |last=Abell |date=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was a reference to [[HP Garage|David Packard's garage]] in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded the company after graduating from nearby [[Stanford University]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="isbn1-59184-152-6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bill &amp; Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company |publisher=Portfolio |location=New York |first=Michael S |last=Malone |year=2007 |pages=39–41 |isbn=1-59184-152-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Eleven "Rules of the Garage" ==
The eleven rules are:&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;
# Believe you can change the world.
# Work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever.
# Know when to work alone and when to work together.
# Share — tools, ideas. Trust your colleagues.
# No Politics. No bureaucracy. (These are ridiculous in a garage.)
# The customer defines a job well done.
# Radical ideas are not bad ideas.
# Invent different ways of working.
# Make a contribution every day. If it doesn’t contribute, it doesn’t leave the garage.
# Believe that together we can do anything.
# Invent.

'''Saddar''' ({{lang-ur|'''  صدر  '''}}) is a neighbourhood in [[Saddar Town]] in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karachicity.gov.pk/town/index.asp?txtTown=Saddar Saddar Town – Government of Karachi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613010729/http://karachicity.gov.pk/town/index.asp?txtTown=Saddar |date=2006-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbourhood serves as a major commercial centre in the historic British-era core of Karachi. The neighbourhood contains Karachi’s largest concentration of colonial-era architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/01/03/2018/Pakistan-s-crumbling-architectural-heritage|title=Pakistan's crumbling architectural heritage - The Peninsula Qatar|website=www.thepeninsulaqatar.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central business district==

Saddar is the [[central business district]] of Karachi. 'Saddar' generally means 'centre' (of the town) and also 'head' (of State or organization). 
[[Empress Market]] in Saddar is the central shopping area of [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name=Dawn2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/742156|author=Nadir Siddiqui|title=Karachi Time Machine|date=2 March 2014|publisher=Dawn (newspaper)|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karachi's central bus station ''Regal Bus Stop'' is also located in Saddar, thus connecting it with other areas of [[Karachi]]. A major street in Saddar is named [[Zaibunnisa Street]], after the influential author and journalist, [[Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah]]. This street is one of the most modern and bustling in Karachi. Saddar is the hub of business activities in Karachi and is one of the oldest parts of the city. Many beautiful examples of British Colonial architecture can be found here; like the main building of [[Karachi Grammar School]], [[Frere Hall]] and the [[Sindh Club]]. This was the centre of [[Karachi]] in the colonial era, and still is today.

Saddar also has the famous Karachi building called [[Rainbow Centre Karachi|Rainbow Centre]].

There are several ethnic groups in Saddar including [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]], [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]], [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiris]], [[Saraiki people|Seraikis]], [[Pashtun people|Pakhtuns]], [[Baloch people|Balochis]], [[Brahui people|Brahuis]], [[Memon people|Memons]], [[Musta'li|Bohras]],  [[Ismaili people|Ismailis]], etc. Over 85% of the population is [[Muslim]]. There are also [[Christian]], [[Hindu]], [[Zoroastrian|Parsis]], [[Ahmadis]], and other religious communities in Saddar. The population of [[Saddar Town]] is estimated to be nearly one million.

A '''tax advisor''' or '''tax consultant''' is a person with advanced training and knowledge of [[tax law]]. The services of a tax advisor are usually retained in order to minimize taxation while remaining compliant with the law in complicated financial situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxadvisor.asp|title=Tax Advisor Definition|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax Advisors are also retained to represent clients before tax authorities and tax courts to resolve tax issues.

==World==
===Austria===
In [[Austria]], Steuerberater is the professional license for tax advisors.

===Germany===
{{See also|Steuerberater}}
In [[Germany]], Steuerberater is the professional license for tax advisors.&lt;ref name=bstbk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bstbk.de/de/index.html|title=Bundessteuerberaterkammer|publisher=Bundessteuerberaterkammer|language=German|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], tax advisors are called ''commercialisti'', and provide assistance on [[business management]], [[business law]], [[economics]], [[finance]], tax, [[accounting]], commercial, corporate and administrative matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/regprof/index.cfm?action=regprof&amp;id_regprof=18165&amp;cookies=disabled|title=Dottore commercialista (Italy)|publisher=[[European Commission]]|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treccani, [http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/commercialista/ commercialista]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dottori commercialisti'', who have a degree in [[economics]], and ''ragionieri commercialisti'', who have a [[diploma]] from an ''[[istituto tecnico economico]]'', were members of two different [[Professional Order|professional orders]], but they were merged in 2008 and it is now impossible to become a ''commercialista'' without a ''[[Laurea#Second cycle: Laurea Magistrale|laurea magistrale]]''. ''Esperti contabili'', whose roles are similar to those of a ''commercialista'', must have a ''[[Laurea#First cycle: Laurea|laurea]]'', a first cycle degree that is equivalent to a [[bachelor's degree]]. According to the Italian law, the following activities are some of the roles of a ''commercialista'':
* the administration and liquidation of companies and assets;
* surveys and technical advice;
* inspections and administrative reviews;
* verifications and investigations regarding the reliability of [[financial statements]], [[financial accounts|accounts]] and records of a [[company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lavoroeformazione.it/1/lavoro/il-dottore-commercialista-,138|title=Il dottore commercialista|publisher=lavoroeformazione.it|language=Italian|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unive.it/pag/10159/|title=Dottore commercialista, Esperto contabile, Revisore legale|publisher=[[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]]|language=Italian|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elenco-commercialisti.it/dottore-commercialista.html|title=Dottore commercialista e ragioniere commercialista|publisher=ItaliaWeb Srl|language=Italian||access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], there is a specific license for tax advisors called {{nihongo|'''certified public tax accountant'''|税理士|zeirishi}}. In order to obtain this qualification, an individual must pass a special state examination, or already be qualified as an [[attorney at law (Japan)|attorney at law]] or [[certified public accountant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichizeiren.or.jp/eng/index.html Japan Federation of Certified Public Tax Accountants' Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], there is a specific license for tax advisors called '''certified tax accountant'''. In order to obtain this qualification, an individual must pass a special examination.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], guidelines concerning professional conduct in relation to taxation are published in conjunction with the [[Chartered Institute of Taxation]], the [[Association of Taxation Technicians]], the [[Institute of Indirect Taxation]], the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]], the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]. These were prepared for the assistance of members of the various associations both generally in dealing with clients and the tax authorities and specifically in relation to irregularities and errors. 

The guidelines, which include practical advice about a range of legal and ethical issues, are summarised as:

* A member's primary duty is to ensure that his actions comply with the law. He/she owes a contractual duty to the client to act for him/her with the requisite degree of skill and care, and the contractual relationship should be governed by a letter of engagement. The member also has duties to the tax authorities, notably of compliance with the law and the honest presentation of his client's circumstances.
* It is the taxpayer's responsibility to ensure that returns made to the tax authorities are correct and complete. It is for the member to assist him to decide on the extent and manner of disclosure of facts in relation to his tax affairs.
*Where a member becomes aware that irregularities have occurred in relation to a client's tax affairs he should advise the client of the consequences, and the manner of disclosure. If necessary, appropriate specialist advice should be taken.
* Where a client refuses to follow the advice of a member in relation to issues involving disclosure, the member should consider whether he should continue to act. If appropriate, specialist advice should be taken.
* If mistakes are made by the tax authorities there may be a need, and in some cases a duty, on the part of the client and sometimes the member, to put matters right.
* Members may have statutory duties of disclosure where they have suspicions of criminal activity.
* When approached for information on a client's affairs by another adviser the member should ensure that he has his client's authority before making any disclosure.

===United States===
In the United States, paid tax return preparers are regulated but not licensed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. There are penalties for failure to disclose the identity of the preparer on the return, for the failure to give the taxpayer a copy of the return, and for negligence in preparing the return.

Practice before the Internal Revenue Service is regulated by [[Circular 230|''Treasury Department Circular No. 230'']], ''Regulations Governing the Practice of Attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, Enrolled Agents, Enrolled Actuaries, and Appraisers before the Internal Revenue Service''.&lt;ref&gt;Codified in regulations at 31 C.F.R. subtitle A, part 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Most practice is limited to [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorneys]], [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs), [[enrolled agent]]s, and [[enrolled actuary|enrolled actuaries]]. Rendering tax advice is also regulated by [[Circular 230]].

Failure to uphold these standards can result in disciplinary action ranging from reprimand to permanent disbarrment from practice.

In the United States, the term "tax professional" is a generic term describing a variety of professions including enrolled agents, Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), [[financial planner]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[tax preparer]]s, and some [[lawyer]]s.

In the United States, by far the largest segment of tax professionals are individual tax preparers.

==History==
===Foundation===
[[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra]] started a joint venture with [[British Telecom]] in 1986 as a technology outsourcing firm. British Telecom initially had around 30 percent stake in the Tech Mahindra company. In December 2010, British Telecom sold 5.5 per cent of its stake in Tech Mahindra to Mahindra &amp; Mahindra for Rs 451 crore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BT Group to exit from Tech Mahindra, directors resign|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-12-24/news/30554758_1_bt-group-tech-mahindra-techm|publisher=Economic Times|accessdate=4 July 2015|date=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, British Telecom sold 14.1 per cent of its stake to institutional investors for about Rs 1,395 crore. In December 2012, British Telecom sold its remaining 9.1 per cent (11.6 million shares) shareholding to institutional investors for a total gross cash proceeds of Rs 1,011.4 crore. This sale marked the exit of British Telecom from Tech Mahindra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BT exits Tech Mahindra|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/bt-exits-tech-mahindra/article4191751.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=4 July 2015|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of Satyam Computer Services Ltd.===
After the [[Satyam scandal]] of 2008-09 Tech Mahindra bid for [[Satyam Computer Services]], and emerged as a top bidder with an offer of Rs 58.90 a share for a 31 per cent stake in the company, beating a strong rival [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/tech-mahindra-wins-satyam-bid--full-coverage/90124-7.html|title=Tech Mahindra wins Satyam Computer bid|work=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; After evaluating the bids, the government-appointed board of Satyam Computer announced on 13 April 2009: "its Board of Directors has selected Venturbay Consultants Private Limited, a subsidiary controlled by Tech Mahindra Limited as the highest bidder to acquire a controlling stake in the Company, subject to the approval of the Hon'ble Company Law Board." Through a subsidiary, it has emerged victorious in [[Mahindra Satyam|Satyam]] sell-off, a company probably two times its size in number of people. This was one of the largest merger deals in India's tech industry.

== Overview ==
The Industries of the Future by Senior Policy Advisor [[Alec Ross (government official)|Alec Ross]] explores the geopolitical, cultural and generational changes that will be driven by the key industries over the next twenty years. Ross is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alecross.com/about/|title=Alec Ross - Leading Expert on Innovation|website=Alec Ross {{!}} Technology Policy Expert, Innovator and Author|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the Senior Advisor for Innovation to [[Hillary Clinton|Secretary of State Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Talks at Google|title=Alec Ross: "The Industries of the Future" {{!}} Talks at Google|date=2016-04-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMmM2Jtkhxc|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as Senior Advisor for Innovation he visited forty-one countries looking at the technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/global-economy-come/?hootPostID=d6814599a4be899c06782c2a3f764f5e|title=A Road Map for the Future|website=WNYC|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a guest lecturer at a number of institutions including the [[United Nations]], [[University of Oxford]], [[Harvard Law School]], and [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford Business School]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ross started his career as a teacher through Teach for America and in 2000 he co-founded a technology-focused nonprofit organization called [[One Economy Corporation|One Economy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The book explores several industries including robotics, genetics, coding and big data. Ross explores how advances in robotics and life sciences will change the way we live—robots, artificial intelligence and machine learning will have impact on our lives. According to Ross, dramatic advances in life sciences will increase our life expectancy—but not all will benefit from such changes. Ross spends time exploring "Code" and how the codefication of money and also weapons (computer security) will both benefit and potentially disrupt our international economies. Ross also looks at how data will be "the raw material of the information age."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industries of the Future|last=Ross|first=Alec|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2016|isbn=9781476753652|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross also focuses on globalization and geopolitical economics. He explores how competitiveness and how societies, families and individuals will need to thrive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ross gives attention to the importance of women stating that "the states and societies that do the most for women are those that will be best positioned to compete and succeed in the industries of the future."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The book also touches on how to prepare children for "success in a world of increasing change and competition."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ross discusses the shift of robotics from being manual and repetitive to cognitive and non-repetitive.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/Alec-Ross-on-how-cognitive-robots-will-change-the-world|title=Alec Ross on how cognitive robots will change the world|website=SearchCIO|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that breakthroughs in [[mathematical model]]ing and [[cloud robotics]] ([[machine learning]] and [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]]) make robotics acceptable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the book Ross describes how other cultures have different reactions to robotics and he uses Japan's use of robotics in elder-care as an example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also expects that less developed countries may be able to leapfrog technologies in robotics much like they did with cell and mobile technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Ross, the last trillion dollar industry was created out of computer code; the next trillion dollar industry will be created out of genome code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/02/16/exp-gps-0214-alec-ross-interview.cnn|title=Ross on the future of work - CNN Video|website=CNN|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dawn-nakagawa/alec-ross--genetic-code_b_9146928.html|title=The Next Trillion-Dollar Industry Could Be Built on Genetic Code|date=2016-02-04|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book Ross describes how [[genome]] code is already being used to fix humans from curing [[cancer]] to hacking the brain to growing organs. He also describes the difference between the [[United States]] investment in genome research with that of [[China]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ross then turns to the "code-ification" of money, markets and trust. He describes the transition from cash to mobile and online banking. He also discusses the sharing economy from eBay to AirBnB and then gives an overview of BitCoin and blockchain technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ross also focuses on [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] and the weaponization of code with a focus on a move from cold war to "code war." Ross states that he expects the total market size of the cyberindustry to reach $175 billion by the end of 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Development history ==
Alec Ross has said that he intended to give a balanced point of view with the book that it is neither a [[Utopia]]n or [[Dystopia]]n vision of the future which is why he opened the book with the struggles he witnessed growing up in West Virginia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On writing the book Ross said that he knows his parents would have wanted a book like this in the sixties that would describe what globalization would do and he wished that he had a book like this when he graduated from college that would have explored the Internet and digitization on the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The editors for the book were Jonathan Karp and Jonathan Cox of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reviews and reception ==
''The Industries of the Future'' has received mainly positive reviews from the likes of ''[[Forbes]]'', ''New York Journal of Books'', and ''[[Financial Times]]''. ''Forbes'' contributor Peter Decherney said the book "reads like a portable [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] at which you've been seated next to the smartest guy in the room."&lt;ref name="Decherney"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdecherney/2016/01/30/a-bad-time-to-be-a-control-freak-alec-ross-forecasts-the-industries-of-the-future/#575ae045209c|title=Searching for the Next Silicon Valley: Alec Ross Forecasts the Industries of the Future|last=Decherney|first=Peter|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also listed on the Forbes list—''16 New Books for Leaders to Begin in 2016''.&lt;ref name="Decherney"/&gt; [[Tara Sonenshine|Tara D. Sonenshine]] in the ''New York Journal of Books'' called the book a good place to start "if you want to know how to survive and thrive in the fast-paced world of today and how to anticipate the opportunities  of tomorrow's information age." Sonenshine also called out the book for focusing on women and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/industries-future|title=a book review by Tara Sonenshine: The Industries of the Future|website=www.nyjournalofbooks.com|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "Is predicting the future futile or necessary?" by Stephen Cave in the ''Financial Times'' is more critical, saying that Ross focuses on industries with already considerable coverage and investment but Cave points out that "rarely can the future be predicted by extending current trajectories."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5815c14a-b2e7-11e5-b147-e5e5bba42e51.html|title=Is predicting the future futile or necessary?|last=Cave|first=Stephen|date=2016-01-08|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Finney''' (1837–1903) was an [[Australia]]n businessman and politician. He represented the [[electoral district of Toowong]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland]] from 1896 until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040182b.htm|title=Finney, Thomas (1837-1903)|author=A.A. Morrison|year=1972|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qp&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Members|publisher=[[Parliament of Queensland]]|year=2015| url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/members/former/bio?id=2006432948|accessdate= 26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Thomas Finney was born 10 January 1837&lt;ref&gt;http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/finney-thomas-3518&lt;/ref&gt; at Currakeen House, [[Tuam]], [[Galway]], [[Ireland]]. His father was Thomas Finney and his mother was Eliza Finney, née Cornwall. He began work at a drapery shop in 1856, and in 1862 emigrated to [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] with his partner James Isles.

The two started a drapery business, Finney Isles &amp; Co., which was extremely successful. In 1869 the company had branches in [[Rockhampton]] and [[Gympie]], and by 1873 it had expanded into the areas of tailoring, furniture, furnishing, and hardware.

in 1879, Finney pioneered 6 p.m. closing in Brisbane stores. In 1885, with other firms, he instituted 1 p.m. closing on Saturdays and even after other firms reverted to the old Saturday hours of 8 a.m. to 11 p.m, Finney continued it. A charity fund of the employees was subsidized £ for £ by the management and was administered by a committee that included the managing director and two employees elected by the staff.

The business suffered severely in 1893 from flood waters and from the financial crisis, but soon recovered.

At some point Finney was elected to the Toowong Shire Council, and in 1896 he won the [[electoral district of Toowong]] and was seated in the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland]], holding his seat until his resignation in 1902.

Finney was married thrice. On 22 May 1864, he was wed to Kate Pringle Little, but she died after two years and he married Sidney Anne Jackson, whose sister married Finney’s business partner, James Isles. Finney and Sidney had two daughters and a son together, and she died on 13 October 1883. In 1901, while in England, Finney married Janet Edgar Farrow, a widow.

He died on 16 December 1903 and was buried in [[Toowong Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=bcc&gt;[https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=142585 Finney Thomas] &amp;mdash; Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 26 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Msk cao tverskoy.png|thumb|Tverskoy and [[Kitai-gorod]] on the map of Moscow. As of 2007, Kitai-gorod is a separate territory governed directly by Central Administrative Okrug]]
[[File:Coat of Arms of Tverskoy (municipality in Moscow).png|thumb|Coat of arms of Tverskoy District]]

'''Tverskoy District''' ({{lang-rus|Тверско́й райо́н|p=tvʲɪrˈskoj|a=Ru-Тверской.ogg}}) is a [[administrative divisions of Moscow|district]] of [[Central Administrative Okrug]] of the [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. Population: {{ru-census2010|75,378|;}} {{ru-census2002|75,955|.}}

The district extends from [[Kitai-gorod]] northwest to [[Belorussky Rail Terminal|Belorussky]] and [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]]s . Its southern boundary runs one or two city blocks south from [[Tverskaya Street]]; eastern boundary follows the track of the [[Neglinnaya River]] now flowing in a [[tunnel]] under Samotechnaya Street, [[Tsvetnoy Boulevard]], and Neglinnaya Street.

Tverskoy District houses [[State Duma]], [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], the Mayor of Moscow, Moscow City Council, and [[Moscow Police]] Headquarters. It contains [[Theatre Square]], the business district of Tverskaya Street with [[Pushkin Square]], [[Petrovka Street]], Dmitrovka Street, and the western part of [[Kuznetsky Most]]. It has the highest concentration of theatres, including [[Bolshoi Theatre]] and the historical Pillar Hall of the [[House of the Unions]].

Historical areas of [[Patriarshy Ponds]], Malaya Bronnaya Street, and most of [[Tverskoy Boulevard]], while closely associated with Tverskaya Street actually belong to [[Presnensky District]]. Since 2002 Tverskoy District also includes [[Kitai-gorod]], which was once a separate territory managed directly by Central Administrative Okrug.

==History==
''This section is based on P.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Sytin's "History of Moscow Streets"''&lt;ref&gt;Russian: П.В.Сытин, "Из истории московских улиц", М, 1948 (''Sytin'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Muscovy to 19th century===
[[File:Vysokopetrovsky Monastery 6.JPG|thumb|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter's Cathedral, Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, ca. 1508]]

Tverskaya Street emerged, as the road to [[Tver]], in the 12th century. Dmitrovka Street, the road to [[Dmitrov]], and [[Petrovka Street]], leading to [[Vysokopetrovsky Monastery]], date back to the 14th century.

[[File:Putinki.jpg|thumb|left|Church of Nativity in Putinki, 1650s]]

Until the 1820s, the territory of what is now Tverskoy District was separated from the [[Moscow Kremlin]] by the [[Neglinnaya River]].  Because of that, the city grew primarily eastward in the Middle Ages—into the [[Red Square]] and Kitai-Gorod—while the development of western territories lagged behind. A stone bridge connecting Tverskaya with the Red Square was built in 1595. Urban development in the western part concentrated along Tverskaya Street. In the late 15th century, it was built out with country-like wooden homes to Pushkin Square, and by the end of the 16th century the city extended beyond the present-day [[Garden Ring]].  First stone [[Boyar]] houses appeared in downtown Tverskaya around that time. In 1654, [[Strastnoy Monastery]] was set up in present-day Pushkin Square, and three years later, Odoyevsky family set up a stone mansion on the site of present-day Museum of Modern History (formerly Museum of Revolution), beyond the [[Bely Gorod]] walls. 

[[File:Dmitrovka Street, 2010192.jpg|thumb|Dmitrovka Street]]

Dmitrovka Street also developed rapidly after the fire of 1648, as marked by the one-of-a-kind eight-[[tented church]] of [[Nativity Church at Putinki|Nativity in Putinki]]. Unusually for Moscow outskirts, it was financed by the State, as the church was located near the Embassy Inn ({{lang|ru|Посольский двор}}), home to foreign guests.&lt;ref&gt;''Sytin'', p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dmitrovka Street, 2010193.jpg|thumb|left|Dmitrovka Street]]

[[Peter the Great]]'s move of the national [[capital (political)|capital]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] actually improved the leading role of Tverskaya Street, as it became the main road of royal journeys between two capitals. Tverskaya acquired Moscow's first triumphal arch (1703, giving name to Triumphalnaya Square), [[Gagarin family]] palace (1760s), and [[Zakhar Chernyshyov]] mansion (1782); later the seat of Moscow Governor, [[Mossovet]], and currently of the Mayor of Moscow (which was rebuilt in the 1940s). The [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Fire of 1812]] wiped out wealthy mansions and peasant homes alike, sparing only the Pushkin Square;&lt;ref&gt;''Sytin'', p.128&lt;/ref&gt; Tverskaya was rebuilt as an upper-class street and retained this status ever since.

Northeastern side of Tverskoy District (east of Petrovka Street) lagged behind Tverskaya Street and Moscow's east side due to frequent floods on the Neglinnaya River. First attempt to control the river, proposed in 1775 by Matvey Kazakov, materialized in 1792 Neglinnaya Canal, which was running parallel to the river.  Once the canal was completed, the old river bed was filled with earth. In 1817–1819, the channel was covered with masonry vaults, locking the stream in an underground tunnel. This created Neglinnaya Street, the youngest street inside Boulevard Ring, but did not rule out future floods.  The most recent flood, in 1973, led to complete rebuilding of the aging tunnel (1974–1989, see [http://www.mosinzhproekt.ru/press-center/articles/print_neglinka.shtml 1965 flood photos])&lt;ref&gt;Russian, Contractor report: Река Неглинная. История и современность, Мосинжроект, 2005 [http://www.mosinzhproekt.ru/press-center/articles/print_neglinka.shtml www.mosinzhproekt.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; Another legacy of the Neglinnaya river survives in Central Baths (1890) and [[Sanduny|Sandunovsky Baths]] (1896).&lt;ref&gt;Russian: "Москва начала века", М, ООО "O-Мастер", 2001 {{ISBN|5-9207-0001-7}} стр.184 (''Builders of Moscow'', p.184). Dates are for extant buildings. Sandunov family owned the baths since the 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandunovsky Baths on Neglinnays Street are actually located in [[Meshchansky District]] (on the eastern side of the street), just like the [[Central Bank of Russian Federation]] building.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theatre District====
[[File:MosMetro Teatralnaya img3 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb|Theatre Square, Teatralnaya metro station]]

The first public theater, ''[[Petrovka Theatre|Petrovsky Teatr]]'', was set up in 1780 by English entrepreneur [[Michael Maddox]] and Prince Urusov in present-day [[Theatre Square]].  It burned down in October 1805 after 425 successful shows.&lt;ref&gt;German: [http://russlandonline.ru/bolschoi/morenews.php?iditem=27 http://russlandonline.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, [[Joseph Bove]] built a new, larger [[Bolshoi Theatre]] on the same site. By this time, downtown stretch of the Neglinnaya River was contained in an underground tunnel; Peter's [[bastion]]s of Kitai-gorod were razed, forming the [[Theatre Square]]. In the same 1825, landowner Vargin built Maly Theatre on his own adjacent lot. For the first five years, the State leased the building from Vargin; he was later convicted of fraud and the State bought out the building in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.184&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of the opposite land lots were obliged to build houses exactly like Maly Theatre, forming a perfectly symmetrical [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] square with a parade ground and water fountain. The symmetry was eventually ruined by expansions in the 1870s, which added the third theatre—originally Bronnikov private theater (now Molodyozhny Theater).

Another historical hall, the Assembly of Nobility (now the [[House of the Unions]]) stands on the corner of Bolshaya Dmitrovka and [[Okhotny Ryad (street)|Okhotny Ryad]] streets since 1790. The building, designed by [[Matvey Kazakov]], was rebuilt externally, but the Pillar Hall inside it, famous for its [[acoustics]], remains close to Kazakov's original design. When the State lifted the ban on private theatres in 1882, tradition continued with [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in Kamergersky Lane (1902–1909),&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Russia'', p.187 says "minor construction work proceeded till 1909". Substantial completion is usually dated 1903&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yermolova Theatre]] (1925), Hermitage (1883), and Aquarium (1898) park theatres, etc. Currently, Tverskoy District has nineteen [[repertory]] theatres, the Pillar Hall, [[Tchaikovsky]] Hall (1940), and [[Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard]] (originally Salamonovsky Circus, 1880, rebuilt in 1987–1989).

====Industrial expansion====
[[File:Wiki Zelenko Kindergarten Vadkovsky Lane.jpg|thumb|1907 Communal Club for working teenagers, funded by [[Nikolai Krotov (industrialist)|Nikolay Krotov]], designed and managed by [[Alexander Zelenko]] and [[Stanislav Shatsky]]]]

Unlike [[Presnensky District|Presnensky]] or [[Basmanny District]]s, Tverskoy has, and always had, very few industrial properties. However, its northern part, beyond Garden Ring, developed into a working-class neighborhood in line with the 19th-century industrialization. Development began in the 18th century with the [[Butyrka prison]] (rebuilt to a castle shape in 1800).&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.42&lt;/ref&gt; For the next hundred years, the territories around the prison were filled with farms and small wooden homes.  Things changed with the construction of railroads—[[Smolensk]] railroad station was built in 1870; current building, known as [[Belorussky Rail Terminal]], was completed in 1909. [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]] and Moscow Ring Railroad followed in the 1900s. Territories near the railroads were quickly used for factories, cheap housing for workers followed soon.

Miusskaya Square, located three blocks from Belorussky Terminal, was a site of unusual urban development, a new center of blue-collar social life. In the course of one decade, 1904–1914, the city and private sponsors built Abrikosova Hospital and Nursery (1906),&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Junior High School (1912),&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.372&lt;/ref&gt; Shanyavsky University (1913),&lt;ref&gt;''Builders of Moscow'', p.382&lt;/ref&gt; kindergartens, and trade schools. Development of similar social hubs in other working districts lagged behind and terminated with [[World War I]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

====Modern history====
[[File:Corner of Manege Square, Moscow.jpg|thumb|left|Corner of [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manege Square]]: extant National Hotel and demolished Intourist Hotel (1970–2002)]]

Redevelopment of Tverskaya Street began in the late 1920s with infill buildings like [[Ivan Rerberg]]'s Central Telegraph (1927), and [[Grigory Barkhin]]'s [[Izvestia]] building in Pushkin Square (1927). This was followed by demolition of [[Okhotny Ryad (street)|Okhotny Ryad]] and [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manege Square]].

Major reconstruction of Tverskaya Street began in 1937 with demolition of Strastnoy Monastery and dozens of smaller buildings. Three buildings, including Savvinskoye Podvorye, [[Mossovet]] building, and the Eye Clinic, were spared from demolition and moved to new foundations farther from the street. As a result, Savvinskoye Podvorye is now completely locked inside a 1930s [[stalinist architecture|stalinist]] block. Another building, a print shop at Pushkin Square, was moved in the 1970s to make way for Izvestia expansion.&lt;ref&gt;М.Трубилина, "Переезды во сне и наяву", Российская Газета, 1 марта 2004, [http://www.rg.ru/2004/03/01/pereezdy.html www.rg.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

Design of the first stretch of new Gorky Street (the name of Tverskaya since 1935) was awarded to [[Arkady Mordvinov]], 1929 graduate in architecture known for his ultra-left public statements. Mordvinov proved himself a good project manager, successfully testing so-called ''flow method'' of fast-track construction. By 1941, most of central Gorky Street was completed; the rest was built out after [[World War II]].

[[File:Wiki St Nicholas u Tverskoy.jpg|thumb|Contemporary [[Old Believers]] murals near Belorussky Terminal&lt;ref&gt;St.Nicholas church of [[Rogozhskoye Cemetery|Rogozhskoye Old Believers]] was laid down shortly before [[World War I]] and was not properly completed and consecrated before the Revolution of 1917. All exterior and interior finished were made from scratch in the 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 1970s, the street acquired [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]]-era boxlike buildings of 23-story [[Intourist]] Hotel (1970, demolished in 2002&lt;ref&gt;Russian: illustrated contractor's report on demolition [http://www.krealist.ru/showinfo.php?id=50 www.krealist.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;) and smaller Minsk Hotel (1964, demolished in 2005) and New Izvestia building; less controversial pseudo-stalinist infill buildings followed in the 1980s and late 1990s. However, outside Tverskaya, historical buildings and neighborhoods were being demolished throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Many blocks in the [[Novoslobodskaya]] station area are already rebuilt as post-2000 highrises. The City has declared plans to reconstruct Pushkin Square and Belorussky Terminal Square with mult-level underground tunnels, shopping space, and parking&lt;ref&gt;English: Pushkin Square Under Threat, The Moscow Times, 24.10.2006 [http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=149&amp;data_id=229&amp;do=view_single MAPS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515055542/http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=149&amp;data_id=229&amp;do=view_single |date=May 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but those plans were later abolished with mayor resignation.

Population of Tverskoy District is traditionally affluent and educated, with a substantial share of foreigners (most of them are not included in official population count). Its ethnic mix, changing rapidly since the 1980s, has high shares of [[Tatars]], [[Armenians]] and [[Jews]]; once-strong [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] community has dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;Russian: Ethnicity maps in: Вендина, Ольга (ред.)

The '''United States Rubber Company''' ('''Uniroyal''') is an American manufacturer of [[tire]]s and other [[synthetic rubber]]-related products, as well as variety of items for military use, such as [[ammunition]], [[explosives]] and [[operations and maintenance]] activities (O&amp;MA) at the government-owned contractor-operated facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2790783;view=1up;seq=413 Defense Procurement]. // ''Defense Industry Bulletin'', November 1966, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in [[Naugatuck, Connecticut]], in 1892. It was one of the original 12 stocks in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]],&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.djindexes.com| title=The Dow 1896-1909: What happened to the original 12 companies in the DJIA?| publisher=Dow Jones Indexes| accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became Uniroyal, Inc., as part of creating a unified brand for its products and subsidiaries in 1961. In 1990, Uniroyal was acquired by [[France|French]] tire maker [[Michelin]] and &lt;!-- evidently --&gt; ceased to exist as a separate business.  Today around 1,000 workers in the U.S. remain employed by Michelin to make its Uniroyal brand products. The company's long-lived advertisement slogan was "''United States Tires are Good Tires''."{{sfn|Babcock|1966|p=97}}

One of Uniroyal's best known tires is the ''Tiger Paw'' introduced in the 1960s and included as original equipment for that decade's [[muscle car]]s such as the [[Pontiac GTO]], which itself was promoted as The Tiger during its early years. Today, Uniroyal still uses the Tiger Paw brand name in its tire line.

In North America, Colombia and Peru, the Uniroyal brand has been owned by [[Michelin]] since 1990, and outside those regions, the Uniroyal brand has been owned by [[Continental AG]] since 1979 following their acquisition of Uniroyal Europe, formerly known as [[Englebert (tyre manufacturer)|Englebert]].

==Origins==
[[File:Goodyear-1-.jpg|thumb|left|Goodyear Metallic Rubber Shoe Company &amp; Downtown Naugatuck (c. 1890)]]
By 1892, there were many rubber manufacturing companies in [[Naugatuck, Connecticut]], as well as elsewhere in Connecticut. Nine companies consolidated their operations in Naugatuck to become the United States Rubber Company.  It should be noted that one of the nine, Goodyear's India Rubber Glove Mfg. Co. (named Litchfield Rubber Co. until 1847) &amp;ndash; which manufactured rubber gloves for telegraph linemen &amp;ndash; was the only company in which [[Charles Goodyear]], inventor of the rubber vulcanization process, is known to have owned stock.

From 1892 to 1913, the rubber footwear divisions of U.S. Rubber manufactured their products under 30 different brand names, including the Wales-Goodyear Shoe Co. The company consolidated these footwear brands under one name, [[Keds (shoes)|Keds]], in 1916, and were mass-marketed as the first flexible rubber-sole with canvas-top "[[Sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]]" in 1917.
[[File:United States Tire newspaper ad 1922.png|thumbnail|left|1922 US Tire newspaper ad.]]
On May 26, 1896, [[Charles Dow]] created the Dow Industrial average of twelve industrial manufacturing stocks, which included among them U.S. Rubber Company. When the average expanded to a list of 20 stocks in 1916, U.S. Rubber remained, however the listing expanded to 30 stocks in 1928 and U.S. Rubber was dropped.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite book| author=Jeremy J. Siegel| title=[[Stocks for the Long Run]], Second Edition| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=1 March 1998| isbn=0-07-058043-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:US Rubber 1790 Bwy west jeh.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. Rubber Headquarters constructed at 1790 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in 1912]]

In an effort to increase its share of the automobile tire market in 1931, U.S. Rubber Company bought a substantial portion of the Gillette Safety Tire Company. The company was founded in 1916 by Raymond B. Gillette and its primary manufacturing plant was located in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]]. The Gillette plant held large contracts with the [[General Motors]] Corporation and with the addition of U.S. Rubber products, became one of the world's largest suppliers of original equipment tires. U.S. Rubber produced tires under the Gillette, Ward, Atlas, U.S. Rubber and U.S. Royal brands.&lt;ref name="UW"&gt;{{cite web| title=Uniroyal, Inc. Records, 1917-1990| url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=wiarchives;cc=wiarchives;view=text;rgn=main;didno=uw-whs-ec00cb| publisher=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire| author=Cindy Knight| year=1995| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, U.S. Rubber purchased the remainder of the Gillette Safety Tire Company, and began to expand and modernize the Eau Claire factory, greatly increasing production. During [[World War II]], U.S. Rubber factories were devoted to production of war goods, and produced military truck and airplane tires, as well as the canvas-top, rubber-soled [[Jungle boot]] for soldiers and marines serving in tropical and jungle environments.&lt;ref name="UW"/&gt; U.S. Rubber ranked 37th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, the United States government restricted the sale of scarce rubber products for civilian use and production at the plant dwindled. The company sold the Eau Claire plant to the government, which then converted it for the manufacture of small caliber ammunition and renamed it the Eau Claire Ordnance plant.&lt;ref name="UW"/&gt;

By December 31, 1943, the need for tires outweighed the need for ammunition. U.S. Rubber repurchased the plant from the government for more than [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million, and converted it back to synthetic rubber tire production. The company began an expansion and modernization program at the plant that lasted through 1951. When it ended, the Eau Claire plant was the fifth largest tire facility in the United States. The company again expanded the plant in 1965 to produce tires for construction machinery, and for many years it was the largest private employer in Eau Claire and the second largest in neighboring [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]] before it was closed in 1991.&lt;ref name="UW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;{{cite news| title=Eau Claire responds to Uniroyal closing| url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3021| work=Fedgazette| publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]]| author=Kathy Cobb| date=1 January 1991| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1943, U.S. Rubber engineer '''Dr. Louis Marick''' developed a propeller de-icing system in which a rubber boot was fitted onto the leading edge of a propeller. The boot contained wires that conducted electricity to heat the edge and break-up ice.&lt;ref name="mechanics"&gt;{{cite news| title=De-Icer for Airplane Propeller is Made of Electric Rubber| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S9YDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Uu44TpGOEquGsgLepeUC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true| work=[[Popular Mechanics]]| date=December 1943| page=12| publisher=[[Google Books]]| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Englebert Company ===

In 1958, Uniroyal entered into a partnership with the [[Englebert (tyre manufacturer)|Englebert]] tire company of [[Liège]], [[Belgium]], which became known as Uniroyal Englebert Deutschland AG. In 1963, the name was shortened to Uniroyal-Englebert, and in 1967 it became Uniroyal along with all company divisions. Uniroyal sold this division with its four factories in Belgium, Germany, France and Scotland to [[Continental AG]] in 1979. Continental continues to market tires under the Uniroyal brand outside [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="continental"&gt;{{cite web| title=Uniroyal History| url=http://www.uniroyal-tyres.com/generator/www/de/en/uniroyal/automobile/themes/06_uniroyal/03_history/history_en.html| publisher=Continental AG| accessdate=2012-03-13| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314080703/http://www.uniroyal-tyres.com/generator/www/de/en/uniroyal/automobile/themes/06_uniroyal/03_history/history_en.html| archive-date=2012-03-14| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.continental-corporation.com/www/hr_in_en/themes/why_continental/your_employer/cwl_rubber_en.html | title = Passenger and Light Truck Tires | website = www.continental-corporation.com | publisher = Continental AG | access-date = 11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominion Rubber ===
[[File:UNIROYAL (scan d un 4x5 print).jpg|thumb|left|Uniroyal plant in [[Saint-Jérôme, Quebec]], built in 1911–1930]]

Uniroyal operations in Canada were carried out under the name Dominion Rubber Company for a number of decades.

Dominion started operations as Brown, Hibbard and Bourne, established in 1854. In 1866, the company registered as the Canadian Rubber Company of Montreal Limited and became prosperous manufacturing waterproof cloth, rubber footwear and machinery belts.  It began to produce auto tires in 1906 in its Montreal factory and through a series of mergers with other companies in Ontario and Quebec became the Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company Limited.

After another series of mergers, the company became the Dominion Rubber Company Limited in 1926. It produced footwear under a variety of brand names, coated upholstery fabrics, mechanical parts, industrial chemicals and vehicle tires.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web| title=Dominion Rubber Company| work=Canadian Register of Commerce and Industry| year=1959| publisher=[[University of Western Ontario]]| accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, after four decades as Dominion, the company was renamed Uniroyal Ltd., along with all other company holdings, and in 1981, it was sold to Waterville Ltd.

[[File:UNIROYAL démolition-2.jpg|thumb|right|The Saint-Jérôme facility during demolition in 1994]]

=== S.A. Rubber ===

In 1939, Mark Lodge and Harold Hill established S. A. Rubber Mills Pty. Ltd. in [[Edwardstown, South Australia]]. The company grew until 1963 when U.S. Rubber purchased 25% of the business. By 1980, Uniroyal owned sixty percent of what was now Uniroyal Brazil which it sold to [[Bridgestone]]. The subsidiary which operated Australian plants under the name Uniroyal Tyre Company became Bridgestone Australia Ltd. and was traded on the Australian stock exchange as a majority-owned subsidiary of Japan's tire company.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| title=History of Bridgestone Australia| url=http://www.bridgestone.com.au/corporate/history/default.aspx| publisher=Bridgestone| year=2007| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 March 2007 stockholders of Bridgestone Australia Ltd. voted to make the company a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Bridgestone]] Corporation of Japan.&lt;ref name="privatised"&gt;{{Cite news| title=Bridgestone to be privatised| url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/bridgestone-to-be-privatised/story-e6frede3-1111113191878?from=public_rss| date=20 March 2007| author=Cameron England| work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]| location=Adelaide| publisher=adelaidenow.com.au| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;({{Tyo2|5108}})

=== Isochem ===

A joint venture, Isochem, Inc., was established in June, 1965 together with [[Martin Marietta Corporation]] and chaired by the Martin's vice president [[Malcolm A. MacIntyre]] to operate [[Hanford nuclear site]] under the auspices of [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]], thus assuming duties, previously performed by the [[General Electric Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/missilesrockets1617unse#page/n393/mode/2up New Activities]. // ''Missiles and Rockets'', June 14, 1965, v. 16, no. 24, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/missilesrockets1719unse#page/n429/mode/2up Mergers and Acquisitions]. // ''Missiles and Rockets'', October 25, 1965, v. 17, no. 17, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniroyal==
[[File:Uniroyalsuperfleet.jpg|thumb|Uniroyal Mexican Truck Tire]]
In 1961, the company became '''Uniroyal, Inc.'''&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;  The Uniroyal name was applied to all its operating components and products by 1967, creating a unified brand.&lt;ref name="UW"/&gt;

As Uniroyal, the company became defendant in a landmark gender discrimination case, ''[[Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal]]'', under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The case continued for several years until the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] issued a ruling in 1982.

==Uniroyal Goodrich Tire==
In 1985, Uniroyal was taken private by its management and the New York investment firm of [[Clayton &amp; Dubilier]] to prevent a hostile takeover by financier [[Carl Icahn|Carl C. Icahn]]. At the time, Uniroyal was the fifth-largest tire company in the country.&lt;ref name="icahn"&gt;{{cite news| agency=Associated Press| title=Uniroyal Plans Buy-Out; Icahn to Drop Offer | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| publisher=LATimes.com| date=7 May 1985 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-07/business/fi-11319_1 | accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To help pay the nearly $1 billion in debt incurred in the leveraged buyout, the company sold its Uniroyal's Chemical subsidiary to Avery Inc. &amp;ndash; a producer of agricultural chemicals, industrial chemical additives and specialized rubber and plastic products &amp;ndash; for $760 million in May 1986.&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;{{cite news| title=Uniroyal to Sell Subsidiary for $760 Million| agency=[[Associated Press]]| work=Los Angeles Times |date=15 May 1986| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-15/business/fi-5521_1_uniroyal-chemical| publisher=LATimes.com| accessdate=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining tire operation was merged with that of [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]] Company ({{nyse2|GR}}), a [[S&amp;P 500]]-listed tire and rubber fabricator that made high-performance replacement tires.&lt;ref name="UW"/&gt; The joint venture partnership became the '''Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company''' and B.F. Goodrich Company held a 50% stake in the new tire company.&lt;ref name="nytimes883q"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFD71630F937A25753C1A96E948260| title=Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30| work=[[The New York Times]]| publisher=NYTimes.com| date=14 October 1988| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company established its headquarters at the former B. F. Goodrich corporate headquarters, within its 27-building downtown complex in [[Akron, Ohio]], which contained Goodrich's original factory. In the fall of 1987, the B.F. Goodrich Company closed several manufacturing operations at the site, and most of the complex remained vacant until February 1988, when B.F. Goodrich announced plans to sell the vacant portions of the complex to the Covington Capital Corporation, a New York developer.&lt;ref name="nytimes880218"&gt;{{cite news| title=COMPANY NEWS; Goodrich to Sell Complex in Akron| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/18/business/company-news-goodrich-to-sell-complex-in-akron.html| agency=AP| work=The New York Times| date=18 February 1988| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, its first full year of operation, the new Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company generated almost US$2 billion in sales revenue, with profit of about US$35 million. However, the merger soon proved to be difficult. In June 1988, B.F. Goodrich sold its 50% stake to a group of investors led by [[Clayton &amp; Dubilier]], Inc. for US$225 million.&lt;ref name="nytimes883q"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes880624"&gt;{{cite news| title=Company News; Goodrich Outlook| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/business/company-news-goodrich-outlook.html| agency=[[Reuters]]| work=The New York Times| date=24 June 1988| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, B.F. Goodrich also received a warrant to purchase indirectly up to 7% of the equity in Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company.&lt;ref name="nytimes900503"&gt;{{cite news| title=COMPANY NEWS; Goodrich Gains In Uniroyal Sale |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/03/business/company-news-goodrich-gains-in-uniroyal-sale.html| agency=Reuters| work=The New York Times| date=3 May 1990| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in June 1988 as part of the sale deal, the new privately held tire company acquired publicly held debt of $415 million.&lt;ref name="nytimes891q"&gt;{{cite news| title=Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co reports earnings for Qtr to March 31 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/25/business/uniroyal-goodrich-tire-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html|  work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| date=25 April 1989| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company offered the debt securities in two parts through [[underwriter]]s led by [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] Inc. The two instruments were a US$250 million issue of 14 ⅛% notes due in 1998, and a US$165 million issue of 14 ½% subordinated [[debenture]]s due in 2000.&lt;ref name="nytimes880617"&gt;{{cite news| title=FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Uniroyal Goodrich Sets 2-Part offer| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/17/business/finance-new-issues-uniroyal-goodrich-sets-2-part-offer.html| work=The New York Times| date=17 June 1988| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the year 1988, Uniroyal Goodrich Tire posted sales revenue of US$2.2 billion, while profit declined to about a third of the prior year, less than US$12 million, which included an extraordinary credit of nearly US$2 million from the purchase of Canadian annuity pension obligations, and also a charge of over US$16 million from the June 1988 recapitalization resulting from the selloff by B.F. Goodrich.&lt;ref name="nytimes894q"&gt;{{cite news| title=Uniroyal Goodrich Tire reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/23/business/uniroyal-goodrich-tire-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html| work=The New York Times| date=23 February 1990| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1988, Michelin Group, a subsidiary of the French tire company [[Michelin]] et Cie ({{Euronext2|ML}}) proposed to acquire the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, and began acquiring a stake.&lt;ref name="UW"/&gt;

In 1989, Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company posted sales revenue that was up to almost US$2.3 billion, but profit was down by 90% to just over US$1 million, but included over US$9 million extraordinary credit that year for the ongoing Canadian annuity pension obligation purchase. 1989 year-end net income results were also hurt by increased interest expense of nearly US$31 million on the June 1988 debt recapitalization, and a US$29 million charge for deferred employee compensation related to the proposed purchase of the company by Michelin Group.&lt;ref name="nytimes894q"/&gt;

==Michelin Group==
By May 1990, Michelin Group completed its purchase of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company from Clayton &amp; Dubilier of New York. The deal was valued at about US$1.5 billion.&lt;ref name="nytimes890923"&gt;{{cite news| title=Michelin Group to Buy Uniroyal Goodrich in a Deal Worth $1.5 Billion| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-23/business/fi-571_1_uniroyal-goodrich-tire-co| author= Nancy Rivera Brooks| work=Los Angeles Times| publisher=LATimes.com| date=23 September 1989| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; B.F. Goodrich surrendered its 7% warrant to Michelin Group for US$32.5 million.&lt;ref name="nytimes900503"/&gt;

With the sale, B.F. Goodrich then exited the tire business and became the Goodrich Corporation to focus on building its chemicals and aerospace businesses through reinvestment and acquisitions.&lt;ref name="nytimes880624"/&gt;  Michelin Group continued to operate the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company as its tire manufacturing unit in the United States and Canada.

In January 1991, Michelin Group closed the historic Eau Claire, Wisconsin, plant, eliminating 1,350 positions. Later in 1991 it closed the tire-cord manufacturing plant in [[Lindsay, Ontario]], with 74 workers on August 30, 1991, due to high cost and two tire factories with 1,000 jobs in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], citing overcapacity.&lt;ref name="nytimes910606"&gt;{{cite news| title=COMPANY NEWS; Uniroyal-Goodrich| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/06/business/company-news-uniroyal-goodrich.html| agency=Reuters| work=The New York Times| date=6 June 1991| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1991, the Uniroyal tiger returned to national television after a 10-year hiatus, featured in a new 30-second spot created by Wyse Advertising of [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. The animated Uniroyal tiger had been a television advertising icon for the company through the 1970s. The new commercial appeared on ESPN and CNN sports-related programming, and also was run by Uniroyal dealers in local markets.&lt;ref name="nytimes910621"&gt;{{cite news| title=ADDENDA; New Campaigns| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/21/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-new-campaigns.html| work=The New York Times| author=Stuart Elliott| publisher=NYTimes.com| date=21 June 1991| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1993, Michelin North America employed 28,000 people at 18 plants, in South Carolina, Alabama, Oklahoma, Indiana, Nova Scotia and Ontario. In mid-1993, Michelin North America cut 2,500 of those jobs, which represented  about 9% of its work force in the United States and Canada, because of softening demand for tires.&lt;ref name="nytimes930624"&gt;{{cite news| title=COMPANY NEWS; Michelin to cut workforce in U.S. and Canada by 9%| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/24/business/company-news-michelin-to-cut-work-force-in-us-and-canada-by-9.html| work=The New York Times| date=24 June 1993| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010, the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire unit continued to operate with about 1,000 workers at its tire plant in [[Woodburn, Indiana]], and another plant in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]. Citing overcapacity in the North American tire market, the plant in [[Opelika, Alabama]], closed in 2009.
