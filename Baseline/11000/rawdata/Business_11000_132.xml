'''Alexey Viktorovich Kuzmichev''' or '''Kousmichoff''' (Russian: ''Алексей Викторович Кузьмичёв'') is a Russian businessman. He is one of the founders of the [[LetterOne|LetterOne Group]] (LetterOne). Currently, as well as being a member of the Board of Directors of LetterOne, Mr. Kuzmichev holds various positions at [[Alfa Group|Alfa Group Consortium]] including being a member of the Supervisory Board of Alfa Group Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supervisory Board|url=http://www.alfagroup.org/about-us/supervisory-board/member/alexey-kousmichoff/|website=Alfa Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kuzmichev is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys. He is one of the founders and controlling owners of investment conglomerate, Alfa Group. Kuzmichev indirectly controls about 10 percent of [[VimpelCom Ltd.|VimpelCom]], the world's sixth-biggest mobile phone operator; 18 percent of [[Alfa-Bank]], Russia's largest closely held bank; and 11 percent of [[X5 Retail Group]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.x5.ru/en/ |title=X5 Retail Group |publisher=X5.ru |date=2014-08-14 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Kuzmichev sold his stake in energy venture [[TNK-BP]] to state-run oil company [[Rosneft]] for $2.5 billion. Forbes magazine rates Kuzmichev as the 138th world's richest person (2013) with a fortune estimated at $8.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/alexei-kuzmichev/ |title=Alexei Kuzmichev |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloomberg’s Wealth Ranking Kuzmichev is the 148th richest person globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9627351/TNK-BP-deal-makes-Dr-Vekselberg-richest-man-in-Russia.html |title=TNK-BP deal makes Dr Vekselberg richest man in Russia |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzmichev is married to Russian philanthropist Svetlana Kuzmicheva-Uspenskaya, founder and director of Project Perpetual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership|url=http://www.projectperpetual.org/project/leadership|website=Project Perpetual|access-date=4 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208124830/http://www.projectperpetual.org/project/leadership|archive-date=8 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have one son.  

==Overview==
Kuzmichev was born in 1962 in Kirov, Russia. Between 1980 and 1982 he served in the army on the Soviet-Chinese border as a radio operator. During this time he joined the Communist party. In 1983, he enrolled in the [[Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys]] where he met his future business partners, [[Mikhail Fridman]] and [[German Khan]]. In 1988 Kuzmichev, Fridman and Khan, along with Mikhail Alfimov, founded Alfa Photo, which specialized in the import of photo chemicals. Later, Kuzmichev convinced his partners to diversify into the export business. Thus in 1998 Alfa Eco was founded. This venture would become the basis of [[Alfa Group|Alfa Group Consortium]]. (In 2005, Alfa Eco was rebranded as A1).

==Alfa Group==
Alfa Group’s portfolio includes the largest commercial bank in Russia, [[Alfa-Bank]], (with affiliates in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and the Netherlands/Amsterdam Trade Bank); international telecom company [[VimpelCom]] (the sixth largest mobile network operator in the world by subscribers as of April, 2012); as well as holding shares in Turkish telecommunications company [[Turkcell]]. Until April 2012, Alfa Group owned 25 percent of Russian cell phone operator [[MegaFon]]; it sold its share for $5.2 billion. Alfa also has stakes in Russian retailer X5 Retail Group,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Rosvodokanal|Rosvodokanal Group]]; and insurance company, Alfa-Strakhovanie Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfastrah.ru/en/company/ |title=About company |publisher=Alfastrah.ru |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzmichev owns over 18 percent of the consortium’s joint assets and is a member of the board of directors of Alfa Finance Holdings. The Group’s major transactions include TNK oil company privatization, which later became a part of [[TNK-BP]] venture, Russia’s third-largest oil producer. In March 2013 Alfa Group and its joint partners AAR Consortium sold 50 percent of [[TNK-BP]] to Russian oil company [[Rosneft]].

===Location of operations===
Kuzmichev has worked in Europe, the former Soviet Union republics, Venezuela, Nigeria, Iran and Iraq. Speaking to Russian newspaper Vedomosti in 2002 following the reduction of Russian oil sales to the EU, he claimed market opportunities had been reduced for independent traders due to an increasingly globalised business in raw materials such as oil, metals and food stuffs.

===Russian export blend crude oil===
Kuzmichev is responsible for overseeing Alfa Group’s international trading operations. He has criticised the existing methods of pricing of the Russian Export Blend Crude Oil (REBC) and became a vocal proponent of detachment of its price from BFOE (Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk). Kuzmichev has proposed that REBCO should be traded on an internationally recognised commodity exchange to achieve fair and transparent pricing. Through the continued efforts of Kuzmichev, together with Expertica Group, a deliverable futures contract for REBCO was launched on NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange, now part of the CME Group) in 2006, followed by a financially settled futures contract in 2008.

===Sinking of The Prestige===
Crown Resources, a European oil and commodity trading arm of Alfa Group, of which Kuzmichev is chairman, was the owner of the oil cargo on [[Prestige oil spill|The Prestige vessel]], which sank near the coast of Galicia, Spain in 2002. The case concerning The Prestige centred on the negligence of the vessel’s owner and was completed in July 2013. No accusations or financial claims were brought against Crown Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Govan |first=Fiona |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/10447185/Prestige-oil-tanker-sinking-Spanish-court-finds-nobody-responsible.html |title=Prestige oil tanker sinking: Spanish court finds nobody responsible |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LetterOne Group==
Mr Kuzmichev is one of the original founders of the [[LetterOne|LetterOne Group]]. The LetterOne Group (LetterOne) is an international investment business based in [[Luxembourg]]. Its investments are focused on the telecoms, technology and energy sectors through its two main business units, [[L1 Energy]] and L1 Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexey Kuzmichev|url=http://www.letterone.com/about-us/leadership-and-governance/board-members/alexey-kuzmichev}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite recently being required by the Government to sell their North Sea oil and gas fields, LetterOne have reportedly been told in a letter from a senior UK official that this ‘is not a judgement on the suitability of LetterOne’s owners to control these or any other assets in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ineos targets further North Sea assets in wake of $750m deal|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2d178112-7008-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F2d178112-7008-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044.html&amp;_i_referer=&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app#axzz3uxC5UJg2|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Babylon Project==
The Babylon Project was founded by Kuzmichov in 2002. It is aimed at establishing an international foundation to preserve the ancient treasures of Iraq. Kuzmichev asked Russia, the U.S. and other countries to join in a cultural initiative to safeguard the ruins of Babylon, near the town of Hillah, as well as participate in restoration of the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad, which suffered heavy looting in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/robbing-the-cradle-of-civilization/a-835730 |title=Robbing the Cradle of Civilization &amp;#124; Europe &amp;#124; DW.COM &amp;#124; 18.04.2003 |publisher=Dw.de |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to ongoing unrest in Iraq, the project is currently frozen.

==Charity Work==
Mr Kuzmichev’s wife, Svetlana Kuzmicheva-Uspenskaya, is founder and director of Project Perpetual – a group which harnesses the contributions of the world’s leading contemporary artists and global influencers to raise funds and facilitate advocacy for children in peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.projectperpetual.org/mission/|website=Project Perpetual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Kuzmichev’s role in the charity was to be part of the lead sponsorship of the 2013 Global Leadership Awards Dinner at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Global Leadership Dinner|url=http://www.unausa.org/about-us/global-leadership-awards/2013-global-leadership-dinner|website=The United Nations Association of the United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project is partnered with the United Nations Foundation

The '''American Chamber of Commerce Japan''' ('''ACCJ''') is a non-profit business organization consisting mainly of executives from American companies.  Currently, the ACCJ has members that represent over 1,000 companies with offices located in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka.  Working closely with the governments of the United States and Japan, business organizations and others, the ACCJ actively promotes activities that help achieve its mission of further developing commerce between the United States and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ: About the ACCJ|url=http://www.accj.or.jp/en/about/about-the-accj|publisher=ACCJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The  ACCJ was established in 1948 by representatives of 40 American companies. Originally, the ACCJ had six committees and nine board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ: History|url=http://www.ajstokyo.org/ajs_j/samuel_h_kidder-j.html|accessdate=15 May 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223152013/http://www.ajstokyo.org/ajs_j/samuel_h_kidder-j.html|archive-date=2013-02-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCJ claims to be Japan’s most influential foreign business organization, and serves as the primary forum for the foreign business community in Japan to identify and pursue shared interests and goals. There are more than sixty Chamber committees, subcommittees, task forces, and advisory councils that cover such diverse areas as: financial services, corporate social responsibility, marketing, independent business, healthcare services, e-business, transportation and logistics, legal services, the travel industry, and human resource management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ: Committees|url=http://www.accj.or.jp/en/about/committees/accj-committees|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

The ACCJ committees combined hold over 500 programs annually, and these events are exclusively attended by ACCJ members and their accompanied guests. The backbone of the annual agenda is hundreds of engagements with leading experts and shapers of policy and business trends in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APCAC|url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/noda/statement/201203/02summit_e.html|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers are drawn from the ranks of global business leaders, top U.S. and Japanese government officials, industry experts, scholars and pop culture icons. Former speakers Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe; JP Morgan Japan Director of Research, Jesper Koll; [[Rakuten]] Inc CEO, [[Hiroshi Mikitani]]; [[General Electric]] CEO, [[Jeffrey R. Immelt]]; [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] CEO, [[Tom J. Donohue]]; former Governor of California, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]; U.S. Department of Energy Secretary, [[Steven Chu]]; [[Department of Transportation|Transportation]] Secretary, [[Ray LaHood]]; [[Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Secretary, [[Janet Napolitano]]; [[U.S. Ambassador to Japan]], [[Caroline Kennedy]], and many others have chosen the ACCJ as their forum for addressing Japan’s international business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ:Events|url=http://www.accj.or.jp/user/200/Events/|publisher=ACCJ|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary Locke|url=http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2010/11/10/secretary-locke-addresses-american-chamber-commerce-tokyo-japan|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==

As a key stakeholder in the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan, the ACCJ works to influence the discussions that frame policy in both countries.  The ACCJ issues its official positions on policy issues in Viewpoint position papers, white papers, public comments and other reports.  The ultimate goal of these policy positions and the advocacy carried out to communicate them and promote their implementation is to further the mission of the ACCJ to improve the business environment in Japan for Chamber members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ:Advocacy|url=http://www.tokyoweekender.com/2007/06/accj/|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ACCJ Board of Governors (as of 2018)==

Leadership positions within the ACCJ are held by elected officials who represent top-level Japanese businesspeople and expats in Japan from the U.S. and around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCJ Leadership|url=http://www.accj.or.jp/en/about/leadership|accessdate=2 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her father's affair with British socialite Suzanna McQuiston, she is a half-sister of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[aristocrat]] [[Emma Thynn, Viscountess Weymouth]].&lt;ref name="3R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=24 August 2018 | url=http://thenationonlineng.net/i-always-wanted-to-be-a-broadcaster/ |title=‘I always wanted to be a broadcaster’ |

==Career==
After medical school, she was recruited by [[Goldman Sachs]]. She started work in the Investment Banking division of the firm, based in their offices in [[London]], focusing on mergers, acquisitions and corporate finance. She worked there for three years.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; Even though Jadesimi is better known as a businesswoman, she never intended to leave the medical field and pursue another career. She was offered a job by Goldman Sachs while working with a firm in Oxford. After working there for three years, she never went back to the hospital or her previous job and instead went on to pursue an MBA at Stanford.&lt;ref name="5R"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sinmisolany.com/2016/08/16/amy-jadesimi/ |title=Amy Jadesimi, Managing Director of the Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base (LADOL) |access-date=24 August 2018 |date=16 August 2016 |publisher=Sinmisolany.com |author=Sinmisola Nojimu-Yusuf |location=Lagos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduation from Stanford University, she interned for one year at [https://brait.investoreports.com/about-us/ Brait SE] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], where she worked in the private equity division, as a transaction executive. In 2004, she relocated back to her homeland and joined LADOL, the logistics firm that her father started in 2001. Over time, she rose through the ranks and in 2009, she was appointed by the board as the Chief Executive Officer of the business.&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; Through LADOL, Jadesimi joined the Venture Strategies for Health and Development (VSHD) organization where she works with others Nigerian doctors and birth attendants to reduce the high rate of maternal mortality in Nigeria. Upon addressing the many cases, Jadesimi and other practitioners noticed that the drugs used to help reduce the maternal mortality were expensive; therefore, not many pregnant women could afford them. The VSHD came up with a drug that was well suited for maternal mortality and was better for the market. Under Jadesimi's supervision, the organization partnered with a leading pharmaceutical company in Nigeria, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, to distribute the drugs through Nigeria.&lt;ref name="6R"&gt;{{cite web|title=People: Amy Jadesimi |author=Oreoluwa Atobatele |url=https://the234project.com/people/nigeria/amy-jadesimi/ |publisher=The234Project.Com |location=Austin, Texas |access-date=24 August 2018 |date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond LADOL, she is on the Prince's Trust International global advisory board, a founding commissioner of the Business and Sustainable Development and Commission and a Forbes contributor.&lt;ref name="7R"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Philanthropreneurshipforum.com | url=https://www.philanthropreneurshipforum.com/speaker/dr-amy-jadesimi/ |title=Biography of Dr. Amy Jadesimi, Managing Director and CEO, LADOL |date=2016 |access-date=24 August 2018 | author=Philanthropreneurshipforum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehicles of creating artificial demand can include [[mass media]] advertising, which can create demand for [[good (economics)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]], [[policy|political policies]] or [[political platform|platforms]], and other entities.

Another example of artificial demand can be seen in [[penny stock]] [[Spam (e-mail)|spam]]. After purchasing a large number of shares of an extremely low-value stock, the spammer attempts to create artificial demand by implementing a spam-based [[guerrilla marketing]] strategy.

'''Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta''' {{IPA-it|ˈfabbrika ˈdarmi ˈpjɛtro beˈretta|}} (literally, "Pietro Beretta Arms Factory") is a [[Privately held company|privately held]] Italian [[firearms manufacturing company]] operating in several countries. Its firearms are used worldwide for a variety of civilian, law enforcement, and military purposes. Sporting arms account for three-quarters of sales; Beretta is also known for marketing shooting clothes and accessories. Founded in the 16th century, Beretta is the oldest active manufacturer of firearm components in the world.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt; In 1526 its inaugural product was [[arquebus]] barrels; by all accounts Beretta-made barrels equipped the Venetian fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571.&lt;ref name=Suro/&gt; Beretta has supplied weapons for every major European war since 1650.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Territorio di Brescia e di Crema 1500s.jpg|thumb|16th Century map by [[Giovanni Antonio Magini]] of the Province of Brescia. Val Trompia is in the center. Map is oriented with West at the top.]]
[[File:Archivio di Stato di Venezia.jpg|thumb|Venetian State Archive building]]

[[Val Trompia]], a northern Italian river valley in the [[Province of Brescia]], [[Lombardy]], has been mined for iron ore since the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], Val Trompia was known for its ironworks; after the [[Renaissance]] it came to be a center for the manufacture of weapons.&lt;ref name=Alderson/&gt; By the mid 16th century Val Trompia had forty ironworks, supplied by fifty mines and eight smelters. The birthplace of Beretta is in the village of [[Gardone Val Trompia|Gardone]] located on the banks of the [[Mella (river)|Mella]] river, in the middle of Val Trompia (i.e., between the upper valley and lower valley).&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

The Beretta forge was in operation from about 1500,&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; although the first documented transaction is a contract dated October 3, 1526 for 185 [[arquebus]] barrels, for which the Republic of Venice was to pay 296 ducats to ''Maestro di Canne'' (master [[Barrel (firearms)|gun-barrel]] maker) [[:it:Bartolomeo Beretta|Bartolomeo Beretta]] {{it icon}}.&lt;ref name=Alderson/&gt; The original account document for the order of those barrels is now stored in the [[:it:Archivio di Stato di Venezia|''Archivio di Stato di Venezia'']] {{it icon}} in [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=Story/&gt; By the end of the 17th century, Beretta had become the second largest gun barrel maker in Gardone.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

Under the guild system, the knowledge of gun barrel fabrication that was bequeathed to Jacopo (1520/25 – …) from his father Bartolomeo (1490 – 1565/68)&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; was then passed on to his own son Giovannino (1550 – post 1577), and to his grandson Giovan Antonio (1577 – post 1649)&lt;ref name=Since /&gt; and so on until guilds were abolished by [[Napoleon]] after his conquest of Venetian Republic in 1797.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

Beretta has been owned by the same family for almost five hundred years&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; and is a founding member of [[Henokiens|Les Henokiens]], an association of bicentenary companies that are family owned and operated.&lt;ref name=Henokiens/&gt;

In 1918, the [[Beretta Model 1918]], one of the first [[submachine gun]]s in the world, was fielded by the Italian army. Beretta manufactured [[rifle]]s and [[pistol]]s for the Italian military until the [[Armistice with Italy|1943 Armistice between Italy and the Allied forces]] during [[World War II]]. With the Wehrmacht's control of northern Italy, the Germans seized Beretta and continued producing arms until the 1945 German surrender in Italy.&lt;ref name=Alderson/&gt; In that time, the quality of the exterior finish of the weapons diminished and was much more inferior to both the pre-war and mid-war weapons, but their operation remained excellent.&lt;ref name=International/&gt; The last shipment of [[Type I Rifle]]s left Venice for Japan in a [[U-boat]] in 1942.

After World War II, Beretta was actively involved in repairing the American [[M1 Garand]]s given to Italy by the U.S. Beretta modified the M1 into the [[Beretta BM-59]] rifle, which is similar to the [[M14 rifle|M14]] [[battle rifle]]; armourers consider the BM-59 rifle to be superior to the M14 rifle in some ways, because it is more accurate under certain conditions.&lt;ref name=GunsMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case82R/&gt;

After the war, Beretta continued to develop firearms for the Italian Army and police, as well as the civilian market.&lt;ref name=McClellan/&gt;

In the 1980s, Beretta enjoyed a renewal of popularity in North America after its [[Beretta 92]] pistol was selected as the service handgun for the [[United States Army]] under the designation of "[[M9 pistol]]".&lt;ref name=Suro/&gt;

In the 1970s, Beretta also started a manufacturing plant in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. A contract between Beretta and the Brazilian government was signed, under which Beretta produced Beretta 92s for the [[Brazilian Army]] until 1980. Later this plant was sold to [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Taurus]], who continues to manufacture the Beretta 92 under the name of [[Taurus PT92|PT92]] using the same tools and labour which Beretta used, without the need for a license from Beretta, since the design is based on the original Beretta 92, for which the patents are expired.&lt;ref name=Humphries/&gt;

Beretta acquired several domestic competitors (notably [[Benelli (firearms)|Benelli]] and [[Franchi (firearms)|Franchi]]) and some foreign companies (notably in Finland) in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:M9-pistolet.jpg|thumb|Beretta M9]]
Today, Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta (Beretta S.p.A) is run by Franco Gussalli Beretta, President and CEO.

The traditional father-to-son Beretta dynasty was interrupted when Ugo Gussalli Beretta assumed the firm's control; uncles Carlo and Giuseppe Beretta were childless; Ugo married into the Beretta family and adopted the last name Beretta. His sons are now direct descendants through their mother's side of the family.

Beretta is known for its broad range of firearms: side-by-side [[shotguns]], over-and-under shotguns, hunting [[rifles]], [[express rifle]]s, [[assault rifles]], [[submachine guns]], lever- and  bolt-action rifles, single- and double-action [[revolvers]] and semi-automatic  [[pistols]].&lt;ref name=AR-May-15/&gt; The parent company, Beretta Holding, also owns Beretta USA, [[Benelli (firearms)|Benelli]], [[Franchi (firearms)|Franchi]], [[SAKO]], [[Stoeger Industries|Stoeger]], [[SAKO|Tikka]], [[Uberti]], and the Burris Optics company.

The model [[Beretta 92FS]] is the primary [[side arm]] of the [[United States Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], designated the [[M9 pistol]].&lt;ref name=AR-Feb-15/&gt; In 1985, Beretta was chosen after a controversial competition to produce the M9, winning a contract for 500,000 pistols.&lt;ref name=SI-Jul-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Machinist/&gt; A condition of the original agreement was domestic fabrication of the M9.&lt;ref name=Valsecchi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;  After complaints from servicemen, the Beretta M9 lost the U.S. Army sidearm contract in January 2017 to the 9mm version of the [[SIG Sauer P320]].&lt;ref name=YahooNews/&gt;

'''''Bonsai Barber''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Zoonami]] for [[Wii]]. It was released in North America on March 30, 2009, in Europe on August 7, 2009 and in Japan on April 6, 2010.

==Overview==

The game places players in the role of a [[barber]] who must groom and style the foliage of their plant, fruit and vegetable customers in similar manner to the art of [[bonsai]] pruning. Using the [[Wii Remote]], the player uses tools such as scissors, hair clippers, combs and hairspray to work on the requests of up to five customers per day and try to achieve a professional five star rated cut for each.

The game also features unlockable modes and rewards as well as an achievement system, and players will be able to send photos of their stylings to friends via [[WiiConnect24]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.ign.com/articles/967/967075p1.html IGN First Look: Bonsai Barber]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Three prototypes of the game were developed on and off by a team of two people before the game moved into full development. In total, development for ''Bonsai Barber'' stretched over a period of two and a quarter years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4107/from_me_to_wii_martin_hollis_.php?page=4 From Me to Wii: Martin Hollis' Journey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[IGN]] commended the tight, responsive controls and the quirky nature of the game, but also called it a pricey one trick pony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.ign.com/articles/968/968200p1.html IGN review]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' loved the concept and the humor and called it "an enjoyable, idiosyncratic experience".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=10501 ONM review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business performance management''' is a set of [[performance management]] and analytic processes that enables the [[management]] of an [[organization's performance]] to achieve one or more pre-selected goals. Synonyms for "business performance management" include '''"corporate performance management (CPM)"'''&lt;ref&gt;"Introducing the CPM Suites Magic Quadrant", Lee Geishecker and [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2 October 2002, www.gartner.com, M-17-4718&lt;/ref&gt; and '''"enterprise performance management"'''.&lt;ref&gt;

Business performance management is contained within approaches to [[business process management]].&lt;ref&gt;vom Brocke, J. &amp; Rosemann, M. (2010), [http://www.bpm-handbook.com Handbook on Business Process Management: Strategic Alignment, Governance, People and Culture] (International Handbooks on Information Systems). Berlin: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

Business performance management has three main activities:
# selection of goals
# [[data consolidation|consolidation]] of measurement information relevant to an organization’s progress against these goals
# interventions made by managers in light of this information with a view to improving future performance against these goals

Although presented here sequentially, typically all three activities will run concurrently, with interventions by managers affecting the choice of goals, the measurement information monitored, and the activities being undertaken by the organization.

Because business performance management activities in large organizations often involve the collection and reporting of large volumes of data, many software vendors, particularly those offering [[business intelligence]] tools, market products intended to assist in this process. As a result of this marketing effort, business performance management is often incorrectly understood as an activity that necessarily relies on software systems to work, and many definitions of business performance management explicitly suggest software as being a definitive component of the approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmmag.net/magazine/article.html?articleID=13966 BPM Mag, What is BPM?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212062646/http://www.bpmmag.net/magazine/article.html?articleID=13966 |date=December 12, 2006 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, business performance management has been strongly influenced by the rise of the [[Balanced Scorecard|balanced scorecard]] framework. It is common for managers to use the balanced scorecard framework to clarify the goals of an organization, to identify how to track them, and to structure the mechanisms by which interventions will be triggered. These steps are the same as those that are found in BPM, and as a result, balanced scorecard is often used as the basis for business performance management activity with organizations.{{Citation needed|date = September 2010}}

{{as of | 2009 | alt = In the past}}, owners have sought to drive strategy down and across their organizations, transform these strategies into actionable metrics, and use analytics to expose the cause-and-effect relationships that, if understood, could give insight into decision-making.

== History ==
Reference to non-[[business]] performance management occurs{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} in [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]''. Sun Tzu claims that to succeed in war, one should have full knowledge of one's own strengths and weaknesses as well as those of one's enemies. Lack of either set of knowledge might result in defeat.&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/art-of-war/attack-by-stratagem/zh?en=on#n20929  paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels between the challenges in business and those of war include{{Citation needed | date=January 2009}}:

* collecting data - both internal and external
* discerning patterns and meaning in the data (analyzing)
* responding to the resultant information

Prior to the start of the [[Information Age]] in the late 20th century, businesses sometimes took the trouble to laboriously collect data from non-automated sources. As they lacked computing resources to properly analyze the data, they often made commercial decisions primarily on the basis of [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

As businesses started automating more and more systems, more and more data became available. However, collection often remained a challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for data exchange or due to incompatibilities between systems. Reports on the data gathered sometimes took months to generate. Such reports allowed informed long-term strategic decision-making. However, short-term tactical decision-making often continued to rely on intuition.

In 1989 [[Howard Dresner]], a research analyst at [[Gartner]], popularized "[[business intelligence]]" (BI) as an umbrella term to describe a set of concepts and methods to improve business decision-making by using fact-based support systems. Performance management builds on a foundation of BI, but marries it to the planning-and-control cycle of the enterprise with enterprise planning, consolidation, and modeling capabilities.

Increasing standards, automation, and technologies have led to vast amounts of data becoming available. [[Data warehouse]] technologies have allowed the building of repositories to store this data. Improved [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] and [[enterprise application integration]] tools have increased the timely collecting of data. [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] reporting technologies have allowed faster generation of new reports which analyze the data. {{As of | 2010}}, business intelligence has become the art of sieving through large amounts of data, extracting useful information and turning that information into actionable knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Definition and scope ==
Business performance management consists of a set of management and analytic processes, supported by technology, that enable businesses to define strategic goals and then measure and manage performance against those goals. Core business performance management processes include [[Financial planning (business)|financial planning]], operational planning, business modeling, consolidation and reporting, analysis, and monitoring of [[key performance indicator]]s linked to strategy.

Business performance management involves [[data consolidation|consolidation of data]] from various sources, querying, and analysis of the data, and putting the results into practice.

== Frameworks ==
Various frameworks for implementing business performance management exist. The discipline gives companies a top-down framework by which to align planning and execution, strategy and tactics, and [[business-unit]] and enterprise objectives. Reactions may include the [[Six Sigma]] strategy, [[balanced scorecard]], [[activity-based costing]] (ABC), [[OKR | Objectives and Key Results]] (OKR), [[Total Quality Management]], [[Economic value added|economic value-add]], [[integrated strategic measurement]] and [[Theory of Constraints]].

== Metrics and key performance indicators ==
Some of the areas from which bank management may gain knowledge by using business performance management include:

* customer-related numbers:
** new customers acquired
** status of existing customers
** attrition of customers (including breakup by reason for attrition)
* turnover generated by segments of the customers - possibly using demographic filters
* outstanding balances held by segments of customers and terms of payment - possibly using demographic filters
* collection of bad debts within customer relationships
* [[demographic analysis]] of individuals (potential customers) applying to become customers, and the levels of approval, rejections and pending numbers
* delinquency analysis of customers behind on payments
* [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] of customers by demographic segments and segmentation of customers by profitability
* [[marketing campaign|campaign]] management
* [[Real time (media)|real-time]] [[Dashboard (business)|dashboard]] on key operational metrics
** [[overall equipment effectiveness]]
* [[clickstream]] analysis on a website
* key product portfolio trackers
* [[marketing channel|marketing-channel]] analysis
* [[sales]]-data analysis by product segments
* [[callcenter]] metrics

Though the above list describes what a bank might monitor, it could refer to a telephone company or to a similar service-sector company.

Items of generic importance include:

# consistent and correct KPI-related data providing insights into operational aspects of a company
# timely availability of KPI-related data
# KPIs designed to directly reflect the efficiency and effectiveness of a business
# information presented in a format which aids decision-making for management and decision-makers
# ability to discern patterns or trends from organized information

Business performance management integrates the company's processes with [[customer relationship management|CRM]] or {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} [[enterprise resource planning|ERP]]. Companies should become better able to gauge [[customer satisfaction]], control customer trends and influence shareholder value.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Application software types==
People working in business intelligence have developed tools that ease the work of business performance management, especially when the business-intelligence task involves gathering and analyzing large amounts of unstructured [[data]].

Tool categories commonly used for business performance management include:

* [[MOLAP]] &amp;mdash; Multidimensional online analytical processing, sometimes simply called "analytics" (based on [[dimensional analysis]] and the so-called "hypercube" or "cube")
* [[Balanced scorecard|scorecarding]], [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboarding]] and [[data visualization]]
* [[data warehouse]]s
* [[document warehouse]]s
* [[text mining]]
* DM &amp;mdash; [[data mining]]
&lt;!--  * BPM — Business performance management --&gt;
* BPO &amp;mdash; business performance optimization
* EPM &amp;mdash; [[enterprise performance management]]
* EIS &amp;mdash; [[executive information system]]s
* DSS &amp;mdash; [[decision support system]]s
* MIS &amp;mdash; [[management information system]]s
* SEMS &amp;mdash; [[strategic enterprise management]] software
* EOI &amp;mdash; [[Operational intelligence]] Enterprise Operational Intelligence Software

== Design and implementation ==
Questions asked when implementing a business performance management program include:

* '''Goal-alignment queries'''
:Determine the short- and medium-term purpose of the program. What strategic goal(s) of the organization will the program address? What organizational mission/vision does it relate to? A hypothesis needs to be crafted that details how this initiative will eventually improve results / performance (i.e. a [[strategy map]]).
* '''Baseline queries'''
:Assess current information-gathering competency. Does the organization have the capability to monitor important sources of information? What data is being collected and how is it being stored? What are the statistical parameters of this data, e.g., how much random variation does it contain? Is this being measured?
* '''Cost and risk queries'''
:Estimate the financial consequences of a new BI initiative. Assess the cost of the present operations and the increase in costs associated with the BPM initiative. What is the risk that the initiative will fail? This risk assessment should be converted into a financial metric and included in the planning.
* '''Customer and stakeholder queries'''
:Determine who will benefit from the initiative and who will pay. Who has a stake in the current procedure? What kinds of customers / stakeholders will benefit directly from this initiative? Who will benefit indirectly? What quantitative / qualitative benefits follow? Is the specified initiative the best or only way to increase satisfaction for all kinds of customers? How will customer benefits be monitored? What about employees, shareholders, and distribution channel members?
* '''Metrics-related queries'''
:Information requirements need [[operationalization]] into clearly defined metrics. Decide which metrics to use for each piece of information being gathered. Are these the best metrics and why? How many metrics need to be tracked? If this is a large number (it usually is), what kind of system can track them? Are the metrics standardized, so they can be [[benchmarking|benchmarked]] against performance in other organizations? What are the industry standard metrics available?
* '''Measurement methodology-related queries'''
:Establish a methodology or a procedure to determine the best (or acceptable) way of measuring the required metrics. How frequently will data be collected? Are there any industry standards for this? Is this the best way to do the measurements? How do we know that?
* '''Results-related queries'''
:Monitor the BPM program to ensure that it meets objectives. The program itself may require adjusting. The program should be tested for accuracy, [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[Validity (statistics)|validity]]. How can it be demonstrated that the BI initiative, and not something else, contributed to a change in results? How much of the change was probably random?

'''''Cadillac Man''''' is a 1990 [[Comedy film|comedy]] film directed by [[Roger Donaldson]], starring [[Robin Williams]] and [[Tim Robbins]].

==Plot==
[[Queens]] [[car salesman]] Joey O'Brien ([[Robin Williams]]) must deal with the ever-increasing pressures in his life: he has an ex-wife demanding [[alimony]], a daughter who is missing, a married [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] ([[Fran Drescher]]) and a single mistress ([[Lori Petty]]) who are both desperately in love with him, and a two-day deadline to either sell twelve cars or lose his job.  In addition, he has an outstanding loan to a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] [[crime boss|don]] which he must either quickly repay, or lose his life.

On the day of the big dealership car sale (and the final day of O'Brien's deadline), the car dealership is taken [[hostage]] by an [[AK-47]]-toting motorcyclist ([[Tim Robbins]]) who believes his wife ([[Annabella Sciorra]]) is cheating on him. Joey manages to talk the man out of doing any harm to the other hostages, as police surround the dealership.  Without realizing that the assailant's gun is not loaded, the police wound him after most of the hostages have already been released which prompts Joey to promise to remain with him while he recovers. The crisis solves all of Joey's problems: his mistresses learn of each other and dump him, his daughter returns, his job is secure, the Mafia don (whose son was among the hostages) forgives his debt, and he begins to reconcile with his ex-wife.

Eventually Boois supported the unity of the tribe by reconciling with fellow former Karas governor [[Stephanus Goliath]] early in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.com.na/news/full-story/archive/2011/february/article/boois-and-goliath-bury-the-hatchet/ Boois and Goliath bury the hatchet] ''[[The Namibian]]'', 25 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==
According to transparency documents released in 2003 while Boois was a member of the National Assembly, the Berseba-native is a director of Kaiseb Fishing. He also owns 8% of the shares in the company. He also owns over 15,000 shares in Southern Namibia Hake Fishing Industries alongside fellow SWAPO politician [[Willem Konjore]]. He also owns a restaurant and hotel in ǁKaras Region.&lt;ref name=NID/&gt;

}}An '''employee assistance program''' (EAP) is an [[employee benefit]] program that assists employees with personal problems and/or work-related problems that may impact their [[job performance]], [[health]], mental and emotional [[well-being]]. EAPs generally offer free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services for employees and their household members. EAP counselors also work in a consultative role with managers and supervisors to address employee and organizational challenges and needs.  Many corporations, academic institution and/or government agencies are active in helping organizations prevent and cope with workplace violence, trauma, and other emergency response situations. There is a variety of support programs offered for employees.   Even though EAPs are mainly aimed at work-related problems, there are a variety of programs that can assist with problems outside of the workplace. EAPs have grown over the years, and are more desirable economically and socially.

== History ==

=== Early formation ===
EAPs have been traced back to the late 1930s, and were formed out of programs that dealt with occupational alcoholism. During a time when drinking on the job was the norm, people began to notice the effects it had on job performance and productivity. This became a major issue for industrial jobs and would become the main focus for correction with job-based alcoholism programs. By 1939, the [[Alcoholics Anonymous|Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)]] movement had begun to spread throughout the Midwestern and Northeastern United States.&lt;ref name="Richard, Hutchinson 2009"&gt;(Richard, Hutchinson, Emener, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; People in “recovery" began to eagerly share their experiences with other workers. This would be the start of the EAP movement. Businesses also started to see the effectiveness of the programs through the rehabilitation of their workers and the rise of productivity. These improvements sparked the thought of what other types of problems this program could address.

=== Taking shape ===
In 1962, The Kemper Group introduced a program to address alcoholic rehabilitation and later expanded the program to address the needs of the families of their employees as well.  Including the families broaden the programs services to deal with marital, emotional, financial, legal, and drug abuse problems.&lt;ref name="Richard, Hutchinson 2009"/&gt; In 1969, Senator Harold Hughes would introduce a bill called The Hughes Act. Sen. Hughes felt that there was a great lack of federal and state involvement in the treatment of alcoholism. In 1970, Congress would pass the [http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/about-niaaa/our-work/history-niaaa Federal Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention Treatment and Rehabilitation Act] creating the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA)]]. States would then soon begin to follow suit and denounce public intoxication and began treating alcoholism as a disease. The [http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/ NIAAA] priority would be to begin researching and treating alcoholism. They were also focused on providing states with grants to hire and train EAP specialist.

In the 1970s, the Occupational Alcoholism Bureau formed by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence|National Council on Alcoholism (NCA)]] and the Association of Labor and Management Administrators and Consultants on Alcoholism (ALMACA) helped to spread EAP concepts. They did this by distributing information, giving conferences and seminars, increasing the knowledge of professionals and the community. A number of treatment centers would also grow after the passing of the Hughes Act. These centers have EAP specialist on site to help in the rehabilitation processes. It is not known the exact amount of treatment centers in the United States.

=== Economic crisis cutbacks ===
Employee Assistance Programs would see a significant shift during the economic crisis of the 1980s. During this time, the government was forced to create cutbacks for programs. This would cause for mental health public agencies, treatment centers, and private counseling firms to survive by partnering with industry wanting to enter the EAP field. This though would also cause the effectiveness of the programs to come into question. The cutbacks began to affect the training of the EAP specialist and their effectiveness. The situations of workers also began to change at this time. People were also having to wait in lines, and were having to search for work due to the crisis.

=== Post September 11 ===
In most recent years, the services provided by EAPs have changed in their direction. With events occurring nationally and around the world has caused for EAPs to rise and the need for them greater in the United States. EAPs have also been affected by technology, terrorism attacks, natural disasters, disabilities act, and workplace violence.&lt;ref name="Richard, Hutchinson 2009"/&gt; Since the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], EAP specialists have become more involved in incident debriefing and implementing plans during emergencies &lt;ref&gt;(Richard, Hutchinson, Emener, 2009 &amp; Masi 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Providers began to report more on the workforce experiencing [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)]], and an increase in stress and depression.&lt;ref&gt;(Richard, Hutchinson, Emener, 2009 &amp; Masi 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The continued threat of terrorism, people are reporting that they are more anxious about the thought of an attack occurring again.

== Benefits ==

Some studies indicate that offering EAPs may result in various benefits for employers, including lower medical costs, reduced turnover and absenteeism, and higher employee productivity.&lt;ref name="Hargrave"&gt;[http://www.choixdecarriere.com/pdf/6573/2010/HargraveHiattAlexanderShaffer2008.pdf EAP Treatment Impact on Presenteeism and Absenteeism: Implications for Return on Investment, Hargrave et Al.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attridge"&gt;[http://www.easna.org/documents/EASNAResearchNotesNo10ValueModelMAY2010102209.pdf EAP Effectiveness and ROI, Attridge et Al.]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of these studies question the scientific validity of their findings, noting small sample sizes, lack of experimental control groups, and lack of standardized measures as primary concerns. Proponents, however, argue that the consistency of positive findings across studies in different service sectors denote at least some positive effect of programs, even if the most effective components of such programs have not been determined.&lt;ref name="Attridge" /&gt; EAPs may also provide other services to employers, such as supervisory consultations, support to troubled work teams, training and education programs, and critical incident services.

The provision of employee assistance services has established business benefits, including increased productivity of employees (termed "presenteeism") and decreased [[absenteeism]].&lt;ref name="Hargrave" /&gt; Employees typically have access to an EAP hotline 24 hours a day, so there is no need to wait to seek assistance. If an appointment with a medical professional or counselor is necessary, the employee can arrange to see one in just a few days. Because the employee can call anytime, they do not have to worry about calling from a work phone. You may also be able to minimize the cost of your health insurance plan, because employees can use the EAP to ward off stress-related illnesses, meaning fewer trips to the doctor.

Small businesses can especially benefit from EAP programs.  Even though they may have fewer employees and may not see the need to implement an EAP program, small business owner's bottom line can suffer quicker due to decreased performance and productivity and workplace negativity.  A small company could be severely damaged if they do not seek effective measure to rectify such issues.  An employer that provides an effective, full-service EAP can help both themselves and employees by lowering risk and liability, improving employee satisfaction, and especially decreasing the stress small business owners experience when managing numerous responsibilities with little support.&lt;ref name="Fully Effective Employees"&gt;[http://fee-eap.com/why-should-a-small-business-have-an-eap/.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benefits.org|Benefits]] of EAP are:
* Direct Access: Employees call the psychologist's office directly.
* Quick Response: The first counseling session occurs within a few days, and a crisis is dealt with immediately.
* Professional: Counselors have earned a master's or doctorate in psychology or counseling, and are experts in human behavior.
* Confidentiality: The employer never knows who uses the service.
* Off-Site: Counseling takes place at the Psychologist's office.
* Direct Treatment: Referrals are made only when the patient requires another specialist or long-term care.
* Appropriate Coverage: 24 hours a day hot-line with offices in towns and cities in which employees are located

== Service ==
Employees and their household members may use EAPs to help manage issues in their personal lives. EAP counselors typically provide assessment, support, and referrals to additional resources such as counselors for a limited number of program-paid counseling sessions. The issues for which EAPs provide support vary, but examples include:
* [[substance abuse]]
* [[occupational stress]]
* [[Stress (medicine)|emotional distress]]
* major life events, including births, accidents and deaths
* [[health care]] concerns
* financial or non-work-related legal concerns
* family/personal relationship issues
* work relationship issues
* concerns about aging parents

An EAP's services are usually free to the employee and their household members, having been prepaid by the employer.  In most cases, an employer contracts with a third-party company to manage its EAP.  Some of these companies rely upon other vendors or contracted employees for specialized services to supplement their own services, such as: financial advisors, attorneys, travel agents, elder/child care specialists, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Ann D.|date=2015|title=Quality EAPs Carry Their Weight|url=|journal=Benefit Magazine 52|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confidentiality]] is maintained in accordance with [[privacy laws]] and [[ethical standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html|title=Your Rights Under HIPAA|last=(OCR)|first=Office for Civil Rights|date=2008-05-07|work=HHS.gov|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.amstat.org/cpc/lawsregulations|title=Laws &amp; Regulations   - Committee on Privacy and Confidentiality|website=community.amstat.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, California requires EAP providers who deliver actual counseling services on a pre-paid basis for more than 3 sessions within any six-month period to have a Knox-Keene license. This is a specialty license for psychological services and is mandated by the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. The state's Department of Managed Health Care regulates these licensed plans and assists consumers with regard to grievances, access to quality care, and ensuring that the EAP has an appropriate level of tangible net equity to deliver services to plan members. Title 28, Rule 1300.43.14 of the California Code of Regulations allows EAPs without a Knox-Keene license to request an exemption if they solely refer callers to external services and do not provide the actual services themselves.

Each Federal Executive Branch agency has an Employee Assistance Program (EAP).  An EAP is a voluntary, confidential program that helps employees (including management) work through various life challenges that may adversely affect job performance, health, and personal well-being to optimize an organization's success.  EAP services include assessments, counseling, and referrals for additional services to employees with personal and/or work-related concerns, such as stress, financial issues, legal issues, family problems, office conflicts, and alcohol and substance abuse.  EAPs also often work with management and supervisors providing advanced planning for situations, such as organizational changes, legal considerations, emergency planning, and response to unique traumatic events. EAP’s can reap benefits for agencies, employees, families and communities. Some of those aspects that we will be focusing on are: the improvement of productivity and employee engagement, improving employees’ and dependents’ abilities to successfully respond to challenges, developing employee and manager competencies in managing workplace stress, reducing workplace absenteeism and unplanned absences, supporting employees and managers during workforce restructuring, reduction-in-forces, or other workforce change events, reducing workplace accidents, reducing the likelihood of workplace violence or other safety risks, supporting disaster and emergency preparedness, managing the effect of disruptive incidents, such as workplace, injury, or other crises,facilitating safe, timely, and effective return-to-work for employees short-term and extended absences, reducing healthcare costs associated with stress, depression, and other mental health issues, reducing employee turnover and related replacement costs.

== Military/veterans ==
There are a variety of employee assistance programs in the military, ranging from financial assistance programs, family counseling, depression, and transitional assistance programs.  One of the largest military employee assistance organizations is [https://www.militaryonesourceeap.org Military One Source]. Military One Source offers both services directly to service members and their families, but can also help send people to places in the community if there is a specific need.  If someone is in need of assistance and is: an active duty service member, family member of a service member, a veteran, or family member of a veteran, they can find additional information about the assistance programs offered by Military One Source on their website.

In the last couple decades military employee assistance programs have expanded greatly.  What started as alcohol assistance programs has grown to help people with financial issues, physical health, family health, and since 2000 mental health programs have expanded rapidly as more has become known about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and [[Traumatic brain injury|Traumatic Brain Injuries]] (TBI).  There are several programs for families, and increasing assistance for dual military families, families in which both spouses are active duty military, as they have grown dramatically in number.  Financial programs have been expanded as well, as payday loan establishments grew in popularity in the 2000s; and as a result, debt among military members has grown as well.  The [[Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society]] (NMCRS), is a program started by military members to help other members that have fallen into debt, and has expanded to also help service members reach educational goals.  This society has helped many service members, as a service member can borrow up to 300 dollars without a reason, and more with a valid reason for either no interest or low interest depending on how much and how long they borrow for. The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society has helped many members of the military when unforeseen problems arise.  More information on the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society can be found at: [http://www.nmcrs.org www.nmcrs.org].

One of the largest veteran employee assistance programs is the Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VA provides a variety of services to veterans including: health care, education assistance, transitional housing assistance, mental health, financial assistance, women veterans assistance, and career search assistance.  The Veteran Affairs is a nationwide system that offers their services to all veterans who attained any discharge other than dishonorable.  More information on Veterans Affairs can be found at: [http://www.va.gov www.va.gov].

[[File:Graph RE Australia 2010.svg|thumb|Electricity generation from renewable sources in Australia, 2010]]

'''Feed-in tariffs in Australia''' are the [[feed-in tariff]]s (FITs) paid under various State schemes to non-commercial producers of electricity generated by [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) systems using [[solar panel]]s. They are a way of subsidising and encouraging uptake of [[renewable energy]] and in Australia have been enacted at the State level, in conjunction with a federal [[mandatory renewable energy target]].

Australian FIT schemes tend to focus on providing support to solar PV particularly in the residential context, and project limits on installed capacity (such as 10&amp;nbsp;kW in NSW) mean effectively that FITs do not support large scale projects such as wind farms or solar thermal power stations.

==Gross vs. net FIT schemes==
Some schemes are based on a gross feed-in tariff model while most are based on a net tariff.&lt;ref name="ausrenewpolicy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrnes |first=L. |last2=Brown |first2=C. |last3=Foster |first3=J. |last4=Wagner |first4=L. |date=December 2013 |title=Australian renewable energy policy: Barriers and challenges |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=60 |pages=711–721 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148113003170 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Net feed-in tariff schemes have been criticised for not providing enough incentive for households to install solar panels and thus for not effectively encouraging the uptake of solar PV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/energy-smart/get-paid-for-solar-power-on-your-roof/2008/11/23/1227375061994.html |title=Get paid for solar power on your roof |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bspq.com.au/solar-rebates/solar-feed-in-tariffs/|title=Solar Feed-in-tariffs|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as a "fake feed-in tariff". Critics of net FIT argue that gross tariffs conform to the normal definition of a feed-in tariff, and provide a more certain financial return, paying for all electricity produced, even if it is consumed by the producer, reducing or helping meet peak demand. The issue still remains as to what level the FIT rate should be set — e.g., at the cost of production, at market rates, at the cost at which the retailer sells electricity, or at the rate at which the retailer can acquire electricity in the wholesale market, while others set them at premium or subsidy levels.

The effective difference is that household producers under a gross scheme pay for electricity from the electricity retailer for household consumption at the market rate while all the power produced by them is sold to the retailer at the higher subsided FIT rate. Net FIT schemes effectively use the same rate for the use of electricity by household producers as for sale into the grid (i.e., use of electricity by the household reduces the amount of electricity available to feed into the grid), and accordingly the subsidy to household producers is generally less in overall terms.

The [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and [[New South Wales]] had gross feed-in tariffs, which were subsequently replaced with net feed-in tariffs.

==Proposed federal gross feed-in tariff scheme==
A uniform federal scheme to supersede all State schemes has been proposed by Tasmanian Greens Senator [[Christine Milne]], but not enacted. National feed-in tariff systems have been enacted in numerous countries including Brazil, Canada, China and many EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dr James Prest [http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/eca_ctte/renewable_energy/submissions/sub123.pdf Submission to Senate Inquiry into Feed-in Bill 2008]. Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray Block (28 April 2009).

Block’s Indicator of Sustainable Growth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Parliament has not yet enacted a national gross feed-in tariff scheme for renewable energy. However, a capital grant/rebate was offered of up to $8,000 per household for domestic installations and 50% for school installations up until June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/renewable/pv/index.html Solar Homes and Communities Plan]. Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, a bill was introduced by [[Australian Greens]] Senator [[Christine Milne]], (Tasmania), called the ''Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Feed-In Tariff) Bill 2008''. The bill was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts.

More than 23,000 people have signed an online petition for a national gross feed-in tariff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feedintariff.com.au/index.php feedintariff.com.au]. An Energy Matters community initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech, the Federal Minister for Energy, [[Martin Ferguson]], said that feed-in tariffs are technologically prescriptive and ideologically based, rather than being a market based mechanism. In response to the [[Feed-in tariffs in Germany|German feed-in tariff for solar]], he suggested that Germany's solar subsidy meant German consumers paid more than €1 billion in additional power bills in 2007 to generate around 0.5% of Germany’s gross electricity consumption, suggesting that the policy does not deliver value for money. He also suggested that an Australian solar feed-in tariff may lead to greater PV panel imports rather than a significant expansion of Australian production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minister.ret.gov.au/TheHonMartinFergusonMP/Pages/SOLARFLAGSHIPSFORUM.aspx Solar Flagships Forum] The Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP&lt;/ref&gt; However commentators have suggested that Martin Ferguson's comments are ideologically driven and do not take into account the [[Merit order|Merit Order Effect]] which in some instance negates or almost negates the cost of funding FiTs and in other instances shows funding FiTs delivers a net dividend to consumers.

===Australian Capital Territory===
Under the [http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2008-21/default.asp Electricity Feed-in (Renewable Energy Premium) Act 2008], Canberrans can install [[photovoltaic]] (solar) cells or other [[renewable sources]], produce their own energy, and sell it back to the [[power grid]] but perhaps not until July 2009. They'll be paid a [[tariff]] 3.88 times the retail cost of [[electricity]] (60c/[[kWh]] Jan 2009) for the energy they feed back into the [[electrical grid]] for up to 20 years from the date they sign up to the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2008-21/default.asp Electricity Feed-in (Renewable Energy Premium) Act 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a gross metered scheme meaning that owners get paid a premium rate for all [[electricity]] produced by their installation with their own usage being metered separately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/hansard/2008/week07/2577.htm Legislative Assembly for the ACT: 2008 Week 7 Hansard (2 July) Page 2577]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] scheme will be the most generous feed in scheme in Australia when it comes into operation some time after March 2009.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

As the [[Australian Capital Territory]] ("ACT") scheme is a gross feed in scheme, it is a relatively easy task to estimate the payback time for various system sizes because the calculation is independent of electricity consumption. e.g. a well positioned location in the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] could produce approximately 1800 [[kWh]] per year from a 1&amp;nbsp;kW system{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} or A$1,080 per year at a price of 60 c/[[kWh]]. On this basis payback for a 1&amp;nbsp;kW system costing $5,000 net (includes $8,000 federal rebate &amp; 22 RECS) would be around 5 years. Larger systems would take longer but would have a larger income stream over the life of the system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The ACT Government established an inter-departmental committee to look at feed in tariffs in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;(15 November 2007). [http://www.electricalsolutions.net.au/news/12146-ACT-considers-a-renewable-energy-feed-in-tariff ACT considers a renewable energy feed-in tariff]. ElectricalSolutions. Westwick-Farrow. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some concern that a proposed commercial [[solar power plant]], the feasibility of which is to be examined by a joint study be ACT government and [[ActewAGL]],&lt;ref&gt;(8 May 2008).

Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; may undermine the proposed feed in tariff proposal.

The submission of the Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission 25 February 2008 was that there were issues to be resolved including:
* overall effectiveness and efficiency
* cross-subsidy elements
* equity issues particularly for households suffering financial hardship
* a gross or net approach is adopted
* a clearly predefined finite life (no more than 5 years);
* a partial subsidy rather than full cost recovery
* ability to terminate if national policies are introduced e.g. carbon tax
* transparency of tariff setting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/95647/ICRC_Submission_Feed-in-Tariff_25-2-08.pdf Feed-In Tariff Discussion Paper — Comments February 2008] ACT Govt ''Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the grounds that a capacity cap of 30MW had been reached, the FIT scheme in the ACT was closed to micro and medium scale generators at midnight on 13 July 2011 just days after the legislation was amended (by the Greens and Liberal parties voting together against the will of the government Labor party) on 12 July 2011 to enable micro-generators to continue to access it. The micro-generator category under the Act had earlier been closed on 31 May 2011 once a statutory cap of 15&amp;nbsp;MW had been reached.

===South Australia===
In September 2006, it was announced that the ''Electricity (Feed-In Scheme-Solar Systems) Amendment Bill 2008'' would come into force on 1 July 2008 and run out on 30 June 2028. The normal tariff for electricity is $0.26 / kWh and the feed-in tariff was set at $0.44 / kWh.&lt;ref name="sfis"/&gt; The result is that not only will thousands of South Australian homes have solar systems installed, but many businesses will now have the opportunity to embrace this technology and turn their roofs into mini-renewable power stations. The former South Australian Premier, [[Mike Rann]], wanted the government to be [[carbon neutral]] by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="sagcn"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/features/environment/sa-government-to-go-carbon-neutral/story-e6frflp0-1111115581007 |title=SA Government to go carbon neutral |accessdate=12 January 2012 |date=18 February 2008 |work=news.com.au |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original intent of some parties, for the feed-in tariff to increase with increases to the price of [[electricity]], at a multiple of two was negotiated out before legislated. The 44 cent [[tariff]] is only paid for any electricity exported, so only when the system output exceeds domestic demand.

The solar feed-in scheme commenced on 1 July 2008. It was reviewed in 2009-10 and amendments to the legislation took effect from 29 July 2011. The major change to the scheme was to introduce the concept of customer groups, dependent on the dates of approval and connection of the solar PV system, and the reduction of the feed-in tariff for customers receiving approval after 30 September 2011.

Groups 1, 2 and 3 (broadly existing customers) will continue to receive 44 cents and in addition will receive a minimum retailer payment (estimated to start at about 6 cents) to give a total feed-in payment of about 50 cents. Group 4 (approved permission to connect received between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2013) will receive 16 cents plus the minimum retailer payment to give a total feed-in payment of about 22 cents. Group 5 (approved permission to connect received after 30 September 2013) will not receive any feed-in tariff, but will be eligible for the minimum retailer payment, that is a total payment of about 6 cents. Retailers are free to pay customers more than the legislated minimum rates.

The feed-in tariffs are fixed until 30 June 2028 for Groups 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. the 44 cent rate), and until 30 September 2016 for Group 4 (i.e. the 16 cent rate). The minimum retailer payment will be determined by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia (ESCOSA) has been estimated to commence at about 6 cents from 1 January 2013, and will be reviewed and is expected to increase with the price of electricity over time.&lt;ref name="sfis"&gt;[http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Water%2C+energy+and+environment/Energy/Energy+rebates%2C+concessions+and+incentives/Solar+electricity+rebates+and+incentives/Solar+feed-in+scheme#minimum Solar feed-in scheme]. Government of South Australia. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebates: The South Australian government does not offer any additional rebates or incentives to domestic customers, it’s a solar schools program.
Estimated payback: It’s very hard to calculate, but it will be best for systems of largest eligible size, where the domestic demand is smallest, or mainly occurs at night and low power consumption during the day. Houses without air-conditioning would seem to fit the bill.&lt;ref&gt;(19 February 2008).

===New South Wales===
On 8 May 2008, the NSW government announced that it intended to introduce feed in tariffs. Further details of the solar feed in tariff in NSW were announced on 23 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.theage.com.au/national/nsw-to-introduce-solar-feedin-tariff-20081123-6ex0.html|title=NSW to introduce solar feed-in tariff|publisher=The Age|accessdate=30 June 2009|location=Melbourne|date=23 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705092604/http://news.theage.com.au/national/nsw-to-introduce-solar-feedin-tariff-20081123-6ex0.html|archivedate=5 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSW Feed-in Tariff Taskforce was established to advise the NSW Government on the details of a feed-in tariff scheme for NSW. Its representatives are from the Department of Water and Energy, the Department of Environment and Climate Change, the Department of Premier and Cabinet and NSW Treasury. In January 2009, the Taskforce issued a submission on the design of a feed-in tariff scheme for NSW.

On 23 June 2009, the government announced a Solar Bonus Scheme. This is a net feed-in tariff for the state rather than a gross tariff. Under this 20-year scheme, some residents, schools, small businesses and community groups will be paid $0.60 per kwh for the net amount of electricity sold back into the grid. As few as 42,000 households are expected to take advantage of the scheme.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The scheme was set to begin on 1 January 2010 and to be reviewed in 2012.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Solar Bonus Scheme is payable to energy customers with solar panel systems up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW in size;.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Cubby (24 July 2009).

In October 2010 the New South Wales government cut the solar feed in tariff to $0.20 per kWh, the lowest level in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/2000-jobs-tipped-to-go-from-nsw-solar-cuts-20101104-17f06.html|title=2000 jobs tipped to go from NSW solar cuts |last=AAP|first=|date=4 November 2010|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|pages=1|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011 the NSW FIT (Solar Bonus) scheme was retrospectively closed to new applicants and removed for current users after a Ministerial declaration was made under s.15A(8C) Electricity Supply Act 1995 (NSW) that the cumulative total installed capacity cap of 300 MW had been reached.

A new feed-in tariff is proposed, with the constraint that it not raise the cost of electricity and not involve funding from the NSW government. This inherently limits the FIT to less than the consumer electricity cost, and does not conform to the normal definition of a feed-in tariff. A feed-in tariff of from 5.2 to 10.3 cents/kWh is proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipart.nsw.gov.au/Home/Industries/Electricity/Reviews/Retail_Pricing/Solar_feed-in_tariffs/14_Mar_2012_-_Consumer_Fact_Sheet_on_Final_Report/Fact_Sheet_-_Consumer_-_A_fair_and_reasonable_solar_feed-in_tariff_for_NSW_-_Solar_Feed-in_Tariffs_-_14_March_2012 Fact Sheet - Consumers]&lt;/ref&gt; By the normal definition of a feed-in tariff, the cost of a new and expensive generation source, e.g. solar panels, is borne by all of the consumers rather than the early adopters, who instead are rewarded. It is implemented in the expectation that volume will reduce the cost, thus allowing more people to use that source. Feed-in tariff advocacy organizations claim that feed-in tariff is both the least expensive, and the most effective incentive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wind-works.org/FeedLaws/Germany/StatusofFeed-inTariffsinEurope2010.html Status of Feed-in Tariffs in Europe 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Australia===

The Western Australian Government had committed to a limited Gross feed in tariff for household scale PV.  The scheme was to be funded for four years at a cost of $13.5m and based on a payment of 60c kW/h to re cover the capital cost of the system after any rebates.  After the capital cost is paid back the tariff will revert to a lower rate or the existing Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme (REBS).&lt;ref name="synpricsched1" /&gt;

On 2 June 2009 the state government backflipped on this promise and has deferred the introduction of the scheme for 1 year until 1 July 2010.  In the new scheme a net metering system would be applied rather than gross.  The $13.5m of funds had already been allocated to systems installed prior to the 1 July 2009 implementation date in a public display of support for the concept.  The over-subscription highlighted the imbalance between public and state support for the renewable energy industry.&lt;ref name="sgstres"&gt;Peter Collier (2 June 2009). [http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Results.aspx?ItemID=131978 State Government scheme targets renewable energy systems]. State Government Media Statement. Retrieved 14 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2010, the net feed in tariff commenced and existing customers can migrate to the new billing system. New customers will need to sign up the Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme from their state electricity provider, [[Synergy (electricity corporation)|Synergy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synergy.net.au/at_home/feedintariff.xhtml Feed-in tariff]. Synergy. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feed In Tariff offered by the state government is 40 cents whilst Synergy offers 7 cents via the Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme. Once the customer signs up, they will receive both incentives for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infiniteenergy.com.au/solarenergygovernmentincentives.html Government Incentives]. Infinite Energy. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2011, the state government suspended all new applications for the Feed in Tariff, citing the expense of the programme as the reason.&lt;ref name="sgstres"/&gt;

The situation is better for Horizon Power residential customers, who are offered renewable energy buy-back rates equal to their electricity tariff rate (A2 tariff) less the GST component (10%). The current electricity charge - cents per unit is 20.83c including GST. Horizon Power's rebate is more than double the rate paid by Synergy.

===Queensland===
[[File:Solar hot water service.JPG|thumb|A solar hot water panel and integrated tank on a house roof, 2006]]
The Queensland Government Solar Bonus Scheme is a program that pays domestic and other small energy customers for the surplus electricity generated from roof-top [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) systems that is exported to the Queensland grid. It commenced on 1 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanenergy.qld.gov.au/solar_bonus_scheme.cfm Office of Clean Energy - Solar Bonus Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422075453/http://www.cleanenergy.qld.gov.au/solar_bonus_scheme.cfm |date=22 April 2011 }}. Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation. Retrieved 14 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme provides for 44c/kWh (around twice times the current general domestic use tariff of 21.35c/kWh (including GST)) on the net amount exported to the grid, subject to having proper metering installed.

A feed-in tariff will ensure that Queenslanders benefit from the federal Photovoltaic Rebate Program.&lt;ref&gt;(24 June 2007) [http://www.enviro-friendly.com/ClimateSmart_2050.pdf ClimateSmart 2050: Queensland climate change strategy 2007: a low-carbon future].

Whilst the government scheme has now ended for new installs, energy retailers still offer competitive feed in tariffs. As of July 1st, 2017, Click Energy&lt;ref name="Click"&gt;[https://www.clickenergy.com.au/solar-power/] Solar Energy Feed In Tariff | Click Energy&lt;/ref&gt; provides 16c/kWh and Origin provides 14c/kWh.&lt;ref name="ORIGIN"&gt;[http://www.originenergy.com.au/2716/Feed-in-tariffs?g%5Buser_state%5D=qld], Origin FEED-IN TARIFFS&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
In November 2009 Victoria set up a net metered feed-in tariff scheme, under which households were paid 60 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid. This was about twice the then current retail price for electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.dpi.vic.gov.au/energy/policy/greenhouse-challenge/feed-in-tariffs]. Department of Primary Industries. October 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914121220/http://new.dpi.vic.gov.au/energy/policy/greenhouse-challenge/feed-in-tariffs |date=14 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feed-in tariff scheme was to run for 15 years from November 2009, and applied to all household systems of up to 5&amp;nbsp;kW capacity and had a cap of 100MW of generating capacity and/or a $10 per annum increase in the average household electricity bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/dpinenergy.nsf/LinkView/7AFCBB81592B8111CA2576350020903D3E1179147BC310BACA257635001F2BEF |title=Premium Rate for Solar Power |date=September 2009 |publisher=Department of Primary Industries |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004115901/http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/dpinenergy.nsf/LinkView/7AFCBB81592B8111CA2576350020903D3E1179147BC310BACA257635001F2BEF |archivedate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A feed-in tariff scheme was originally announced on 7 May 2008 which had been described by environment groups as ineffective, as the then proposed 2&amp;nbsp;kW cap on array size, combined with net metering, meant that very little surplus power would be put into the grid so very little of the high tariff would actually be paid.  Environment groups and renewable energy companies called for the Victorian feed-in tariff to be paid on gross metering with a 10&amp;nbsp;kW cap on array size to overcome these problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envict.org.au/inform.php?item=1797 Brumby Government’s solar feed-in law a flop], Environment Victoria, 5 May 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024125952/http://www.envict.org.au/inform.php?item=1797 |date=24 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/environment/government-attacked-on-solar-tariff-plan-20090316-8zww.html# "Government attacked on solar tariff plan"], David Rood and Royce Millar, [[The Age]], 17 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but these concerns were only partially addressed in the 2009 scheme.

On 1 September 2011, it was announced that the 60 cent tariff would be closed to new installations after 30 September 2011 after 88,000 installations, and a new Transitional tariff of at least 25 cents would apply to systems installed afterwards. The Transitional tariff will be paid until the end of 2016, when tariffs will be reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyandresources.vic.gov.au/energy/environment-and-community/victorian-feed-in-tariff/closed-schemes/maintaining-eligibility Maintaining eligibility for the Premium Feed-in Tariff,  Transitional Feed-in Tariff, or "one-for-one" Standard Feed-in Tariff]&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum feed-in tariff that applies to new applicants from 1 January 2016 was 5 cents per kilowatt hour (c/kWh).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyandresources.vic.gov.au/energy/environment-and-community/victorian-feed-in-tariff Victorian Feed-in Tariff]&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum feed-in tariff that applies to new applicants from 1 July 2017 is 11.3 cents per kilowatt hour (c/kWh). This is broken down as follows.
Feed-in tariff component.
Forecast solar-weighted average wholesale electricity pool cost - 8.1 (c/kWh).
Value of avoided distribution and transmission losses - 0.6 (c/kWh).
Avoided market fees and ancillary service charges - 0.1 (c/kWh).
Value of avoided social cost of carbon - 2.5 (c/kWh).
FiT - 11.3 (c/kWh).

From 1 July 2018 the minimum electricity feed-in tariff for households and businesses who feed power back into the electricity grid from small renewable energy sources will be 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). This is broken down as follows. Feed-in tariff component. Forecast solar-weighted average wholesale electricity pool cost - 6.8 (c/kWh). Value of avoided distribution and transmission losses - 0.5 (c/kWh). Avoided market fees and ancillary service charges - 0.1 (c/kWh). Value of avoided social cost of carbon - 2.5 (c/kWh). FiT - 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). For the first time, retailers will be able pay solar system owners either a single-rate tariff or time-varying tariff. The single rate tariff is 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour. Under the time-varying tariff, customers will be credited between 7.1 cents and 29.0 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity exported, depending on the time of day.

===Tasmania===
On Tuesday, 3 March 2008, the Premier of Tasmania announced that the Government will consider a mid-year report on the introduction of minimum feed-in tariffs to support householders and small energy consumers using solar panels and other forms of domestic renewable energy and that provide surplus energy into the electricity grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/policy/climate/ Department of Premier and Cabinet - Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506114659/http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/policy/climate/ |date=6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Territory===
Northern Territory is yet to make an announcement on feed-in tariffs as a means of subsidising and encouraging solar PV, other than in relation to Alice Springs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ata.org.au/feedintariffs/take-action-nt/ Alternative Technology Association website » Take action NT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123232011/http://www.ata.org.au/feedintariffs/take-action-nt/ |date=23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 there was a bid to make Alice Springs a Solar City. Australian Government funding would give four different regions in Australia the chance to become a Solar City and share $75 m funding to make solar power projects a reality. If successful, the Alice Springs project would involve solar power generation plus investigating energy efficiency, [[smart meter]]ing and tariff pricing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nt.gov.au/business/documents/general/2006_Industry_Sector_Snapshots.pdf NT Industry Sector Snapshots 2006]. Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alice Springs, an official Solar City, from May 2008 people with grid connected PV systems can sell all the solar electricity they generate back to Power and Water Corporation at 45 cents per kilowatt–hour, which is more than double the cost of purchasing electricity from the grid.&lt;ref&gt;(12 May 2008).

Media Release. Retrieved 14 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the Alice Springs Solar City area, people with Solar PV in the NT can arrange to sell their gross electricity production to the Power &amp; Water Corporation of the Northern Territory at 14.38c. They can effectively use the grid as a bank and notionally re-purchase the electricity at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerwater.com.au/powerwater/business/photovoltaic_rebate.html Power and Water Corporation - Solar Energy Buyback Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720074558/http://www.powerwater.com.au/powerwater/business/photovoltaic_rebate.html |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nt.gov.au/dpifm/Minerals_Energy/MakeTheSwitch/index.cfm?header=Roof-top%20solar%20panels Make the Switch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303221404/http://www.nt.gov.au/dpifm/Minerals_Energy/MakeTheSwitch/index.cfm?header=Roof-top%20solar%20panels |date=3 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity retailers==
Some electricity retailers are offering feed in tariff rates above the minimum stipulated by government. Many of the larger corporate retailers offer these incentives to capture larger proportions of the green electricity customer base, who are known to have lower churn rates.

==Council of Australian Governments==
According to the [[COAG]] communiqué released in November 2008 [[COAG]] agreed to a set of national principles to apply to new feed-in tariff schemes and to inform the reviews of existing schemes. These principles will promote national consistency of schemes across Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Ju Yeon Jung (1 December 2008). [http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2008/12/01/article/ZTKRJMZLNH.html COAG meeting vague on feed-in tariffs]. Government News.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Communique the basic principles are:
# Micro renewable generation to receive fair and reasonable value for exported energy
# Any premium rate to be jurisdictionally determined, transitional and considered for public funding
# Ministerial Council for Energy (MCE) to continue to advance fair treatment of small renewables
# FiT policy to be consistent with previous [[COAG]] agreements (particularly the Australian Energy Market Agreement)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_meeting_outcomes/2008-11-29/docs/20081129_national_principles_fits.pdf Council of Australian Governments meeting, Canberra, 29 November 2008 - National Principles for Feed-in Tariff Schemes]&lt;/ref&gt;

These principles do not appear to support a gross feed in tariff as exists in Germany, but rather a net feed in tariff.

==Opposition to feed-in tariffs==
A Bill for a national feed-in tariff introduced by Senator Milne has not progressed after the Rudd government indicated it would not support such legislation. Some reasons were provided through the majority report of a Senate Committee examining the Bill. In the ACT, in February 2010, the ACT Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission proposed reducing the amount paid to RE generators under the Territory's FIT law.

It has been reported that NSW households could pay an extra $600 on their electricity bill over six years ($8.33/month) to cover the $2 billion cost of the tariff scheme. The total cost to families in some regional areas could be $1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/energy-smart/solar-flareup-will-burn-a-hole-in-every-pocket-20101030-17862.html | title=Solar flare-up will burn a hole in every pocket | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government investment in roads or schools, for example, is part of national saving in the national income accounts. National saving is reduced by the government deficit net of government investment, not by the entire government deficit. The difference between domestic investment and national saving is not affected by this qualification, however, as government investment and the implied adjustment to national saving cancel each other out."&lt;/ref&gt; exceeds desired [[investment]].{{Sfn|Bernanke|Bertaut|DeMarco|Kamin|2011}}  By 2005 [[Ben Bernanke]], chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], the [[central bank]] of the [[United States]], expressed concern about the "significant increase in the global supply of saving" and its implications for monetary policies, particularly in the United States. Although Bernanke's analyses focused on events in 2003 to 2007 that led to the 2007–2009 financial crisis, regarding GSG countries and the United States, excessive saving by the non-financial corporate sector (NFCS) is an ongoing phenomenon, affecting many countries.{{Sfn|OECD|2001}}{{Sfn|Cardarelli|Ueda|2006}}{{Sfn|Chang|Lemos-Stein|Schulz|Stout|2012}}{{Sfn|Williams|2013}} Bernanke's "celebrated (if sometimes disputed)"{{Sfn|Obstfeld|2012|29}} global saving glut (GSG) hypothesis{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}}{{Sfn|Bernanke|2007}} argued that increased capital inflows to the United States from GSG countries&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In his 2011 paper Bernanke defined the GSG countries as "all countries of Asia and the Middle East excluding Japan. This group, although not exhaustive, accounts for the lion's share of investment in the United States by emerging market economies."&lt;/ref&gt; were an important reason that U.S. longer-term interest rates from 2003 to 2007 were lower than expected.{{Sfn|Bernanke|Bertaut|DeMarco|Kamin|2011}}

[[Alan Greenspan]] testifying at the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] in 2010 explained, "Whether it was a glut of excess intended saving, or a shortfall of investment intentions, the result was the same: a fall in global real long-term interest rates and their associated capitalization rates. Asset prices, particularly house prices, in nearly two dozen countries accordingly moved dramatically higher. U.S. house price gains were high by historical standards but no more than average compared to other countries."{{Sfn|Greenspan|2010}}

A 2007 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) report noted that the "excess of gross saving over fixed investment (i.e. net lending) in the "aggregate OECD corporate sector" had been unusually large since 2002.{{Sfn|OECD|2001}} In a 2006 [[International Monetary Fund]] report, it was observed that, "since the bursting of the equity market
bubble in the early 2000s, companies in many industrial countries have moved from their traditional position of borrowing funds to finance their capital expenditures to running financial surpluses that they are now lending to other sectors of the economy".{{Sfn|Cardarelli|Ueda|2006}} David Wessell in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article observed that, "[c]ompanies, which normally borrow other folks’ savings in order to invest, have turned thrifty. Even companies enjoying strong profits and cash flow are building cash hoards, reducing debt and buying back their own shares—instead of making investment bets."{{Sfn|Wessell|2005}} Although the hypothesis of excess cash holdings or cash hoarding has been used by the OECD, the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the media (''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]), the concept itself has been disputed and criticized as conceptually flawed in articles and reports published by the [[Hoover Institute]], the [[Max-Planck Institute]] and the [[CATO Institute]] among others.{{Sfn|von Weizsäcker|2011}}{{Sfn|Borio|Disyatat|2011}}{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=4}} [[Ben Bernanke]] used the phrase "global savings glut" in 2005 linking it to the U.S. [[current account]] deficit.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}}

In their July 2012 report [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] described the "fragile equilibrium that currently exists in the global corporate credit landscape". U.S. NFCS firms continued to hoard a "record amount of cash" with large profitable investment-grade companies and technology and health care industries (with significant amounts of cash overseas), holding most of the wealth.{{Sfn|Chang|Lemos-Stein|Schulz|Stout|2012}}

By January 2013, NFCS firms in Europe had over 1 trillion euros of cash on their balance sheets, a record high in nominal terms.{{Sfn|Williams|2013}}

==History==
When the equity market bubble burst, in the early 2000s, companies in many industrial countries cut down on borrowing funds to finance their capital expenditures. They began running financial surpluses that they lent to other sectors of the economy.{{Sfn|Cardarelli|Ueda|2006}}

In 2003–2004 the non-financial corporate sector in member nations of the Group of Seven (G-7) held $US 1.3 trillion of corporate excess saving.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The IMF (2006) report used "cash" to refer refers to "currency and deposits plus short-term securities (including treasury bills, commercial paper, and certificates of deposits)."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Cardarelli|Ueda|2006}}

By 2011 Statistics Canada reported that Canadian business were "sitting on more than $583 billion in Canadian currency and deposits, and more than $276 billion in foreign currency".{{Sfn|CBC News|2012}}

During and after the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s levels of economic{{Sfn|The Economist|2012}} and [[policy uncertainty]] rose dramatically contributing to the depth of the recession and the weakness of the following recovery with{{Sfn|Pastor|Veronesi|2012}}{{Sfn|Berg|2012}} many corporations globally and avoiding investments and increasing their cash holdings, in what has been called "liquidity hoarding",{{Sfn|Berrospide|2012}} "cash hoarding" or "dead cash".{{Sfn|Sanchez|Yurdagul|2013}}{{Sfn|Walsh|2012}}{{Sfn|Bloomberg|2012}}

==Cash kings==
In March 2013 Moody's Investors Service published their report entitled ''Cash Pile Grows 10% to $1.45 Trillion; Overseas Holdings Continue to Expand'' in their Global Credit Research series, in which they examined companies they rate in the US non-financial corporate sector (NFCS). According to their report, by the end of 2012 the US NFCS held "$1.45 trillion in cash," 10% more than in 2001. At the end of 2011, US NFCS held $1.32 trillion in cash which was already a record level.{{Sfn|Global Credit Research|2013}} "Of the $1.32 trillion for all the rated companies, Moody's estimates that $840 billion, or 58% of the total cash, is held overseas."{{Sfn|Global Credit Research|2013}}
 
By the end of 2012 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, and Cisco, "cash kings", as Moody's called them, held $347 billion at the end of 2012 compared to $278 billion in 2011.{{Sfn|Global Credit Research|2013}}

At the end of 2012 [[History of Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company's]] cash balance was $22.9 billion and was listed as ten on the list of U.S. non-financial corporation sector's top ten cash kings by [[Moody's Investors Service]] in their March 2013 annual report on Global Credit Research.{{Sfn|Global Credit Research|2013}}{{Sfn|Fontevecchia|2013}}

==Causes==
In his article in April 2013 Federal Reserve Bank Economist, Kevin Kliesen  investigated some of the causes of the "recent upsurge in hoarding of cash by firms" or "increased accumulation of cash on corporate balance sheets" in the United States. He suggested a number of valid reasons including "increased levels of economic uncertainty", "increased competition, especially in the information technology sector" and "financing of research and development". Kliesen also argued that another reason for cash hoarding in the U.S. is the "relatively high U.S. corporate tax rate on income generated from foreign operations and subsidiaries".{{Sfn|Kleisen|2013}}

In an article published in [[The Economist]] in 2005, it was argued that the consumer boom was built on the unreliable foundation of rising house prices and that corporations were waiting for housing prices to level off or decline before they are willing to invest rather than save.{{Sfn|The Economist|2005}}

==Opportunistic borrowing==

Financial liabilities have increased at U.S. NFCS firms, suggesting they may be taking advantage of low interests rates, and saving this cash as unused financial assets for future use.{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}}

===Pension deficit===
In 2005 Bernanke identified a number of possible causes for the global saving glut that began in 2001, including pension funding to make provision for an impending increase in the number of retirees relative to the number of workers.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}} "Dearth of domestic [[investment]] opportunities", due to slowly growing or declining work forces, and high [[Capital intensity|capital-labor ratios]], which leads to low returns on domestic investment.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}} As a result, the mature industrial economies seek to run current account surpluses and thus to lend abroad.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2007}}

RBC Global Asset Management's Chief Economist, Eric Lascelles, also argued that NFCS firms were building financial assets as a precautionary measure, claiming that in 2011 "private U.S. defined-benefit pension plans were underfunded by $USD 909 billion", whereas they "were roughly balanced in 2007".{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}}

===Bank-centred governance and non-financial corporations cash holdings===
At the 1998 International Finance Conference, in their paper entitled ''Bank Power and Cash Holdings: Evidence from Japan'', Pinkowitz and Williamson{{Sfn|Pinkowitz|1998|page 2}} showed that Japanese firms held more cash than U.S. or German firms. They concluded that the "monopoly power of Japanese banks" persuaded non-financial corporations to hold larger cash balances. "During periods with powerful banks, firms' high cash holdings are consistent with banks extracting rents."{{Sfn|Pinkowitz|1998|page 2}} When banks weakened, NFCS firms held lower cash levels. Firms might take fewer risks in countries with bank-centered governance but "banks' incentives might not coincide with those of shareholders".{{Sfn|Pinkowitz|1998|page 9, 27}}

===Policy uncertainty: environmental and health public policies===
U.S. NFCS firms' rationale behind increasing cash holdings and restrained capital expenditures is most often linked to policy uncertainty.{{Sfn|Pastor|Veronesi|2012}}{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}} At the end of 2012 NFCS firms faced "uncertainty regarding economic growth, the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling, the pursuit of a sustainable long-term fiscal trajectory, health-care reform and financial-sector reform". The Policy Uncertainty Index was elevated at that time.{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}}

== Consequences==

===A fall in global real long-term interest rates===
In 2005 J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. observed that the increase in excess saving in the corporate sector contributed to the "relatively low level of global long-term interest rates at a time of a ballooning U.S. current account deficit".{{Sfn|Wessell|2005}}{{Sfn|J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.|2005}} Greenspan argued that the excess saving resulted in a "fall in global real long-term interest rates and their associated capitalization rates. Asset prices, particularly house prices, in nearly two dozen countries accordingly moved dramatically higher. U.S. house price gains were high by historical standards but no more than average compared to other countries."{{Sfn|Greenspan|2010}}

===Rising global imbalances with respect to international current account balances===
The United States was already experiencing a dramatic increase in its [[current account deficit]]&lt;ref group=notes&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/ Bernanke 10 March 2005] explained the U.S. current account deficit equalled the "excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period." The U.S. current account deficit was c. $635 billion in 2004. The value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports by c. $618 billion.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernanke argued that the GSG caused the rise in current account deficits.  A "current account deficit means that a country is spending more than it is producing".{{Sfn|Cecchetti|2011}}

===Low capital expenditure (capex)===
Low capital expenditure ([[capex]]) is frequently cited as hindering economic recovery although economists are not in agreement on this.{{Sfn|Williams|2013}} Eric Lascelles, explained the rationale behind the surge in corporate saving. He argued that NFCS firms continued to be restrained in terms of capital expenditure for a variety of reasons. Equipment and software prices have dropped since 1992 allowing them to purchase more with less. In the United States, there is an oversupply of capital stock which includes physical capital, office space, plants and equipment in the U.S. Existing capital is not depreciating rapidly and firms are running under capacity.{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}} NFCS firms began [[deleveraging]] after the financial crisis as they found that their assets were "worth less than they imagined and discovered that continuous access to debt markets was not guaranteed". They channeled resources to the financial account and asset liquidity, away from capital expenditures.{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}}

In 2013 Gareth Williams, Director, Sector Economist at [[Standard &amp; Poor]]'s argued that a "large and growing share of European corporate capex was directed to emerging markets" outside of Europe, "up 42% from January 2012 and up from 28% from 2007".{{Sfn|Williams|2013|2}} Williams claims there is "a strong precautionary motive in the amount of cash being held" by NFCS firms, in the eurozone [[European Economic and Monetary Union]] which is "trapped in a quagmire of austerity, high unemployment, and political uncertainty".

===Developing countries became net lenders on capital markets===
Developing countries became net lenders on capital markets. United States and other advanced economies became net borrowers. University of California, Berkeley economist Obstfeld observed, that Bernanke and other proponents of the global saving glut account of the 2007–09 crisis argued that large surpluses by China (and other GSG countries) had adverse effects on richer countries' current accounts and financial markets.{{Sfn|Obstfeld|2012|33}} To avoid the consequences of financial crises, developing countries built up "war chests" of large quantities of foreign-exchange reserves to act as a buffer against potential capital outflows during financial crises.{{Sfn|Council of Economic Advisers|2009|pages=61,63}}

According to Bernanke the US was attractive for foreign investors because of new technologies and rising productivity. Capital flowing into the United States increased the value of the dollar making the imports of the US cheap (in terms of dollars) and exports expensive (in terms of foreign currencies), creating a rising US current account deficit.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}}{{Sfn|Bernanke|2007}} GSG countries accumulated reserves in the "context of foreign exchange interventions intended to promote export-led growth by preventing exchange-rate appreciation".{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}}(sometimes called [[Bretton Woods II]]).

==The Lucas paradox==

In [[Lucas paradox|Robert Lucas' classical paradox]] described in the article entitled "Why doesn't capital flow from rich to poor countries?" and published in 1990 in the ''[[American Economic Review]]'', Lucas questioned{{Sfn|1990|Lucas|92-96}} the validity of the assumptions of the neoclassical model that gave rise to differences in the marginal product of capital. For example, in 1988 in India, a poorer country at that time, the marginal product of capital should have been 58 greater than in the United States, a richer nation. Lucas did not observe such flows. Lucas argued that the central question of economic development should be to replace these assumptions.{{Sfn|Bonizzi|2013}}{{Sfn|Daly|2010}}{{Sfn|World Bank|2013}}

{{quote|The integration of emerging markets into the global financial system has been characterized by cyclical periods of capital inflows, interrupted by sudden capital outflows and financial crises. Probably the most renowned boom-and-bust cycle was the surge of private capital flows to emerging markets during the 90's that ended with a succession of crises, starting with Mexico in 1995 and then touching East Asian countries in 1997–1998, Russia in 1998, Brazil in 1999, Argentina and Turkey in 2001. The following boom to emerging markets during the 2000's was again interrupted by a sudden reversal of capital flows during the global financial crisis following the Lehmann Brothers collapse in 2008. Since 2009 capital flows to emerging markets are again at historical heights. This highly cyclical nature of capital flows and the increased frequency of financial crashes have cast questions about the process of financial globalisation—i.e. the dramatic expansion of international financial transactions over the past twenty-thirty years—and holdings itself.|Bonizzi, 2013, 3}}

In an [[open economy]], a country's spending in any given year need not to equal its output of goods and services. A [[country]] can spend more money than it produces by [[government debt|borrowing]] from abroad, or it can spend less than it produces and lend the difference to [[alien (law)|foreigners]].{{Sfn|Mankiw|2010}} Even though some economies are more open or closed than others, there are no closed economies in the strict sense of the definition in today's world.&lt;ref name="ClosedEconomies"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=closed+economy |title=Closed Economy |website=AmosWEB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The Canadian government introduced business incentives along with corporate tax reductions "to compel Canadian corporations to invest some $525 billion of dead cash back into the economy".{{Sfn|Canadian Press|2012}} In their analysis of the 2012 budget the Canadian Labour Congress argued that "non-financial corporations" have used their federal incentives and tax cuts&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Prior to 2007, the federal corporate income tax rate was over 20%. Since 2007 the corporate tax rate was lowered. Bay 2012 it was 15%.&lt;/ref&gt; to "buy up their own shares, to increase dividends, and to increase their cash holdings" which amounted to "close to $500 billion of surplus cash" that they were not investing in job creation.{{Sfn|Canadian Labour Congress|2012}}

In August 2012 then Bank of Canada Governor [[Mark Carney]] "castigated corporations in Canada for their high levels of savings, saying firms should either spend their ample financial reserves or return the value to shareholders through buy-backs". ''[[Financial Post]]'' journalist Philip Cross argued that "It is the job of companies to make money for their shareholders, not to put money to work."{{Sfn|Cross|2012}} Cross also argued that, "If households and governments are net borrowers, inevitably firms must be net lenders, which require savings." From 2002 to 2012, corporations in Germany, the UK and Japan had higher savings rates than corporations in Canada. After the [[Great Recession]] corporations in OECD member nations further increased their savings rates Great Recession.{{Sfn|Cross|2012}}

Don Drummond, who was formerly the chief economist for TD Bank, argued that reluctance of Canadian businesses to invest capital is a problematic, long term pattern.{{Sfn|Walberg|2013}} It is not because of "excessive prudence". By spring 2013 in Canada "the stock of machinery and equipment per worker" in average "was between 50% and 60%" of what it was in the United States. The lack of spending was long term and it continued through 2012 while in the United States spending increased. Drummond argued that this gap would get bigger. According to Drummond, there was a time when Canadian businesses spent less because of "factors such as tax rates and the dollar, but if that were ever true it's certainly not anymore... Canadian businesses are accustomed to operating in an environment that is sheltered from competition, compared to the American business climate. As a result, they don't accurately perceive the risks of being too cautious, and of failing to exploit opportunities and available resources."{{Sfn|Walberg|2013}}

== Concept of cash hoarding disputed ==
This view of a worldwide saving glut responsible for low levels of interest rates is disputed by [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] like the German economist [[Hans-Werner Sinn]], who claims that it was the monetary policy of the US [[Federal Reserve]] in the 1990s which kept interest rates too low for too long. In addition, the policy of the US government encouraged private debt to promote private consumption. This led to a lack of savings in the US which was then provided from foreign countries on a basis which was not sustainable. Carl Christian von Weizsäcker follows Ben Bernanke claiming that aging populations which save more than can be profitably invested lead to a saving glut and negative equilibrium rates of interest which makes public deficits necessary to fill the gap between excess private savings and private investment.{{Sfn|von Weizsäcker|2011}}

From the perspective of [[monetary economics]], the savings glut idea has been criticized as conceptually flawed, ignoring the role of [[credit creation]], and related unsustainable asset price booms.{{Sfn|Borio|Disyatat|2011}} Further, the composition of cross-border financing flows cannot be determined just from the ''net'' capital flows, and analysis on this basis yields flawed conclusions.

In his 2008 article entitled "Competing Explanations: A Global Saving Glut", Senior Fellow in Economics at Stanford University's [[Hoover Institution]], [[John B. Taylor]], stated that there was "no evidence for a global saving glut".{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=4}} Using an International Monetary Fund 2005 graph,{{Sfn|IMF|2005|p=92}} he argued that "the global saving rate—world saving as a fraction of world GDP—was very low in the 2002–2004 period especially when compared with the 1970s and 1980s".{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=4}}

According to Taylor, "[T]here was a gap of saving over investment in the world outside the United States during 2002–2004, and this may be the source of the term "saving glut". But the United States was saving less than it was investing during this period; it was running a current account deficit which implies that saving was less than investment. Thus the positive saving gap outside the United States was offset by an equal sized negative saving gap in the United States. No extra impact on world interest rates would be expected. As implied by simple global accounting, there is no global gap between saving and investment."{{Sfn|Taylor|2007|p=5}}{{Sfn|Taylor|2009}}

Taylor argued that the global ''gross'' savings rate (not necessarily the net savings rate) during the 2000s was slightly higher than savings rate in the 80s or 90s according to IMF data.{{Sfn|EconStats|nd}}

[[Niall Ferguson]] in ''[[The Ascent of Money]]'',  published in 2008, examines the long history of money, credit, and banking. In it he predicted a financial crisis as a result of the world economy and in particular the [[United States]] using too much credit. Specifically he cites the [[China]]–[[United States|America]] dynamic which he refers to as [[Chimerica]] where an Asian "savings glut" helped create the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] with an influx of easy money.{{Sfn|McRae|2008}}{{Sfn|Ferguson|Schularick|2007}}

'''''Gold v. Eddy''''', [[Case citation|1 Mass. 1 (1804)]], was the first recorded case in the official [[Law report|reports]] of the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]].

==Ruling==
According to the reporter's summation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In an action by the endorser against the promisor of a [[promissory note]] negotiated subsequent to the day of payment, the defendant may go into such evidence as he would have been entitled to had the action been brought by the original promisee. The deposition of a person used in a former trial is competent [[evidence]] in a review, though the [[Deposition (law)|deponent]] is a party to the suit, having become administrator of one of the original parties.&lt;ref&gt;''Gold v. Eddy'', 1 Mass. 1 (1804)[http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/1/1mass1.html] (accessed June 21, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2229">'''Industrial arbitration''' is a type of [[arbitration]] to prevent or settle labor disputes that may arise between an industrial employer and a [[organized labor|union]], union member, or union representative to prevent legal action taking place and finding less costly ways to settle disputes.  

Taking an issue to court or a breakdown of negotiations can be dangerous for both management and labor, and as such parties are often willing to negotiate and plead their cases with a third party arbiter to come to fair decisions.  Industrial arbitration refers to this process taking place in which labor and management will sit down and solve a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This process often benefits the employer because it reduces the chances of a strike or legal action, and benefits the employee because it allows them more bargaining power and prevents mass layoffs in a dispute.  However, at times the government has been known to step in regardless of arbitration clauses and force its own remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Jonuz Kaceli''' (20 Juni 1908– 25 February 1951) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] businessman and dissident of the [[Communist Albania|communist regime]] in Albania. He was one of the 23 victims of the regime's [[Massacre of 1951 in Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/article/Historia/7046/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Jonuz Kaceli was born in 1908 in [[Tirana]]. Prior to his arrest and killing, he had been a well known businessman in [[Albania]], as the co-owner in the company [[Osman Kaceli e djemtë]], which had been one of the first companies registered in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] after the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] in 1912. He was also the brother of [[Sadik Kaceli]], a famous Albanian painter. [[Qemal Stafa]], a notable World War II hero, had been a company employee prior to his death in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Libri: Bombe ne ambassades Sovjetik&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Kaceli had been an important person in the business community of Tirana.&lt;ref name="Telegraf"&gt;Telegraf published on 9 march 2008 [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kaceli_Article_1.jpg]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kaceli_article_part_4.jpg]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He allegedly tried to hurt [[Mehmet Shehu]] during such interrogations. As a result, according to a witness who told the story in 1993, he was thrown from the second floor of the Ministry of the Interior building and thus killed one day prior to the rest of the victims of the massacre, on 25 February 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Uran Butka 27 February 2006 Shekulli newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/article/Historia/7742/?highlight=jonuz+kaceli&amp;match= Aleksandër Meksi: Edhe njëherë mbi bombën në Ambasadën sovjetike], ZemraShqiptare.net, 12-04-2009, 07:16pm (GMT)&lt;/ref&gt;
He was survived by wife and seven children, all of whom were sent to Albanian [[gulags]] after the killing took place.&lt;ref name="Telegraf"/&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2008 his act was recognized by the President of Albania, [[Bamir Topi]] and Kaceli was duly awarded post mortem the medal of [[Civil awards and decorations of Albania|Martyr of Democracy]]. His corpse is now buried at the Albanian [[National Martyrs Cemetery of Albania|National Martyrs Cemetery]] ({{lang-sq|Dëshmorët e Kombit}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.al/shqip/info.asp?id=4905 Decorations in 2008 from the President of Albania]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been instrumental in introducing small wind turbines and solar systems on a large scale in an organised manner in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

==Ancestry==
Kazi Zulkader traces his lineage to the first Caliph [[Abu Bakr]]. He is also a direct descendant of the famous Sufi [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya]] Multani (1160–1267). One of [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya]]'s great-grandsons – Shaykh Nizamuddin – moved to the Deccan in South India during the reign of Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] around the year 1343. Subsequently, this branch of the family settled down in Hyderabad for over six centuries. Kazi Zulkader's ancestors were given the title of [[Qadi|"Kazi"]], i.e. judge and administrators of the various towns that were located west of the city of Hyderabad – like Qandahar, [[Udgir]], [[Parbhani]], etc.

His grandmother's great grand father was the great Sufi [[Sayyid Sahib Husayni]], who is buried at Tekmal.

His grandfather [[Kazi Zainul Abedin]] who was the last of the [[Qadi|Kazis]] of [[Udgir]] was one of the earliest officers of the [[Hyderabad Civil Service]] and eventually rose up to the rank of a Secretary in the government of the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State]]. His father Kazi Abdur Rasheed also followed in the footsteps and joined the [[Hyderabad Civil Service]] in 1946, two years before the fall of [[Hyderabad State]] to Indian armed forces.

A year after the creation of [[Pakistan]], his grandfather [[Kazi Zainul Abedin]] moved to Pakistan and settled down in [[Mirpurkhas]], Sindh in 1948. [[Kazi Zainul Abedin]] spent the rest of his years at [[Mirpurkhas]] in developing agricultural farms and social work in that area. He died in 1962 and is buried on his farms there.

==Education and early life==
Kazi is a graduate in Chemical Engineering from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), Cambridge, Mass, USA.&lt;ref&gt;See the Wikipedia article on "List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni"&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued his graduate studies in at the Institute of Islamic Studies, [[McGill University]], Montreal Canada. Prior to his studies at MIT, he also studied at the [[Middle East Technical University]] (METU), Ankara, Turkey for 3 semesters.&lt;ref&gt;list of Pakistanis who studied at METU at http://home.ica.net/~rabbani/list/list_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent his high school years at [[Cadet College Petaro]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petaro.org and check under "Search for Petarian" for details&lt;/ref&gt; one of the premier institutions in Pakistan, from where he completed his Matriculation and Intermediate (FSc).  [[Cadet College Petaro]] is located around 160&amp;nbsp;km from [[Karachi]], the main port city of [[Pakistan]].  This college has produced many prominent Pakistanis who have excelled in every field in Pakistan.

In 1969, upon completion of his High School Certificate from Petaro, Kazi moved to Ankara, Turkey and was admitted to the Chemical Engineering program at the [[Middle East Technical University]] in the Fall of that year with a full merit scholarship from [[CENTO]]. Those were tumultuous years, and the university was going through a difficult period. With political upheavals influenced by Leftist and communist philosophies, [[Middle East Technical University]] was also hit badly. Boycott of classes and other Leftist student activities disrupted studies, leading to closure of the university for 6 months from March – August 1971 after a battle on campus between the Leftist students and the Turkish armed forces.

Dissatisfied with the loss of academic progress and the on-campus politics, Kazi then chose to make a move. He applied for transfer to [[MIT]], USA. He was granted admission as a transfer student in the Second year with scholarship and financial assistance from the university. He moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in September 1971. Subsequently, he graduated from [[MIT]] from the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1974.

Upon return to Pakistan from Canada, Kazi Zulkader married Ayesha in 1980. They have four children – Amina, Kazi Muhammad, Khadija and Sarah.

==Academic experience==
For the past several years, Kazi has also been a professor of Ethics, History and Religion at various universities in Pakistan.  He has been Professor of Civilization Studies and Medical Ethics at the [[Shifa College of Medicine]] ([[Bahria University]]) where he headed the "Physician and Society" program from 2003 to 2010. This unique program examined philosophical and medical ethics issues in a Muslim and Pakistani environment.

Previously, he has taught courses on History and Modern Muslim thought at the [[Hamdard University]], Islamabad Campus. He was also the Founder Head of the Department of Islamic Studies at the [[Women's Institute of Science and Humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;A list of faculty of WISH is given on their website at http://www.wish.edu.pk/F_Visiting.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Riphah International University]], Islamabad), where he remained as a visiting Professor in later years.

He has lectured extensively on various subjects related to civilizational studies, ethics, religion and technology in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ips.org.pk/IpsnewsText/IPS%20News%20Jan-March%202007-Fina.pdf "Capacity Building of RIU's Students Continues" on page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efsrilanka.info/2006_conference_Speaker_Biographies.htm international lecture delivered at Sri Lanka for the Eisenhower Foundation Fellowships program]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a member of the Editorial Committee of the well respected journal "Islamic Studies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiu.edu.pk/Institutes/Islamic%20Research%20Institute/Islamic_Studies.htm Islamic Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903201306/http://www.iiu.edu.pk/Institutes/Islamic%20Research%20Institute/Islamic_Studies.htm |date=3 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the Islamic Research Institute of the [[International Islamic University Islamabad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiu.edu.pk/Institutes/Islamic%20Research%20Institute/IS_Editorial_Committee.htm Editorial Committee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903063254/http://www.iiu.edu.pk/Institutes/Islamic%20Research%20Institute/IS_Editorial_Committee.htm |date=3 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar Energy and Other technologies==
[[File:Kazi at the 100MW Solar Power Plant Bahawalpur.jpg|thumb|Kazi Zulkader Siddiqui at the 100MW QA Solar Power Plant at Bahawalpur, Pakistan with ILF engineer Momin Awan]] [[File:Kazi at 100MW Solar Power Plant Bahawalpur Control Room.jpg|thumb|Kazi Zulkader Siddiqui in Control Room of the 100MW QA Solar Power Plant at Bahawalpur, Pakistan with Zhang Ting, Project Manager of TBEA SunOasis]]

The concept  and implementation of the Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park (QA Solar) at Bahawalpur was his single largest contribution towards development of solar energy technologies in Pakistan. He worked closely with the Government of Punjab to develop the concept of having a 1000MW solar power plant to reduce the energy shortage in the country. Working closely with TBEA of China, he was instrumental in the design, engineering, contractual implementation, construction and commissioning of the first 100MW of the project. This was the first ever grid-connected solar power plant built in Pakistan. In order to ensure highest performance and output, German consultants were employed to oversee the quality of the equipment used and the construction methodology. The project was implemented in record time. The construction of the plant took only 3 months once the design was approved by the consultants. The output of the plant is around 10 percent above the estimated capacity.

The Prime Minister of Pakistan awarded Kazi with a Gold Medal on the date of inauguration of the plant for his work in making this project a reality in record time and within budget, and for successfully coordinating between the client, consultants, contractors and other the utility companies involved.

Prior to his contributions in the field of solar energy, Kazi was responsible for the construction and implementation of several major mobile telephone infrastructure projects in Pakistan, Bangladesh, UAE and Afghanistan. This included the initial phases of construction and launch of infrastructure for Ufone (Pakistan), Warid Telecom (Pakistan), Warid Telecom (Bangladesh), Wateen Telecom (Pakistan) with the development of Main Switching Centers (MSCs) and BTS cell sites. He was also partially responsible for the infrastructure development of Mobilink (Pakistan), Zong (Pakistan), Etisalat (UAE), Afghan Wireless, and Telenor (Pakistan).

During his years in Saudi Arabia, he led the projects for the establishment of two chemical industries – production of corrosion inhibitors for gas turbines, and production of silicates and aluminates.

==Work with NGOs==

His work in different capacities with non-governmental organisations is well recognized in Pakistan. Most notable among these is his work with the Petarian Foundation which is certified by the Pakistan Council for Philanthropy.  Since its inception in 2003, he has been the chairman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petarianfoundation.org/management.htm |title=Petarian Foundation |publisher=Petarian Foundation |date=20 March 2002 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Petarian Foundation]], which offers scholarships to needy and meritorious students at [[Cadet College Petaro]], and runs teacher training programs.

The devastating earthquake&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawausa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=2 and also at http://www.pakistan-earthquake.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004063011/http://pakistan-earthquake.org/ |date=4 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the northern areas of Pakistan on 8 October 2005 brought the Petarian Foundation to offer relief programs, medical relief programs and reconstruction and rehabilitation programs under his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account of Kazi's leadership role during the earthquake relief can be found in the chapter "The Pious Patriot" in the book "Portraits of grief, and of hope" by Nizamuddin Siddiqui, Karachi, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the Petarian Foundation has disbursed nearly US$2.5 million worth of relief and reconstruction services in Bagh, AJK in cash and kind.

The Foundation also established relief camp for the Internally Displaced Persons from Swat at Peshawar in 2009, and for the affected population of the 2010 Floods in Pakistan. It set up relief camp at Jhimpir, Sindh, and constructed homes for people at Jhimpir, Dadu, and Peshawar District.

Kazi was also the founder President of the METUPAK Foundation, established by the Pakistani alumni of Middle East Technical University (METU). The foundation strove to establish a world class technical university in Pakistan on the lines of METU. Much of the work on this project was done and the foundation obtained the requisite approvals from the Higher Education Commission and the President of Pakistan in 2007. However, with the political upheavals that followed and changes in government, all such public sector university projects were abandoned by the government of the People's Party. The foundation had to abandon the project.

Another important milestone was the establishment of Hyderabad Foundation USA,&lt;ref&gt;http://hyderabadfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; which has the objective to support provision of free or low cost healthcare to the impoverished people of South Asia. Kazi has been the President of this foundation from its inception. The first project is the support and development for the Osmania Hospital in Karachi which is owned and operated on charitable basis by the Hyderabad Relief and Rehabilitation Trust.

==Other activities==

Since his return to Pakistan in 1995, Kazi has been involved in a number of activities and has contributed to support social sector and educational programs. He has been deeply involved in philanthropic organisations.

Due to his commitments, he was chosen to sit on the Board of Governors / Management Board of the following academic institutions:
*[[Cadet College Petaro]], Sindh, Pakistan
*[[Women's Institute of Science &amp; Humanities]], Islamabad, Pakistan&lt;ref&gt;A list of the Management Board of WISH is given at http://www.wish.edu.pk/MB.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cadet College Sialkot]], Punjab, Pakistan

During the tenure of Dr. Zafar Ishaq Ansari, he served as an honorary adviser on technology, and an [[ex-officio]] member of the Board of Research at the Islamic Research Institute of the [[International Islamic University Islamabad]], Pakistan for nearly 15 years.

Kazi is also an education counselor for new undergraduate applicants to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Cambridge MA, USA. He has also been a Member of the Nomination Committee for selection of candidates from Pakistan for the [[Eisenhower Foundation Fellowships]], Washington, DC.

==Publications==

'''Malan's triangles''' – comprising the ''triangle of conflict'' and the ''triangle of persons'' – were developed in 1979 by the psychotherapist [[David Malan (psychotherapist)|David Malan]] as a way of illuminating the phenomenon of [[transference]] in psychotherapy, both brief and extended.

Their application has continued to prove fruitful into the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;J. Grant.J. Crawley, ''Transference and Projection'' (2002) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
As Malan himself acknowledged, he drew the concept of his triangles from previous analytic writings (albeit combining in the process very different aspects of the tradition).  The American Freudian [[Karl Menninger]] - building on [[Franz Alexander]]'s concept of the totalizing transference interpretation, which linked past experience, life context and the analytic setting – set out what he called the triangle of insight,&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Malan, ''Towards the Validation of Dynamic Psychotherapy'' (2012) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; involving the three poles of analyst, past significant others, and present significant others.  This triangle Malan renamed as the triangle of persons.

Malan derived his second triangle from his [[Tavistock Clinic]] colleague, the [[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] group therapist [[Henry Ezriel]].  Ezriel had used a three-tiered interpretation for identifying  members' attitudes to the group – the required (surface) attitude, the wished-for attitude, and the catastrophic attitude (a traumatic expectation, fear of which helped turn the wished-for attitude into the required or conformist attitude).&lt;ref&gt;H. Spandler, ''Asylum to Action'' (2006) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplified, Ezriel's three tiers became Malan's triangle of conflict, comprising defence, impulse and anxiety.

==Usage==
Malan's achievement was to place these very differently-sourced triangles in juxtaposition, the one to illuminate intra-psychic processes, the other the inter-personal.   Malan himself claimed that “between them they can be used to represent almost every intervention that a therapist makes...skill consists in knowing which part of which triangle to include at any given moment”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Grant.J. Crawley, ''Transference and Projection'' (2002) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Both triangles should be imagined as inverted, standing on their apex – which in the one consisted of the unconscious impulse, in the other of early childhood links to the parents.  Much interpretation using the triangles concerns illuminating defences and current relationships, with reference to the unconscious feelings and personal transferences underlying them.&lt;ref&gt;J.

'''Marketing spending''' is an organization's total [[expenditure]] on [[marketing]] activities. This typically includes [[advertising]] and non-price [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]. It sometimes includes sales force spending and may also include price promotions. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 52 percent responded that they found the "marketing spending" metric very useful.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0137058292}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

To predict how selling costs change with sales, a firm must distinguish between [[fixed costs|fixed selling costs]] and [[variable costs|variable selling costs]]. Recognizing the difference between fixed and variable selling costs can help firms account for the relative risks associated with alternative sales strategies. In general, strategies that incur variable selling costs are less risky because variable selling costs will remain lower in the event that sales fail to meet expectations.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

== Purpose ==
This metric's purpose is to forecast marketing spending and assess budgeting risk. Marketing costs are often a major part of a firm’s overall discretionary expenditures. As such, they are important determinants of short-term profits. Of course, marketing and selling budgets can also be viewed as investments in acquiring and maintaining customers. From either perspective, however, it is useful to distinguish between fixed marketing costs and variable marketing costs. That is, managers must recognize which marketing costs will hold steady, and which will change with sales. Generally, this classification will require a "line-item by line-item" review of the entire marketing budget.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

Rather than varying with unit sales, total variable selling costs are more likely to vary directly with the monetary value of the units sold – that is, with revenue. Thus, it is more likely that variable selling costs will be expressed as a percentage of revenue, rather than a certain monetary amount per unit. The classification of selling costs as fixed or variable will depend on an organization’s structure and on the specific decisions of management. A number of items, however, typically fall into one category or the other – with the proviso that their status as fixed or variable can be time specific. In the long run, all costs eventually become variable.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

Over typical planning periods of a quarter or a year, fixed marketing costs might
include:&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;
* Sales force salaries and support.
* Major advertising campaigns, including production costs.
* Marketing staff.
* Sales promotion material, such as point-of-purchase sales aids, coupon production, and distribution costs.
* Cooperative advertising allowances based on prior-period sales.

Variable marketing costs might include:&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;
* Sales commissions paid to sales force, brokers or manufacturer representatives.
* Sales bonuses contingent on reaching sales goals.
* Off-invoice and performance allowances to trade, which are tied to current volume.
* Early payment terms (if included in sales promotion budgets).
* Coupon face-value payments and rebates, including processing fees.
* Bill-backs for local campaigns (a bill-back requires customers to submit proof of performance to receive payment or credit whereas an off-invoice are simply deducted from invoice totals). These are conducted by retailers but reimbursed by national brand and cooperative advertising allowances, based on current period sales.

Marketers often do not consider their budgets in fixed and variable terms, but they can derive at least two benefits by doing so.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

First, if marketing spending is in fact variable, then budgeting in this way is more accurate. Some marketers budget a fixed amount and then face an end-of-period discrepancy or "variance" if sales miss their declared targets. By contrast, a flexible budget – that is, one that takes account of its genuinely variable components – will reflect actual results, regardless of where sales end up.
Second, the short-term risks associated with fixed marketing costs are greater than those associated with variable marketing costs. If marketers expect revenues to be sensitive to factors outside their control – such as competitive actions or production shortages – they can reduce risk by including more variable and less fixed spending in their budgets.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

A classic decision that hinges on fixed marketing costs versus variable marketing costs is the choice between engaging third-party contract sales representatives versus an in-house sales force. Hiring a salaried – or predominantly salaried – sales force entails more risk than the alternative because salaries must be paid even if the firm fails to achieve its revenue targets. By contrast, when a firm uses third-party brokers to sell its goods on commission, its selling costs decline when sales targets are not met.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

== Construction ==
:''Total selling (marketing) costs ($)'' = Total fixed selling costs ($) + Total variable selling costs ($)&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

:''Total variable selling costs ($)'' = Revenue ($) * Variable selling cost (%)&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

'''Variable costs'''

There are many types of variable selling costs. For example, selling costs could be based upon a complicated formula, specified in a firm’s contracts with its brokers and dealers. Selling costs might include incentives to local dealers, which are tied to the achievement of specific sales targets. They might include promises to reimburse retailers for spending on cooperative advertising. Sales commissions represent one example of selling costs that vary in proportion to revenue. Consequently, any sales commissions should be included in variable selling costs.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

'''Fixed costs'''

By contrast, payments to a website for a fixed number of impressions or click-throughs, in a contract that calls for specific financial compensation, would more likely be classified as fixed costs. On the other hand, payments for conversions (sales) would be classified as variable marketing costs.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

'''Michael Paul Grace''' (1842 – September 20, 1920) was an Irish-American businessman who was a shareholder and chairman of the [[board of directors]] of [[W. R. Grace and Company]] shipping company of [[New York City]] and of [[Grace Brothers &amp; Co. Ltd.]] of [[London]], [[England]].

Born in [[Cobh|Queenstown]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. to a wealthy family, as a young man he went to [[Peru]] where his father had business interests and where he joined his brother [[William Russell Grace|William]] who had formed a partnership with John Bryce to operate as [[ship chandler]]s. William Grace would emigrate to the United States in 1865 where he established W. R. Grace &amp; Co. of New York, while Michael Grace remained in Peru developing government contacts for the business that became Grace Brothers &amp; Co.

Michael Grace expanded the business into new fields including a near monopoly in the business of supplying the construction contractors building Peru's railway system with [[Rail tracks|rail track]] iron and timber for [[Railroad tie|rail ties]] plus foodstuffs and other provisions. The Grace brothers' influence with the Peruvian government saw them obtain the most of the contracts to provide [[munitions]] and [[battle ship]]s during the Peru-Chile [[War of the Pacific]] between 1877 and 1884. When the war ended, Michael Grace traveled to England and in 1887 put together a consortium of lenders to provide the funding necessary to stabilize the cash-strapped government of Peru. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/08/31/100932670.pdf]

==The Oroya Railroad and the richest silver mine in the world==
Michael Grace too emigrated to the United States where he would become an American citizen. The Grace brothers, along with  Michael Grace's English son-in-law, [[Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 6th Earl of Donoughmore]], widened their business in Peru to include control of the [[guano]] deposits along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific coast]], vast tracts of land containing both oil and mineral deposits including [[Silver mining|silver mines]] at [[Cerro de Pasco]] that were reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in its June 22, 1885 edition as "probably the richest and most extensive in the world." In conjunction with the Cerro de Pasco mines, the Grace's acquired a ninety-nine year lease, the first seven of which were free, on the financially troubled [[Oroya Railroad]] originally built in early 1870s by American promoter [[Henry Meiggs]] but not fully completed. In that same June 22, 1885 story, ''The New York Times'' concluded that "Mr. Grace [Michael P.] gets a property which cost [[United States dollar|$]]27,600,900—86 miles of railroad already equipped and in operation, 50 miles of the most expensive tunneling and grading in the world—for nothing provided he will complete the line." [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/06/22/103024047.pdf]

==The New-York and Pacific Steamship Company==
From a base in [[Lima]], the Grace brothers set up representative offices throughout most of [[South America]] and through their Compania Salitrera obtained control over all [[nitrate]] exported by the government of [[Chile]]. Their business in Chile was such that they eventually established Grace &amp; Co. in [[Valparaíso]].  [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/12/22/103646844.pdf]  To support the vast Grace South American operations with lower costs and in-house control, in 1892 the Grace brothers established The New-York and Pacific Steamship Company, Limited, progenitor of their [[Grace Steamship Company]]. The operation began with a fleet of six newly built steam-powered freighters that shipped products manufactured in the United States from the port at New York City around [[Cape Horn]] to various ports on the west coast of [[South America]]. The ships returned with cargos of [[raw material]]s, primarily from the Grace brothers South American businesses.

The shipping company was incorporated and headquartered in London, England, with Michael Grace as chairman of the board. He began spending a part of each year in England where between 1894 and 1915 he leased [[Battle Abbey]] as a residence for his family. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512000241/http://www.battle-abbey.co.uk/visitor04.htm] He spent the other part of the year in the United States, where he maintained a home at [[Westbury, New York|Westbury]] on [[Long Island]] near daughter Margarita and her husband, [[John Shaffer Phipps]], of the prominent [[Phipps family]]. In 1916, Michael Grace oversaw Grace Steamship Company's addition of a [[mail delivery]] service between New York and its regular South American ports.

==Consolidation of holdings==
Michael and William Grace had a third brother, John W. Grace. For years he remained mostly out of the limelight running a business in [[San Francisco, California]]. However, with Michael based in [[London]], [[England]] for half the year plus his extensive travelling to [[South America]], when  William developed health problems in the early 1890s it made it necessary for John to come to New York to help oversee operations. As part of estate and successor planning, in 1895 the three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company incorporated in [[West Virginia]] called W. R. Grace &amp; Company. The consolidation involved W. R. Grace &amp; Co. of New York, Grace Brothers &amp; Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace &amp; Co. of Valparaíso, Chile, William R. Grace &amp; Co. of London, and J. W. Grace &amp; Co of San Francisco. The officers of the new company were:[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/01/11/102442787.pdf]
* President – William R. Grace
* 1st Vice-President – Michael P. Grace
* 2nd Vice-President – John W. Grace
* Secretary &amp; Director – Edward Eyre
* Director – Lillius Grace (Mrs. W. R.)
* Treasurer – J. Louis Schaefer

J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W. R. Grace &amp; Company in which he became a vice-president, but also as president of [[Grace National Bank]]. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the Estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, [[Joseph Peter Grace, Sr.|Joseph P. Grace]]. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927. [https://www.nytimes.com/1929/02/21/archives/jl-schaefer-left-2962588-estate-family-receives-fortune-of-vice.html]

William Grace died in March 1904 in New York and brother John in September of that same year in London, England. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/781822082.html?dids=781822082:781822082&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Sep+20%2C+1904&amp;author=&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=John+W.+Grace+Dies+In+England&amp;pqatl=google]. Michael Grace then assumed control of all their companies. Because he had four daughters but no sons, Michael took William's most capable son, [[Joseph Peter Grace, Sr.|Joseph]], under his wing and would eventually transfer his interest in the Grace businesses to him.

==Family==
Michael Grace married Margarita Mason (1848-1930) The couple had four daughters: Elisa, Elaina, Margarita, and Gladys. Tragedy struck the family on August 10, 1917 when daughter Elisa drowned while swimming in a lake in [[Italy]]. Elisa married the [[Hubert Beaumont (Liberal politician)|Hon. Hubert Beaumont]], a former [[British House of Commons|Member of the British Parliament]] for [[Eastbourne (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastbourne]]. Elisa and Michael Beaumont had one child, [[Michael Beaumont (politician)|Michael Beaumont]]. She was working as a volunteer for the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War I]] at the time of her death. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/08/17/102361285.pdf]

Margarita married American businessman [[John Shaffer Phipps]] in 1903.

While on an annual business trip to London, England in the late summer of 1920, the then seventy-eight-year-old Michael Grace died. He, and his wife Margarita, are buried in the churchyard in Battle Abbey.

Located east of the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]] in the [[Presnensky District]] of the [[Central Administrative Okrug]], the MIBC is currently under development. Construction of the MIBC took place on the Presnenskaya Embankment next to the [[Moskva River]], approximately {{convert|4|km|mi|sp=us}} west of [[Red Square]], and just east of the Third Ring Road. The project occupies an area of 60 hectares,&lt;ref name="Citynext.ru"/&gt; with the territory chosen being the only area in central Moscow that can accommodate such a project.

The MIBC is expected to become the first zone in [[Russia]] to combine business activity, living space and entertainment in one single development.&lt;ref name="Citynext.ru"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citynext.ru/ |title=ОАО "СИТИ"&amp;nbsp;– Москва-Сити&amp;nbsp;– Московский международный деловой центр |publisher=Citynext.ru |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Moscow government first conceived the project in 1992.&lt;ref name="Design Build Network"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/mibc/ |title=Moscow International Business Centre (MIBC), Moscow |publisher=Design Build Network |date= |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 250,000&amp;nbsp;– 300,000 people will be working in, living in, or visiting the complex at any given time.&lt;ref name="Citynext.ru" /&gt; MIBC includes 6 skyscrapers with maximum height of 300 meters or more ([[List of tallest buildings in Shanghai|Shanghai has 5]], [[List of tallest buildings in Hong Kong|Hong Kong has 6]], [[List of tallest buildings in Chicago|Chicago has 6]], [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|New York has 8]]). Europe's second tallest building, the [[Federation Tower]], is in the  MIBC. The complex also includes the [[OKO Tower|third-tallest]], [[Mercury City Tower|fourth-tallest]], [[Eurasia (building)|sixth-tallest]], [[City of Capitals|seventh-tallest]], and [[Naberezhnaya Tower|eighth-tallest]] buildings in [[Europe]]. By 2016 twelve of twenty-three planned facilities of MIBC were already built, seven buildings are in construction and four are in the design stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tekstilschiky.mos.ru/presscenter/news/detail/3324736.html|title=«Москва-Сити» к 2018 году развернется на 100 га|website=tekstilschiky.mos.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== History ==
Before construction began, the area had been an old [[stone quarry]] where most of the buildings were old factories and industrial complexes that had been closed or abandoned. In order to manage the project, a public company, CITY, was created in 1992 in order to oversee the initial creation and development of Moscow City as well as its subsequent usage. CITY is also a general contractor and both landlord and leaser. Overall responsibility for the [[Architectural plan|architectural planning]] and design of Moscow City belongs to the architectural studio No. 6, which is a part of the large Moscow practice Mosproject-2 named after Mikhail Vasilyevich Posokhin. This group, headed by Gennady Lvovich Sirota, who is officially the Chief Architect of Moscow City, is in charge of overseeing the design of the complex as a whole and agreeing the details of individual projects. Each building lot has its own investor and architect. By 2014 the volume of investments in Moscow City was approximately $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2014/03/18/25-let-spustya|title=Анатомия проекта: 25 лет спустя|first=|last=Ведомости|date=18 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
Established in the spring of 1992, the [[Open joint-stock company|PJSC]] City Company manages the creation and development of the MIBC. On December 30, 1994, the [[Government of Moscow]] authorized PJSC City to act as the managing company for the MIBC and to negotiate with third parties to help develop the MIBC. As of February 2014, the company is owned by the Solvers Group led by Oleg Malis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2014/06/16/poslednie-kogo-zdes-zhdali-lyudi-kotorye-pridut-navodit|title="Последние, кого здесь ждали, - люди, которые придут наводить порядок", - Олег Малис, управляющий партнер группы Solvers|last=Ведомости|date=2014-06-16|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citymoscow.ru/about|title=ПАО «СИТИ» {{!}} Управляющая компания ММДЦ «Москва-Сити»|website=citymoscow.ru|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

=== Pedestrian ===
The [[Bagration Bridge]] is a pedestrian bridge that goes over the [[Moskva River]]. It connects Tower 2000 and the rest of the MIBC complex.

=== Road ===
To correspond with the growing MIBC, new highways and interchanges were built to connect the MIBC with the main transport arteries of the city. These projects include the ten-lane Dorogomilovsky Bridge of the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]] over the [[Moskva River]], the Third Ring Road interchange with [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt|Kutuzovsky Avenue]], and the extension of the Presnenskaya Embankment. Existing roads were reconstructed and rearranged.

Major thoroughfares that connect to the MIBC are the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]], 3rd Magistralnaya street, and the Presnenskaya Embankment.

=== Rapid transit ===
The MIBC is served by several [[Moscow Metro|metro]] stations, two of which are named Delovoy Tsentr ([[Russian language|Russian]] for business district). Stations [[Vystavochnaya]] (formerly known as Delovoy Tsentr) and [[Mezhdunarodnaya (Moscow Metro)|Mezhdunarodnaya]] opened on the [[Filyovskaya Line]] in 2005 and 2006 respectively, [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko–Solntsevskaya line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] on the [[Kalininsko–Solntsevskaya line|Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line]] in 2014, and a [[Delovoy Tsentr (Bolshaya Koltsevaya line)|second Delovoy Tsentr]] on the [[Bolshaya Koltsevaya line]] in 2017.

The MIBC in addition is served by [[Moscow Central Circle]] with the station also named [[Delovoy Tsentr (Moscow Central Circle)|Delovoy Tsentr]] which opened in 2016. There are also plans to install a high-speed rail system between the MIBC and [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]].

The '''National Outsourcing Association''' (NOA) was founded in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1987 by Martyn Hart. The organisation was the first European association to promote effective [[outsourcing]] and it is the parent of the federal [[European outsourcing association]].

The NOA operates as a [[not-for-profit]] trade association and aims to promote best practice in outsourcing, lobbying government and regulators, and provide research and information to companies and managers using outsourcing. The NOA has developed Pathway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/pathway/ |title=Pathway &amp;#124; National Outsourcing Association |publisher=Noa.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a university accredited professional development qualification for the UK’s outsourcing industry.

The NOA includes the OUT Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/outgroup/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331231349/http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/outgroup/ |date=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the commercial arm of the NOA which was created in 2004. The NOA are also associated with sourcingfocus.com, a leading online news resource portal for the sourcing community.

==Outsource magazine==
In 2006 the NOA partnered with [[Outsource magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/publications/ |title=Publications |publisher=Noa.co.uk |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (published by EMP Media), an independent magazine serving the [[outsourcing]] space and the first magazine to do so. [[Outsource magazine]] became the NOA's official partner magazine. Additionally, [[Outsource magazine|Outsource]] became the first magazine serving the [[outsourcing]] sector to achieve [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK)|ABC]] audit in Sep 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.org.uk/Certificates/17478713.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paulus Johannes Zimmerman''' (born 8 November 1958), better known as '''Paul Zimmerman''', is a Dutch-born Hong Kong environmentalist, politician and businessman. He is a member of the [[Southern District Council]] for [[Pokfulam (constituency)|Pokfulam]] and CEO of Designing Hong Kong, a group that advocates better [[urban design]].

==Early life and business career==
Zimmerman was born in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]] of Jewish origin in 1958, and grew up in the town of [[Woerden]]. He set up a student union in high school and joined the editorial board of an underground newspaper. When he was 17, in response to the dismissal of several popular teachers, Zimmerman took part in a demonstration in which protesters barricaded the building. The school was closed for a week and the offending headmaster replaced.&lt;ref name="Dodging"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1846988/how-paul-zimmerman-came-hong-kong-dodge-military-draft | title = Paul Zimmerman on dodging the military and ditching his Dutch passport

He pursued a Master's programme in Social Science (Economics) at [[Erasmus University]] in Rotterdam. While there, he got into politics with the [[Democrats 66]] (D66).&lt;ref name="Dodging"/&gt;

In 1984, he moved to Hong Kong as a three-month trainee in a Dutch bank to avoid [[Conscription in the Netherlands|conscription]]. Deciding against a banking career, by 1987 he had started his own business, a graphic design firm called Bridge Design, and sold it 10 years later to Caribiner International, organisers of the [[Hong Kong Handover]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Zimmerman|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=61127083&amp;privcapId=31164655| publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work for what later became communications agency Jack Morton until 2001.&lt;ref name="Dodging"/&gt;

In 2000, he founded a strategy and policy consultancy called the Experience Group.

In the early 2000s, Zimmerman worked alongside businessman Chung Po-yan on a project that later became Designing Hong Kong Harbourfront District, a non-governmental organisation devoted to improving Hong Kong's waterfronts and promoting liveable density.&lt;ref name="upclose"/&gt; The Government set up the Harbourfront Enhancement Committee in 2004 in response to the project.&lt;ref name="Dodging"/&gt;

He was an executive director at investments umbrella company Jebsen Travel International from 2003 to 2010. He remains on the Board as a non-executive director. He retired from the position to focus his efforts on Designing Hong Kong and the Southern District Council.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Designing" /&gt;

He is currently the vice-chairman of the Coalition on Sustainable Tourism and a member of the advisory committee at Ocean Park Academy. He is also a member of the [[Professional Commons]] and director of the [[Civic Exchange]]. In 2015, he became the chairman of the [[Hong Kong Democratic Foundation]]. He was also a director of the moderate political group [[Path of Democracy]] for a brief period of time.

He is an Honorary Member of the [[American Institute of Architects]] for his work on the harbourfront.&lt;ref name = "Designing" /&gt;

==Political career==
[[file:LawAndZimmerman.jpg|thumb|Zimmerman alongside [[Deanie Ip]] and [[Nathan Law]].]]
In 2006, lawmakers [[Audrey Eu Yuet-mee]], [[Albert Lai Kwong-tak]] and [[Ronny Tong Ka-wah]] asked Zimmerman to join the [[Civic Party]] as a founding member. He represented the Civics in a run for a Tourism Subsector seat on the [[Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector election, 2006|Hong Kong Election Committee in 2006]] but was not elected.

In the [[Hong Kong local elections, 2007|2007 District Council election]], Zimmerman ran against Wong Wang-tai in [[Stubbs Road (constituency)|Stubbs Road]] in [[Wan Chai District Council]], a upper-middle-class constituency, but lost by a margin of 129 votes. He later won a seat in [[Pokfulam (constituency)|Pokfulam]] in the [[Southern District Council]] in a by-election in 2010, succeeding Ronald Chan Ngok-pang who resigned after being hired by the [[Office of the Chief Executive|Chief Executive's Office]]. He was re-elected in 2011 and 2015.

His first bid for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] was in 2008 when he ran in the [[Tourism (constituency)|Tourism]] [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]]. He lost in a four-way contest to independent [[Paul Tse]], receiving 81 votes.

In 2012, Zimmerman intended to run in the territory-wide [[District Council (Second)]] "super seat" in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2012|2012 Legislative Council election]] and left the Civic Party when the party refused to nominate him. He gave up his Dutch citizenship but did not get enough nominations and subsequently endorsed another pro-democracy candidate [[Frederick Fung]]. He also ran in the [[National People's Congress election, 2012 (Hong Kong)|2012 election of the Hong Kong delegates]] to the [[National People's Congress]] but was not successful in an election better suited to pro-Beijing candidates.

On 1 October 2014, Zimmerman took a yellow umbrella to protest at a [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|China National Day]] reception in Hong Kong in the midst of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|Occupy Central protests]], in which thousands of activists took to the streets to protest at Chinese government's [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision]] retarding democratic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29446266|publisher= [[BBC]] |title=Paul Zimmerman: 'Why I took umbrella to China National Day in HK'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]], Zimmerman ran in [[Hong Kong Island (constituency)|Hong Kong Island]] as an independent democrat. He dropped out of the race within a week of the election because he did not want to split the vote among pro-democratic candidates, but his name still appeared on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|title=Hong Kong Island's Paul Zimmerman suspends campaign|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/09/02/breaking-hong-kong-islands-paul-zimmerman-suspend-campaign/|work= [[Hong Kong Free Press]] |date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He once again sought election in the [[Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector elections, 2016]], this time in the [[Election Committee#Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape|Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape Subsector]]. Of the 30 winners, Zimmerman had the most votes, 2524.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Committee Subsector Ordinary Elections results (Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201612/12/P2016121200560p.htm|website=GovHK|accessdate=5 May 2017|date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined 20 other electors (from the 1,194 total) in nominating former judge [[Woo Kwok-hing]] for [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] in the small-circle [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|2017 election]].

'''Place management''' is the process of making places better. This is practiced through programmes to improve a location or to maintain an already attained desired standard of operation. Place management can be undertaken by private, public or voluntary organisations or a mixture of each. Despite the wide variety of place management initiatives the underlying common factor is usually a desire to maximise the effectiveness of a location for its users, whether they are residents, shoppers, tourists, investors, property developers or business owners.

== Overview ==
Place management is defined by the Institute of Place Management as "a coordinated, area-based, multi-stakeholder approach to improve locations, harnessing the skills, experiences and resources of those in the private, public and voluntary sectors".&lt;ref name=IPM&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Place Management Website|url=http://www.placemanagement.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a conceptual field it remains relatively underdeveloped because of its infancy.

== History ==
Place management has its roots in the [[management]] of towns, cities, neighbourhoods and other locations. The reasons for the need for place management are compelling. The proportion of the world’s population living in cities has grown from 13% in 1900 to nearly 50% now.&lt;ref name="Grimond"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimond|first=J. |title=The World goes to town|journal=The Economist|date=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes particularly in healthcare and technology have led to dramatic shifts in migration practices. Fluctuations in the movement of people places a strain on both urban and rural locations.

Migration is not limited between rural and urban locations but can also happen between countries, creating issues relating to cultural integration. People will migrate for numerous reasons often linked with finding a better quality of life either through superior employment prospects, escaping war or poverty, or even to enjoy a better climate. This can create problems for locations which become exposed to increases in population, decreases in population, or a shift in the demographic composition of a population. Places subsequently act as focal points for the occurrence of phenomena such as [[globalisation]] and the [[clash of civilisations]].

Factors such as changing technology not only drive migration, but can in themselves trouble the prosperity of places. Technological development was a driver behind the [[Industrial Revolution]] which led to high levels of migration into urban locations. However, further technological development rendered many of the primary functions of successful industrial cities as obsolete towards the end of the twentieth century. Grimond cites [[New York City]] as being one city which “went through a bad patch in the 1970s” while other major cities, such as [[Manchester]] in the UK which is famed for instigating the Industrial Revolution, also suffered.&lt;ref name="Grimond"/&gt; Rapid technological and industrial change not only creates jobs but can also cause mass unemployment, damaging local economies and leaving pockets of deprivation across regions.

Another important factor in the development of the field of place management is the impact of the retail sector. As a non-judicial parliamentary review of the UK retail sector states, retailing is a necessity for local populations, supplying food and goods in the absence of self agricultural practices. However, shifts in the sector influenced by national and multi-national companies have led to the globalisation of the sector, which raises concerns about the sustainability of the supply of goods and the effectiveness of local economies. Furthermore, all business practices, either positively or negatively, can impact upon the prosperity of the area it is based through the employment of people, investment and skills retention.

As it now appears to be accepted that for numerous reasons places undergo a process evolution which can impact upon their prosperity, it has become more widely acknowledged that deliberate and co-ordinated intervention in this evolution is desirable. Recognising a symbiotic relationship between the prosperity of a location and the prosperity of retail, firms Boots the Chemist, J Sainsburys and Marks &amp; Spencer in the UK contributed to the development of place management by supporting local authorities in the formation of locally based intervention schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atcm.org/about/what-is-tcm.php Association of Town Centre Management Website]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the appointments of the [[United Kingdom]]'s first town centre managers in [[Ilford]] and the London Borough of Redbridge in 1987. This consequently led to the formation of the Association of Town Centre Management.&lt;ref&gt;Warnaby, G., Alexander, A., Medway, D. (1998), "Town centre management in the UK: a review, synthesis and research agenda", [[The International Review of Retail Distribution and Consumer Research]], Vol. 8 No.1, pp.15-31&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1987 and 2000 around 500 town centre management schemes covering 600 towns and cities dedicated to co-ordinating various functions of a particular location have been established.

Since the 1970s and 1980s, similar intervention schemes were practiced elsewhere under different guises including urban revitalisation in Poland, activity centre management in Australia, and business improvement districts in the US. Despite their differences, as they each embody the aim of improving the effectiveness of a location, the Institute of Place Management has sought to unify them under the banner of ‘place management’ borrowing a term which was originally conceived in Australia.

== Nature ==
Place management has existed for over 20 years in a variety of forms. It is encompassed within the practice of acts including town centre management, urban revitalisation, activity centre management, regeneration, management, marketing, economic development, neighbourhood management, neighbourhood renewal, socio-economic revitalisation, community development and business improvement district management.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, C. 2008. "Extended editorial: place - the trinal frontier" Journal of Place Management and Development, Vol 1 No. 1, pp 5-14&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exist questions about the practical nature of place management because no clear consensus has yet been developed.

Questions include both the positive and normative aspects of place management. The overwhelming amount of variables which impact upon the effectiveness of a location in serving the needs of its users makes it difficult to determine if place management is being practised in a particular location, how it is being practiced and how it should be practiced. A mixture of cultural, societal, demographic, economic, religious, political, legal and technological issues may all play a role. This is problematic for both the academic and the practical determination of place management.

Although this term is relatively new, place management has, in practice, become an established concept over the last twenty years in Europe, having existed in parts of North America for much longer. It is also an emerging concept in other parts of the world such as Asia and Australia. The concept embraces management of a wide range of locations, which may include public and private spaces of various sizes and geographical spaces. Consequently, place management can take a number of forms. Initiatives can be differentiated by the origins of the resources which support it and the degree of formality which underpins the agreement to secure resources from the various funding bodies.

One example is a community-based (bottom-up) approach, where communities or businesses take the initiative of improving their street, town centre, public park or engage actively with NGOs and the voluntary sector. Among many other examples, this approach has been trialled successfully since 1995 by an association of independent retailers in Granollers, Spain where a not-for-profit association was formed which aimed to enhance the local area for residents and consumers, investing revenue in improvements and charitable causes.&lt;ref&gt;Coca-Stefaniak J.A., Parker C., Barbany A., Garrell X. and Segovia E. (2005), Gran Centre Granollers city, culture and commerce, [[The International Review of Retail Distribution and Consumer Research]], Vol.33 No.9&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates an informal place management initiative.

A [[business improvement district]] (BID) is a predominantly private partnership (although it can also encompass some public resources) in which businesses in a defined area elect to pay an additional tax in order to fund improvements to the district's public realm and trading environment. These businesses hope to see a return on their investment through an increase in customer spend within the location. The concept of the BID is believed to have been developed in Canada before spreading to the US and across the globe. Unlike the Granollers example, as a BID is a formal place management initiative because it acts as an additional tax which is legally recognised in many of the areas in which they have been set up.

Contrary to the ‘bottom-up’ approach, many place management schemes have been initially formed publicly by local government, which has provided funding to create the post of a place manager.  Local government is often seen as a natural home for place management initiatives, as its remit will be to obtain a desired standard of living for its residents. However, the additional financial burden or a lack of place management expertise can hamper efforts to locate place management initiatives with local government.

In [[economics]], a '''production function''' relates quantities of physical output of a production process to quantities of physical inputs or production function refers as the expression of the technological relation between physical inputs and outputs of the goods.  The production function is one of the key concepts of [[mainstream economics|mainstream]] [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] theories, used to define [[marginal product]] and to distinguish [[allocative efficiency]], a key focus of economics. The primary purpose of the production function is to address allocative efficiency in the use of factor inputs in production and the resulting distribution of income to those factors, while abstracting away from the technological problems of achieving technical efficiency, as an engineer or professional manager might understand it. 

In [[macroeconomics]], aggregate production functions are [[regression analysis|estimated]] to create a framework in which to distinguish how much of [[economic growth]] to attribute to changes in factor allocation (e.g. the accumulation of [[physical capital]]) and how much to attribute to advancing [[technology]].  Some [[heterodox economics|non-mainstream economists]], however, reject the very concept of an aggregate production function.&lt;ref name="Daly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

==The theory of production functions==
In general, economic output is ''not'' a (mathematical) function of input, because any given set of inputs can be used to produce a range of outputs. To satisfy the mathematical definition of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], a production function is customarily assumed to specify the ''maximum'' output obtainable from a given set of inputs.  The production function, therefore, describes a boundary or frontier representing the limit of output obtainable from each feasible combination of input. (Alternatively, a production function can be defined as the specification of the minimum input requirements needed to produce designated quantities of output.) Assuming that maximum output is obtained from given inputs allows economists to abstract away from technological and managerial problems associated with realizing such a technical maximum, and to focus exclusively on the problem of [[allocative efficiency]], associated with the ''economic'' choice of how much of a factor input to use, or the degree to which one factor may be substituted for another. In the production function itself, the relationship of output to inputs is non-monetary; that is, a production function relates physical inputs to physical outputs, and prices and costs are not reflected in the function.

In the decision frame of a firm making economic choices regarding production—how much of each factor input to use to produce how much output—and facing market prices for output and inputs, the production function represents the possibilities afforded by an exogenous technology. Under certain assumptions, the production function can be used to derive a [[marginal product]] for each factor. The profit-maximizing firm in perfect competition (taking output and input prices as given) will choose to add input right up to the point where the marginal cost of additional input matches the marginal product in additional output. This implies an ideal division of the income generated from output into an income due to each input factor of production, equal to the marginal product of each input.

The inputs to the production function are commonly termed [[factors of production]] and may represent primary factors, which are stocks.  Classically, the primary factors of production were Land, Labour and Capital. Primary factors do not become part of the output product, nor are the primary factors, themselves, transformed in the production process.  The production function, as a theoretical construct, may be abstracting away from the secondary factors and intermediate products consumed in a production process. The production function is not a full model of the production process: it deliberately abstracts from inherent aspects of physical production processes that some would argue are essential, including error, entropy or waste, and the consumption of energy or the co-production of pollution. Moreover, production functions do not ordinarily model the [[Business model|business processes]], either, ignoring the role of strategic and operational business management. (For a primer on the fundamental elements of microeconomic production theory, see [[production theory basics]]).

The production function is central to the marginalist focus of neoclassical economics, its definition of efficiency as allocative efficiency, its analysis of how market prices can govern the achievement of allocative efficiency in a decentralized economy, and an analysis of the distribution of income, which attributes factor income to the marginal product of factor input.

===Specifying the production function===

A production function can be expressed in  a functional form as the right side of
:&lt;math&gt;Q = f(X_1,X_2,X_3,\dotsc,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity of output and
&lt;math&gt;X_1,X_2,X_3,\dotsc,X_n&lt;/math&gt; are the quantities of factor inputs (such as capital, labour, land or raw materials).

If &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar, then this form does not encompass joint production, which is a production process that has multiple co-products. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; maps from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; then it is a joint production function expressing the determination of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; different types of output based on the joint usage of the specified quantities of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; inputs.

One formulation, unlikely to be relevant in practice, is as a linear function:
:&lt;math&gt;Q=a_0+a_1 X_1+a_2 X_2+a_3 X_3+\dotsb+a_n X_n&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_0, \dots, a_n&lt;/math&gt; are parameters that are determined empirically.
Another is as a [[Cobb–Douglas]] production function:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = a_0 X_1^{a_1} X_2^{a_2} \cdots X_n^{a_n} .&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Leontief production function]] applies to situations in which inputs must be used in fixed proportions; starting from those proportions, if usage of one input is increased without another being increased, output will not change. This production function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \min (a_1X_1, a_2X_2, \dotsc, a_n X_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Other forms include the [[Constant Elasticity of Substitution|constant elasticity of substitution]] production function (CES), which is a generalized form of the Cobb–Douglas function, and the quadratic production function. The best form of the equation to use and the values of the parameters (&lt;math&gt;a_0, \dots, a_n&lt;/math&gt;) vary from company to company and industry to industry. In a short run production function at least one of the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'s (inputs) is fixed. In the long run all factor inputs are variable at the discretion of management.

Moysan and Senouci (2016) provide an analytical formula for all 2-input, neoclassical production functions.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite journal |first=G. |last=Moysan and |first2=M. |last2=Senouci |year=2016 |title=A note on 2-input neoclassical production functions |work=Journal of Mathematical Economics |doi=10.1016/j.jmateco.2016.09.011 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01383290/document }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production function as a graph===
[[image:stages of production small.png|frame|Quadratic production function]]

Any of these equations can be plotted on a graph. A typical (quadratic) production function is shown in the following diagram under the assumption of a single variable input (or fixed ratios of inputs so they can be treated as a single variable). All points above the production function are unobtainable with current technology, all points below are technically feasible, and all points on the function show the maximum quantity of output obtainable at the specified level of usage of the input. From point A to point C, the firm is experiencing positive but decreasing marginal returns to the variable input. As additional units of the input are employed, output increases but at a decreasing rate. Point B is the point beyond which there are diminishing average returns, as shown by the declining slope of the average physical product curve (APP) beyond point Y. Point B is just tangent to the steepest ray from the origin hence the average physical product is at a maximum. Beyond point B, mathematical necessity requires that the marginal curve must be below the average curve (See [[production theory basics]] for further explanation.).

===Stages of production===

To simplify the interpretation of a production function, it is common to divide its range into 3 stages. In Stage 1 (from the origin to point B) the variable input is being used with increasing output per unit, the latter reaching a maximum at point B (since the average physical product is at its maximum at that point). Because the output per unit of the variable input is improving throughout stage 1, a price-taking firm will always operate beyond this stage.

In Stage 2, output increases at a decreasing rate, and the average and [[marginal physical product]] both decline. However, the average product of fixed inputs (not shown) is still rising, because output is rising while fixed input usage is constant. In this stage, the employment of additional variable inputs increases the output per unit of fixed input but decreases the output per unit of the variable input. The optimum input/output combination for the price-taking firm will be in stage 2, although a firm facing a downward-sloped demand curve might find it most profitable to operate in Stage 1.
In Stage 3, too much variable input is being used relative to the available fixed inputs: variable inputs are over-utilized in the sense that their presence on the margin obstructs the production process rather than enhancing it. The output per unit of both the fixed and the variable input declines throughout this stage. At the boundary between stage 2 and stage 3, the highest possible output is being obtained from the fixed input.

===Shifting a production function===
By definition, in the long run the firm can change its scale of operations by adjusting the level of inputs that are fixed in the short run, thereby shifting the production function upward as plotted against the variable input. If fixed inputs are lumpy, adjustments to the scale of operations may be more significant than what is required to merely balance production capacity with demand. For example, you may only need to increase production by  million units per year to keep up with demand, but the production equipment upgrades that are available may involve increasing productive capacity by 2 million units per year.

[[image:shifting production function small.png|frame|Shifting a production function]]

If a firm is operating at a profit-maximizing level in stage one, it might, in the long run, choose to reduce its scale of operations (by selling capital equipment). By reducing the amount of fixed capital inputs, the production function will shift down. The beginning of stage 2 shifts from B1 to B2. The (unchanged) profit-maximizing output level will now be in stage 2.

===Homogeneous and homothetic production functions===
There are two special classes of production functions that are often analyzed. The production function &lt;math&gt;Q = f(X_1,X_2,\dotsc,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, if given any positive constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(kX_1, kX_2,\dotsc,kX_n) = k^m f(X_1, X_2,\dotsc,X_n)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;m&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the function exhibits [[Economy of scale|increasing]] [[returns to scale]], and it exhibits [[Diseconomy of scale|decreasing]] returns to scale if &lt;math&gt;m &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. If it is homogeneous of degree &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, it exhibits '''constant''' returns to scale. The presence of [[Returns to scale#Economies of scale|increasing returns]] means that a one percent increase in the usage levels of all inputs would result in a greater than one percent increase in output; the presence of decreasing returns means that it would result in a less than one percent increase in output. Constant returns to scale is the in-between case. In the Cobb–Douglas production function referred to above, returns to scale are increasing if &lt;math&gt;a_1+a_2+\dotsb+a_n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, decreasing if &lt;math&gt;a_1+a_2+\dotsb+a_n &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, and constant if &lt;math&gt;a_1+a_2+\dotsb+a_n = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

If a production function is homogeneous of degree one, it is sometimes called "linearly homogeneous". A linearly homogeneous production function with inputs capital and labour has the properties that the marginal and average physical products of both capital and labour can be expressed as functions of the capital-labour ratio alone. Moreover, in this case if each input is paid at a rate equal to its marginal product, the firm's revenues will be exactly exhausted and there will be no excess economic profit.&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Alpha C. (1984) ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', third edition, McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.412–414}}

Homothetic functions are functions whose marginal technical rate of substitution (the slope of the [[isoquant]], a curve drawn through the set of points in say labour-capital space at which the same quantity of output is produced for varying combinations of the inputs) is homogeneous of degree zero. Due to this, along rays coming from the origin, the slopes of the isoquants will be the same. Homothetic functions are of the form &lt;math&gt;F(h(X_1, X_2))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;F(y)&lt;/math&gt; is a monotonically increasing function (the derivative of &lt;math&gt;F(y)&lt;/math&gt; is positive (&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}F/\mathrm{d}y &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;)), and the function &lt;math&gt; h(X_1, X_2) &lt;/math&gt; is a homogeneous function of any degree.

===Aggregate production functions===
{{See also|Cambridge capital controversy}}
In [[macroeconomics]], aggregate production functions for whole nations are sometimes constructed. In theory they are the summation of all the production functions of individual producers; however there are methodological problems associated with aggregate production functions, and economists have debated extensively whether the concept is valid.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

===Criticisms of the production function theory===

There are two major criticisms{{which|date=September 2014}} of the standard form of the production function.&lt;ref&gt;On the history of production functions, see {{cite journal |first=S. K. |last=Mishra |year=2007 |title=A Brief History of Production Functions |work=Working Paper |ssrn=1020577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====On the concept of capital====
During the 1950s, '60s, and '70s there was a lively debate about the theoretical soundness of production functions (see the [[Capital controversy]]). Although the criticism was directed primarily at aggregate production functions, microeconomic production functions were also put under scrutiny. The debate began in 1953 when [[Joan Robinson]] criticized the way the factor input [[Capital (economics)|capital]] was measured and how the notion of factor proportions had distracted economists. She wrote:

"The production function has been a powerful instrument of miseducation. The student of economic theory is taught to write Q = f (L, K ) where L is a quantity of labor, K a quantity of capital and Q a rate of output of commodities. [They] are instructed to assume all workers alike, and to measure L in man-hours of labor; [they] are told something about the index-number problem in choosing a unit of output; and then [they] are hurried on to the next question, in the hope that [they] will forget to ask in what units K is measured. Before [they] ever do ask, [they] have become a professor, and so sloppy habits of thought are handed on from one generation to the next".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Production Function and the Theory of Capital |first=Joan |last=Robinson |year=1953 |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=21 |issue= |pages= [p. 81] |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the argument, it is impossible to conceive of capital in such a way that its quantity is independent of the rates of [[interest]] and [[wages]]. The problem is that this independence is a precondition of constructing an isoquant. Further, the slope of the isoquant helps determine relative factor prices, but the curve cannot be constructed (and its slope measured) unless the prices are known beforehand.

====On the empirical relevance====
As a result of the criticism on their weak theoretical grounds, it has been claimed that empirical results firmly support the use of neoclassical ''well behaved'' aggregate production functions. Nevertheless, [[Anwar Shaikh (economist)|Anwar Shaikh]]  has demonstrated that they also have no empirical relevance, as long as alleged good fit outcomes from an accounting identity, not from any underlying laws of production/distribution.&lt;ref name="Shaikh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaikh |first=A. |year=1974 |title=Laws of Production and Laws of Algebra: The Humbug Production Function |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=115–120 |doi= 10.2307/1927538|jstor=1927538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural resources====
{{See also | Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising neoclassical economics (weak versus strong sustainability)}}
[[Natural resource]]s are usually absent in production functions. When [[Robert Solow]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]] attempted to develop a more realistic production function by including natural resources, they did it in a manner economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] criticized as a "conjuring trick": Solow and Stiglitz had failed to take into account the [[laws of thermodynamics]], since their variant allowed man-made capital to be a complete substitute for natural resources. Neither Solow nor Stiglitz reacted to Georgescu-Roegen's criticism, despite an invitation to do so in the September 1997 issue of the journal ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]''.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Forum on Georgescu-Roegen versus Solow/Stiglitz |journal= Ecological Economics |volume=22 |issue=3 |year=1997 |pages= 261–306 |doi= 10.1016/S0921-8009(97)00080-3 |author= Daly, H }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Daly2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Daly |first=Herman E. |authorlink=Herman Daly |date=1999 |chapter=How long can neoclassical economists ignore the contributions of Georgescu-Roegen? |editor-last=Daly |editor-first=Herman E.

===The practice of production functions===
{{main article|Production (economics)}}

The theory of production function depicts the relation between physical outputs of a production process and physical inputs, i.e. factors of production. The practical application of production function is obtained by valuing the physical outputs and inputs by their prices. The economic value of physical outputs minus the economic value of physical inputs is the income generated by the production process. By keeping the prices fixed between two periods under review we get the income change generated by the change of production function. This is the principle how the production function is made a practical concept, i.e. measureable and understandable in practical situations.

== First Generation ==
In 1891, Nachman Schleime and Yente Rabinovitz immigrated to the United States with their children from [[Malestovka, Russia]]. They settled in Boston, where Yente ran a grocery store in Boston's North End.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;

== The Rabinovitz Brothers ==

The eldest brother, Joseph Rabinovitz and his brother Max founded the Standard Grocery Company (known as "Ecco") in 1898. Their brothers Jacob (1885-1967) and Julius founded the Economy Grocery Stores in 1914. Joseph soon sold his share in Standard and invested in Ecco.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;

== The Rabbs ==

Joseph and his wife Charlotte (Lottie) Wolf had four children: Sidney R. Rabb (1900-1985), Norman S. Rabb (1905-1997), Jeanette Rabb Solomon (Mrs. Sidney), and Irving William Rabb (1913-2011).  The three brothers and one sister all attended [[Boston Latin School andGirls Latin School]] and [[Harvard University]] and joined Ecco. The three joined their last name to Rabb in 1946, the year the Economy Grocery Company was renamed Stop &amp; Shop.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;

Sidney, the eldest, was the first to join Ecco at the age of 18. In 1920 he became co-owner with his father and uncle Joseph and Jacob. Sidney became chairman of the Board and chief executive officer in 1930, a position he retained until his death in 1985.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;

Norman graduated from Harvard and joined Ecco in 1925, the year the company went public. He rose to the position of vice chairman and then senior vice president of Stop &amp; Shop. Norman was youngest of the seven founders of [Brandeis University in 1948. He served as the first secretary of the board, and was chairman of the board from 1961 to 1967.&lt;ref name='normanobit'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/07/classified/paid-notice-deaths-rabb-norman.html|publisher=The New York Times|title=Paid Notice: Deaths RABB, NORMAN|date=May 7, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='normannews'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1961&amp;dat=19810115&amp;id=r64zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k-kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1354,817669|publisher=Palm Beach Daily News|date=Jan 15, 1981|title=Brandeis University To Present Goldfarb Medal To Norman Rabb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving graduated from Boston Latin in 1930 and from Harvard College in 1934, attended [[Harvard Business School]], then joined Ecco in 1935, the year it opened Boston's first supermarket. He rose to become president and then vice chairman of Stop &amp; Shop. He became a trustee of [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center|Beth Israel Hospital]] in 1956, was president of the board from 1967 to 1970, and later served as chairman of the board. Irving, like his brothers, also served as a trustee and board member of several other Boston Jewish, arts, and medical institutions, including the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], the [[Cambridge Community Foundation]], the [[Dana Farber Cancer Institute]], [[Hebrew College]], [[Hebrew SeniorLife]], the [[New England Conservatory of Music]], and [[Temple Israel (Boston)|Temple Israel of Boston]].&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;&lt;ref name='irvinghonor'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/babson-college-commencement-speakers-accenture-chairmanceo-and-stonyfield-farm-chairmanpresidentce-yo-58103372.html|publisher=PR Newswire|date=May 11, 2007|title=Babson College Commencement Speakers: Accenture Chairman/CEO and Stonyfield Farm Chairman/President/CE-Yo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='irving'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/cambridge/articles/2011/08/26/irving_rabb_held_key_posts_at_stop__shop_beth_israel/|publisher=The Boston Globe|title=Irving Rabb; held key posts at Stop &amp; Shop, Beth Israel|date=August 26, 2011|last=Marquard|first=Bryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third Generation ==

Sidney Rabb married Esther Cohn and had two daughters, Helene and Carol R. Carol, born in 1931, attended [[Tufts University]] and Harvard Business School before joining Stop &amp; Shop in 1985. She married a fellow Stop &amp; Shop employee, Avram J. Goldberg. Avram, born in 1930, became executive vice president, then president of the company in 1971 and chairman of the board when his father-in-law Sidney died in 1985. Carol, then executive vice president, became president of the company. They resigned from Stop &amp; Shop soon after the company was purchased by [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co]] in 1988.&lt;ref name='rabbs' /&gt;&lt;ref name='carolavram'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajhsboston.org/2014/03/31/avram-and-carol-goldberg/|title=Avram and Carol Goldberg|date=March 31, 2014|publisher=American Jewish Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Sakamoto Ryōma'''|[[:ja:坂本龍馬|坂本 龍馬]]||January 3, 1836 – December 10, 1867}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] prominent figure in the movement to overthrow the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. He was active for most of the [[Bakumatsu]]. 

One of his most noted accomplishments during this period was the negotiation of peace between [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]] (present day [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]]) and [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] (present day [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]), two powerful provinces that had long been hostile to each other. He then united them against the [[Bakufu]], the government of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] ''[[shōgun]]''.

Ryōma frequently used the alias {{nihongo|'''Saitani Umetarō'''|才谷梅太郎|}} during this period, as he was often hunted by the Bakufu supporters, such as members of the [[Shinsengumi]]. He was ultimately attacked and murdered before the [[Boshin War]], along with his companion [[Nakaoka Shintarō]], at an inn in [[Kyoto]].

== Early life ==
Ryōma was born in [[Kōchi, Kōchi|Kōchi]], of [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]] [[Han system|han]] (present day [[Kōchi Prefecture]]), on the island of [[Shikoku]]. By the [[Japanese calendar]], he was born on the 15th day of the 11th month, of the sixth year of ''[[Tenpō]]''. Previous generations of his family had acquired enough wealth as ''[[sake]]'' brewers to purchase the rank of country ''[[samurai]]'', or {{illm|Gōshi|ja|ja:郷士|dt=''gōshi''}}, which was the lowest rank in the ''samurai'' hierarchy. Unlike other domains, Tosa had a strictly-enforced separation between joshi (high-ranked samurai) and kashi (low-ranked samurai). Joshi and kashi were treated unequally and residential areas were segregated; even in Sakamoto Ryōma's generation (the third in the Sakamoto family), his family's samurai rank remained kashi. At the age of twelve, Ryōma was enrolled in a private school, but this was a brief episode in his life, as he showed little scholarly inclination.

His older sister subsequently enrolled him in fencing classes of the Oguri-ryū when he was 14, after he was bullied at school. By the time he reached adulthood he was by all accounts a master swordsman. In 1853 he was allowed by his clan to travel to [[Edo]] to train and polish his skills as a swordsman. There he enrolled as a student at the famous [[Hokushin Ittō-ryū]] Hyōhō [[Hokushin Ittō-ryū|Chiba-Dōjō]], which was led by its first Headmaster Chiba Sadakichi Masamichi at that time. He received the scroll from the school that declared his mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Kyodo, Staff Report, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/09/national/history/sakamoto-swordsmanship-scroll-declared-authentic/ Sakamoto swordsmanship scroll declared authentic]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', Nov 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He became a shihan at the [[Hokushin Ittō-ryū|Chiba-Dōjō]] and taught [[Kenjutsu]] to the students together with Chiba Jūtarō Kazutane, in whom he found a close friend. That year, Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] of the [[United States]] arrived with a fleet of ships to force Japan out of its centuries-old [[sakoku|national isolation policy]].

==Politics==
When Ryōma completed his studies in 1858, he returned to Tosa. In 1862, his friend, [[Takechi Hanpeita]] (or Takechi Zuizan), organized the Tosa Loyalist Party "Kinnoto". Their political slogan was, "[[Sonnō jōi|Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians]]". It consisted of about 2000 samurai, mostly from the lower rank, who insisted on the reform of the Tosa government. Since the Tosa lord refused to recognize the group, they plotted to assassinate Yoshida Toyo (who was later assassinated, but after Ryōma had left Tosa). Ryōma participated in the plot but did not advocate it; Takechi demanded a revolution for only the Tosa clan, and Ryōma thought they should do something for all of Japan. He decided to leave Tosa and separate from Takechi. In those days, no one was permitted to leave their clan without permission, on penalty of death. One of Ryōma's sisters committed suicide because he left without permission. Sakamoto would later use the alias "Saitani Umetarō" (才谷 梅太郎) as he worked against the shogun.&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100427i1.html Sakamoto, the man and the myth]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', April 27, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned under this alias in the diary of [[Ernest Satow]] for 30 September 1867: "Mr. Saedani had to be sat up for laughing at the questions put by us, evidently with the object of ridiculing us out of our case, but he got a flea in his lug and shut up making the most diabolical faces."&lt;ref&gt;R. Morton &amp; I. Ruxton, eds., ''The Diaries of Sir Ernest Mason Satow, 1861–69,'' Kyoto: Eureka Press, 2013, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bakumatsu period ==
While a ''rōnin'', Ryōma decided to assassinate [[Katsu Kaishū]], a high-ranking official in the Tokugawa shogunate and a supporter of both modernization and westernization. However, Katsu Kaishū persuaded Ryōma of the necessity of a long-term plan to increase Japan's military strength. Instead of killing Katsu Kaishū, Ryōma started working as his assistant and protégé.

In 1864, as the Tokugawa shogunate began taking a hard line, Ryōma fled to [[Kagoshima]] in [[Satsuma Domain]], which was developing as a major centre for the anti-Tokugawa movement. Ryōma negotiated the secret [[Satchō Alliance|alliance]] between [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]] and [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] provinces. Satsuma and Chōshū historically had been irreconcilable enemies, and Ryōma's position as a "neutral outsider" was critical in bridging the gap in trust.

Ryōma is often regarded as the "father of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]", as he worked under [[Katsu Kaishū]]'s direction toward creating a modern naval force (with the aid of western powers) to enable Satsuma and Chōshū to hold their own against the naval forces of the Tokugawa shogunate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}&lt;!--Isn't Katsu Kaishu considered the father of the IJN?--&gt; Ryōma founded the private navy and trading company [[kaientai|Kameyama Shachū]] in Nagasaki City with the help of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]]. Later Kameyama Shachū became [[Kaientai]] or Ocean Support Fleet.

Chōshū's subsequent victory over the Tokugawa army in 1866 and the impending collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate made Ryōma a valuable commodity to his former masters in Tosa. Ryōma was recalled to Kōchi with honours. The Tosa domain was anxious to obtain a negotiated settlement between the Shogun and the Emperor, which would prevent the powerful Satchō Alliance from overthrowing the Tokugawa by force and thus emerging as a new dominant force in ruling Japan. Ryōma again played a crucial role in the subsequent negotiations that led to the voluntary resignation of the Shogun [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] in 1867, thus bringing about the [[Meiji Restoration]].

Ryōma was an admirer of democratic principles. Ryōma began studying democratic governance, particularly the United States Congress and British Parliament as a model for the governance of Japan after the Restoration.  Ryōma argued that after centuries of having little political power, the Imperial Court lacked the resources and wherewithal to run the country.  Ryōma wrote the "Eight Proposals While Shipboard" (『船中八策』) while discussing the future model of Japanese government with [[Gotō Shōjirō]] on board a Tosa ship outside Nagasaki in 1867.  Ryōma outlined the need for a democratically elected bicameral legislature, the writing of a Constitution, the formation of a national army and navy, and the regulation of gold and silver exchange rates. Ryōma's proposals are thought to form the basis for the subsequent parliamentary system implemented after his death.

==Death==
Ryōma was [[assassination|assassinated]] at the age of 31 at the Ōmiya (近江屋) inn in [[Kyoto]], not long before the [[Meiji Restoration]] took place.  On the night of December 10, 1867, assassins gathered at the door of the inn and one approached and knocked, acting as an ordinary caller.  The door was answered by Ryōma's bodyguard and manservant, a former [[rikishi|sumo wrestler]] who told the stranger he would see if Ryōma was accepting callers at that hour of the evening.  When the bodyguard turned his back, the visitor at the door drew his sword and slashed his back, which became a fatal wound.  The team of assassins rushed over and passed the dying sumo wrestler and up the stairs to the guests' rooms.  Ryōma and [[Nakaoka Shintarō]] were resting in one room talking. Hearing the scuffle on the first floor, Ryōma opened the door to yell at his bodyguard, thinking he was wrestling with a friend.  The assassins charged the room, some tearing through the paper doors (''[[shōji]]''), and a confused melée ensued as lamps were knocked over and the room went dark.  By the end of the fight, both Ryōma and Shintaro lay badly wounded, and the assassins fled. Ryōma died that night, regretting with his last words that his assassins caught him unprepared. Shintaro died two days later.

The night of the assassination was eventually called the Omiya Incident.  According to the traditional lunar calendar, Ryōma was born on the 15th day of the 11th month, and killed on his birthday in 1867. Initial reports accused members of the [[Shinsengumi]] for Ryōma's and Shintarō's deaths, and Shinsengumi leader [[Kondō Isami]] was later executed on this charge.  However, members of another pro-''[[shōgun]]'' group, the [[Kyoto Mimawarigumi|Mimawarigumi]], confessed to the murder in 1870. Although Mimawarigumi members [[Sasaki Tadasaburō]] (佐々木 只三郎) and [[Imai Nobuo]] carry the blame, the identity of the true assassin has never been proven.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Marius, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fa20100507a1.html Crime scene investigation: Edo: Samurai Sakamoto Ryoma's murder scene makes a grisly but fascinating show]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', May 7, 2010, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Teradaya fg2.jpg|thumb|Teradaya inn, [[Kyoto]], where Ryōma was attacked in a failed assassination attempt, before being fatally injured at Omiya Inn.]]
Ryōma was a visionary who dreamt of an independent Japan without [[feudalism|feudal]] trappings. He read about the West and was inspired by the example of the [[United States]] where "[[all men are created equal]]". He realized that to compete with an industrially and technologically advanced outside world, the Japanese people needed to modernize. He has also been seen as an intriguing mix of the traditional and modern, symbolized by his preference for samurai dress while favoring western footwear.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Ryōma has been heavily featured and romanticized [[#In popular culture|in popular culture]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Honors in modern times ==
On 15 November 2003, the Kōchi Airport was renamed the [[Kōchi Airport|Kōchi Ryōma Airport]] in his honor.

There is a [[Sakamoto Ryōma Memorial Museum]] (坂本龍馬記念館) south of Kōchi, with a large bronze statue of Ryoma overlooking the sea.  The city of Kōchi has a number of Ryōma-themed attractions and locations, including the Sakamoto Ryōma Birthplace Memorial, and the Sakamoto Ryōma Hometown Museum, dedicated to showing what downtown Kōchi was like during Ryōma's childhood, including relevant aspects that may have influenced his views.  On 15 November 2009, the Hokkaidō Sakamoto Ryōma Memorial Museum was built in [[Hakodate, Hokkaido]].

Asteroid [[2835 Ryoma]] is named after him. Asteroid 5823 Oryo is named after his wife.

An April 2010 ''[[Japan Times]]'' article wrote "Ryōma has inspired at least seven television drama series, six novels, seven manga and five films."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0032310/&lt;/ref&gt; His appeal stems from being "the kind of person onto whom anyone can project themselves", as actor [[Masaharu Fukuyama]] described his role playing him in the [[NHK]] drama ''[[Ryōmaden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corkill |first=Edan |title=Legendary, dirty samurai gets makeover |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20091225r1.html |date=January 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 3, 2010 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakamoto is a recurring character in the [[NHK]] ''[[Taiga Drama]]: [[Shinsengumi!]]''.  He is portrayed as a friend of [[Kondō Isami]] since their younger days.  In the drama he is assassinated by [[Sasaki Tadasaburō]] and the [[Mimawarigumi]].  In ''[[Ryu_ga_Gotoku_Ishin!|Ryū Ga Gotoku Ishin!]]'', the second samurai-themed spinoff to the [[Yakuza (series)|''Yakuza'' series]], Sakamoto Ryōma is the main protagonist played by Takaya Kuroda, and is modeled after series protagonist [[Kazuma Kiryu]].

Sakamoto appears in the historical manga ''[[Shura no Toki]]'', which was later adapted into the anime, ''[[Mutsuen Meiryū Gaiden: Shura no Toki]]''. In addition, he also makes appearances, with varying levels of historical accuracy, in numerous other manga, anime, and video games.

[[GReeeeN]] wrote a song about what Sakamoto would be like in the modern world, named [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEyhXz1O8XE "SAKAMOTO"].

Sakamoto appears in the mobile game ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'', as a Rider-class Servant and ally during the third Gudaguda event.

In [[NHK]]'s [[Taiga Drama]] ''[[Segodon]]'', Sakamoto Ryōma is portrayed by actor [[Shun Oguri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetv.jp/news/detail/154685/|title=＜西郷どん＞小栗旬の“龍馬”登場に女子騒然！「“男くささ”がたまらない!!」|last=|first=|date=July 16, 2018|website=thetv.jp|language=Japanese|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomson Bonar's grave, St Cuthberts Churchyard, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Thomson Bonar's grave, St Cuthberts Churchyard, Edinburgh]]
'''Thomson Bonar''' (died 1814) was a wine-merchant who married Elizabeth, the daughter of the engraver [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]],&lt;ref&gt;The Great EB by Herman Kogan, University of Chicago Press, 1958, p. 28. Note in this reference his name is spelled Thomson Bonar&lt;/ref&gt; who co-founded the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' with [[Colin Macfarquhar]].

Bonar sold the 3rd through 5th editions of the ''Britannica'', and produced the supplement to the 3rd edition&lt;ref&gt;His name is clearly spelled Thomson Bonar, not Thomas, in the frontispage of the supplements to the 3rd edition of Britannica, 1803, Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bonar held the copyright for that supplement, for whose material he asked great sums (20,000 pounds sterling) in subsequent editions, although he was granted but little (100-200 pounds).  Bonar was friendly to the article authors, and introduced the policy of paying them as well as the article reviewers, and of allowing them to retain copyright for separate publication of their work.

Bonar quarreled with his father-in-law, Andrew Bell, and the two men did not speak from 1799 to 1809, when Bell died.  Bell's successor, [[Archibald Constable]], wisely bought out Bonar's copyright for the 5th edition and kept him as an ally of the ''Britannica''.

Thomson died on 25 July 1814, aged 75. He is buried in the northern section of [[St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh|St Cuthberts Churchyard]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The stone backs onto the access path from [[Princes Street]]. His grandson of the same name (1799-1861) is buried with him.

'''''Tin Men''''' is a 1987 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Barry Levinson]], produced by [[Mark Johnson (producer)|Mark Johnson]], and starring [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Danny DeVito]], and [[Barbara Hershey]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=FILM: 'TIN MEN,' COMEDY FROM BARRY LEVINSON|authorlink=Janet Maslin|author=Maslin, Janet|date=March 6, 1987|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE4DC1430F935A35750C0A961948260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the second of Levinson's four "Baltimore Films" set in his hometown of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s: ''[[Diner (film)|Diner]]'' (1982), ''Tin Men'' (1987), ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'' (1990), and ''[[Liberty Heights]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 14, 1999|title=Barry Levinson: Baltimore, My Baltimore|author=Levinson, Barry|authorlink=Barry Levinson|url=https://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/111499levinson-film.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Ernest Tilley and Bill "BB" Babowsky are rival [[door-to-door]] [[aluminum siding]] salesmen in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1963, an era when "tin men," as they're called, will do almost anything — legal or illegal — to close a sale. BB is a smooth-talking con-artist who scams naive and comely young women with his sales pitches, while Tilley is a hapless loser.  

They first meet when BB, driving his new [[Cadillac]] off the lot, backs into Tilley's own Cadillac. Though Tilley had the right of way, each man blames the other, and an escalating feud erupts between them.

After BB smashes Tilley's headlights and Tilley shatters BB's car windows in response, BB sets out to seduce Tilley's long-suffering wife Nora in revenge. Immediately after having sex with Nora, he calls Tilley to taunt him with the news. Tilley tells BB to keep Nora; he wants to be rid of her.

Meanwhile, both men have their own personal troubles. BB's older partner and mentor, Moe Adamson, is hospitalized with a serious heart condition. Tilley has a gambling problem and squanders what little money he makes betting on horse races, causing a rift with Nora. He's in debt to various creditors and the [[IRS]], who begin confiscating his possessions for unpaid property taxes. Exhausted by their rivalry, the two men decide to play a game of [[Eight-ball|pool]] to decide who should get Nora in order to end to their personal war. BB loses, but he does not honor the bet. He has fallen in love for the first time, and Nora moves in with him.

The newly formed [[Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation|Maryland Home Improvement Commission]] is investigating corrupt sales practices in the home-improvement industry. Both men are subpoenaed, and after giving testimony about their sales practices, the commission takes away both of their licenses. While Tilley gives up his license reluctantly, BB does so willingly as part of his new outlook on life. BB, seeing that Tilley has lost everything, including his car, takes pity on him and gives him a ride. Together, the two freshly unemployed men begin sharing ideas for a new business they can create for themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">'''''Toy Biz v. United States''''' was a 2003 decision in the [[United States Court of International Trade]] that determined that for purposes of [[tariffs]], [[Toy Biz]]'s [[action figures]] were [[toy|toys]], not [[doll|dolls]], because they represented "nonhuman creatures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Toy Biz v. United States |court=United States Court of International Trade |date=January 3, 2003 |url=http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/slip-op%2003-2.pdf |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision effectively halved the tariff rate, from 12 percent tax to 6.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Iglesias |first=Matthew |title=How Trade Policy Cost The X-Men Their Humanity |url=https://slate.com/business/2011/12/are-mutants-human.html |access-date=November 22, 2018 |work=Slate.com |date=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the United States|Harmonized Tariff Schedule]] in [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]] distinguished between two types of action figures for determining tariffs: dolls, which are defined to include human figures, and toys, which include "nonhuman creatures". Because duties on dolls were higher than those on toys, [[Marvel Comics]] [[subsidiary]] Toy Biz argued before the [[U.S. Court of International Trade]], that their action figures (including the [[X-Men]] and [[Fantastic Four]]) represented "nonhuman creatures" and were subject to the lower tariff rates for toys instead of the higher ones for dolls. On January 3, 2003, after examining more than 60 action figures, Judge [[Judith Barzilay]] ruled in their favor, granting Toy Biz reimbursement for import taxes on previous toys.

==Reaction==
Because a common theme in Marvel Comics had been the struggle for [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] like the X-Men to prove their humanity, the case shocked numerous fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Time for Mutants |work=USC Annenberg Online Journalism Review |date=January 22, 2003 |url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/spike/1043234172.php |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel responded to these concerns by claiming "our heroes are living, breathing human beings{{spaced en dash}}but humans who have extraordinary abilities ... A decision that the X-Men figures indeed do have 'nonhuman' characteristics further proves our characters have special, out-of-this world powers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=Neal |title=Fans Howl in Protest as Judge Decides X-Men Aren't Human |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 20, 2003 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1043013622300562504 |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the United States|Harmonized Tariff Schedule]] was amended to eliminate the distinction between dolls and other toys, which are now in the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Daily |first=James |title=Are the X-Men Human?

Barut was born in [[Nicosia]] on 14 February 1919, as the second of the three children of Mehmet Recep Bey, the chief imam of the [[Selimiye Mosque, Nicosia|Saint Sophia's Mosque]], and Emine Hanım, a housewife. She started to be schooled at the age of 3 and started receiving violin lessons at the age of 9, being educated at the Ayasofya Primary School. She then graduated from the [[Victoria Girls' High School]] and wanted to pursue a career as a pharmacist, but as the British government had changed policy at the time and did not accept pharmaceutical training at Cypriot hospital, her hopes were dashed. In response, her uncle persuaded her father so that a shop could be opened for her.&lt;ref name=erguclu/&gt;

This shop was opened in 1937. This proved to be very controversial in a very patriarchal society, some reacted to this with vitriol and claimed that it would not be allowed for them to pray behind her father. Mithat Bey, a writer at the newspaper ''[[Söz (newspaper)|Söz]]'', saw these reactions as absurd and became a staunch advocate for Barut, eventually leading to her gaining acceptance in society. Barut would operate her business until 2003,&lt;ref name="kibris"/&gt; despite a fire in the 1980s destroying her shop and forcing her to open a new one with the help of her son. She first started with products that would appeal to women, but later switched to stationery and became the only official vendor of stationery during the [[World War II]] in Nicosia. She also became a newspaper distributor, uniquely selling not only Turkish-language newspaper but also Greek and English-language ones that came from the south of the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]]. She thus became crucial in facilitating the contact between the two communities in Cyprus. After the 1980s fire, she quit the stationery business and continued with selling newspapers only.&lt;ref name=erguclu/&gt;&lt;ref name="kibris"/&gt;

She was also one of the first actresses of the nascent [[Turkish Cypriot theatre]].&lt;ref name="kibris"/&gt; Before the opening of her shop, she staged the adaptation of a popular Turkish play, ''[[Aşık Garip]]'', with an amateur crew she established with her friends.&lt;ref name=erguclu/&gt;
