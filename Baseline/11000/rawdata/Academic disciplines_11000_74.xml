The '''extended mediumwave broadcast band''', commonly known as the ['''AM'''] '''expanded band''', is a [[broadcast]] [[frequency allocation]]. It moves the upper limit of the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[bandplan]] from 1605 to 1705 kHz.&amp;nbsp;

== History ==
The band became officially available around 1993, but only in [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] region 2 (the [[Americas]]). It is popular with micro-broadcasting for having less interference due to fewer signals than the standard/legacy AM band.

Though supported on most modern AM radio receivers sold in the Americas, this band is usually unavailable to older receivers except for those with substantial extended coverage. In the U.S., coverage on newer radios is mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), invoking the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]].

===Police Frequencies===
The band 1600-1700 kHz was originally designated as a [[police radio]] band.  While police radio transmissions are no longer made on this band, a number of county and city ordinances forbid receivers capable of picking up transmissions on this band &lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=County of Los Angeles Code Chapter 13.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  While this ordinance is not normally enforced it can be and has been used to cite motorists in possession of amateur radio gear, or in extreme cases an AM radio installed in the vehicle as original equipment.{{CN|date=August 2018}}

== Regional use ==

=== Americas ===
In the [[United States of America]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] voted to support an expanded band on April 12, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FCC Votes To Proceed With AM-Band Improvement Plans|last=Holland|first=Bill|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 28, 1990|volume=102|issue=17|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC granted "stereo preferences" to commercial broadcasters intending to use [[AM stereo]] when issuing licenses for the band.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, such stations have never been required to broadcast in stereo. With the content of the AM band evolving more toward [[talk radio]] than music, it is unlikely that the FCC would take any action against an extended-band station only broadcasting in [[Monaural|monophonic]] sound.{{or|date=January 2013}}

The standard for FCC licensed expanded band stations has been to broadcast omnidirectionally with ten kilowatts of power in the daytime and one kilowatt at night—except for stations that use antennas with higher than normal efficiency or those multiplexed with an existing station on a different frequency. In those cases, they are, by FCC Part 73 rules, authorized for less than one kilowatt at night, generally limiting such stations to 281 millivolts per meter per kilowatt at one kilometer, the minimum efficiency for a Class B station. One station ([[KVNS]] 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz, licensed to Brownsville, Texas) operates at 12% less than the standard (8.8kW Day and 880 watts at night) due to treaty obligations with Mexico.

Because 1610&amp;nbsp;kHz (the top or right-most channel on analog radios) had previously been used for [[Travelers' Information Station]]s (TIS) as 530&amp;nbsp;kHz — the bottom or left-most channel — still is (though 530 is NOT an FCC U.S. AM Broadcast channel, some TIS stations were displaced for new expanded-band stations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} There are no AM stations in the United States licensed to 1610&amp;nbsp;kHz &lt;ref&gt;http://www.radio-locator.com&lt;/ref&gt;

While 1710&amp;nbsp;kHz appears on many radios, it is unused even by TIS stations, except for a [[single-frequency network|group]] ([http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/licenseLocSum.jsp?licKey=2826342 WQFG689]) licensed with a [[waiver]] to the [[Hudson County, New Jersey|County of Hudson]] in [[New Jersey]]. This is because TIS stations are authorized under Part 90 of the FCC rules which deal with all two-way radio [except marine (Part 80) and ham/amateur radio (Part 97)] and not Part 73 or 74 which are the broadcast rules.

Mexico has a total of four radio stations licensed for the expanded band: [[XEUT-AM]] 1630, [[XEARZ-AM]] 1650, [[XEANAH-AM]] 1670, and [[XEPE-AM]] 1700. XEARZ (5&amp;nbsp;kW) and XEPE (10&amp;nbsp;kW) operate with nighttime power greater than 1&amp;nbsp;kW.{{mexico-inf|AM|accessdate=2017-03-07}} These stations were authorized before changes in 2014 set aside the AM expanded band, along with 106-108 MHz on FM, for social community and social indigenous radio stations.

=== Greater Europe ===
Although the extended band is not officially allocated in Europe, it is used by a number of "hobby" [[pirate radio]] stations, particularly in the [[Netherlands]], [[Greece]], and [[Serbia]], and it was used in the past by [[Vatican Radio]] (on 1611kHz).

=== Australia ===
In [[Australian Broadcasting Authority|Australia]], many {{vague|date=January 2013}} [[commercial radio]] [[broadcast licence]]s have been authorised for the extended band.

The vast majority of licences have never been used.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Due to a number of factors{{vague|date=January 2013}}, few Australian stations in this band have many listeners.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Japan ===
AM expanded band in Japan is up to 1629 kHz. 1620 kHz or 1629 kHz is normally used on [[Highway advisory radio]] and/or [[Roadside Station]] along stretches on major expressways in their country. Many Japanese AM radios can tune up to 1629 kHz, it can be found on Japanese car stereos and many radios, walkman, etc. 1611 kHz is rarely used in Japan, and it appeared on many Japanese radios.

=== The Philippines ===

In the [[Philippines]], the first AM expanded band radio station in low power format broadcasting in [[Marikina City]] is [[DZBF]] DEL Radio - Radyo Marikina 1674 [[kHz]] started in July 25, 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1894">'''ATSTEP''' is a Gaussian puff model for diagnosis and prognosis of the atmospheric dispersion, deposition, gamma radiation and doses of released radioactivity in case of accidents in nuclear power plants or during transport, and from [[dirty bomb]]s.

It was developed by Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (now [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], KIT), one of the largest national research centers in [[Germany]], and is designed for running in the RODOS (Real-time On-line DecisiOn Support) system for nuclear emergency management. RODOS is operational at the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), and test operational in many other European countries. More information on RODOS is available on the RODOS website [https://resy5.iket.kit.edu/RODOS/ here] and on the ATSTEP model [https://resy5.iket.kit.edu/RODOS/Documents/Public/HandbookV6f/Volume3/ATSTEPfinal2.pdf here].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19389">'''Aeroelasticity''' is the branch of [[physics]] and [[engineering]] that studies the interactions between the [[inertial force|inertial]], [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a [[fluid]] flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as [[energy harvesting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sousa|first=V. C.|title=Enhanced aeroelastic energy harvesting by exploiting combined nonlinearities: theory and experiment|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2011|volume=20|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding [[snoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first= P. D. M. |title= Laser palatoplasty for snoring due to palatal flutter: a further report|journal= Clinical Otolaryngology|year=1994|volume=19|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or [[steady state|steady]] response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body's [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] (typically [[vibration]]al) response. Aeroelasticity draws on the study of [[fluid mechanics]], [[solid mechanics]], [[structural dynamics]] and [[dynamical systems]].
The synthesis of aeroelasticity with [[thermodynamics]] is known as aerothermoelasticity, and its synthesis with [[control theory]] is known as aeroservoelasticity.

== History ==
The 2nd failure of [[Samuel Langley]]'s prototype plane on the Potomac has been attributed to aeroelastic effects (specifically, torsional divergence).&lt;ref name="Bisplinghoff"&gt;Bisplinghoff, R.L., Ashley, H. and Halfman, H., ''Aeroelasticity''. Dover Science, 1996, {{ISBN|0-486-69189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with torsional divergence plagued aircraft in the First World War, and were solved largely by trial-and-error and ad-hoc stiffening of the wing. In 1926, [[Hans Reissner]] published a theory of wing divergence, leading to much further theoretical research on the subject.&lt;ref name="Bisplinghoff" /&gt;

In the development of [[aeronautical engineering]] at [[Caltech]], [[Theodore von Kármán]] started a course "Elasticity applied to Aeronautics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore von Kármán]] (1967) ''The Wind and Beyond'', page 155&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching the course for one term, Kármán passed it over to [[Ernest Edwin Sechler]], who developed aeroelasticity in that course, and in publication of [[textbook]]s on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Edwin Sechler]] and L.G. Dunn (1942) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.205355 Airplane Structural Analysis and Design] from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Sechler (1952) ''Elasticity in Engineering''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, [[Arthur Roderick Collar]] defined aeroelasticity as ''"the study of the mutual interaction that takes place within the triangle of the inertial, elastic, and aerodynamic forces acting on structural members exposed to an airstream, and the influence of this study on design."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collar|first=A. R.|title=The first fifty years of aeroelasticity|journal=Aerospace|year=1978|volume=5|series=2|pages=12–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Static aeroelasticity ==
In an aeroplane, two significant static aeroelastic effects may occur. ''Divergence'' is a phenomenon in which the elastic twist of the wing suddenly becomes theoretically infinite, typically causing the wing to fail spectacularly. ''Control reversal'' is a phenomenon occurring only in wings with [[aileron]]s or other control surfaces, in which these control surfaces reverse their usual functionality (e.g., the rolling direction associated with a given aileron moment is reversed).

=== Divergence ===
Divergence occurs when a lifting surface deflects under aerodynamic load so as to increase the applied load, or move the load so that the twisting effect on the structure is increased. The increased load deflects the structure further, which eventually brings the structure to the point of divergence. Divergence can be understood as a simple property of the [[differential equation]](s) governing the wing [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]]. For example, modelling the airplane wing as an [[isotropic]] [[Euler–Bernoulli beam theory|Euler–Bernoulli beam]], the uncoupled torsional [[equation of motion]] is:

: &lt;math&gt; GJ \frac{d^2 \theta}{dy^2} = -M'&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''y'' is the spanwise dimension, ''θ'' is the elastic twist of the beam, ''GJ'' is the torsional stiffness of the beam, ''L'' is the beam length, and ''M’'' is the aerodynamic moment per unit length. Under a simple lift forcing theory the aerodynamic moment is of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;M' = C U^2 (\theta + \alpha_0) &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''C'' is a coefficient, ''U'' is the free-stream fluid velocity, and α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial angle of attack. This yields an [[ordinary differential equation]] of the form:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 \theta}{dy^2} + \lambda^2 \theta = -\lambda^2 \alpha_0 &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda^2 = C U^2/(GJ)&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary conditions for a clamped-free beam (i.e., a cantilever wing) are:

: &lt;math&gt; \theta|_{y=0} = \frac{d\theta}{dy}\biggl|_{y=L} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Which yields the solution:

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \alpha_{0} [\tan (\lambda L) \sin(\lambda y) + \cos (\lambda y) - 1]&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen, for ''λL = π/2 + nπ'', with arbitrary integer number ''n'', ''tan(λL)'' is infinite. ''n = 0'' corresponds to the point of torsional divergence. For given structural parameters, this will correspond to a single value of free-stream velocity U. This is the torsional divergence speed. Note that for some special boundary conditions that may be implemented in a wind tunnel test of an airfoil (e.g., a torsional restraint positioned forward of the aerodynamic center) it is possible to eliminate the phenomenon of divergence altogether.&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;Hodges, D.H. and Pierce, A., ''Introduction to Structural Dynamics and Aeroelasticity'', Cambridge, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-521-80698-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control reversal ===
{{main article|Control reversal}}
Control surface reversal is the loss (or reversal) of the expected response of a control surface, due to deformation of the main lifting surface. For simple models (e.g. single aileron on an Euler-Bernoulli beam), control reversal speeds can be derived analytically as for torsional divergence. Control reversal can be used to aerodynamic advantage, and forms part of the [[Kaman servo-flap rotor]] design.&lt;ref name="Hodges" /&gt;

== Dynamic aeroelasticity ==
'''Dynamic aeroelasticity''' studies the interactions among aerodynamic, elastic, and inertial forces. Examples of dynamic aeroelastic phenomena are:

=== Flutter ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Resonance]], and [[Aeroelastic flutter]] redirects here --&gt;
'''Flutter''' is a dynamic instability of an elastic structure in a fluid flow, caused by [[positive feedback]] between the body's deflection and the force exerted by the fluid flow. In a [[linear system]], 'flutter point' is the point at which the structure is undergoing [[simple harmonic motion]]—zero net [[damping]]—and so any further decrease in net damping will result in a [[self-oscillation]] and eventual failure. 'Net damping' can be understood as the sum of the structure's natural positive damping, and the negative damping of the aerodynamic force. Flutter can be classified into two types: ''hard flutter'', in which the net damping decreases very suddenly, very close to the flutter point; and ''soft flutter'', in which the net damping decreases gradually.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dimitriadis, University of Liège, ''Aeroelasticity: Lectrue 6: Flight testing'', [http://www.ltas-aea.ulg.ac.be/cms/uploads/Aeroelasticity06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of predicting flutter in linear structures include the p-method, the k-method and the p-k method.&lt;ref name="Hodges" /&gt; In water the mass ratio of the  pitch inertia of the foil vs that of the circumscribing cylinder of fluid is generally too low for binary flutter to occur, as shown by explicit solution of the simplest pitch and heave flutter stability determinant.&lt;ref name="windeng372013"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/c553k773504m276x/?p=b99b20fe0d14408b9a01c901c4c31c05&amp;pi=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141029011643/http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/c553k773504m276x/?p=b99b20fe0d14408b9a01c901c4c31c05&amp;pi=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-29 |title=Binary Flutter as an Oscillating Windmill - Scaling &amp; Linear Analysis |journal=Wind Engineering |volume=37 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[nonlinear system]]s, flutter is usually interpreted as a [[limit cycle]] oscillation (LCO), and methods from the study of [[dynamical system]]s can be used to determine the speed at which flutter will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tang|first=D. M.|title=Effects of geometric structural nonlinearity on flutter and limit cycle oscillations of high-aspect-ratio wings|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2004|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tacoma Narrows Bridge destruction.ogv|thumb|Video of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge being destroyed through aeroelastic fluttering]]
Structures exposed to aerodynamic forces—including wings and aerofoils, but also chimneys and bridges—are designed carefully within known parameters to avoid flutter.  In complex structures where both the aerodynamics and the mechanical properties of the structure are not fully understood, flutter can be discounted only through detailed testing. Even changing the mass distribution of an aircraft or the [[stiffness]] of one component can induce flutter in an apparently unrelated aerodynamic component.  At its mildest this can appear as a "buzz" in the aircraft structure, but at its most violent it can develop uncontrollably with great speed and cause serious damage to or lead to the destruction of the aircraft,&lt;ref name = "YouTube"&gt;{{citation | format = Video | title = YouTube | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRit6tcNT4s | contribution = Visual demonstration of flutter which destroys an RC aircraft}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Braniff Flight 542]].  Famously the original [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] was destroyed as a result of aeroelastic fluttering.&lt;ref&gt;The adequacy of comparison between flutter in aircraft aerodynamics and Tacoma Narrows Bridge case is discussed and disputed in Yusuf K. Billah, Robert H. Scanian, [http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf  "Resonance, Tacoma Bridge failure, and undergraduate physics textbooks"]; Am. J. Phys. 59, nr 2, s. 118-124, February 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, automatic control systems have been demonstrated to help prevent or limit flutter-related structural vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph39/mon39_b.pdf|title=Control of Aeroelastic Response: Taming the Threats|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confusing|section|small=&lt;!-- needed because of an apparent bug in section variant --&gt;|reason=it is filled with dense jargon accessible only to experts familiar with the topic|date=July 2015}}
Flutter as a [[controlled aerodynamic instability phenomena|controlled aerodynamic instability phenomenon]] is used intentionally and positively in windmills for generating electricity and in other works like making musical tones on ground-mounted devices, as well as on [[Kite types|musical kites]]. Flutter is not always a destructive force; recent progress has been made in windmills for underserved communities in developing countries, designed specifically to take advantage of this effect. The oscillating motion allows variable-stroke waterpumping to match the variable power in the wind. Semirotary binary flutter can also have an upper critical airspeed at which it stops, affording automatic high wind protection&lt;ref name="windeng372013"/&gt;  The resulting Wing'd Pump has been designed to mount on the well it pumps or float on the pond it draws from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIj7LCtX0U|format=video|title=WING'D MILLS 2013: FLO'Pump and FLUTTER WELL Pump}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its large scale the flutter is coupled by static gravity imbalance as well as dynamic imbalance.

=== Buffeting ===
'''[[Transonic buffet|Buffeting]]''' is a high-frequency instability, caused by airflow separation or shock wave oscillations from one object striking another. It is caused by a sudden impulse of load increasing. It is a random forced vibration. Generally it affects the tail unit of the aircraft structure due to air flow downstream of the wing.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The methods for buffet detection are:

# Pressure divergence at trailing edge
# Computing separation from trailing edge based on [[Mach number]]
# Normal force fluctuating divergence

=== Transonic aeroelasticity===
Flow is highly non-linear in the [[transonic]] regime, dominated by moving shock waves. It is mission-critical for aircraft that fly through transonic Mach numbers. The role of shock waves was first analyzed by [[Holt Ashley]].&lt;ref&gt;Holt Ashley. "Role of Shocks in the "Sub-Transonic" Flutter Phenomenon", Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 17, No. 3 (1980), pp. 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; A phenomenon that impacts stability of aircraft known as 'transonic dip', in which the flutter speed can get close to flight speed, was reported in May 1976 by Farmer and Hanson&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, M.G. and Hanson, P.W., "Comparison of Super-critical and Conventional Wing Flutter Characteristics," NASA TM X-72837&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Langley Research Center]].

== Prediction and cure ==
Aeroelasticity involves not just the external aerodynamic loads and the way they change but also the structural, [[damping]] and mass characteristics of the aircraft. Prediction involves making a [[mathematical model]] of the aircraft as a series of masses connected by springs and dampers which are tuned to represent the [[dynamic characteristics]] of the aircraft structure. The model also includes details of applied aerodynamic forces and how they vary.

The model can be used to predict the flutter margin and, if necessary, test fixes to potential problems. Small carefully chosen changes to mass distribution and local structural stiffness can be very effective in solving aeroelastic problems.

== Media ==
These videos detail the [[X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing|Active Aeroelastic Wing]] two-phase [[NASA]]-[[United States Air Force|Air Force]] flight research program to investigate the potential of aerodynamically twisting flexible wings to improve maneuverability of high-performance aircraft at transonic and [[supersonic]] speeds, with traditional control surfaces such as [[aileron]]s and leading-edge flaps used to induce the twist.

Astral rays, composed of [[microtubules]], radiate from the centrosphere and look like a cloud. It is one of the variants of microtubules like [[kinetochore]] and interpolar microtubules.

During mitosis, there are four stages of cell division: [[Prophase]], [[Metaphase]], [[Anaphase]], and [[Telophase]]. During prophase, two aster-covered centrosomes migrate to opposite sides of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] in preparation of mitotic spindle formation. During metaphase, the kinetochore microtubules connect to the [[centromere]]. Afterwards, during anaphase, the kinetochore microtubules pull the chromatids apart into its individual [[chromosomes]] and pull them towards the centrosomes, located at opposite ends of the cell. This allows the cell to divide properly with each daughter cell containing full replicas of chromosomes. In some cells, the positions of the asters determine the site of cell divisions.

'''Biolinguistics''' is the study of the [[biology]] and [[evolution]] of [[language]].  It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including [[Linguistics|linguists]], [[biologist]]s, [[Neuroscience|neuroscientists]], [[psychologists]], [[Mathematician|mathematicians,]] and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language.

==Origins==
The biolinguistic perspective began to take shape in the mid-twentieth century, among the linguists influenced by the developments in biology and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chomsky|first= Noam|year= 2004|title= Biolinguistics and the Human Capacity. Lecture delivered at MTA, Budapest, May 17, 2004|url= http://www.chomsky.info/talks/20040517.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Lenneberg|Eric Lenneberg’s]] ''Biological Foundations of Language'' remains a basic document of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Lenneberg, Eric. 1967. ''Biological Foundations of Language''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by [[Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]], bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1= Cedric |first2= Massimo |last2=Piattelli-Palmarini |year=2005|title= Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science. Linguistic Review 22: 447–466 |url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
Recent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language in particular is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguists is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].

==Hypothesis==
It is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&amp;mdash;an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Soschen, Alona. 2006. Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in the Minimalist Program. DEAL. Linguistics in Potsdam 25. {{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.

==Critiques==
David Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of "inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization", arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015. ''[https://www.academia.edu/19749424/Biosemiotic_Perspectives_on_Language_and_Linguistics Biosemiotic Perspectives on Language and Linguistics]''. (Biosemiotics 13.) Cham: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

from biological samples. Essential of this method is the use of silica beads, capable of binding the NA in the presence of a chaotropic substance according to the effect.
This method is one of the most widespread&lt;ref name=RAS/&gt;&lt;ref name="sms"/&gt; methods for isolating nucleic acids from biological samples and is known as a simple, rapid, and reliable&lt;ref name="Boom2"/&gt; method for the small-scale purification of NA from biological sample.

This method is said to have been developed and invented by [[Willem R. Boom]] et al. around 1990.&lt;ref group=notes name="Note1"&gt;
Estimated from priority date of Boom, et. al; US5234809 [http://www.google.com/patents/US5234809], EP0389063 [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19900926&amp;CC=EP&amp;NR=0389063A2&amp;KC=A2] and their family patents.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the aforementioned chaotropic effect itself was already known and already reported by Vogelstein and Gillespie&lt;ref name=voge&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; before the development of the BOOM method.
So the contribution of Boom et al. may be the optimization of the method to complex starting materials,&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt; such as body fluids and other biological starting materials, and provides a short step procedure according to the Boom et al. US5234809.&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt; After the Boom et al.&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt; was filed,
similar applications&lt;ref name=BD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5342931|title=US5342931|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.co.jp/patents/US5973138|title=US5973138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.co.jp/patents/US5705628|title=DNA purification and isolation using magnetic particles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been filed by other parties.

In a narrow sense, the word "silica" meant SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystals; however, other forms of silica particles are available.
Especially amorphous silicon oxide and glass powder, alkylsilica, aluminum silicate ([[zeolite]]), or,  activated
silica with -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are suitable as nucleic acid binding solid phase material according to this method.
Today, the embodyments of Boom method, characterized by "utilizing the magnetic beads (silica beads are magnetic beads)" is widely used. In such method, silica beads are captured by magnetic beads collector, such as Tajima pipette,&lt;ref name="Tajima"&gt;

==Brief procedure==
[[File:Boom method by Tajima pipet.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1: Boom method by Tajima pipette and magnetic silica beads.&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; Schematic structure of Tajima pipette are shown in Fig. 2. Apparatus and methods&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; are mainly intended to the immune system.
However, alternative embodiment for nucleic acids extraction assay are also mentioned in this patent and procedure of Fig.1 is generally similar to Boom method.]]
[[File:Tajima pipet.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2:Schematic structure of Tajima pipette.]]

The process for isolating nucleic acid from starting material of Boom method are essentially consist of following 4 steps&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boom2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP2"/&gt; (See Fig. 1).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) '''Lysing and/or Homogenizing''' the starting material.&lt;br&gt;
Lysate of starting material is obtained by for example a detergent
in the presence of protein degrading enzymes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(b) '''Mixing''' chaotropic substance and silica beads into the starting material.&lt;br&gt;
'''Mixing the Starting material''', a chaotropic substance to bind the NA to silica beads, lysate of starting material of (a)  is mixed with sufficiently large amounts of chaotropic substance.
According to the chaotropic effect, releasing-NA will be bound to
the silica beads almost instantaneously. In this way, silica-nucleic
acid complexes are formed. The reasons why NA and silica form
bonds are to be described in the following section (Basic principles).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(c) '''Washing silica beads''' &lt;br&gt;
In this step, silica beads of (b) are washed several times to remove contaminants.
Process of washing of the silica-nucleic acid complexes (silica beads) typically consists of following steps,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Collecting silica beads from the liquid by for example Tajima pipette (see Fig. 1,2) or by for example Pellet-down (by rapid sedimentation (centrifugation) and disposal of the supernatant (e.g., bysuction))
*Redispersioning silica beads into the chaotropic salt-containing washing buffer using, e. g., a vortex mixer.
*Collecting redispersed silica beads from above mentioned washing buffer again.
*Further washed successively with an alcohol-water solution&lt;ref group=notes&gt;According original method by Boom, most preferably about 70% ethanol to restrict losses in yield&lt;/ref&gt; and with acetone.
*Drying beads are preferably be done.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(d)'''Separating the bonded nucleic acids''' &lt;br&gt;
Separating the bonded nucleic acids from the silica beads. Pure NA are eluted into buffer by decreasing the concentration of chaotropic substance.
NA presented in the washed (and preferably dried) silica-nucleic
acid complexes is eluted into elution buffer such as TE buffer,
aqua bidest, ... , and so on. The selection of the elution buffer is
co-determined by the contemplated use of the isolated NA.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this way, pure NA are isolated from the starting material.

By the alteration of the experimental condition, especially by alteration of the composition of [[reagents]] (chaotropic substance, wash buffer, and so on) we can realize more specific isolation. For example, some composition of reagents are suitable for obtaining long ds DNA, some composition of reagents are suitable for short ss RNA, and so on.

Starting material are for example, [[whole blood]], [[blood serum]], [[buffy coat]], [[urine]], [[feces]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[sperm]], [[saliva]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[cell cultures]], [[food products]], [[vaccines]]. and..., so various Starting biological material are available.

Of cause optimization of procedure according to the starting material, species of desired nucleic acid (DNA/RNA, Linear/ circular, ds/ss, long/short) are required.

Today, the assay characterized by using silica coated magnetic beads seems to be the most common. Therefore, in this article, "silica beads" are intended to mean silica coated magnetic beads unless stated otherwise.

===Magnetic beads===
The silica coated beads&lt;ref name=hitachi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US20040126902|title=Magnetic carrier for biological substance, production method thereof and isolation method of biological substance using same|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US7119194&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7119194|title=Nucleic acid-bondable magnetic carrier and method for isolating nucleic acid using the same|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Promega&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6368800|title=Kits for isolating biological target materials using silica magnetic particles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; coated various magnetic particles (magnetic carrier) with silica
are often used.
[[Maghemite]] particle (γ-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[magnetite]] particle ([[Iron(II,III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]),
as well as an intermediate iron oxide particle thereof, are most suitable
as magnetic carrier.

Generally, the quality of the magnetic beads are characterized by
following parameters:&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;&lt;ref name=tk&gt;[http://www.technochemical.com/plscnss/File/Magnetic%20Particles.pdf Magnetic Particles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015130/http://www.technochemical.com/plscnss/File/Magnetic%20Particles.pdf |date=December 3, 2013 }}(Written in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[saturation magnetization]] (～10-80 A m2/kg (emu/g):[[Superparamagnetic]]),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*[[coercive force]] (～ 0.80-15.92 kA/m),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*size [[diameter]] (～ 0.1-0.5 μm),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*mass of each particle (～ 2.7&amp;nbsp;ng),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;
[[Order estimation]] procedures for estimating are as follows.
*Radius of each particle (r) is about
::0.5 μm &lt;math&gt;=0.5 \frac{1}{10^6}\frac{100}{1} cm =0.5\times 10^{-4} cm&lt;/math&gt;.
*So, volume of each particle (V) is about 5.2*10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by
::&lt;math&gt;V=2\times \frac{2}{3}\pi r^3=\frac{4}{3}\pi {r}^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.
*When we supposed that magnatic particle are [[Iron(II,III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] then, the density (D) 5.17 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
*So weight (w) of each particle is about
::w=VD=2.7 pg&lt;/ref&gt;
*ease of collection (to be mentioned later),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*capture ability (to be mentioned later),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*[[Stokes' law|Sedimentation rate]] (～4% in 30 min),&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;
*[[Area ratio]] (&gt; 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g),
*[[Effective density]] (～ 2.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and
*[[Particle counts]] (～ 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; particles/mg).&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;

Here, "ease of collection" is defined and compared by&lt;blockquote&gt;
"magnetic beads are collected by not less than X wt % (～90wt %) within T seconds(～ 3 seconds) in the presence of a magnetic field of Y gauss (～3000 [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]) when it is dispersed in an amount of at least Z mg (～20 mg) in W mL (～1 mL) of an aqueous solution of a sample containing a biological substance" &lt;/blockquote&gt; and, capture ability are defined and compared by&lt;blockquote&gt;
"binding with at least A μg (～0.4μg) of the biological substance per B mg (～1 mg) thereof
when it is dispersed in an amount of at least Z mg (～20 mg) in W mL (～1 mL) of an aqueous solution of a sample containing a biological substance".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Basic principles==
The principle of this method&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boom2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; is based on the nucleic acid-binding properties of silica particles or diatoms in the presence of this chaotropic agent, which are according to the [[Chaotropic agent|chaotropic effect]].

Put simply, the chaotropic effect is where a chaotropic anion in an aqueous solution disturbs the structure of water, and weakens the hydrophobic interaction.&lt;ref name=genecle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/Molbio/MolStudents/spring99/lauren/geneclean.html|title=GENECLEAN assignment|first=Lauren|last=Freeman|website=www.bio.davidson.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=napr&gt;maxXbond: first regeneration system for DNA binding silica matrices
KH Esser, WH Marx, T Lisowsky&amp;nbsp;– Nature Methods| Application Notes, 2006
[http://www.nature.com/app_notes/nmeth/2006/060117/full/nmeth845.html][http://www.nature.com/app_notes/nmeth/2006/060117/fig_tab/nmeth845_F1.html] see also,[http://it.vwr-cmd.com/ex/downloads/life_science/biomarke/0709/bioMarkeMagazine-18_20.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a broad sense, "chaotropic agent" stands for any substance
capable of altering the secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary
structure of proteins and nucleic acids, but leaving at least the
primary structure intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/chaotropic|title=Medical Definition of CHAOTROPIC|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqueous solution of chaotropic salt is a chaotropic agent. Chaotropic anion increase the [[entropy]] of the system by interfering with inter molecular interactions mediated by non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic effects.
Examples thereof are aqueous solution of:
[[thiocyanate ion]], [[iodine ion]], [[perchlorate ion]],
[[nitrate ion]], [[bromine ion]],
[[chlorine ion]], [[acetate ion]], [[fluorine ion]], and
[[sulfate ion]], or mutual combinations therewith.
According to the original method of Boom method, the chaotropic
guanidinium salt employed IS preferably guanidinium
thiocyanate (GuSCN).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the chaotropic effect,
in the presence of the chaotropic agent, hydration water of NA are taken from the [[phosphodiester bond]] of the [[phosphate group]] of the skeleton of a NA. Thereby, the phosphate group becomes "exposed" and hydrophobic interaction between silica and exposed phosphate group are formed.

==Automated instruments==

===Tajima pipette===
Nucleic acid extraction apparatus based on the Tajima pipette&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tajima2/&gt; (see Fig. 2) are one of the most widespread instruments to perform the Boom method.&lt;ref name=pss&gt;
See the web site of {{Interlanguage link multi|Precision System Sciences|2=ja|3=プレシジョン・システム・サイエンス|preserve=1}}
(PSS) Inc.[http://www.pss.co.jp/](Written in Japanese). Web site of their U.S branch are [http://www.pssbio.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tajima pipette was invented by Hideji Tajima,&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; founder and president of
Precision System Sciences (PSS)&lt;ref name=pss/&gt; Inc., a Japanese manufacturer of precision and measuring instruments.
Tajima pipette is a Core Technology of PSS Inc.&lt;ref name=pss/&gt;
PSS Inc. provides [[OEM]] product based on this technology (for example MagNA Pure(R) )
for several leading reagent manufacturers such as [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]], ... and so on.
After Tajima et al.&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; was filed, similar applications such as&lt;ref name=RDTP/&gt; have also been filed by other parties.

The Tajima pipette performs magnetic particle control method and procedure, which can separate magnetic particles combined with a target substance from the liquid by magnetic force and suspend them in a liquid.

====Configurations====
The pipette itself is an apparatus comprising following members (see Fig. 2).&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt;
: '''pipette tip''' configured to be able to access and aspirate/discharge liquid from/into each of vessels, having
::a front end portion,
::a reservoir portion,
::a liquid passage
:::connecting the front end portion and the reservoir portion,
::a separation region
:::in the liquid passage subjected to an action of a magnetic field, and
::a mechanism
:::for applying a negative or positive pressure to the interior of the pipette portion to draw or discharge a magnetic substance suspended liquid into or from the pipette portion
:'''magnetic field Source'''
::arranged on the outside of and adjacent to pipette tip; and
:'''magnetic field source driving device'''
::for driving the magnetic field source to apply or remove a magnetic field to or from the separation region from outside the liquid passage. When the magnet is brought close to the pipette tip, a magnetic field is applied; when retracted away from the pipette tip, that magnetic field is removed.

A nucleic acid extraction apparatus incorporating Tajima pipettes typically consists of:&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt;
:Above mentioned '''Tajima pipette''',
:Plurality of '''tubes'''.
: Plurality of '''tube holder''' for above mentioned tubes,
:'''Transport mean'''
::to transport Tajima pipette among that plurality of tubes (tubes are supported by tube holder), and
:'''Control device'''
::for controlling abovementioned devices.

====Motions====
'''(a) Capturing of the magnetic beads.'''&lt;br&gt;
During this suction process,
when the magnetic field are applied to the separation region of piper tip, from outside of pipette tip, by the magnet arranged on the outside of the pipette tip,
as liquid containing magnetic beads passes through a separation region of the pipette tip,
the magnetic particles are attracted to and arrested to the inner wall of tile separation region of pipette tip.

Subsequently, when that solution are discharged under the conditions of has been kept the magnetic field,
magnetic particles only are left in the inside of pipette tip.
In this way magnetic particles are separated from liquid.

In accordance with Tajima,&lt;ref name=Tajima/&gt;
the preferable suction height of the mixture liquid is such that
:the bottom level of the liquid is higher than the lower end of the separation region of the liquid passage  (That means bottom level of the liquid is higher than the lower end of the magnet.),
::when all the mixture liquid is drawn up,
::so as to ensure that the aspirated magnetic particles can be completely arrested.

At this time, because the magnetic particles are wet, they stay attached to the inner surface of the
separation region of the liquid passage of the pipette tip. If the pipette tip P is moved or
transported, the magnetic particles will not come off easily.

'''(b) Re-suspension of the captured magnetic beads.'''&lt;br&gt;

After the magnetic particles are arrested by above mentioned manner (a),
::so the mixture liquid removed of the magnetic particles is discharged into the liquid accommodating portion (Vessel) and drained out, with only the magnetic particles remaining in the pipette tip,
we can do the re-suspension process.

Re-suspension of the captured magnetic beads are in detail, consists of the following steps.
Of cause, we consider that, the state in which that magnetic material has been captured
by above mention way.
*Aspirate liquid such as washing buffer into the tip
*Quit the application of a magnetic field
::By "Quit the application of a magnetic field" the magnetic particles are suspended in the liquid.
*Discharging the liquid (such as washing buffer) from pipette tip to vessel (in the condition of magnetic force generated by the magnet body is cut off.).

====Operations====
An example of the operations of the nucleic acid extraction apparatus which incorporates
Tajima pipette are typically as shown in Fig. 1.

===Other methods===
Examples of other type of method of the magnetic particle capturing device are as follows.
*Pen type capture&lt;ref name="PP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP2"/&gt;
*tube type capture&lt;ref name=quod/&gt;&lt;ref name=leviathan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7741129|title=Method for treating magnetic particles and biological analysis device using magnets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US7384559&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7384559|title=Device and method for treating magnetic particles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US6764859&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6764859|title=Device and method for mixing magnetic particles with a fluid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CGIAR is unusual in that it is not part of an international political institution such as the United Nations or the World Bank; it is an ad-hoc organization which receives funds from its members.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10947/2549/cgiar%4040_final_LOWRES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The membership of CGIAR includes country governments, institutions, and philanthropic foundations including the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, and Japan, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO), the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), the [[World Bank]], the European Commission, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Fund of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC Fund). In 2009 CGIAR had revenues of US$629 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgiar.org/publications/annual/cgiar-annualreport2010/cgiar-annualreport2010/cgiar_annual_report/2009_CGIAR_Full_Financial_Report_FINAL.pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== CGIAR's vision ==
CGIAR's vision is to:

:Reduce poverty and hunger, improve human health and nutrition, and enhance ecosystem resilience through high-quality international agricultural research, partnership and leadership.

== Strategic objectives ==
CGIAR's vision is supported by four strategic objectives:

* Reducing [[rural poverty]]
* Improving [[food security]]
* Improving [[nutrition]] and [[health]]
* Sustainably managing [[natural resources]]

The Strategy and Results Framework&lt;ref&gt;http://library.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10947/5224/CGIAR-SRF-March_2011_BROCHURE.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; describes how CGIAR intends to work towards those objectives.

== History ==
=== The early years ===
CGIAR arose in response to the widespread concern in the mid-20th century that rapid increases in human populations would soon lead to widespread [[famine]]. Starting in 1943, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the Mexican government laid the seeds for the [[Green Revolution]] when they established the Office of Special Studies, which resulted in the establishment of the [[International Rice Research Institute]] ([[IRRI]]) in 1960 and [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT) in 1963 with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation, developing high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties that dramatically increased production of these staple cereals, and turned India, for example, from a country regularly facing starvation in the 1960s to a net exporter of cereals by the late-1970s. But it was clear that these foundations alone could not fund all the agricultural research and development efforts needed to feed the world's population. In 1969, the [[Pearson Commission on International Development]] urged the international community to undertake "intensive international effort" to support "research specializing in food supplies and tropical agriculture".

In 1970, the Rockefeller Foundation proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat. This was further supported and developed by the [[World Bank]], FAO and UNDP, and CGIAR was established on May 19, 1971, to coordinate international agricultural research efforts aimed at reducing poverty and achieving [[food security]] in developing countries.

CGIAR originally supported four centres: CIMMYT; [[International Rice Research Institute]] ([[IRRI]]); the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT); and the [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]] (IITA). The initial focus on the staple cereals—rice, wheat and maize—widened during the 1970s to include cassava, chickpea, sorghum, potato, millet and other food crops, and encompassed livestock, farming systems, the conservation of genetic resources, plant nutrition, water management, policy research, and services to national agricultural research centers in developing countries. By 1983 there were 13 research centers around the world under its umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;Establishment of CGIAR - see Mark Dowie, ''American Foundations: An Investigative History'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2001, (p.114)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion and consolidation ===
By the 1990s the number of centers supported by CGIAR had grown to 18. Mergers between the two livestock centers the [[International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases]] (ILRAD) and the [[International Livestock Centre for Africa]] (ILCA)) and the absorption of work on bananas and plantains into the program of the [[International Plant Genetic Resources Institute]] (IPGRI; now [[Bioversity International]]) reduced the number to 16. Later another center (ISNAR) was absorbed{{clarification needed|date=March 2017 &lt;!--into what?--&gt;}}, reducing the total number of supported centers to 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiar.org/who/history/index.html#5 |title=History of CGIAR / CGIAR |publisher=Cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction in the number of supported centers was not enough to address problems facing the group. These included the logistics of funders and the group alike in dealing with a large number of centers. This led to the creation of three classes of centers, divided into high, medium, and low impact delivery. 

At the same time, a number of aid recipient countries like China, India, and Malaysia created their own development agencies and developed cadres of agricultural scientists. Private donors and industries also contributed, while research institutions in the rich world turned their attention to problems of the poor. CGIAR, however, failed to embrace these changes in any effective way.

=== CGIAR reforms ===
Seeking to increase its efficiency and build on its previous successes, CGIAR embarked on a program of reform in 2001. Key among the changes implemented was the adoption of Challenge Programs as a means of harnessing the strengths of the diverse centers to address major global or regional issues. Three Challenge Programs were established within the supported research centers and a fourth to FARA, a research forum in Africa:
* Water and Food, aimed at producing more food using less water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?ProjectID=60685 |title=Research for Development &gt; Water and Food Challenge Programme |publisher=DFID |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Including [[Basin Focal Projects]])
* HarvestPlus, to improve the micronutrient content of staple foods;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://knowledge.cta.int/en/S-T-Organisations/International/HarvestPlus |title=HarvestPlus / International / S&amp;T Organisations / Home - Knowledge for Development |publisher=Knowledge.cta.int |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Generation, aimed at increasing the use of [[plant genetic resources | crop genetic resources]] to create a new generation of plants that meet farmers and consumers needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijpg/2008/369601/ |title=The Generation Challenge Programme Platform: Semantic Standards and Workbench for Crop Science |publisher=Hindawi.com |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A new CGIAR ===
Since CGIAR was established there have been large changes in the agricultural research "landscape". Fluctuations in food and energy prices and in financial markets are adding uncertainty to the environment in which farmers and consumers operate. Climate change will have a wide range of impacts on agriculture, with changes in growing conditions for crops, livestock, and fish and the pests and diseases that affect them. Droughts and storms are expected to increase in frequency and severity, undermining the efforts of farmers, foresters and fishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/15538-079b31d45081fe9c3dbc6ff34de4807e4.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - main document3 ivan.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will have a large impact on food security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19703.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, CGIAR embarked on a change process to improve the engagement between all stakeholders in international agricultural research for development—donors, researchers and beneficiaries—and to refocus the efforts of the centers on major global development challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yojana Sharma |url=http://www.scidev.net/en/features/a-revolution-to-combat-world-hunger.html |title=A revolution to combat world hunger |publisher=SciDev.Net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiar.org/changemanagement/briefs/march08.html |title=Browsing by Subject "CGIAR newsletters" |publisher=Cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key objective was to integrate the work of the centers and their partners, avoiding fragmentation and duplication of effort.

CGIAR components include the [[CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers]], the CGIAR Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905190501/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/ |archive-date=2011-09-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the CGIAR Independent Science and Partnership Council (ISPC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencecouncil.cgiar.org/ |title=Independent Science &amp; Partnership Council: ISPC home |publisher=Sciencecouncil.cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partners. Research is guided by the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/sites/cgiarfund.org/files/Documents/PDF/CGIAR-SRF-March%202011_BROCHURE.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331111653/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/sites/cgiarfund.org/files/Documents/PDF/CGIAR-SRF-March%202011_BROCHURE.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CGIAR Consortium unites the centers supported by CGIAR; it coordinates limited research activities of about fifteen research projects (See list below) among the centers and provides donors with a single contact point to centers. The CGIAR Fund aims to harmonize the efforts of donors to contribute to agricultural research for development, increase the funding available by reducing or eliminating duplication of effort among the centers and promote greater financial stability. The CGIAR ISPC, appointed by the CGIAR Fund Council, provides expert advice to the funders of CGIAR, particularly in ensuring that CGIAR's research programs are aligned with the Strategy and Results Framework. It provides a bridge between the funders and the CGIAR Consortium. The hope was that the Strategy and Results Framework would provide the strategic direction for the centers and CGIAR Research Programs, ensuring that they focus on delivering measurable results that contribute to achieving CGIAR objectives. However the research programs were designed prior to the Framework being ready, so now some refitting will have to take place to get the programs inline with it.&lt;ref&gt;http://consortium.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CGIAR-SRF-Feb_20_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A biennial Global Conference on Agricultural Research for Development (GCARD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=What is GCARD GCARD 2012 GCARD 2010 |url=http://www.egfar.org/egfar/website/gcard/aboutGCARD |title=What is GCARD |publisher=EGFAR |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2012-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061054/http://www.egfar.org/egfar/website/gcard/aboutGCARD |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a forum for closer engagement of developing countries and partners in developing and guiding the research and development agenda of the CGIAR Consortium and the CGIAR Fund. The first GCARD was held in Montpellier, France, in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=What is GCARD GCARD 2012 GCARD 2010 |url=http://www.egfar.org/egfarW/website/gcard |title=GCARD |publisher=EGFAR |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061109/http://www.egfar.org/egfarW/website/gcard |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGIAR Consortium was established in April 2010. It is based at the  [[Agropolis International|Agropolis campus]] in Montpellier. The CGIAR Fund was established in January 2010 and is based in Washington, DC.

====CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers====
The '''CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers''' was established in April 2010 to coordinate and support the work of the 15 international agricultural research centers supported by CGIAR.&lt;ref&gt;http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; It plays a central role in formulating the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework (SRF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consortium.cgiar.org/our-strategic-research-framework/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928002728/http://consortium.cgiar.org/our-strategic-research-framework/ |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that guides the work of CGIAR supported centers on CGIAR funded research and developing CGIAR Research Programs under the SRF. The work of the CGIAR Consortium is governed by the Consortium Board, a 10-member panel that has fiduciary responsibility for CGIAR Research Programs, including monitoring and evaluation and reporting progress to donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/the-consortium-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034056/http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/the-consortium-board/ |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CGIAR Research Programs are approved and funded by the CGIAR Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711021646/http://www.cgiarfund.org/ |archive-date=2012-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a contractual basis through performance agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/how_the_fund_works |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101080923/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/how_the_fund_works |archive-date=2011-11-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CGIAR Research Programs ====
CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) are multi-center, multi-partner initiatives built on three core principles: impact on CGIAR's four system-level objectives; making the most of the centers' strengths; and strong and effective partnerships.

The following research programmes have now been approved (lead centers shown in brackets):

*FiSH - Fish in Agri-Food Systems ([[WorldFish]])

A new strategy and results framework was approved in 2015 and the portfolio of research programs revised. The systems programs dryland systems, aquatic agricultural systems, and Humidtropics ceased to be standalone programs, even though they were seen as what was new to the reformed CGIAR, but were not given a real chance to take off and prosper, mainly due to funding reductions, but also because of a refocus on commodity value chains. These commodity programs were renamed to, for example, RTB Systems Program or Rice Systems Program. Some work of the earlier systems programs were incorporated, but most was lost.

== Impacts of CGIAR ==
The impacts of CGIAR research have been extensively assessed, as demonstrated by a review article published in the journal ''Food Policy'' in 2010.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Renkow, M. and Byerlee, D. 2010. The impacts of CGIAR research: A review of recent evidence. Food Policy, 35 (5):391-402&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the impact of the CGIAR centers has come from crop genetic improvement. The high-yielding wheat and rice varieties that were the foundation of the Green Revolution were the beginning of a long line of successes. An assessment of the impact of crop breeding efforts at CGIAR centers between 1965 and 1998 showed that 65 percent of the area planted to ten crops addressed by CGIAR—wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, barley, lentils, beans, cassava, and potatoes—was planted in improved varieties. Of this, 60 percent was sown with varieties with CGIAR ancestry (more than 90 percent in the case of lentils, beans, and cassava), and half of those varieties came from crosses made at a CGIAR center.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, R.E. 2003. Modern variety production: a synthesis. In: Evenson, R.E., Gollin, D. (Eds.), Crop Variety Improvement and its Effect on Productivity: The Impact of International Agricultural Research. [[CAB International|CABI]] Publishing, Wallingford, UK, pp. 427–446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, R.E. 2003. Production impacts of crop genetic improvement programmes. In: Evenson, R.E., Gollin, D. (Eds.), Crop Variety Improvement and its Effect on Productivity: The Impact of International Agricultural Research. CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK, pp. 447–472.&lt;/ref&gt; The monetary value of CGIAR's investment in crop improvement is huge, running into the billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raitzer, D.A. and Kelley, T.G. 2008. Benefit-cost meta-analysis of investment in the international agricultural research centers of the CGIAR. Agricultural Systems, 96 (1–3):108–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centers have also contributed to such fields as improving the nutritional value of staple crops; pest and disease control through breeding resistant varieties; integrated pest management and biological control (e.g., control of the cassava mealybug in sub-Saharan Africa through release of a predatory wasp); improvements in livestock and fish production systems; genetic resources characterization and conservation; improved natural resource management; and contributions to improved policies in numerous areas, including forestry, fertilizer, milk marketing, and genetic resources conservation and use. The introduction of no-tillage systems in the rice-wheat systems in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, for example, generated economic benefits of about US$165 million between 1990 and 2010 from an investment of only US$3.5 million.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Even the most conservative estimate of the measurable benefits of CGIAR research indicate US$2 in benefits for every US$1 invested.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/212527/SCBriefbfitcostan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CRISPR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|p|ər}}) ('''clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats''') is a family of [[DNA]] sequences found within the [[genome]]s of [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms such as bacteria and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name="pmid25574773" /&gt; These sequences are derived from DNA fragments from viruses that have previously infected the prokaryote and are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar viruses during subsequent infections.

Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as '''CRISPR/Cas9''' that can be used to edit genes within organisms.&lt;ref name="pmid24651067"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang F, Wen Y, Guo X | title = CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing: progress, implications and challenges | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = R1 | pages = R40–6 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24651067 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddu125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of gene editing process has a wide variety of applications including use as a basic biology research tool, development of [[biotechnology]] products, and potentially to treat diseases.&lt;ref&gt;CRISPR-CAS9, TALENS and ZFNS - the battle in gene editing https://www.ptglab.com/news/blog/crispr-cas9-talens-and-zfns-the-battle-in-gene-editing/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt;

A simple version of the CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR/Cas9, has been modified to edit genomes. By delivering the [[Cas9]] nuclease complexed with a synthetic [[guide RNA]] (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's [[genome]] can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added.&lt;ref name="nature99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vb99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26121415"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hendel A, Bak RO, Clark JT, Kennedy AB, Ryan DE, Roy S, Steinfeld I, Lunstad BD, Kaiser RJ, Wilkens AB, Bacchetta R, Tsalenko A, Dellinger D, Bruhn L, Porteus MH | title = Chemically modified guide RNAs enhance CRISPR-Cas genome editing in human primary cells | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = 985–9 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26121415 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3290 | pmc=4729442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cas9-gRNA complex corresponds with the CAS III CRISPR-RNA complex in the accompanying diagram.

== History ==
=== Repeated sequences ===
The discovery of clustered DNA repeats occurred independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from [[Osaka University]] researcher [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR together with the ''[[Inhibitor of apoptosis|iap]]'' gene, the target of interest. The organization of the repeats was unusual because repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively along DNA.&lt;ref name="Ishino1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Shinagawa H, Makino K, Amemura M, Nakata A | title = Nucleotide sequence of the iap gene, responsible for alkaline phosphatase isozyme conversion in Escherichia coli, and identification of the gene product | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 169 | issue = 12 | pages = 5429–33 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3316184 | pmc = 213968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu2014" /&gt; They studied the relation of "iap" to the bacterium ''[[E. coli]]''. The function of the interrupted clustered repeats was not known at the time.

In 1993, researchers of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in this bacterium. These researchers recognized the diversity of the DR-intervening sequences among different strains of ''M. tuberculosis''&lt;ref name="Soolingen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Soolingen D, de Haas PE, Hermans PW, Groenen PM, van Embden JD | title = Comparison of various repetitive DNA elements as genetic markers for strain differentiation and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1987–95 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 7690367 | pmc = 265684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used this property to design a typing method that was named ''spoligotyping'', which is still in use today.&lt;ref name="Groenen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groenen PM, Bunschoten AE, van Soolingen D, van Embden JD | title = Nature of DNA polymorphism in the direct repeat cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; application for strain differentiation by a novel typing method | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 1057–65 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 7934856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00976.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mojica2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mojica FJ, Montoliu L |title=On the Origin of CRISPR-Cas Technology: From Prokaryotes to Mammals |journal=Trends in Microbiology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=811–20 |year=2016 |pmid=27401123 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2016.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, repeats were observed in the archaeal organisms of ''[[Haloferax]]'' and ''[[Haloarcula]]'' species, and their function was studied by [[Francisco Mojica]] at the [[University of Alicante]] in Spain. Although his hypothesis turned out to be wrong, Mojica's supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in ''[[Haloferax volcanii]]''. Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mojica2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mojica2016b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Rodriguez-Valera F |title=The discovery of CRISPR in archaea and bacteria |journal=The FEBS Journal |volume=283 |issue=17 |pages=3162–9 |year=2016 |pmid=27234458 |doi=10.1111/febs.13766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, Mojica performed a survey of scientific literature and one of his students performed a search in published genomes with a program devised by himself. They identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes as belonging to the same family.&lt;ref name="Mojica_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, Soria E, Juez G | title = Biological significance of a family of regularly spaced repeats in the genomes of Archaea, Bacteria and mitochondria | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 244–6 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10760181 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01838.x |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who was searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=Mojica2016b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barrangou | first1 = Rodolphe | last2 = van der Oost | first2 = John | name-list-format = vanc | title = CRISPR-Cas Systems : RNA-mediated Adaptive Immunity in Bacteria and Archaea | date = 2013 | publisher = Springer | location = Heidelberg  | isbn = 978-3-642-34656-9 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Tang, et al. showed evidence that CRISPR repeat regions from the genome of [[Archaeoglobus fulgidus]] were transcribed into long RNA molecules that were subsequently processed into unit-length small RNAs, plus some longer forms of 2, 3, or more spacer-repeat units.&lt;ref name="pmid25994611"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charpentier E, Richter H, van der Oost J, White MF | title = Biogenesis pathways of RNA guides in archaeal and bacterial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 428–41 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25994611 | pmc = 5965381 | doi = 10.1093/femsre/fuv023 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CRISPR-associated systems ===
A major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or ''cas'' genes. Four ''cas'' genes (''cas'' 1 - 4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed [[helicase]] and [[nuclease]] motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci.&lt;ref name="pmid11952905"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen R, Embden JD, Gaastra W, Schouls LM | title = Identification of genes that are associated with DNA repeats in prokaryotes | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1565–75 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11952905 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication the acronym CRISPR was coined as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.

[[File:SimpleCRISPR.jpg|thumb|Simplified diagram of a CRISPR locus. The three major components of a CRISPR locus are shown: ''cas'' genes, a leader sequence, and a repeat-spacer array. Repeats are shown as gray boxes and spacers are colored bars. The arrangement of the three components is not always as shown.&lt;ref name="pmid20056882"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/Science.1179555 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20125085" /&gt;
In addition, several CRISPRs with similar sequences can be present in a single genome, only one of which is associated with ''cas'' genes.&lt;ref name="pmid17521438"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grissa I, Vergnaud G, Pourcel C | title = The CRISPRdb database and tools to display CRISPRs and to generate dictionaries of spacers and repeats | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 8 | pages = 172 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17521438 | pmc = 1892036 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-8-172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from [[phage]] DNA and [[extrachromosomal DNA]] such as [[plasmids]].&lt;ref name="pmid15758212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pourcel C, Salvignol G, Vergnaud G | title = CRISPR elements in Yersinia pestis acquire new repeats by preferential uptake of bacteriophage DNA, and provide additional tools for evolutionary studies | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 653–63 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15758212 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.27437-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15791728"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, García-Martínez J, Soria E | title = Intervening sequences of regularly spaced prokaryotic repeats derive from foreign genetic elements | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–82 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15791728 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00239-004-0046-3 | bibcode = 2005JMolE..60..174M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16079334"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolotin A, Quinquis B, Sorokin A, Ehrlich SD | title = Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 2551–61 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16079334 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.28048-0 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/''cas'' system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid20056882" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25963251"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morange M | title = What history tells us XXXVII.

The first publication&lt;ref name="pmid15791728" /&gt; proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by the researchers at the [[University of Alicante]], predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the [[RNA interference]] system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.&lt;ref name=Makarova2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makarova KS, Grishin NV, Shabalina SA, Wolf YI, Koonin EV | title = A putative RNA-interference-based immune system in prokaryotes: computational analysis of the predicted enzymatic machinery, functional analogies with eukaryotic RNAi, and hypothetical mechanisms of action | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16545108 | pmc = 1462988 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published.&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt; A CRISPR region in ''[[Streptococcus thermophilus]]'' acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage. The researchers manipulated the resistance of ''S. thermophilus'' to phage by adding and deleting spacers whose sequence matched those found in the tested phages.&lt;ref name=Marraffini2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="craze"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennisi E | title = The CRISPR craze | journal = Science | volume = 341 | issue = 6148 | pages = 833–6 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23970676 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6148.833 | department = News Focus }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Brouns and Van der Oost identified a complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) that in ''E. coli'' cut the CRISPR RNA precursor within the repeats into mature spacer-containing RNA molecules (crRNA), which remained bound to the protein complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brouns SJ, Jore MM, Lundgren M, Westra ER, Slijkhuis RJ, Snijders AP, Dickman MJ, Makarova KS, Koonin EV, van der Oost J | title = Small CRISPR RNAs guide antiviral defense in prokaryotes | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5891 | pages = 960–4 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18703739 | pmc = 5898235 | doi = 10.1126/science.1159689 | bibcode = 2008Sci...321..960B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it was found that Cascade, crRNA and a helicase/nuclease (Cas3) were required to provide a bacterial host with immunity against infection by a DNA virus. By designing an anti-virus CRISPR, they demonstrated that two orientations of the crRNA (sense/antisense) provided immunity, indicating that the crRNA guides were targeting dsDNA. That year Marraffini and Sontheimer indeed confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'' targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent [[conjugation (genetics)|conjugation]]. This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in ''[[Pyrococcus furiosus]]''.&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marraffini2015/&gt; A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts both strands of phage and plasmid DNA in ''S. thermophilus''.&lt;ref name=Garneau2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garneau JE, Dupuis MÈ, Villion M, Romero DA, Barrangou R, Boyaval P, Fremaux C, Horvath P, Magadán AH, Moineau S | display-authors = 6 | title = The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7320 | pages = 67–71 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21048762 | doi = 10.1038/nature09523 | bibcode = 2010Natur.468...67G | citeseerx = 10.1.1.451.9645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas9 ===
Researchers studied a simpler CRISPR system from ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' that relies on the protein [[Cas9]]. The Cas9 endonuclease is a four-component system that includes two small RNA molecules named CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="Barrangou2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | title = Diversity of CRISPR-Cas immune systems and molecular machines | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 16 | issue =  | pages = 247 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26549499 | pmc = 4638107 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-015-0816-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a "single-guide RNA" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA. By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid22745249" /&gt; Another group of collaborators comprising [[Virginijus Šikšnys]] together with Gasiūnas, Barrangou and Horvath showed that Cas9 from the ''S. thermophilus'' CRISPR system can also be reprogrammed to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of its crRNA.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system has shown to make effective gene edits in Human [[tripronuclear zygotes]] first described in a 2015 paper by Chinese scientists P. Liang and Y. Xu. The system made a successful cleavage of mutant [[HBB|Beta-Hemoglobin]] (HBB) in 28 out of 54 embryos. 4 out of the 28 embryos were successfully recombined using a donor template given by the scientists. The scientists showed that during DNA recombination of the cleaved strand, the homologous endogenous sequence HBD competes with the exogenous donor template. DNA repair in human embryos is much more complicated and particular than in derived stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–372 | date = May 2015 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 | pmid=25894090 | pmc=4417674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cpf1 ===
In 2015, the nuclease Cpf1 was characterized in the [[CRISPR/Cpf1]] system of the bacterium ''[[Francisella novicida]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid26422227"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zetsche B, Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Slaymaker IM, Makarova KS, Essletzbichler P, Volz SE, Joung J, van der Oost J, Regev A, Koonin EV, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease of a class 2 CRISPR-Cas system | journal = Cell | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 759–71 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26422227 | pmc = 4638220 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27096362"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonfara I, Richter H, Bratovič M, Le Rhun A, Charpentier E | title = The CRISPR-associated DNA-cleaving enzyme Cpf1 also processes precursor CRISPR RNA | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7600 | pages = 517–21 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27096362 | doi = 10.1038/nature17945 | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..517F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name, from a [[TIGRFAMs]] [[protein family]] definition built in 2012, reflects the prevalence of its CRISPR-Cas subtype in the Prevotella and Francisella lineages. Cpf1 showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' PAM (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9) and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast Cas9 requires both crRNA and a [[Trans-activating crRNA|transactivating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).

These differences may give Cpf1 some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cpf1's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5' overhangs left by Cpf1 can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning.&lt;ref name="PMC5316869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim ST, Ryu J, Kang BC, Kim JS, and Kim SG | title = CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated DNA-free plant genome editing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 14406 | pages = 14406 | date = February 2017 | pmc = 5316869 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms14406 | pmid=28205546| bibcode = 2017NatCo...814406K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Cpf1 cleaves DNA 18-23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cpf1 enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in indel mutations which destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Cpf1 Nuclease|url = https://www.abmgood.com/marketing/knowledge_base/CRISPR_Cas9_Introduction_Part7.php#ATSPC|website = abmgood.com|accessdate = 2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===

Small clusters of ''cas'' genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 ''cas'' genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the ''cas'' core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the ''cas'' core.&lt;ref name="Makarova2015" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI.&lt;ref name="Wright2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright AV, Nuñez JK, Doudna JA | title = Biology and Applications of CRISPR Systems: Harnessing Nature's Toolbox for Genome Engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 164 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 29–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26771484 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6 system types are divided into 19 subtypes.&lt;ref name="Westra2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westra | first1 = Edze R. | last2 = Dowling | first2 = Andrea J. | last3 = Broniewski | first 3 = Jenny M. | last4 = van Houte | first4 = Stineke | name-list-format = vanc | title = Evolution and Ecology of CRISPR | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date = November 2016 | volume = 47 | issue = 1 |pages = 307–331 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a "signature gene" found almost exclusively in the category.

[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|thumb|left|upright=2|The stages of CRISPR immunity for each of the three major types of adaptive immunity. (1) Acquisition begins by recognition of invading DNA by [[Cas1]] and Cas2 and cleavage of a protospacer. (2) The protospacer is ligated to the direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence and (3) single strand extension repairs the CRISPR and duplicates the direct repeat. The crRNA processing and interference stages occur differently in each of the three major CRISPR systems. (4) The primary CRISPR transcript is cleaved by cas genes to produce crRNAs. (5) In type I systems Cas6e/Cas6f cleave at the junction of ssRNA and dsRNA formed by hairpin loops in the direct repeat. Type II systems use a trans-activating (tracr) RNA to form dsRNA, which is cleaved by [[Cas9]] and RNaseIII. Type III systems use a Cas6 homolog that does not require hairpin loops in the direct repeat for cleavage. (6) In type II and type III systems secondary trimming is performed at either the 5’ or 3’ end to produce mature crRNAs. (7) Mature crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form interference complexes. (8) In type I and type II systems, interactions between the protein and PAM sequence are required for degradation of invading DNA. Type III systems do not require a PAM for successful degradation and in type III-A systems basepairing occurs between the crRNA and mRNA rather than the DNA, targeted by type III-B systems.]]

CRISPR-Cas immunity is a natural process of bacteria and archaea. CRISPR-Cas prevents bacteriophage infection, [[conjugation (genetics)|conjugation]] and [[transformation (genetics)#Natural transformation|natural transformation]] by degrading foreign nucleic acids that enter the cell.&lt;ref name="Marraffini2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA | title = CRISPR-Cas immunity in prokaryotes | journal = Nature | volume = 526 | issue = 7571 | pages = 55–61 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432244 | doi = 10.1038/nature15386 | bibcode = 2015Natur.526...55M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spacer acquisition ===
When a [[microbe]] is invaded by a [[virus]], the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. [[Cas1]] and Cas2 are found in both types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of [[cas1]] or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.&lt;ref name="pmid19120484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aliyari R, Ding SW | title = RNA-based viral immunity initiated by the Dicer family of host immune receptors | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 227 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–88 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19120484 | pmc = 2676720 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23696746"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dugar G, Herbig A, Förstner KU, Heidrich N, Reinhardt R, Nieselt K, Sharma CM | title = High-resolution transcriptome maps reveal strain-specific regulatory features of multiple Campylobacter jejuni isolates | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e1003495 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23696746 | pmc = 3656092 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22160698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatoum-Aslan A, Maniv I, Marraffini LA | title = Mature clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats RNA (crRNA) length is measured by a ruler mechanism anchored at the precursor processing site | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 52 | pages = 21218–22 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22160698 | pmc = 3248500 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112832108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10821218H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22402487"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yosef I, Goren MG, Qimron U | title = Proteins and DNA elements essential for the CRISPR adaptation process in Escherichia coli | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 5569–76 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22402487 | pmc = 3384332 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swarts DC, Mosterd C, van Passel MW, Brouns SJ | title = CRISPR interference directs strand specific spacer acquisition | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35888 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22558257 | pmc = 3338789 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035888 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735888S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid22834906" /&gt;

Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of ''E. coli''. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22771574" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt; This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt;

=== Biogenesis ===
CRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence. The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array.&lt;ref name="pmid20125085" /&gt; This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs. The mechanism to produce crRNAs differs among CRISPR/Cas systems. In type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops&lt;ref name="pmid21572444"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gesner EM, Schellenberg MJ, Garside EL, George MM, Macmillan AM | title = Recognition and maturation of effector RNAs in a CRISPR interference pathway | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 688–92 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572444 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21572442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sashital DG, Jinek M, Doudna JA | title = An RNA-induced conformational change required for CRISPR RNA cleavage by the endoribonuclease Cse3 | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 680–7 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572442 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20829488"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haurwitz RE, Jinek M, Wiedenheft B, Zhou K, Doudna JA | title = Sequence- and structure-specific RNA processing by a CRISPR endonuclease | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5997 | pages = 1355–8 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20829488 | pmc = 3133607 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192272 | bibcode = 2010Sci...329.1355H }}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the pairing of identical repeats that flank the crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunin V, Sorek R, Hugenholtz P | title = Evolutionary conservation of sequence and secondary structures in CRISPR repeats | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = R61 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17442114 | pmc = 1896005 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Cas proteins cleave the longer transcript at the edge of the paired region, leaving a single crRNA along with a small remnant of the paired repeat region.

Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the longer transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage just upstream of the repeat sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid19141480"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carte J, Wang R, Li H, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = Cas6 is an endoribonuclease that generates guide RNAs for invader defense in prokaryotes | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 22 | issue = 24 | pages = 3489–96 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19141480 | pmc = 2607076 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1742908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21300293"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang R, Preamplume G, Terns MP, Terns RM, Li H | title = Interaction of the Cas6 riboendonuclease with CRISPR RNAs: recognition and cleavage | journal = Structure | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–64 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21300293 | pmc = 3154685 | doi = 10.1016/j.str.2010.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24150936"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niewoehner O, Jinek M, Doudna JA | title = Evolution of CRISPR RNA recognition and processing by Cas6 endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 1341–53 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24150936 | pmc = 3902920 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a [[trans-activating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="pmid23696746" /&gt; Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt;

CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.&lt;ref name="pmid19095942" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garneau2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19120484" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21646539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Semenova E, Jore MM, Datsenko KA, Semenova A, Westra ER, Wanner B, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ, Severinov K | display-authors = 6 | title = Interference by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNA is governed by a seed sequence | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 25 | pages = 10098–103 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21646539 | pmc = 3121866 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1104144108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10810098S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21166892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gudbergsdottir S, Deng L, Chen Z, Jensen JV, Jensen LR, She Q, Garrett RA | title = Dynamic properties of the Sulfolobus CRISPR/Cas and CRISPR/Cmr systems when challenged with vector-borne viral and plasmid genes and protospacers | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–49 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21166892 | pmc = 3025118 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07452.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21385233"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manica A, Zebec Z, Teichmann D, Schleper C | title = In vivo activity of CRISPR-mediated virus defence in a hyperthermophilic archaeon | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 481–91 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21385233 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07586.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins bound to a single crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid21460843"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jore MM, Lundgren M, van Duijn E, Bultema JB, Westra ER, Waghmare SP, Wiedenheft B, Pul U, Wurm R, Wagner R, Beijer MR, Barendregt A, Zhou K, Snijders AP, Dickman MJ, Doudna JA, Boekema EJ, Heck AJ, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural basis for CRISPR RNA-guided DNA recognition by Cascade | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 529–36 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21460843 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21938068"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedenheft B, Lander GC, Zhou K, Jore MM, Brouns SJ, van der Oost J, Doudna JA, Nogales E | title = Structures of the RNA-guided surveillance complex from a bacterial immune system | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7365 | pages = 486–9 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21938068 | doi = 10.1038/nature10402 | bibcode = 2011Natur.477..486W | pmc=4165517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interference ===
During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.

Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, [[Cas9]], for the interference step.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt; [[Cas9]] requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).

Type III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid22227115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Rouillon C, Kerou M, Reeks J, Brugger K, Graham S, Reimann J, Cannone G, Liu H, Albers SV, Naismith JH, Spagnolo L, White MF | title = Structure and mechanism of the CMR complex for CRISPR-mediated antiviral immunity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–13 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22227115 | pmc = 3381847 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hale CR, Zhao P, Olson S, Duff MO, Graveley BR, Wells L, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 5 | pages = 945–56 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19945378 | pmc = 2951265 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type III systems analysed from ''S. solfataricus'' and ''P. furiosus'' both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome,&lt;ref name="pmid23320564" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378" /&gt; which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.&lt;ref name="pmid22337052" /&gt;

The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = Self versus non-self discrimination during CRISPR RNA-directed immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7280 | pages = 568–71 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20072129 | pmc = 2813891 | doi = 10.1038/nature08703 | bibcode = 2010Natur.463..568M }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as [[Restriction enzyme#Type V|type V restriction enzymes]].

The cas genes in the adaptor and effector modules of the CRISPR-Cas system are believed to have evolved from two different ancestral modules.

CRISPR/Cas can immunize bacteria against certain phages and thus halt transmission.

Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A | title = Lamarckian Illusions | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 566–568 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26411613 | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2015.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more recent studies have been conducted, it has become apparent that the acquired spacer regions of CRISPR-Cas systems are a from of Lamarckian evolution because they are genetic mutations that are acquired and then passed on.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Wolf YI | title = Just how Lamarckian is CRISPR-Cas immunity: the continuum of evolvability mechanisms | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 9 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26912144 | pmc = 4765028 | doi = 10.1186/s13062-016-0111-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the evolution of the car gene machinery that facilitates the system evolves through classic Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Coevolution ===
Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed [[coevolution]] of host and viral genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidelberg JF, Nelson WC, Schoenfeld T, Bhaya D | title = Germ warfare in a microbial mat community: CRISPRs provide insights into the co-evolution of host and viral genomes | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4169 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19132092 | pmc = 2612747 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004169 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4169H | editor1-last = Ahmed | editor1-first = Niyaz }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in [[pathogen]]ic and [[commensal]] bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, ''[[Francisella novicida]]'' uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial [[lipoprotein]] that is critical for ''F. novicida'' to dampen host response and promote virulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampson TR, Saroj SD, Llewellyn AC, Tzeng YL, Weiss DS | title = A CRISPR/Cas system mediates bacterial innate immune evasion and virulence | journal = Nature | volume = 497 | issue = 7448 | pages = 254–7 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23584588 | pmc = 3651764 | doi = 10.1038/nature12048 | bibcode = 2013Natur.497..254S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt; Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.&lt;ref name="pmid18065545" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt;

=== Rates ===
A study of 124 ''S. thermophilus'' strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt; Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A [[Comparative genomics|comparative genomic]] analysis showed that ''E. coli'' and ''S. enterica'' evolve much more slowly than ''S. thermophilus''. The latter's strains that diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.&lt;ref name="pmid20559554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touchon M, Rocha EP | title = The small, slow and specialized CRISPR and anti-CRISPR of Escherichia and Salmonella | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e11126 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20559554 | pmc = 2886076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011126 | editor1-last = Randau | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511126T | editor1-first = Lennart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[metagenomics|Metagenomic]] analysis of two acid mine drainage [[biofilm]]s showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions versus the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community than the other.&lt;ref name="pmid17894817" /&gt; In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% were shared across individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;

From the same environment a single strain was tracked using [[PCR]] primers specific to its CRISPR system. Broad-level results of spacer presence/absence showed significant diversity. However, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt; suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly.

CRISPRs were analysed from the metagenomes produced for the [[human microbiome project]].&lt;ref name="pmid22719260"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rho M, Wu YW, Tang H, Doak TG, Ye Y | title = Diverse CRISPRs evolving in human microbiomes | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002441 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22719260 | pmc = 3374615 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most were body-site specific, some within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these loci originated from [[streptococcal]] species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some showed little evolution over time.&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt;

CRISPR evolution was studied in [[chemostat]]s using ''S. thermophilus'' to directly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, ''S. thermophilus'' strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun CL, Barrangou R, Thomas BC, Horvath P, Fremaux C, Banfield JF | title = Phage mutations in response to CRISPR diversification in a bacterial population | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 463–70 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23057534 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02879.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same interval the phage developed [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that became fixed in the population, suggesting that targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534" /&gt;

Another ''S. thermophilus'' experiment showed that phages can infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer. Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.&lt;ref name="pmid24586036"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuno S, Sako Y, Yoshida T | title = Diversification of CRISPR within coexisting genotypes in a natural population of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa | journal = Microbiology | volume = 160 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 903–16 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24586036 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.073494-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.

== Identification ==

CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea&lt;ref name="pmid24728998" /&gt; and show some sequence similarities.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114" /&gt; Their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeats decreases the likelihood of a false positive match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sorek R, Kunin V, Hugenholtz P | title = CRISPR--a widespread system that provides acquired resistance against phages in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature Reviews.

Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble, due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22583485"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pride DT, Salzman J, Relman DA | title = Comparisons of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and viromes in human saliva reveal bacterial adaptations to salivary viruses | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 2564–76 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22583485 | pmc = 3424356 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02775.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23701169"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Whitaker RJ | title = Reassortment of CRISPR repeat-spacer loci in Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 3065–76 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23701169 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20927396"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Cadillo-Quiroz H, Whitaker RJ | title = CRISPR associated diversity within a population of Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e12988 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20927396 | pmc = 2946923 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012988 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...512988H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) primers.

The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely ''de novo'' identification&lt;ref name="pmid23511966"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skennerton CT, Imelfort M, Tyson GW | title = Crass: identification and reconstruction of CRISPR from unassembled metagenomic data | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = e105 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23511966 | pmc = 3664793 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from [[contig]]s (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt; and direct repeat sequences from published genomes&lt;ref name="pmid22732228"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stern A, Mick E, Tirosh I, Sagy O, Sorek R | title = CRISPR targeting reveals a reservoir of common phages associated with the human gut microbiome | journal = Genome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 1985–94 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22732228 | pmc = 3460193 | doi = 10.1101/gr.138297.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.

== Use by phages ==

Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having [[genomic island|chromosomal islands]]. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.&lt;ref name="pmid20634809"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Novick RP, Christie GE, Penadés JR | title = The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 541–51 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20634809 | pmc = 3522866 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PICIs are induced, excised, replicated and finally packaged into small capsids by certain staphylococcal temperate phages. PICIs use several mechanisms to block phage reproduction. In first mechanism PICI-encoded Ppi differentially blocks phage maturation by binding or interacting specifically with phage TerS, hence blocks phage TerS/TerL complex  formation responsible for phage DNA packaging. In second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirect the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and pahage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsid and hence become nonviable phage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Kumar K, Ross HF, Ubeda C, Damle PK, Lane KD, Penadés JR, Christie GE, Novick RP|date=October 2012|title=Staphylococcal pathogenicity island interference with helper phage reproduction is a paradigm of molecular parasitism|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=40|pages=16300–5|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204615109|pmc=3479557|pmid=22991467|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins.

One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' [[serogroup]] O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a ''V. cholera'' PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the I-F system found in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="pmid23446421"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seed KD, Lazinski DW, Calderwood SB, Camilli A | title = A bacteriophage encodes its own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to evade host innate immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7438 | pages = 489–91 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23446421 | pmc = 3587790 | doi = 10.1038/nature11927 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..489S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predecessors ===

In the early 2000s, researchers developed [[zinc finger nuclease]]s (ZFNs), synthetic proteins whose [[DNA-binding domains]] enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Susan|date=11 February 2014|title=CRISPR and Other Genome Editing Tools Boost Medical Research and Gene Therapy's Reach|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/524451/genome-surgery|accessdate=2014-04-13|name-list-format=vanc|journal=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[RNA interference|RNA interference (RNAi)]] does not fully suppress gene function, CRISPR, [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]] and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] provide full irreversible [[gene knockout]].&lt;ref name="Heidenreich_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidenreich M, Zhang F | title = Applications of CRISPR-Cas systems in neuroscience | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Genome engineering ===
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a [[CRISPR#Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes|Type II]] CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes [[Cas9]], crRNA, tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR).

CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a [[plasmid]] to [[Transfection|transfect]] the target cells.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table. The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template is designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.

Multiple crRNAs and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://archive.org/details/LyJosephP201311PhDThesis |title=Discovering Genes Responsible for Kidney Diseases |last=Ly |first=Joseph |year=2013 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Toronto |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells.

==== Structure ====
CRISPR/Cas9 offers a high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the PAM. The target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F | title = Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2281–308 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24157548 | pmc = 3969860 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.143 | hdl = 1721.1/102943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialk P, Rivera-Torres N, Strouse B, Kmiec EB | title = Regulation of Gene Editing Activity Directed by Single-Stranded Oligonucleotides and CRISPR/Cas9 Systems | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = e0129308 | date = 2015-06-08 | pmid = 26053390 | pmc = 4459703 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0129308 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1029308B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by Cas9. Cas9 cannot be easily modified to recognize a different PAM sequence. However this is not too limiting as it is a short sequence and nonspecific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt;

Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with the help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single or double strand break in the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/11/12/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-check-three-times-cut-once/ |title=CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing: check three times, cut once | first = Robert | last = Sanders | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 November 2015 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226231842/http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/11/12/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-check-three-times-cut-once/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger [[homology directed repair]], which is less error prone than the non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.

Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Optimized CRISPR Design|url = http://crispr.mit.edu/|website = crispr.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Delivery ====
{{See also|Transfection}}

Delivery of Cas9, sgRNA, and associated complexes into cells can occur via viral and non-viral systems.

Using "dead" versions of Cas9 ([[Cas9#Interference of transcription by dCas9|dCas9]]) eliminates CRISPR's DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dCas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or adjust its level of activity.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"&gt;{{cite web | title = And Science's Breakthrough of the Year is …|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/12/and-science-s-breakthrough-year|website = news.sciencemag.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21|date = December 17, 2015|last = Science News Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated, [[Epigenetics|epigenetically]] modifying the gene. This modification inhibits transcription. These precisely placed modifications may then be used to regulate the effects on gene expressions and DNA dynamics after the inhibition of certain genome sequences within DNA. Within the past few years, epigenetic marks in different human cells have been closely researched and certain patterns within the marks have been found to correlate with everything ranging from tumor growth to brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = CRISPR: gene editing is just the beginning | journal = Nature | volume = 531 | issue = 7593 | pages = 156–9 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26961639 | doi = 10.1038/531156a | url = https://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-is-just-the-beginning-1.19510 | bibcode = 2016Natur.531..156L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) promotes gene transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominguez AA, Lim WA, Qi LS | title = Beyond editing: repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26670017 | pmc = 4922510 | doi = 10.1038/nrm.2015.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.&lt;ref name="pmid24336571"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalem O, Sanjana NE, Hartenian E, Shi X, Scott DA, Mikkelsen TS, Heckl D, Ebert BL, Root DE, Doench JG, Zhang F | title = Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 84–7 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24336571 | pmc = 4089965 | doi = 10.1126/science.1247005 | bibcode = 2014Sci...343...84S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA sequences called [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] that immediately precede the target gene.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

Cas9 was used to carry synthetic [[transcription factor]]s that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different locations on the gene's promoter.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== RNA editing ===
In 2016, researchers demonstrated that CRISPR from an ordinary mouth bacterium could be used to edit [[RNA]]. The researchers searched databases containing hundreds of millions of genetic sequences for those that resembled Crispr genes. They considered the [[fusobacteria]] ''Leptotrichia shahii''. It had a group of genes that resembled CRISPR genes, but with important differences. When the researchers equipped other bacteria with these genes, which they called C2c2, they found that the organisms gained a novel defense.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/science/rna-c2c2-gene-editing-dna-crispr.html | title = Scientists Find Form of Crispr Gene Editing With New Capabilities|last=Zimmer|first=Carl | name-list-format = vanc | date=2016-06-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many viruses encode their genetic information in RNA rather than DNA that they repurpose to make new viruses. [[HIV]] and [[poliovirus]] are such viruses. Bacteria with C2c2 make molecules that can dismember RNA, destroying the virus. Tailoring these genes opened any RNA molecule to editing.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems can also be employed for editing of [[MicroRNA|micro-RNA]] and [[Long non-coding RNA|long-noncoding RNA]] genes in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Basak J, Nithin C | title = Targeting Non-Coding RNAs in Plants with the CRISPR-Cas Technology is a Challenge yet Worth Accepting | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 6 | pages = 1001 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26635829 | pmc = 4652605 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2015.01001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease models ===

CRISPR simplifies creation of [[Genetically modified organism#Mammals|animals for research]] that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is [[Gene knockdown|knocked down]] or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the [[germline]] level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be targeted at non-germline cells.&lt;ref name="pmid25914022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Erp PB, Bloomer G, Wilkinson R, Wiedenheft B | title = The history and market impact of CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases | journal = Current Opinion in Virology | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = 85–90 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25914022 | doi = 10.1016/j.coviro.2015.03.011 | pmc = 4470805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25819765"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maggio I, Gonçalves MA | title = Genome editing at the crossroads of delivery, specificity, and fidelity | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 280–91 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25819765 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25868999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rath D, Amlinger L, Rath A, Lundgren M | title = The CRISPR-Cas immune system: biology, mechanisms and applications | journal = Biochimie | volume = 117 | issue =  | pages = 119–28 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 25868999 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR can be utilized to create human cellular models of disease.

CRISPR/Cas-based "RNA-guided nucleases" can be used to target [[virulence factors]], genes encoding [[antibiotic resistance]] and other medically relevant sequences of interest. This technology thus represents a novel form of antimicrobial therapy and a strategy by which to manipulate bacterial populations.&lt;ref name="Gomaaetal2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gomaa AA, Klumpe HE, Luo ML, Selle K, Barrangou R, Beisel CL| title = Programmable removal of bacterial strains by use of genome-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems | journal = MBio | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e00928–13 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24473129 | pmc = 3903277 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00928-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CitorikMimee2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Citorik RJ, Mimee M, Lu TK | title = Sequence-specific antimicrobials using efficiently delivered RNA-guided nucleases | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 11 | pages = 1141–5 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25240928 | pmc = 4237163 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3011 | hdl = 1721.1/100834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggested a correlation between the interfering of the CRISPR/Cas locus and acquisition of antibiotic resistance&lt;ref name="Gholizadeh2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gholizadeh P, Aghazadeh M, Asgharzadeh M, Kafil HS,| title = Suppressing the CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system in bacterial infections | journal = European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 11 | pages = 2043–2051 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28601970  | doi = 10.1007/s10096-017-3036-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system provides protection of bacteria against invading foreign DNA, such as transposons, bacteriophages and plasmids.

Research suggests that CRISPR is an effective way to limit replication of multiple [[herpesviruses]]. It was able to eradicate viral DNA in the case of [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV). Anti-herpesvirus CRISPRs have promising applications such as removing cancer-causing EBV from tumor cells, helping rid donated organs for [[immunocompromised]] patients of viral invaders, or preventing [[Herpes labialis|cold sore]] outbreaks and recurrent eye infections by blocking [[HSV-1]] reactivation. {{as of|2016|August}}, these were awaiting testing.&lt;ref name="pmid27362483"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Diemen FR, Kruse EM, Hooykaas MJ, Bruggeling CE, Schürch AC, van Ham PM, Imhof SM, Nijhuis M, Wiertz EJ, Lebbink RJ | title = CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing of Herpesviruses Limits Productive and Latent Infections | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = e1005701 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27362483 | pmc = 4928872 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005701 | laysummary = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQaWh8VLkiU | laysource = PLOS Media YouTube Channel }}&lt;/ref&gt; CRISPR is being applied to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27595406"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Zhan Y, Chen Z, He A, Li J, Wu H, Liu L, Zhuang C, Lin J, Guo X, Zhang Q, Huang W, Cai Z | display-authors = 6 | title = Directing cellular information flow via CRISPR signal conductors | journal = Nature Methods | volume =  13| issue =  11| date = September 2016 | pmid = 27595406 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3994 | pages=938–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR may revive the concept of [[Xenotransplantation|transplanting]] animal organs into people. [[Retroviruses]] present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015, a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirus's DNA from the pig genome in a kidney epithelial cell.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"/&gt; Researchers recently demonstrated the ability to birth live pig specimens after removing these retroviruses from their genome using CRISPR for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608579/crispr-opens-up-new-possibilities-for-transplants-using-pig-organs/|title=Using CRISPR on pigs could make their organs safer for human transplant|last=Mullin|first=Emily | name-list-format = vanc |work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR may have applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, such as by creating human blood vessels that lack expression of [[MHC class II]] proteins, which often cause transplant rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abrahimi P, Chang WG, Kluger MS, Qyang Y, Tellides G, Saltzman WM, Pober JS | title = Efficient gene disruption in cultured primary human endothelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–8 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25940550 | pmc = 4490936 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.306290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CRISPR in cancer ====
{{as of|2016}} CRISPR had been studied in animal models and cancer cell lines, to learn if it can be used to repair or thwart mutated genes that cause [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan FA, Pandupuspitasari NS, Chun-Jie H, Ao Z, Jamal M, Zohaib A, Khan FA, Hakim MR, ShuJun Z | title = CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics: a cure for cancer and other genetic diseases | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 7 | issue = 32 | pages = 52541–52552 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27250031 | pmc = 5239572 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.9646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first clinical trial involving CRISPR started in 2016. It involved removing immune cells from people with lung cancer, using CRISPR to edit out the gene expressed PD-1, then administrating the altered cells back to the same person. 20 other trials were under way or nearly ready, mostly in China, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Le Page | name-list-format = vanc | title=Boom in human gene editing as 20 CRISPR trials gear up|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133095-boom-in-human-gene-editing-as-20-crispr-trials-gear-up/|work=New Scientist|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a clinical trial in which CRISPR would be used to alter T cells extracted from people with different kinds of cancer and then administer those engineered T cells back to the same people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20137 |title=First CRISPR clinical trial gets green light from US panel |journal=Nature |year=2016 |last1=Reardon |first1=Sara | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the company CRISPR Therapeutics received approval to start a clinical trial with a CRISPR-based treatment for the blood disorder beta-thalassemia, which is scheduled to start in late 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labiotech.eu/medical/crispr-therapeutics-clinical-trials/|title=CRISPR Therapeutics Plans First CRISPR Clinical Trial in Europe for 2018|date=2017-12-13|work=Labiotech.eu|access-date=2018-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://genomemag.com/2018/05/crispr-beta-thalassemia-treatment-approved-for-clinical-trial-in-europe/|title=CRISPR Beta-Thalassemia Treatment Approved for Clinical Trial in Europe|work=Genome Magazine|access-date=2018-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene function ===
In 2015, multiple studies attempted to systematically disable each individual human gene, in an attempt to identify which genes were essential to human biology. Between 1,600 and 1,800 genes passed this test—of the 20,000 or so known human genes. Such genes are more strongly activated, and unlikely to carry disabling mutations. They are more likely to have indispensable counterparts in other species. They build proteins that unite to form larger collaborative complexes. The studies also cataloged the essential genes in four cancer-cell lines and identified genes that are expendable in healthy cells, but crucial in specific tumor types and drugs that could target these rogue genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Revolutionary Gene-Editing Technique That Reveals Cancer's Weaknesses|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/a-revolutionary-gene-editing-technique-reveals-cancers-weaknesses/417495/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2016-02-21 | first = Ed | last = Yong | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific functions of some 18 percent of the essential genes are unidentified. In one 2015 targeting experiment, disabling individual genes in groups of cells attempted to identify those involved in resistance to a [[melanoma]] drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate "drug", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough" /&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' genetic depletion ===
Unenriched sequencing libraries often have abundant undesired sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage with up to 99% efficiency and without significant [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] as seen with [[restriction enzyme]]s. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.&lt;ref name="pmid26944702"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu W, Crawford ED, O'Donovan BD, Wilson MR, Chow ED, Retallack H, DeRisi JL | title = Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH): using Cas9 to remove unwanted high-abundance species in sequencing libraries and molecular counting applications | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 41 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26944702 | pmc = 4778327 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-016-0904-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In vivo'' applications ===
CRISPR/Cas-9 can be used to edit the DNA of organisms ''in vivo'' and entire chromosomes can be eliminated from an organism at any point in its development. Chromosomes that have been deleted ''in vivo'' are the Y chromosomes and X chromosomes of adult lab mice and human chromosomes 14 and 21, in embryonic stem cell lines and [[aneuploid]] mice respectively. This method might be useful for treating genetic aneuploid diseases such as [[Down Syndrome]] and [[intersex]] disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid29178945"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuo E, Huo X, Yao X, Hu X, Sun Y, Yin J, He B, Wang X, Shi L, Ping J, Wei Y, Ying W, Wei W, Liu W, Tang C, Li Y, Hu J, Yang H | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted chromosome elimination | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 224 | year = 2017 | pmid = 29178945 | pmc = 5701507 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-017-1354-4 | lay-summary = https://www.genomeweb.com/gene-silencinggene-editing/crispr-used-eliminate-targeted-chromosomes-new-study | lay-source= Genome Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised that [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] (editing of genes besides the ones intended) may obscure the results of a CRISRP gene editing experiment (the observed phenotypic change may not be due to modifying the target gene, but some other gene).  Modifications to CRISRP have been made to minimize the possibility of off-target effects.

{{as of|2014|December}}, [[patent rights]] to CRISPR were contested.

As of November 2018, All the CRISPR patent holders and institutes associated with them have set up companies to commercialize the patents by sub-licensing them for therapeutic, agriculture and many other application areas to biotech firms, pharmaceuticals, agri-businesses etc. Caribou Biosciences, ERS Genomics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, and CRISPR Therapeutics are the spin offs associated with CRISPR landscape. Not many large scale commercial assignees have actively participated in the early phases of the CRISPR–Cas patent landscape. The only large establishments making it to the top ten are Dow AgroSciences and DuPont Nutrition Science (now merged as DowDuPont), together holding 20 inventions in CRISPR-Cas9 applications in agriculture and animal biotechnology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/11/prweb15924785.htm|title=CRISPR Cas9 Genome Editing Market Worth $5.3 Billion by 2025|work=PRWeb|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Human germline modification ===

As of March 2015, multiple groups had announced ongoing research to learn how they one day might apply CRISPR to human embryos, including labs in the US, China, and the UK, as well as US biotechnology company [[OvaScience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Antonio | last = Regalado | name-list-format = vanc | journal = MIT Technology Review | date = March 5, 2015 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/ | title = Engineering the Perfect Baby }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists, including a CRISPR co-discoverer, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said "scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans" until the full implications "are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations".&lt;ref name="SCI-20150319"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baltimore D, Berg P, Botchan M, Carroll D, Charo RA, Church G, Corn JE, Daley GQ, Doudna JA, Fenner M, Greely HT, Jinek M, Martin GS, Penhoet E, Puck J, Sternberg SH, Weissman JS, Yamamoto KR | title = Biotechnology.

In April 2015, Chinese scientists reported results of an attempt to alter the [[DNA]] of non-viable [[human embryos]] using CRISPR to correct a [[mutation]] that causes [[beta thalassemia]], a lethal heritable disorder.&lt;ref name="LiangXu2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–72 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25894090 | pmc = 4417674 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150423"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolata | first = Gina  | name-list-format = vanc | title=Chinese Scientists Edit Genes of Human Embryos, Raising Concerns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/health/chinese-scientists-edit-genes-of-human-embryos-raising-concerns.html |date=23 April 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study had previously been rejected by both ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in part because of ethical concerns.&lt;ref name=NatureNews&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17378 |title=Chinese scientists genetically modify human embryos |journal=Nature |year=2015 |last1=Cyranoski |first1=David |last2=Reardon |first2=Sara | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments resulted in successfully changing only some of the intended genes, and had [[Off-target effects of genome editing|off-target effects]] on other genes. The researchers stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in [[reproductive medicine]].&lt;ref name=NatureNews/&gt; In April 2016, Chinese scientists were reported to have made a second unsuccessful attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR - this time to alter the [[CCR5]] gene to make the embryo HIV resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601235/chinese-researchers-experiment-with-making-hiv-proof-embryos/|title=Chinese Researchers Experiment with Making HIV-Proof Embryos|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-05-08|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, an International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of [[David Baltimore]]. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. They agreed to support basic and clinical research under certain legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between [[somatic cells]], where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes could be inherited by descendants. Heritable modifications could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. [[Social Darwinism]]). Altering of [[gametocytes]] and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was defined to be irresponsible. The group agreed to initiate an international forum to address such concerns and harmonize regulations across countries.&lt;ref name="National Academy of Science"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12032015a | date =3 December 2015 | title = International Summit on Gene Editing | publisher =[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] | accessdate = 3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, [[He Jiankui]] announced that he had edited two human embryos, to attempt to disable the gene for [[CCR5]], which codes for a receptor that [[HIV]] uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, Lulu and Nana, had been born a few weeks earlier.  He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 ([[mosaicism]]) and were still vulnerable to HIV.  The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Begley |first1=Sharon |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies - STAT |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT |date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy barriers to genetic engineering ===

Policy regulations for the CRISPR/cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify [[human embryos]] by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaway E | title = UK scientists gain licence to edit genes in human embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 530 | issue = 7588 | pages = 18 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842037 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19270 | bibcode = 2016Natur.530...18C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has an elaborate, interdepartmental regulatory system to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the [[Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000]] gives the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] the authority to oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment and economy of the US. The act regulates any [[genetically modified organism]] that utilizes the genome of a predefined 'plant pest' or any plant not previously categorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McHughen A, Smyth S | title = US regulatory system for genetically modified [genetically modified organism (GMO), rDNA or transgenic] crop cultivars | journal = Plant Biotechnology Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17956539 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2007.00300.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Yinong Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the white button mushroom. Since he had not added any foreign DNA to his organism, the mushroom could not be regulated by the USDA under Section 340.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotechnology/downloads/reg_loi/15-321-01_air_response_signed.pdf|title=Re: Request to confirm &lt;!-- too lazy to type --&gt;|author=USDA|authorlink=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yang's white button mushroom was the first organism genetically modified with the Crispr/cas9 protein system to pass US regulation.&lt;ref name="Waltz_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waltz E | title = Gene-edited CRISPR mushroom escapes US regulation | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7599 | pages = 293 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27111611 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19754 | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..293W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques. With the help of the US [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine]], special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next 5 years and potential policy regulations that would need to come into play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = Gene-editing surges as US rethinks regulations | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7598 | pages = 158–9 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27075074 | doi = 10.1038/532158a | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..158L }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of rogue genetic engineers employing the technology, the [[FDA]] has begun issuing new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-rogue-genetic-engineers/ "The FDA Is Cracking Down On Rogue Genetic Engineers"], Kristen V. Brown. Gizmodo. February 1, 2017. Retrieved 5 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit''' is a branch of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]], based in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. The CBSU is a world-leading centre for cognitive neuroscience, with a mission to improve human health by understanding and enhancing cognition and behaviour in health, disease and disorder. It is one of the largest and most long-lasting contributors to the development of psychological theory and practice. 

The CBSU has its own [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI, 3T) scanner on-site, as well as a 306-channel [[Magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) system and a 128-channel [[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) laboratory.

The CBSU is now an internationally leading centre for research in the cognitive sciences and neurosciences, with close links to clinical neuroscience research in the University of Cambridge Medical School. Over 140 scientists, students, and support staff work in research areas such as Memory, Attention, Emotion, Speech and Language, Development and Aging, Computational Modelling and Neuroscience Methods. With dedicated facilities available on site, the Unit has particular strengths in the application of neuroimaging techniques in the context of well-developed neuro-cognitive theory.

The unit was established in 1944 as the '''MRC Applied Psychology Unit'''.&lt;ref name="HoMBRG"&gt;{{cite Q|Q29581668}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the [[History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group]] held a [[witness seminar]] to gather information on the unit's history.&lt;ref name="HoMBRG" /&gt;

On 1 July 2017, the CBU was merged with the University of Cambridge. Coming under the Clinical School, the unit is still funded by the British government through Research Councils UK but is managed and maintained by Cambridge University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4329">'''Conjugate eye movement''' refers to motor coordination of the eyes that allows for bilateral fixation on a single object.  
A conjugate eye movement is a movement of both eyes in the same direction to maintain binocular gaze (also referred to as “yoked” eye movement). This is in contrast to [[vergence]] eye movement, where binocular gaze is maintained by moving eyes in opposite directions, such as going “cross eyed” to view an object moving towards the face. Conjugate eye movements can be in any direction, and can accompany both [[saccade|saccadic]] eye movements and [[smooth pursuit]] eye movements.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, D. (n.d.). The Classification of Eye Movements. Retrieved from [http://www.opt.indiana.edu/v665/CD/CD_Version/CH2/CH2.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjugate eye movements are used to change the direction of gaze without changing the depth of gaze. This can be used to either follow a moving object, or change focus entirely. When following a moving object, conjugate eye movements allow individuals to stabilize their perception of the moving object, and focus on the object rather than the rest of the visual world. When changing focus, conjugate eye movements allow for the perception of a stabilized world relative to an individual, rather than the perception of the world “jumping” as the individual’s gaze shifts.  Without conjugate eye movements, there would be no synchronicity of the information obtained by each eye, so an individual would not be able to willingly move their eyes around a scene while still maintaining depth perception and scene or object stability.&lt;ref&gt;Enderle, J. D. (2010). Models of horizontal eye movements: Part I: Early models of
Saccades and smooth pursuit. S.l.: Morgan &amp; Claypool.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several centers in the brainstem are involved. Horizontal conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of the [[Ocular nerve|Ocular Nerve]], CN III, and the [[Abducens nerve]], CN VI, the [[paramedian pontine reticular formation]], and the [[nucleus prepositus hypoglossi]]-medial [[Vestibular nuclei|vestibular nucleus]]. Vertical conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of CN III and the [[Trochlear nerve]], CN IV, the [[rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus]] (riMLF), and the [[interstitial nucleus of Cajal]].&lt;ref&gt;Fine structure of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal of the cat. J Anat. 1995 August; 187(Pt 1): 141–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opt.indiana.edu/v665/CD/CD_Version/CH2/CH2.HTM|title=Oculomotor Functions &amp; Neurology CD-ROM|last=Hodgson|first=Douglas|date=|year=2004|website=www.opt.indiana.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disorders of conjugate gaze typically consist of the inability to move one or both eyes in the desired direction, or the inability to prevent eyes from making vergence movements.

[[Conjugate gaze palsy]]: Conjugate gaze palsies typically affect horizontal gaze, although some affect upward gaze. Few affect downward gaze. These effects can range in severity from a complete lack of voluntary eye movement to mild impairments in speed, accuracy or range of eye movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben, M. (2017, November). Conjugate Gaze Palsies - Neurologic Disorders. Retrieved from
[https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/neurologic-disorders/neuro-ophthalmologic-and-cranial-nerve-disorders/conjugate-gaze-palsies]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internuclear ophthalmoplegia]]: Internuclear ophthalmoplegia affects horizontal gaze, such that one eye is capable of full horizontal movement, while the other is incapable of gazing in the direction contralateral to the affected eye.&lt;ref&gt;Toral, M., Haugsdal, J., &amp; Wall, M. (2017, June 08). Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia. Retrieved from [https://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/cases/252-internuclear-ophthalmoplega.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[One and a half syndrome]]: “One and a half syndrome” also affects horizontal gaze. One eye is completely incapable of horizontal movement, while the other eye is capable of horizontal movement only in one direction away from the midline.&lt;ref&gt;Xue, F., Zhang, L., Zhang, L., Ying, Z., Sha, O., &amp; Ding, Y. (2017). One-and-a-half syndrome with its spectrum disorders. Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery, 7(6), 691-697. doi:10.21037/qims.2017.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1297">A '''cue tone''' is a message consisting of [[Audio frequency|audio]] [[Pitch (music)|tone]]s, used to prompt an action.

In [[broadcast network]]s, a [[DTMF]] cue tone or [[subaudible tone]] was traditionally used to prompt [[local insertion|insertion]] of a local [[TV commercial]] or [[radio advertisement]] by the [[broadcast automation]] equipment at the [[broadcasting|broadcast station]] or [[cable headend]]. This has been replaced in the IPTV with digital cue tones (typically [[SCTE-35]] streams in North America).

Cue tones were also used on [[broadcast cart]]s (cartridge [[magnetic tape|tape]]s) to cue local equipment to start and stop, particularly to cue the [[tape player]] itself, as the tape runs in an [[endless loop]] and often contains several [[:wikt:segment|segment]]s of [[content (media)|content]].

{{Cyber anthropology}}
'''Cyborg anthropology''' is a discipline that studies the interaction between humanity and technology from an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective. The discipline is relatively new, but offers novel insights on new technological advances and their effect on culture and society.

== History ==
[[Donna Haraway]]’s 1984 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto|"]]''[[Cyborg Manifesto|"A Cyborg Manifesto"]] was the first widely-read academic text to explore the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the cyborg.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1992 presented a paper entitled "Cyborg Anthropology", which cites Haraway's "Manifesto". The group described cyborg anthropology as the study of how humans define humanness in relationship to machines, as well as the study of science and technology as activities that can shape and be shaped by culture. This includes studying the ways that all people, including those who are not scientific experts, talk about and conceptualize technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Downey|first=Gary Lee|last2=Dumit|first2=Joseph|last3=Williams|first3=Sarah|year=1995|title=Cyborg Anthropology|url=|journal=Cultural Anthropology|volume=10|pages=264-269|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-group was closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie. Cyborg Anthropology. Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Amber Case]] has been responsible for explicating the concept of Cyborg Anthropology to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/amber-case/|title=Amber Case, Cyborg Anthropologist Information, Facts, News, Photos -- National Geographic|first=National Geographic|last=Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that a key aspect of cyborg anthropology is the study of networks of information among humans and technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Illustrated Dictionary of Cyborg Anthropology|last=Case|first=Amber|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1494773519|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many academics have helped develop cyborg anthropology, and many more who haven't heard the term still are today conducting research that may be considered cyborg anthropology, particularly research regarding technologically advanced prosthetics and how they can influence an individual's life. A 2014 summary of holistic American anthropology intersections with cyborg concepts (whether explicit or not) by Joshua Wells explained how the information-rich and culture-laden ways in which humans imagine, construct, and use tools may extend the cyborg concept through the human evolutionary lineage&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Joshua|date=2014|title=Keep Calm and Remain Human: How We Have Always Been Cyborgs and Theories on the Technological Present of Anthropology|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00938157.2014.872460|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=43|pages=5-34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Amber Case generally tells people that the actual number of self-described cyborg anthropologists is "about seven".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caseorganic.com/2008/11/robots-robots-everywhere-a-field-guide-to-cyborg-anthropology/|title=Robots, Robots, Everywhere – A Field Guide to Cyborg Anthropology {{!}} The World is not a desktop|website=caseorganic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://cyborganthropology.com/Main_Page The Cyborg Anthropology Wiki], overseen by Case, aims to make the discipline as accessible as possible, even to people who do not have a background in anthropology.

== Methodology ==
Cyborg anthropology uses traditional methods of anthropological research like ethnography and participant observation, accompanied by statistics, historical research, and interviews. By nature it is a multidisciplinary study; cyborg anthropology can include aspects of [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[cybernetics]], [[feminist theory]], and more.  It primarily focuses on how people use  discourse about science and technology in order to make these meaningful in their lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.downey.sts.vt.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1995-Cyborg-Anthropology-.pdf/|title= Cyborg Anthropology: Anthropologies of the Body {{!}} Volume 10, Number 2, May 1995 |website=downey.sts.vt.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== 'Cyborg' origins and meaning ===
Originally coined in a 1960 paper about [[space exploration]], the term is short for cybernetic organism.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.scribd.com/doc/2962194/Cyborgs-and-Space-Clynes-Kline?autodown=pdf Cyborgs and Space]," in ''Astronautics'' (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.&lt;/ref&gt; A cyborg is traditionally defined as a system with both organic and inorganic parts. In the narrowest sense of the word, cyborgs are people with machinated body parts. These cyborg parts may be restorative technologies that help a body function where the organic system has failed, like [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]s, [[insulin pump]]s, and [[bionic]] limbs, or enhanced technologies that improve the human body beyond its natural state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cyborg Handbook|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Gray|editor-first=Chris Hables|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadest sense, all human interactions with technology could qualify as a cyborg. Most cyborg anthropologists lean towards the latter view of the cyborg; some, like Amber Case, even claim that humans are already cyborgs because people's daily life and sense of self is so intertwined with technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto" suggests that technology like virtual avatars, artificial insemination, sexual reassignment surgery, and artificial intelligence might make dichotomies of sex and gender irrelevant, even nonexistent. She goes on to say that other human distinctions (like life and death, human and machine, virtual and real) may similarly disappear in the wake of the cyborg.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cybercultures Reader|last=Haraway|first=Donna|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-18378-2|editor-last=Bell|editor-first=David|location=|pages=291-324|chapter=A Cyborg Manifesto|quote=|editor-last2=Kennedy|editor-first2=Barbara|via=Georgetown University Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital vs. cyborg anthropology ===
{{Main|Digital anthropology}}

[[Digital anthropology]] is concerned with how digital advances are changing how people live their lives, as well as consequent changes to how anthropologists do ethnography and to a lesser extent how digital technology can be used to represent and undertake research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://savageminds.org/2012/03/22/digital-anthropology-group-is-happening-now/|title=Digital Anthropology Group Is Happening Now|last=Thompson|first=Matt|date=2012-03-22|website=Savage Minds|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg anthropology also looks at disciplines like [[genetics]] and nanotechnology, which are not strictly digital. Cybernetics/informatics covers the range of cyborg advances better than the label digital.

== Key concepts and research ==

=== Actor–network theory ===
{{main|Actor–network theory}}
Questions of [[subjectivity]], agency, actors, and structures have always been of interest in [[social anthropology|social]] and [[cultural anthropology]]. In cyborg anthropology the question of what type of cybernetic system constitutes an actor/subject becomes all the more important. Is it the actual technology that acts on humanity (the Internet), the general techno-culture ([[Silicon Valley]]), government sanctions ([[net neutrality]]), specific innovative humans ([[Steve Jobs]]), or some type of combination of these elements? Some academics believe that only humans have agency and technology is an object humans act upon, while others argue that humans have no agency and culture is entirely shaped by material and technological conditions. [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT), proposed by [[Bruno Latour]], is a theory that helps scholars understand how these elements work together to shape techno-cultural phenomena. Latour suggests that actors and the subjects they act on are parts of larger networks of mutual interaction and feedback loops. Humans and technology both have the agency to shape one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network Theory|last=Latour|first=Bruno|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANT best describes the way cyborg anthropology approaches the relationship between humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyborganthropology.com/Defining_Cyborg_Anthropology|title=Defining Cyborg Anthropology - Cyborg Anthropology|website=cyborganthropology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Wells explain how new forms of networked political expression such as the [[Pirate Party]] movement and [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source software]] philosophies are generated from human reliance on information technologies in all walks of life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Researchers like Kathleen Richardson have conducted ethnographic research on the humans who build and interact with artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Anthropology of Robots and AI: Annihilation Anxiety and Machines|last=Richardson|first=Kathleen|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1138831742|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Stuart Geiger, a PhD student at [[University of California, Berkeley]] suggested that robots may be capable of creating a culture of their own, which researchers could study with ethnographic methods. Anthropologists react to Geiger with skepticism because, according to Geiger, they believe that culture is specific to living creatures and ethnography limited to human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Heather|date=2012-01-15|title=The ethnography of robots|url=http://ethnographymatters.net/blog/2012/01/15/the-ethnography-of-robots/|journal=Ethnography Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Posthumanism ===
The most basic definition of anthropology is the study of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/|title=American Anthropological Association|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cyborgs, by definition, describe something that is not entirely an organic human. Moreover, limiting a discipline to the study of humans may be difficult the more that technology allows humans to transcend the normal conditions of organic life. The prospect of a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] condition calls into question the nature and necessity of a field focused on studying humans. 

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] of technology [[Zeynep Tufekci]] argues that any symbolic expression of ourselves, even the most ancient cave painting, can be considered "posthuman" because it exists outside of our physical bodies. To her, this means that the human and the "posthuman" have always existed alongside one another, and anthropology has always concerned itself with the posthuman as well as the human.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Neil L. Whitehead and Michael Welsch point out that the concern that posthumanism will decenter the human in anthropology ignores the discipline's long history of engaging with the unhuman (like spirits and demons that humans believe in) and the culturally "subhuman" (like marginalized groups within a society).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human No More? Digital Subjectivities, Unhuman Subjects, and the End of Anthropology|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|last2=Wesch|first2=Michael|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60732-170-5|location=Boulder|pages=1-21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Contrarily, Wells, taking a deep-time perspective, points out the ways that tool-centric and technologically communicated values and ethics typify the human condition, and that cross-cultural and ethnological trends in conceptions of lifeways, power dynamics, and definitions of humanity often incorporate information-rich technological symbology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Data-centric security''' is an approach to security that emphasizes the security of the [[data]] itself rather than the security of [[Computer network|networks]], [[Server (computing)|servers]], or applications. Data-centric security is evolving rapidly as enterprises increasingly rely on digital information to [[business process|run their business]] and [[big data]] projects become mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;

Data-centric security also allows organizations to overcome the disconnect between IT security technology and the objectives of business strategy by relating security services directly to the data they implicitly protect; a relationship that is often obscured by the presentation of security as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;

* Manage: the ability to define access policies that will determine if certain data is accessible, editable, or blocked from specific users, or locations.
* Protect: the ability to defend against data loss or unauthorized use of data and prevent sensitive data from being sent to unauthorized users or locations.
* Monitor: the constant monitoring of data usage to identify meaningful deviations from normal behavior that would point to possible malicious intent.

From a technical point of view, information(data)-centric security relies on the implementation of the following:&lt;ref&gt;

* Information (data) that is self-describing and defending.
* Policies and controls that account for business context.
* Information that remains protected as it moves in and out of applications and storage systems, and changing business context.
* Policies that work consistently through the different data management technologies and defensive layers implemented.

== Technology ==

===Data access controls and policies=== 
Data [[access control]] is the selective restriction of access to data. Accessing may mean viewing, editing, or using. Defining proper access controls requires to map out the information, where it resides, how important it is, who it is important to, how sensitive the data is and then designing appropriate controls.&lt;ref&gt;

===Encryption===
{{main|Encryption}}
Encryption is a proven data-centric technique to address the risk of data theft in smartphones, laptops, desktops and even servers, including the cloud. One limitation is that encryption is not always effective once a network intrusion has occurred and cybercriminals operate with stolen valid user credentials.&lt;ref&gt;  Encryption solutions with multi-factor authentication are much more effective in preventing such access.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data masking===
{{main|Data masking}}
Data Masking is the process of hiding specific data within a database table or cell to ensure that data security is maintained and that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized personnel. This may include masking the data from users, developers, third-party and outsourcing vendors, etc.
Data masking can be achieved multiple ways: by duplicating data to eliminate the subset of the data that needs to be hidden, or by obscuring the data dynamically as users perform requests.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Auditing===
{{main|Security audit}}
Monitoring all activity at the data layer is a key component of a data-centric security strategy. It provides visibility into the types of actions that users and tools have requested and been authorized to on specific data elements. Continuous monitoring at the data layer combined with precise access control can contribute significantly to the real-time detection of data breaches, limits the damages inflicted by a breach and can even stop the intrusion if proper controls are in place. A 2016 survey&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
shows that most organizations still don't assess database activity continuously and lack the capability to identify database breaches in a timely fashion.

== Cloud computing  ==
[[Cloud computing]] is an evolving paradigm with tremendous momentum, but its unique aspects exacerbate security and privacy challenges. Heterogeneity and diversity of cloud services and environments demand fine-grained access control policies and services that should be flexible enough to capture dynamic, context, or attribute-based access requirements and data protection.&lt;ref&gt;

 | url = http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/SE765/Paper/security2.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data-centric security in the public cloud environments=== 
In recent decades many organizations rely on managing database services in public clouds such [[Amazon Web Services]], [[Oracle Cloud]], [[Google Cloud Platform]] or [[Microsoft Azure]] to organize their data.
Such approach has its own limitations on what users can do with managing security of their sensitive data. For instance, hardware security appliances or agents running on the database servers are no longer an option. This requires innovative ways to secure data and databases such as using reverse proxy sitting between clients / applications and database servers. The requirements such supporting a load balancing, high availability and fail-over in data-centric security brings additional challenges that database security vendors must meet. &lt;ref&gt;

'''David Greetham''' (born October 21, 1941) is an Anglo-American literary critic and the founder of the [[Society for Textual Scholarship]].

==Career==

Greetham received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1963 and completed his Ph.D. in English at the [[City University of New York]].

[[Marta Werner]] of [[D'Youville College]] describes Greetham as "drawn to texts that spill over the boundaries of genre, that exist in multiple versions, that explore intertextuality, and that complicate in various other ways the notion of text as fixed or stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=Marta|title=Post-Everything|journal=Text|date=2003|volume=15|pages=337–349|ref=post_everything|jstor=30227799}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works, Greetham has sought to co-opt "the terminology
and practice of literary theory in re-designating textual operations in
the guise of ... literature, anthropology, sociology,
gender studies, history, political science, linguistics, psychology, [and]
philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greetham|first1=David C.|title=Theories of the Text|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67Yg06eUaDkC|accessdate=15 April 2015|ref=theories_text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theorist of scholarly editing, Greetham has taken up a middle ground between [[intentionalist]] positions like that of [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] and the [[social textual criticism]] of [[Jerome McGann]], maintaining the goal of establishing an authoritative text while allowing the possibility that multiple authorized versions can exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathijsen|first1=Marita|title=The Concept of Authorisation|journal=Text|date=2002|volume=14|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his later work, Greetham has moved away from the idea that an editor can establish a "psychic" connection with the author through which he or she can determine the author's true intentions, instead seeing editing as an occasion for reflections on the ideology underlying scholarly practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Marta|title=Signals from a Distance: Editing, Telepathy, Elegy|journal=Textual Cultures|date=2008|volume=3|issue=1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society for Textual Scholarship==

Greetham was one of the founders of the Society for Textual Scholarship and served as the Society's President from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Society for Textual Scholarship|journal=Textual Cultures|date=Spring 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=166–169|jstor=10.2979/textcult.6.1.166|ref=soc_text|doi=10.2979/textcult.6.1.166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1979, the Society provides an interdisciplinary forum for presentation of research in a number of textual disciplines. Notable past members have included [[G. Thomas Tanselle]], [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Fredson Bowers]], and [[Jerome McGann]].

'''Deadpan''', '''dry humor''' or '''dry wit'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rishel|first=Mary Ann|title=Writing humor|year=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=0-8143-2959-4|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBsC3ItxoYQC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22dry+wit%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y2tJT83UMIaAOoiwzewN&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dry%20wit%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate display of a lack of or no emotion, commonly as a form of [[Comedy|comedic]] delivery to contrast with the ridiculousness of the subject matter. The delivery is meant to be blunt, [[ironic]], [[laconic]], or apparently unintentional.

==Etymology==
The term ''deadpan'' first emerged as an [[adjective]] or [[adverb]] in the 1920s, as a [[compound word]] combining "dead" and "pan" (a [[slang]] term for the face). The oldest usage recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' comes from ''[[The New York Times]]'' (1928), which defines the term as "playing a role with expressionless face".&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. [http://oed.com/view/Entry/47677 "dead-pan, adj., n., adv., and v."] Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. accessed 17 February 2012. First published in ''A Supplement to the OED I'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this usage is in a scene from the 1934 film ''[[The Gay Bride]]'' in which a [[gangster]] tells a man on the other end of a phone conversation to "give it a dead pan" (with the emphasis on "pan"), so that the man does not inadvertently alert anyone else in the room as to the importance of what the gangster is about to say. The usage of deadpan as a [[verb]] ("to speak, act, or utter in a deadpan manner; to maintain a dead pan") is recorded at least as far back as 1942.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|List of deadpan comedians}}
[[File:USO Vietnam 1968 Troop - Jennie Frankel, Tony Diamond, Sara Sue, Sig Sakowitz, Joey Bishop, Tippi Hedren, Mel Bishop, Jennie Frankel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rat Pack]] comedian [[Joey Bishop]], noted for his deadpan style, with Jennie and Terrie Frankel (Doublemint Twins), Sig Sakowitz, Tony Diamond, Sara Sue, Tippi Hedren and Mel Bishop]]
Early in his vaudeville days, [[Buster Keaton]] developed his deadpan expression.  Keaton realized that audiences responded better to his stony expression than when he smiled, and he carried this style into his silent film career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/deadpan-the-comedy-of-buster-keaton|title=Deadpan: the comedy of Buster Keaton|work=[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=17 April 1964|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 film ''[[Airplane!]]'' was performed almost entirely in deadpan.&lt;ref name="MIL"&gt;{{cite news| last=Dudek| first=Duane| title=25 years and still laughing; Airplane!' maintains its cruising| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|accessdate=23 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430053901/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493 |archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor, including ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', and ''[[My Name Is Earl]]''. More recent examples are [[Andre Braugher]] as Captain Raymond Holt from the TV show ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'', [[Jennette McCurdy]] as Sam Puckett in ''[[iCarly]]'', and [[Louis C.K.]] in ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''. Another example is the comedy of [[Steven Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=E.C. | title=The Everything Big Book of Jokes: Hundreds of the Shortest, Longest, Silliest, Smartest, Most Hilarious Jokes You've Never Heard! | publisher=Adams Media | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4405-7698-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zrsDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 | access-date=June 29, 2017 | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry humor is often confused with [[highbrow]] or [[egghead]] humor, because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words or delivery. Instead, the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words, delivery and [[Context (language use)|context]]. Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor unfunny. However, the term "deadpan" itself actually refers only to the method of delivery.

The '''Enzyme Function Initiative''' ('''EFI''') is a large-scale collaborative project aiming to develop and disseminate a robust strategy to determine [[enzyme]] function through an integrated sequence–structure-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=New NIGMS ‘Glue Grant’ Takes Aim at Unknown Enzymes |publisher=NIGMS |date=2010-05-20 |url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/Results/gluegrant_051510.htm |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427131544/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/Results/gluegrant_051510.htm |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was funded in May 2010 by the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] as a Glue Grant which supports the research of complex biological problems that cannot be solved by a single research group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/Collaborative/GlueGrants/ |title=Glue Grants |accessdate=2012-04-27 |work= |publisher=NIGMS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603062033/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/Collaborative/GlueGrants/ |archivedate=2013-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PAR-07-412&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-07-412.html|title=PAR-07-412: Large-Scale Collaborative Project Awards (R24/U54) |accessdate=2012-04-27 |work= |publisher=NIH/NIGMS }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EFI was largely spurred by the need to develop methods to identify the functions of the enormous number proteins discovered through [[Genomics|genomic]] sequencing projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Researchers Awarded $33.9 Million Grant to Study Enzyme Functions |publisher=UIUC News Bureau |date=2010-05-20 |url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/10/0520gerlt.html |accessdate=2012-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
The dramatic increase in genome sequencing technology has caused the number of [[Peptide sequence|protein sequences]] deposited into public databases to grow apparently exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/TrEMBLstats/ |accessdate=2012-04-27 |title=UniProtKB/TrEMBL Protein Database Release Statistics |work= |publisher=UniProtKB/TrEMBL Protein Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To cope with the influx of sequences, databases use computational predictions to auto-annotate individual protein's functions.  While these computational methods offer the advantages of being extremely high-throughput and generally provide accurate broad classifications, exclusive use has led to a significant level of misannotation of enzyme function in protein databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000605 |title=Annotation Error in Public Databases: Misannotation of Molecular Function in Enzyme Superfamilies |year=2009 |editor1-last=Valencia |editor1-first=Alfonso |last1=Schnoes |first1=Alexandra M. |last2=Brown |first2=Shoshana D. |last3=Dodevski |first3=Igor |last4=Babbitt |first4=Patricia C. |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e1000605 |pmid=20011109 |pmc=2781113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus although the information now available represents an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular metabolism across a wide variety of organisms, which includes the ability to identify molecules and/or reactions that may benefit human quality of life, the potential has not been fully actualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=130–42 |doi=10.1038/nchembio0805-130 |title=Assignment of protein function in the postgenomic era |year=2005 |last1=Saghatelian |first1=Alan |last2=Cravatt |first2=Benjamin F |journal=Nature Chemical Biology |volume=1 |issue=3 |pmid=16408016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological community's ability to characterize newly discovered proteins has been outstripped by the rate of genome sequencing, and the task of assigning function is now considered the rate-limiting step in understanding biological systems in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/gb-2006-7-1-r8 |year=2006 |last1=Brown |first1=Shoshana |last2=Gerlt |first2=John |last3=Seffernick |first3=Jennifer |last4=Babbitt |first4=Patricia |journal=Genome Biology |volume=7 |pages=R8 |pmid=16507141 |title=A gold standard set of mechanistically diverse enzyme superfamilies |issue=1 |pmc=1431709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrated strategy for functional assignment ==
The EFI is developing an integrated sequence-structure based strategy for functional assignment by predicting the [[Substrate specificity|substrate specificities]] of unknown members of mechanistically diverse [[Protein family|enzyme superfamilies]].&lt;ref name=EFIBIOCHEM&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gerlt JA, Allen KN, Almo SC, Armstrong RN, Babbitt PC, Cronan JE, Dunaway-Mariano D, Imker HJ, Jacobson MP, Minor W, Poulter CD, Raushel FM, Sali A, Shoichet BK, Sweedler JV|title=The Enzyme Function Initiative.|journal=Biochemistry|date=Nov 22, 2011|volume=50|issue=46|pages=9950–62|pmid=21999478|doi=10.1021/bi201312u|pmc=3238057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach leverages conserved features within a given superfamily such as known chemistry, identity of [[active site]] functional groups, and composition of specificity-determining residues, motifs, or structures to predict function but relies on multidisciplinary expertise to streamline, refine, and test the predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=486–91 |doi=10.1038/nchembio.2007.11 |title=Prediction and assignment of function for a divergent N-succinyl amino acid racemase |year=2007 |last1=Song |first1=Ling |last2=Kalyanaraman |first2=Chakrapani |last3=Fedorov |first3=Alexander A |last4=Fedorov |first4=Elena V |last5=Glasner |first5=Margaret E |last6=Brown |first6=Shoshana |last7=Imker |first7=Heidi J |last8=Babbitt |first8=Patricia C |last9=Almo |first9=Steven C |journal=Nature Chemical Biology |volume=3 |issue=8 |pmid=17603539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05981 |title=Structure-based activity prediction for an enzyme of unknown function |year=2007 |last1=Hermann |first1=Johannes C. |last2=Marti-Arbona |first2=Ricardo |last3=Fedorov |first3=Alexander A. |last4=Fedorov |first4=Elena |last5=Almo |first5=Steven C. |last6=Shoichet |first6=Brian K. |last7=Raushel |first7=Frank M. |journal=Nature |volume=448 |issue=7155 |pages=775–779 |pmid=17603473 |pmc=2254328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1668–77 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2008.08.015 |title=Discovery of a Dipeptide Epimerase Enzymatic Function Guided by Homology Modeling and Virtual Screening |year=2008 |last1=Kalyanaraman |first1=C |last2=Imker |first2=H |last3=Fedorov |first3=A |last4=Fedorov |first4=E |last5=Glasner |first5=M |last6=Babbitt |first6=P |last7=Almo |first7=S |last8=Gerlt |first8=J |last9=Jacobson |first9=M |journal=Structure |volume=16 |issue=11 |pmid=19000819 |pmc=2714228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The integrated sequence-strategy under development will be generally applicable to deciphering the ligand specificities of any functionally unknown protein.&lt;ref name="EFIBIOCHEM"/&gt;

== Organization ==
By NIGMS program mandate, Glue Grant consortia must contain core resources and bridging projects.&lt;ref name=PAR-07-412/&gt; The EFI consists of six scientific cores which provide bioinformatic, structural, computational, and data management expertise to facilitate functional predictions for enzymes of unknown function targeted by the EFI. At the beginning of the grant, these predictions were tested by five Bridging Projects representing the amidohydrolase, enolase, GST, HAD, and isoprenoid synthase enzyme superfamilies. Three Bridging Projects now remain.&lt;ref name="EFIBIOCHEM"/&gt; In addition, the Anaerobic Enzymology Pilot Project was added in 2014 to explore the Radical SAM superfamily and Glycyl Radical Enzyme superfamily.

=== Scientific cores ===

The bioinformatics core contributes [[bioinformatic]] analysis by collecting and curating complete sequence data sets, generating sequence similarity networks, and classification of superfamily members into subgroups and families for subsequent annotation transfer and evaluation as targets for functional characterization.

The protein core develops cloning, expression, and [[protein purification]] strategies for the enzymes targeted for study.

The structure core fulfills the [[structural biology]] component for EFI by providing high resolution structures of targeted enzymes.

The computation core performs ''in silico'' [[Docking (molecular)|docking]] to generate rank-ordered lists of predicted substrates for targeted enzymes using both experimentally determined and/or homology modeled protein structures.

The microbiology core examines ''in vivo'' functions using genetic techniques and [[metabolomics]] to compliment ''[[in vitro]]'' functions determined by the Bridging Projects.

The data and dissemination core maintains a public database for experimental data (EFI-DB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=2545–55 |doi=10.1021/bi052101l |title=Leveraging Enzyme Structure−Function Relationships for Functional Inference and Experimental Design:  The Structure−Function Linkage Database† |year=2006 |last1=Pegg |first1=Scott C.-H. |last2=Brown |first2=Shoshana D. |last3=Ojha |first3=Sunil |last4=Seffernick |first4=Jennifer |last5=Meng |first5=Elaine C. |last6=Morris |first6=John H. |last7=Chang |first7=Patricia J. |last8=Huang |first8=Conrad C. |last9=Ferrin |first9=Thomas E. |journal=Biochemistry |volume=45 |issue=8 |pmid=16489747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EFI-DB&gt;{{cite web|title=EFI-DB Experimental Database|url=http://kiemlicz.med.virginia.edu/efi/|publisher=Enzyme Function Initiative|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bridging projects ===
The [[enolase superfamily]] contains evolutionarily related enzymes with a (β/α)7β‑barrel (TIM‑barrel) fold which primarily catalyze metal-assisted epimerization/racemization or β-elimination of carboxylate substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=59–70 |doi=10.1016/j.abb.2004.07.034 |title=Divergent evolution in the enolase superfamily: The interplay of mechanism and specificity |year=2005 |last1=Gerlt |first1=John A. |last2=Babbitt |first2=Patricia C. |last3=Rayment |first3=Ivan |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=433 |pmid=15581566 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haloacid dehydrogenase superfamily]] contains evolutionarily related enzymes with a Rossmanoid α/β fold with an inserted "cap" region which primarily catalyze metal-assisted nucleophilic catalysis, most frequently resulting in phosphoryl group transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1003–34 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2006.06.049 |title=Evolutionary Genomics of the HAD Superfamily: Understanding the Structural Adaptations and Catalytic Diversity in a Superfamily of Phosphoesterases and Allied Enzymes |year=2006 |last1=Burroughs |first1=A.

The Anaerobic Enzymology bridging project will explore radical-dependent enzymology, which allows the execution of unusual chemical transformations via an iron-sulfur cluster cleaving S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) and producing a radical intermediate, or alternatively, abstraction of a hydrogen from glycine producing a glycyl radical. The superfamilies containing these enzymes are largely unexplored and thus, ripe with the potential for functional discoveries. The acquisition of an anaerobic protein production pipeline coupled with the installation of a Biosafety Level 2 anaerobic chamber for culturing human gut microbes has readied the EFI to pursue anaerobic enzymology.

== Deliverables ==
The EFI's primary deliverable is development and dissemination of an integrated sequence/structure strategy for functional assignment.  The EFI now offers access to two high-throughput docking tools, a web tool for comparing protein sequences within entire protein families, and a web tool for composing a genome context inventory based on a protein sequence similarity network. Additionally, as the strategy is developed, data and clones generated by the EFI are made freely available via several online resources.&lt;ref name="EFIBIOCHEM"/&gt;

== Funding ==
The EFI was established in May 2010 with $33.9 million in funding over a five-year period (grant number GM093342).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/Collaborative/GlueGrants/OutcomeAssessment |title=NIGMS Glue Grants Outcomes Assessment |accessdate=2012-04-27 |work= |publisher=NIGMS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427104459/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/Collaborative/GlueGrants/OutcomeAssessment/ |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1164">In [[astrophysics]], particularly the study of [[accretion disk]]s, the '''epicyclic frequency''' is the frequency at which a radially displaced fluid parcel will oscillate. It can be referred to as a "[[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]] discriminant".  When considering an astrophysical disc with differential rotation &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, the epicyclic frequency &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{2} \equiv \frac{2 \Omega}{R}\frac{d}{dR}(R^2 \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, where R is the radial co-ordinate.&lt;ref&gt;p161, Astrophysical Flows, Pringle and King 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

This quantity can be used to examine the 'boundaries' of an accretion disc - when &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{2}&lt;/math&gt; becomes negative then small perturbations to the (assumed circular) orbit of a fluid parcel will become unstable, and the disc will develop an 'edge' at that point.  For example, around a Schwarzschild black hole, the [[Innermost Stable Circular Orbit]] (ISCO) occurs at 3x the event horizon - at &lt;math&gt;6GM/c^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a Keplerian disk, &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Fern sports''' are plants that show marked change from the normal type or parent stock as a result of mutation. The term [[Morphotype]] is also used for any of a group of different types of individuals of the same species in a population. Fern [[frond]]s in sports are typically altered in several ways, such as the frond apex divided and [[Pinnate|pinna]]e similarly duplicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardenseeker.com/roses/rose-plant-sports.htm Plants Sports] Retrieved : 2011-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Soft Shield Fern ''[[Polystichum setiferum]]'', Lady Fern ''[[Athyrium filix-femina]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fibrex.co.uk/hardy-british-ferns/athyrium-2/ Lady Fern sports] Retrieved : 2011-07-23&lt;/ref&gt; and Hart's Tongue Fern ''[[Asplenium scolopendrium]]'' are known to have around three hundred varieties or sports.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;[http://www.peterboyd.com/pteridomania.htm Peter D. A. Boyd's Pteridomania] Retrieved : 2011-07-22&lt;/ref&gt; Scaly Male Fern [[Dryopteris affinis]] and Male Fern [[Dryopteris filix-mas]] have a number of commercially available and naturally occurring sports or subspecies. Examples are ''D. affinis polydactyla Dadds'', ''A. filix-femina plumosum'', ''A. filix-femina corymbiferum'', and ''D. filix-mas Barnesii''   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardyferns.com/dbase.asp Hardy Ferns] Retrieved : 2011-07-23&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Characteristics==
The frond of a sport may be branched at the tip and at the tips of the pinna, the colour may vary, and variegation may occur; fronds generally remain bilaterally symmetrical. Ferns sports remain normal in certain respects, such as viability with [[Sorus|sori]] and [[Indusium|indusia]] appearing normal. The frond stipe may be a different colour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferns.rogergolding.co.uk/ferngenus/athyrium/filixfemina.html Male Fern] Retrieved : 2011-07-23&lt;/ref&gt;

;Misidentification
[[File:Fern sports - insect damage.jpg|200px|thumb|Typical asymmetric frond resulting from likely insect damage.]]
Galls on ferns and other physical damage to fern fronds can be mistaken as sports, however this is usually asymmetric, ferns generally being bilaterally symmetrical. In ''Athyrium'' and ''Dryopteris'' species white maggots of ''Chirosia betuleti'' create mop-head galls on fern frond tips that look somewhat like fern sports, however this is physical damage and not a growth form.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Page 288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rarity==
Ferns sports particularly suffered during the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] [[Pteridomania]] ('Fern-Fever') [[Social mania|craze]], when over collecting of fern species included over collecting unusual fern varieties.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt;

Fluxomics falls within the field of [[systems biology]] which developed with the appearance of high throughput technologies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aon|first=Miguel A.|last2=Cortassa|first2=Sonia|date=2015-07-22|title=Systems Biology of the Fluxome|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/3/3/607|journal=Processes|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=607–618|doi=10.3390/pr3030607}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Systems biology recognizes the complexity of biological systems and has the broader goal of explaining and predicting this complex behavior.&lt;ref name="Cascante 67–82"/&gt;

== Metabolic flux ==
Metabolic flux refers to the rate of metabolite conversion in a metabolic network.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349514030690|title=From Metabolomics to Fluxomics: A Computational Procedure to Translate Metabolite Profiles into Metabolic Fluxes|access-date=2016-04-11|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.1857|volume=108|issue=1|pages=163–172|journal=Biophysical Journal|pmid=25564863|pmc=4286601 | last1 = Cortassa | first1 = S | last2 = Caceres | first2 = V | last3 = Bell | first3 = LN | last4 = O'Rourke | first4 = B | last5 = Paolocci | first5 = N | last6 = Aon | first6 = MA|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a reaction this rate is a function of both enzyme abundance and enzyme activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Enzyme concentration is itself a function of transcriptional and translational regulation in addition to the stability of the protein.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Enzyme activity is affected by the kinetic parameters of the enzyme, the substrate concentrations, the product concentrations, and the effector molecules concentration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The genomic and environmental effects on metabolic flux are what determine healthy or diseased phenotype.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Fluxome ==
Similar to genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, the fluxome is defined as the complete set of metabolic fluxes in a cell.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  However, unlike the others the fluxome is a dynamic representation of the phenotype.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This is due to the fluxome resulting from the interactions of the metabolome, genome, transcriptome, proteome, post-translational modifications and the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Flux analysis technologies ==
Two important technologies are [[flux balance analysis]] (FBA) and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-fluxomics.  In FBA metabolic fluxes are estimated by first representing the metabolic reactions of a metabolic network in a numerical matrix containing the stoichiometric coefficients of each reaction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orth|first=Jeffrey D.|last2=Thiele|first2=Ines|last3=Palsson|first3=Bernhard Ø|date=2010-03-01|title=What is flux balance analysis?|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n3/full/nbt.1614.html|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=245–248|doi=10.1038/nbt.1614|issn=1087-0156|pmc=3108565|pmid=20212490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stoichiometric coefficients constrain the system model and are why FBA is only applicable to steady state conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Additional constraints can be imposed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  By providing constraints the possible set of solutions to the system are reduced.  Following the addition of constraints the system model is optimized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Flux-balance analysis resources include the BIGG database,&lt;ref name="KingLu2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Zachary A.|last2=Lu|first2=Justin|last3=Dräger|first3=Andreas|last4=Miller|first4=Philip|last5=Federowicz|first5=Stephen|last6=Lerman|first6=Joshua A.|last7=Ebrahim|first7=Ali|last8=Palsson|first8=Bernhard O.|last9=Lewis|first9=Nathan E.|title=BiGG Models: A platform for integrating, standardizing and sharing genome-scale models|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=44|issue=D1|year=2016|pages=D515–D522|issn=0305-1048|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv1049|pmid=26476456|pmc=4702785}}&lt;/ref&gt; the COBRA toolbox,&lt;ref name="SchellenbergerQue2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schellenberger|first1=Jan|last2=Que|first2=Richard|last3=Fleming|first3=Ronan M T|last4=Thiele|first4=Ines|last5=Orth|first5=Jeffrey D|last6=Feist|first6=Adam M|last7=Zielinski|first7=Daniel C|last8=Bordbar|first8=Aarash|last9=Lewis|first9=Nathan E|last10=Rahmanian|first10=Sorena|last11=Kang|first11=Joseph|last12=Hyduke|first12=Daniel R|last13=Palsson|first13=Bernhard Ø|title=Quantitative prediction of cellular metabolism with constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox v2.0|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=6|issue=9|year=2011|pages=1290–1307|issn=1754-2189|doi=10.1038/nprot.2011.308|pmid=21886097|pmc=3319681}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FASIMU.&lt;ref name="HoppeHoffmann2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoppe|first1=Andreas|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Sabrina|last3=Gerasch|first3=Andreas|last4=Gille|first4=Christoph|last5=Holzhütter|first5=Hermann-Georg|title=FASIMU: flexible software for flux-balance computation series in large metabolic networks|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=12|issue=1|year=2011|pages=28|issn=1471-2105|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-12-28|pmid=21255455|pmc=3038154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-fluxomics, metabolic precursors are enriched with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C before being introduced to the system.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krömer | first1 = J. | last2 = Quek | first2 = L. E. | last3 = Nielsen | first3 = L. | year = 2009 | title = 13C-Fluxomics: a tool for measuring metabolic phenotypes | url = | journal = Aust Biochem | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using an imaging technique such as mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the level of incorporation of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C into metabolites can be measured and with stoichiometry the metabolic fluxes can be estimated.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Stoichiometric and kinetic paradigms==
A number of different methods, broadly divided into [[stoichiometric]] and [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic]] paradigms.

Within the stoichiometric paradigm, a number of relatively simple linear algebra methods use restricted [[metabolic network]]s or genome-scale [[metabolic network modelling|metabolic network models]] to perform [[flux balance analysis]] and the array of techniques derived from it.  These linear equations are useful for steady state conditions.  Dynamic methods are not yet usable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fluxomics – connecting 'omics analysis and phenotypes|journal = Environmental Microbiology|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1462-2920|pages = 1901–1916|volume = 15|issue = 7|doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12064|language = en|first = Gal|last = Winter|first2 = Jens O.|last2 = Krömer|pmid=23279205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the more experimental side, [[metabolic flux analysis]] allows the empirical estimation of reaction rates by [[Isotopic labeling|stable isotope labelling]].

Within the kinetic paradigm, kinetic modelling of metabolic networks can be purely theoretical, exploring the potential space of dynamic metabolic fluxes under perturbations away from steady state using formalisms such as [[biochemical systems theory]]. Such explorations are most informative when accompanied by empirical measurements of the system under study following actual perturbations, as is the case in [[metabolic control analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Demin | first1 = O. | last2 = Goryanin | first2 = I. | title = Kinetic Modelling in Systems Biology | year = 2010 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | isbn = 9781420011661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constraint based reconstruction and analysis==
Collected methods in fluxomics have been described as "COBRA" methods, for ''co''nstraint ''b''ased ''r''econstruction and ''a''nalysis. A number of software tools and environments have been created for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Klamt | first1 = S. | last2 = Saez-Rodriguez | first2 = J. | last3 = Gilles | first3 = E.

A '''functional block diagram''' in [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]] is a [[block diagram]]. It describes the functions and interrelationships of a [[system]]. 

The functional block diagram can picture:&lt;ref&gt;James Perozzo (1994) ''The complete guide to electronics troubleshooting''. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
* Functions of a system pictured by blocks  
* input and output elements of a block pictured with lines 
* the relationships between the functions, and 
* the functional sequences and paths for matter and or signals&lt;ref&gt;William H. Von Alven (1964) ''Reliability engineering'' explains: "Functional block diagrams show functional sequences and signal paths, and items which are wired in parallel are drawn in parallel" (p. 286)&lt;/ref&gt;
The block diagram can use additional schematic symbols to show particular properties. 

Functional block diagrams have been used in a wide range applications, from [[systems engineering]] to [[software engineering]], since the late 1950s. They became a necessity in complex systems design to "understand thoroughly from exterior design the operation of the present system and the relationship of each of the parts to the whole."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry H. Goode]], [[Robert Engel Machol]] (1957) System engineering: an introduction to the design of large-scale systems. p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many specific types of functional block diagrams have emerged. For example, the [[functional flow block diagram]] is a combination of the functional block diagram and the [[flow chart]]. Many software development methodologies are built with specific functional block diagram techniques. An example from the field of industrial computing is the [[Function Block Diagram]] (FBD), a graphical language for the design of [[programmable logic controller]]s.

A '''heterotroph''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|t|ər|ə|ˌ|t|r|oʊ|f|,_|-|ˌ|t|r|ɒ|f}};&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|grc|τροφή}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek ἕτερος ''héteros'' = "other" plus ''trophe'' = "nutrition") is an [[organism]] that cannot produce its own food, relying instead on the intake of nutrition from other sources of organic carbon, mainly plant or animal matter. In the food chain, heterotrophs are secondary and tertiary consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heterotroph Definition |publisher=Biology Dictionary |url=https://biologydictionary.net/heterotroph/|date=15 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="essential microbiology"&gt;{{cite book | last= Hogg| first= Stuart| title= Essential Microbiology| year= 2013| edition=2nd| publisher= Wiley-Blackwell| page= 86| isbn= 978-1-119-97890-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-five percent or more of all types of living organisms are heterotrophic, including all [[animal]]s and [[fungi]] and some [[bacteria]] and [[protists]].&lt;ref name="cell"&gt;[http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0072965819/415836/rav65819_ch07.pdf "How Cells Harvest Energy"]. McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The term heterotroph arose in [[microbiology]] in 1946 as part of a classification of [[microorganisms]] based on their type of [[nutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;Lwoff, A., C.B. van Niel, P.J. Ryan, and E.L. Tatum (1946). Nomenclature of nutritional types of microorganisms. ''Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology'' (5th edn.), Vol. XI, The Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., pp. 302–303, [http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/11/local/back-matter.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now used in many fields, such as [[ecology]] in describing the [[food chain]].

Heterotrophs may be subdivided according to their energy source. If the heterotroph uses chemical energy, it is a [[chemotroph|chemoheterotroph]] (e.g., humans and mushrooms). If it uses light for energy, then it is a [[photoheterotroph]] (e.g., [[green non-sulfur bacteria]]).

Heterotrophs represent one of the two mechanisms of nutrition ([[trophic levels]]), the other being [[autotroph]]s (auto = self, troph = nutrition). Autotrophs use energy from [[sunlight]] ([[photoautotroph]]s) or inorganic compounds ([[lithoautotroph]]s) to convert inorganic [[carbon dioxide]] to organic carbon compounds and energy to sustain their life. Comparing the two in layman's terms, heterotrophs (such as animals) eat either autotrophs (such as plants) or other heterotrophs, or both.
 
[[Detritivore]]s are heterotrophs which obtain [[nutrient]]s by consuming [[detritus]] (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as [[feces]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel, R. G. 2001. Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems. Academic Press. 3rd. p.700.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saprotroph]]s (also called lysotrophs) are [[chemoheterotroph]]s that use [[extracellular digestion]] in processing decayed organic matter. It is a term most often associated with [[fungus|fungi]]. The process is most often facilitated through the [[active transport]] of such materials through [[endocytosis]] within the internal mycelium and its constituent [[hypha]]e.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1"&gt;''Advanced biology principles'', p 296—states the purpose of saprotrophs and their internal nutrition, as well as the main two types of fungi that are most often referred to, as well as describes, visually, the process of saprotrophic nutrition through a diagram of hyphae, referring to the Rhizobium on damp, stale whole-meal bread or rotting fruit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Heterotrophs can be [[organotroph]]s or [[lithotroph]]s. Organotrophs exploit reduced carbon compounds as electron sources, like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from plants and animals. On the other hand, lithotrophs use inorganic compounds, such as ammonium, nitrite, and sulfur to obtain electron sources. Another way of classifying different heterotrophs is by assigning them as [[chemotroph]]s or [[phototroph]]s. Phototrophs utilize light to obtain energy and carry out metabolic processes, whereas chemotrophs use the energy obtained by the oxidation of chemicals from their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mills|first1=A.L.|title=The Environmental Geochemistry of Mineral Deposits: Part A: Processes, Techniques, and Health Issues Part B: Case Studies and Research Topics|date=1997|publisher=Society of Economic Geologists|isbn=978-1-62949-013-7|pages=125–132|url=http://lmecol.evsc.virginia.edu/pubs/C13-Mills_Bull%20Econ%20Geol%20.PDF|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoorganoheterotrophs, such as [[Rhodospirillaceae]] and purple non-sulfur bacteria synthesize organic compounds using sunlight coupled with oxidation of organic substances, including [[hydrogen sulfide]], elemental [[sulfur]], [[thiosulfate]], and molecular [[hydrogen]].
They use organic compounds to build structures. They do not fix carbon dioxide and apparently do not have the [[Light-independent reactions#Calvin Cycle|Calvin cycle]].&lt;ref name="botany"&gt;{{cite book | last= Mauseth| first= James D.| title= Botany: an introduction to plant biology| year= 2008| edition=4th| publisher= Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers| page= 252| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xPLGdYW9t5kC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=heterotroph+fix+carbon&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=heterotroph%20fix%20carbon&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-7637-5345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemolithoheterotrophs like the ''Oceanithermus profundus''&lt;ref&gt;M.

[[Mixotroph]]s (or facultative chemolithotroph) can use either carbon dioxide or organic carbon as the carbon source, meaning that mixotrophs have the ability to use both heterotrophic methods as well as autotrophic methods.&lt;ref name="biogeochemistry"&gt;{{cite book | last= Libes| first= Susan M.| title= Introduction to marine biogeochemistry| year= 2009| edition=2nd| publisher= Academic Press| page= 192| url= https://books.google.com/?id=KVZJUw4nORgC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotrophs+inorganic&amp;cd=53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-12-088530-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prokaryotes"&gt;{{cite book | last= Dworkin| first= Martin| title= The prokaryotes: ecophysiology and biochemistry| year= 2006| edition=3rd| publisher= Springer| page= 988| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uleTr2jKzJMC&amp;pg=PA988&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotroph+chemoorganoheterotroph&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph%20chemoorganoheterotroph&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-387-25492-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although mixotrophs have the ability to grow both under both heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions, ''C. vulgaris'' have higher biomass and lipid productivity when growing under heterotrophic conditions compared to autotrophic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=Yanna|title=Biomass and lipid productivities of Chlorella vulgaris under autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth conditions|journal=Biotechnology Letters|date=July 2009|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1043–1049|doi=10.1007/s10529-009-9975-7|pmid=19322523|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterotrophs, by consuming reduced carbon compounds, are able to use all the energy that they obtain from food for growth and reproduction, unlike autotrophs, which must use some of their energy for carbon fixation.&lt;ref name="botany" /&gt; Both heterotrophs and autotrophs alike are usually dependent on the metabolic activities of other organisms for nutrients other than carbon, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, and can die from lack of food that supplies these nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell and Reece|title=Biology|date=2002|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Co.|isbn=978-0805371710|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies not only to animals and fungi but also to bacteria.&lt;ref name="botany" /&gt;

Many heterotrophs are [[Organotroph|chemoorganoheterotrophs]] that use organic carbon (e.g. glucose) as their carbon source, and organic chemicals (e.g. carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) as their energy and electron sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lmecol.evsc.virginia.edu/pubs/C13-Mills_Bull%20Econ%20Geol%20.PDF|title=The role of bacteria in environmental geochemistry|last1=Mills|first1=A.L.|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterotrophs function as [[Consumer (food chain)|consumers in food chain]]: they obtain these nutrients from [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]], [[Parasitic nutrition|parasitic]], or [[Holozoic nutrition|holozoic nutrients]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/22/m022p101.pdf|title=Heterotrophic nutrition and control of bacterial density|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They break down complex organic compounds (e.g., carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) produced by autotrophs into simpler compounds (e.g., carbohydrates into [[glucose]], fats into [[fatty acids]] and [[glycerol]], and proteins into [[amino acids]]). They release energy by oxidizing carbon and hydrogen atoms present in carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins to carbon dioxide and water, respectively.

They can catabolize organic compounds by respiration, fermentation, or both. [[Fermentation|Fermenting]] heterotrophs are either facultative or obligate [[anaerobes]] that carry out fermentation in low oxygen environments, in which the production of ATP is commonly coupled with [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] and the production of end products (e.g. alcohol, CO2, sulfide).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4612-1072-6|title=Bacterial Metabolism|last1=Gottschalk|first1=Gerhard|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0387961538|edition=2|accessdate=19 November 2017|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-1072-6|series=Springer Series in Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; These products can then serve as the substrates for other bacteria in the [[anaerobic digest]], and be converted into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is an important step for the carbon cycle for removing organic fermentation products from anaerobic environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Heterotrophs can undergo [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], in which ATP production is coupled with [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=MICB 201: Introductory Environmental Microbiology|last1=Wade|first1=Bingle|date=2016|pages=236–250|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the release of oxidized carbon wastes such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reduced wastes like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into the atmosphere. Heterotrophic microbes’ respiration and fermentation account for a large portion of the release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere, making it available for autotrophs as a source of nutrient and plants as a cellulose synthesis substrate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Processes in Microbial Ecology|last1=Kirchman|first1=David L.|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199586936|pages=79–98|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Respiration in heterotrophs is often accompanied by [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]], the process of converting organic compounds to inorganic forms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the organic nutrient source taken in by the heterotroph contains essential elements such as N, S, P in addition to C, H, and O, they are often removed first to proceed with the oxidation of organic nutrient and production of ATP via respiration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; S and N in organic carbon source are transformed into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through desulfurylation and [[deamination]], respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Heterotrophs also allow for [[dephosphorylation]] as part of [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The conversion of N and S from organic form to inorganic form is a critical part of the [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[sulfur cycle]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S formed from desulfurylation is further oxidized by lithotrophs and phototrophs while NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; formed from deamination is further oxidized by lithotrophs to the forms available to plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Heterotrophs’ ability to mineralize essential elements is critical to plant survival.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most [[opisthokont]]s and [[prokaryotes]] are heterotrophic; in particular, all animals and fungi are heterotrophs.&lt;ref name="cell" /&gt; Some animals, such as [[coral]]s, form [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with autotrophs and obtain organic carbon in this way. Furthermore, some [[parasitic plant]]s have also turned fully or partially heterotrophic, while [[carnivorous plant]]s consume animals to augment their nitrogen supply while remaining autotrophic.

Animals are classified as heterotrophs by ingestion, fungi are classified as heterotrophs by absorption.

'''Homogenization''' in [[Climatology|climate research]] means the removal of non-climatic changes. Next to [[Climate change|changes in the climate]] itself, raw climate records also contain non-climatic jumps  and changes for example due to relocations or changes in instrumentation. The most used principle to remove these inhomogeneities is the relative homogenization approach in which a candidate [[Weather station|stations]] is compared to a reference time series based on one or more neighboring stations. The candidate and reference station(s) experience about the same climate, non-climatic changes that happen only in one station can thus be identified and removed.

==Climate observations==
To study climate change and variability long instrumental climate records are essential, but are best not used directly. These datasets are essential since they are the basis for assessing century-scale trends or for studying the natural (long-term) variability of climate, amongst others. The value of these datasets, however, strongly depends on the homogeneity of the underlying time series. A homogeneous climate record is one where variations are caused only by variations in weather and climate. Long instrumental records are rarely, if ever homogeneous.

Results from the homogenization of instrumental western climate records indicate that detected inhomogeneities in mean temperature series occur at a frequency of roughly 15 to 20 years.&lt;ref name="aueretal2007"&gt;Auer, I., R. Bohm, A. Jurkovic, W. Lipa, A. Orlik, R. Potzmann, W. Schoner, M. Ungersbock, C. Matulla, P. Jones, D. Efthymiadis, M. Brunetti, T. Nanni, K. Briffa, M. Maugeri, L. Mercalli, O. Mestre, et al.

M., Collins, D., and Braganza, K.: "Updating Australia’s high quality annual temperature dataset". ''Austr. Meteor. Mag.'', 53, 277-292, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
It should be kept in mind that most measurements have not been specifically made for climatic purposes, but rather to meet the needs of weather forecasting, agriculture and hydrology.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C. N. jr., Menne, M. J., [[Peter Thorne (climatologist)|Thorne, P.W.]] "Benchmarking the performance of pairwise homogenization of surface temperatures in the United States. Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres", 117, D5, {{doi|10.1029/2011JD016761}}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the typical size of the breaks is often of the same order as the climatic change signal during the 20th century.&lt;ref name="aueretal2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brunettietal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="caussinus_mestre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dellamarta" /&gt;
Inhomogeneities are thus a significant source of uncertainty for the estimation of secular trends and decadal-scale variability.

If all inhomogeneities would be purely random perturbations of the climate records, collectively their effect on the mean global climate signal would be negligible. However, certain changes are typical for certain periods and occurred in many stations, these are the most important causes as they can collectively lead to artificial biases in climate trends across large regions.

==Causes of inhomogeneities==
[[Image:HeatIsland Kanto en.png|thumb|300px|[[Tokyo]], an example of an urban heat island. Normal temperatures of Tokyo go up more than those of the surrounding area.]]

The best known inhomogeneity is the [[Urban heat island#Global warming|urban heat island effect]]. The temperature in cities can be warmer than in the surrounding country side, especially at night. Thus as cities grow, one may expect that temperatures measured in cities become higher. On the other hand, with the advent of aviation, many meteorological offices and thus their [[Weather station|stations]] have often been relocated from cities to nearby, typically cooler, airports.&lt;ref name="trewin"&gt;Trewin, B.: "Exposure, instrumentation, and observing practice effects on land temperature measurements".'' WIREs Clim. Change'', 1, 490–506, {{doi|10.1002/wcc.46}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stevenson screen exterior.JPG|thumb|Exterior of a Stevenson screen]]
Other non-climatic changes can be caused by changes in measurement methods. Meteorological instruments are typically installed in a screen to protect them from direct sun and wetting.&lt;ref&gt;Meulen, van der, J.P. and T. Brandsma. "Thermometer screen intercomparison in De Bilt (The Netherlands), part I: Understanding the weather-dependent temperature differences". ''Int. J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.1531}}, 28, 371-387, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century it was common to use a metal screen in front of a window on a North facing wall. However, the building may warm the screen leading to higher temperature measurements. When this problem was realized the [[Stevenson screen]] was introduced, typically installed in gardens, away from buildings. This is still the most typical weather screen with its characteristic [[Louver|double-louvre]] door and walls for ventilation. The historical Montsouri and Wilds screens were used around 1900 and are open to the North and to the bottom. This improves ventilation, but it was found that infra-red radiation from the ground can influence the measurement on sunny calm days. Therefore, they are no longer used. Nowadays [[automatic weather station]]s, which reduce labor costs, are becoming more common; they protect the thermometer by a number of white plastic cones.&lt;ref name="begert" /&gt; This necessitated changes from manually recorded liquid and glass thermometers to automated electrical resistance thermometers, which reduced the recorded temperature values in the USA.&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt;

Also other climate elements suffer from inhomogeneities. The precipitation amounts observed in the early instrumental period, roughly before 1900, are biased and are 10% lower than nowadays because the 
[[Rain gauge|precipitation measurements]] were often made on a roof. At the time, instruments were installed on rooftops to ensure that the instrument is never shielded from the rain, but it was found later that due to the turbulent flow of the wind on roofs, some rain droplets and especially snow flakes did not fall into the opening. Consequently, measurements are nowadays performed closer to the ground.

Other typical causes of inhomogeneities are a change in measurement location; many observations, especially of precipitation are performed by volunteers in their garden or at their work place. Changes in the surrounding can often not be avoided, e.g., changes in the vegetation, the [[Impervious surface|sealing of the land surface]], and warm and sheltering buildings in the vicinity. There are also changes in measurement procedures such as the way the daily mean temperature is computed (by means of the minimum and maximum temperatures, or by averaging over 3 or 4 readings per day, or based on 10-minute data). Also changes in the observation times can lead to inhomogeneities. A recent review by Trewin focused on the causes of inhomogeneities.&lt;ref name="trewin" /&gt;

The inhomogeneities are not always errors. This is seen most clear for stations affected by warming due to the urban heat island effect. From the perspective of global warming, such local effects are undesirable, but to study the influence of climate on health such measurements are fine. Other inhomogeneities are due to compromises that have to be made between ventilation and protection against the sun and wetting in the design of a weather shelter. Trying to reduce one type of error (for a certain weather condition) in the design will often lead to the more errors from the other factors. Meteorological measurements are not made in the laboratory. Small errors are inevitable and may not be relevant for meteorological purposes, but if such an error changes, it may well be an inhomogeneity for climatology.

==Homogenization==
To reliably study the real development of the climate, non-climatic changes have to be removed. The date of the change is often documented (called meta data: data about data), but not always. Meta data is often only available in the local language. In the best case, there are parallel measurements with the original and the new set-up for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar E., Auer, I., Brunet, M., Peterson, T. C., and Wieringa, J.: [http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcdmp/wcdmp_series/documents/WCDMP-53.pdf ''Guidelines on climate metadata and homogenization'']. World Meteorological Organization, WMO-TD No. 1186, WCDMP No. 53, Geneva, Switzerland, 55 p., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is a WMO ([[World Meteorological Organisation]]) guideline, but parallel measurements are unfortunately not very often performed, if only because the reason for stopping the original measurement is not known in advance, but probably more often to save money. By making parallel measurement with replicas of historical instruments, screens, etc. some of these inhomogeneities can still be studied today.
[[File:Centre for Climate Change (C3) Terragona, weather screen intercomparison study.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|One way to study the influence of changes in measurement techniques is by making simultaneous measurements with historical and current instruments, procedures or screens. This picture shows three meteorological shelters next to each other in Murcia (Spain). The rightmost shelter is a replica of the Montsouri screen, in use in Spain and many European countries in the late 19th century and early 20th century. In the middle, Stevenson screen equipped with automatic sensors. Leftmost, Stevenson screen equipped with conventional meteorological instruments.]]

Because you are never sure that your meta data (station history) is complete, statistical homogenization should always be applied as well. The most commonly used statistical principle to detect and remove the effects of artificial changes is relative homogenization, which assumes that nearby stations are exposed to almost the same climate signal and that thus the differences between nearby stations can be utilized to detect inhomogeneities.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, V. and Pollak, C.: [https://archive.org/details/methodsinclimato032726mbp ''Methods in Climatology'']. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 459 p., 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By looking at the difference time series, the year-to-year variability of the climate is removed, as well as regional climatic trends. In such a difference time series, a clear and persistent jump of, for example 1&amp;nbsp;°C, can easily be detected and can only be due to changes in the measurement conditions.

If there is a jump (break) in a difference time series, it is not yet clear which of the two stations it belongs to. Furthermore, time series typically have more than just one jump. These two features make statistical homogenization a challenging and beautiful statistical problem. Homogenization algorithms typically differ in how they try to solve these two fundamental problems.&lt;ref name="venemaetal"&gt;Venema, V., O. Mestre, E. Aguilar, I. Auer, J.A. Guijarro, P. Domonkos, G. Vertacnik, T. Szentimrey, P. Stepanek, P. Zahradnicek, J. Viarre, G. Müller-Westermeier, M. Lakatos, C.N. Williams, 
M.J. Menne, R. Lindau, D. Rasol, E. Rustemeier, K. Kolokythas, T. Marinova, L. Andresen, F. Acquaotta, S. Fratianni, S. Cheval, M. Klancar, M. Brunetti, Ch. Gruber, M. Prohom Duran, T. Likso, 
P. Esteban, Th. Brandsma. [http://www.clim-past.net/8/89/2012/ "Benchmarking homogenization algorithms for monthly data"]. ''Climate of the Past'', '''8''', 89-115, {{doi|10.5194/cp-8-89-2012}}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, it was customary to compute a composite reference time series computed from multiple nearby stations, compare this reference to the candidate series and assume that any jumps found are due to the candidate series.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandersson, A.: "A homogeneity test applied to precipitation data". ''J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.3370060607}}, 6, 661-675, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter assumption works because by using multiple stations as reference, the influence of inhomogeneities on the reference are much reduced. However, modern algorithms, no longer assume that the reference is homogeneous and can achieve better results this way. There are two main ways to do so. You can compute multiple composite reference time series from subsets of surrounding stations and test these references for homogeneity as well.
&lt;ref&gt;Szentimrey, T.: "Multiple Analysis of Series for Homogenization (MASH)". ''Proceedings of the second seminar for homogenization of surface climatological data'', Budapest, Hungary; WMO, WCDMP-No. 41, 27-46, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, you can only use pairs of stations and by comparing all pairs with each other determine which station most likely is the one with the break.&lt;ref name="caussinus_mestre" /&gt; If there is a break in 1950 in pair A&amp;amp;B and B&amp;amp;C, but not in A&amp;amp;C, the break is likely in station B; with more pairs such an inference can be made with more certainty.

If there are multiple breaks in a time series, the number of combinations easily becomes very large and it is becomes impossible to try them all. For example, in case of five breaks (''k''=5) in 100 years of annual data (''n''=100), the number of combinations is about 100&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; or 10 billion. This problem is sometimes solved iteratively/hierarchically, by first searching for the largest jump and then repeating the search in both sub-sections until they are too small. This does not always produce good results. A direct way to solve the problem is by an efficient optimization method called [[dynamic programming]].

Sometimes there are no other stations in the same climate region. In this case, sometimes absolute homogenization is applied and the inhomogeneities are detected in the time series of one station. If there is a clear and large break at a certain date, you may well be able to correct it, but smaller jumps and gradually occurring inhomogeneities (urban heat island or a growing vegetation) cannot be distinguished from real natural variability and climate change. Data homogenized this way does not have the quality you may expect and should be used with much care.

==Inhomogeneities in climate data==
By homogenizing climate datasets, it was found that sometimes inhomogeneities can cause biased trends in raw data; that homogenization is indispensable to obtain reliable regional or global trends. For example, for the Greater Alpine Region a bias in the temperature trend between the 1870s and 1980s of half a degree was found, which was due to ''decreasing urbanization'' of the network and systematic changes in the time of observation.&lt;ref&gt;Böhm R., Auer, I., Brunetti, M., Maugeri, M., Nanni, T., and Schöner, W.: "Regional temperature variability in the European Alps 1760–1998 from homogenized instrumental time series". ''International Journal of Climatology'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.689}}, 21, pp. 1779–1801, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
The precipitation records of the early instrumental period are biased by -10% due to the systematic higher installation of the gauges at the time.&lt;ref name="aueretal2005"&gt;Auer I, Böhm, R., Jurkovic, A., Orlik, A., Potzmann, R., Schöner W., et al.: A new instrumental precipitation dataset for the Greater Alpine Region for the period 1800–2002. International Journal of Climatology,  {{doi|10.1002/joc.1135}}, 25, 139–166, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other possible bias sources are new types of weather shelters&lt;ref name="brunettietal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunet, M., Asin, J., Sigró, J., Banón, M., García, F., Aguilar, E., Esteban Palenzuela, J., Peterson, T. C., and Jones, P.: "The minimization of the screen bias from ancient Western Mediterranean air temperature 
records: an exploratory statistical analysis". ''Int. J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.2192}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the change from liquid and glass thermometers to electrical resistance thermometers,&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt; as well as the tendency to replace observers by automatic weather stations,&lt;ref name="begert" /&gt; the urban heat island effect and the transfer of many urban stations to airports.&lt;ref name="trewin" /&gt;

In the project HOME homogenization algorithms were recently tested on artificial climate data with known inhomogeneities and it was found that relative homogenization improves temperature records and that the modern methods that do not work with a homogeneous reference are most accurate.&lt;ref name="venemaetal" /&gt;

An '''infiltration basin''' (also known as a '''recharge basin''' or in some areas, a '''[[sump]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fagin |first=Dan |title=Ancient, Clean, Controversial: Preserving deep reserves of water is LI's chief environmental issue |year= 2007 |newspaper=Newsday |location=Melville, NY |url=http://regentsearth.com/Projects/Ancient,%20Clean,%20Controversial.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''percolation pond'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Water_Portal_/_Rainwater_Harvesting_/_Groundwater_recharge_/_Infiltration_ponds|title=Water Portal / Rainwater Harvesting / Groundwater recharge / Infiltration ponds}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a type of device that is used to manage [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]], prevent [[flood]]ing and downstream [[erosion]], and improve [[water quality]] in an adjacent [[river]], [[stream]], [[lake]] or [[bay]]. It is essentially a shallow artificial pond that is designed to [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] stormwater through permeable soils into the [[groundwater]] [[aquifer]].  Infiltration basins do not release water except by infiltration, evaporation or emergency overflow during flood conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Pekarek |first1=Kathryn A. |last2=Shelton |first2=David P. |last3=Feehan |first3=Kelly A. |last4=Holm  |first4=Bobbi A. |date=2011 |title=Stormwater Management: Terminology |url=http://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/pdf/ec701.pdf |display-authors=1 |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |page=7 |id=EC701}} Extension Circular.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

It is distinguished from a [[detention basin]], sometimes called a '''dry pond''', which is designed to discharge to a downstream water body (although it may incidentally infiltrate some of its volume to groundwater); and from a [[retention basin]], which is designed to include a permanent pool of water.

==Design considerations==
Infiltration basins must be carefully designed to infiltrate the soil on a given site, at a rate that will not cause flooding.  They may be less effective in areas with:
*high groundwater levels, close to the infiltrating surface;
*[[soil compaction|compacted soils]];
*high levels of [[sediment]] in stormwater; or
*high [[clay]] soil content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wef.org Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some sites infiltration basins have worked effectively where the installation also includes an extended [[detention basin]] as a pretreatment stage, to remove sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Clar | first1=Michael L. |last2=Barfield |first2=Billy J. |last3=O'Connor |first3=Thomas P. |date=2004 |title=Stormwater Best Management Design Guide; Volume 3: Basin Best Management Practices |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000D1L8.txt |publisher=EPA |chapter=Pretreatment |pages=4–8 |id=EPA 600/R-04/121B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basins may fail where they cannot be frequently maintained, and their use is discouraged in some areas of the [[United States]]. For example, they are not recommended for use in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which has many areas with high clay soil content, unless soil on the particular site is modified ("engineered soil") during construction, to improve the infiltration characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Atlanta Regional Commission |date=2016 |title=Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, Volume 2 - Technical Handbook |chapter=Infiltration Practices |url=http://www.atlantaregional.com/environment/georgia-stormwater-manual |pages=247–252|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sunrise - A Song of Two Humans (DVD menu).jpg|thumb|A [[DVD-Video]] typically includes an interactive menu allowing the user to change settings or play additional content.]]
'''Interactive media''' normally refers to products and services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user's actions by presenting content such as [[text (literary theory) | text]], [[moving image]], [[animation]], [[video]], [[Digital audio | audio]], and [[video games]].

==Definition==
[[Interactivity|Interactive]] media is a method of communication in which the output from the media comes from the input of the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive media|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Smart Devices Interact With Pervasive Screens: A Survey", 
P.C. Ng, K.E. Eun, J. She, M. Baldauf, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) 
Volume 13, Issue 4, August 2017.
[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3115933]&lt;/ref&gt;
Interactive media works with the user's participation. The media still has the same purpose but the user's input adds interaction and brings interesting features to the system for better enjoyment.

==Development==
The analogue videodisc developed by NV [[Philips]] was the pioneering technology for interactive media. Additionally, there are several elements that encouraged the development of interactive media including the following: 
* The laser disc technology was first invented in 1958. It enabled the user to access high-quality analogue images on the computer screen. This increased the ability of interactive video systems. 
* The concept of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which was developed in the 1970s, popularized by [[Apple Computer, Inc.]] was essentially about visual metaphors, intuitive feel and sharing information on the virtual desktop. Additional power was the only thing needed to move into multimedia.
* The sharp fall in hardware costs and the unprecedented rise in the computer speed and memory transformed the personal computer into an affordable machine capable of combining audio and color video in advanced ways. 
* Another element is the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990 by [[Microsoft]] into the mainstream IBM clone world. It accelerated the acceptance of GUI as the standard mechanism for communicating with small computer systems. 
* The development by NV [[Philips]] of optical digital technologies built around the compact disk (CD) in 1979 is also another leading element in the interactive media development as it raised the issue of developing interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;Lat chem, C., Williamson, J., &amp; Henderson-Lancet, L. (1993). Interactive multimedia practice and promise. London; Philadelphia: Koran page.&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of the prior elements contributed in the development of the main hardware and software systems used in interactive media.

==Terminology==
Though the word ''media'' is plural, the term  is often used as a singular noun.

Interactive media is related to the concepts [[interaction design]], [[new media]], [[interactivity]], [[human computer interaction]], [[cyberculture]], [[digital culture]], [[interactive design]], and includes [[augmented reality]].

An essential feature of interactivity is that it is mutual: user and machine each take an active role (see [[interaction]]). Most [[interactive computing]] systems are for some human purpose and interact with humans in human contexts.&lt;ref name="Dix"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dix  | first1 = Alan  | last2 = Finlay  | first2 = Janet  | last3 = Abowd  | first3 = Gregory D.  | last4 = Beale  | first4 = Russell  | authorlink = Alan Dix  | title = Human-computer interaction. 3rd edn.  | publisher = Pearson Education  | year = 2004  | page = xvi  | isbn = 9780130461094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manovich complains that 'In relation to computer-based media, the concept of interactivity is a tautology.  .... Therefore, to call computer media “interactive” is meaningless – it  simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.'.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Manovich  | first = Lev  | authorlink = Lev Manovich  | title = The Language of New Media  | publisher = MIT Press  | location = Cambridge  | year = 2001  | page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term is useful to denote an identifiable body of practices and technologies.

Interactive media are an instance of a computational method influenced by the sciences of cybernetics, [[autopoiesis]] and system theories, and challenging notions of reason and cognition, perception and memory, emotions and affection.

Any form of interface between the [[end user]]/[[audience]] and the medium may be considered interactive. Interactive media is not limited to [[electronic media]] or digital media. [[Board game]]s, [[pop-up book]]s, [[gamebook]]s, [[flip book]]s and [[constellation wheel]]s are all examples of printer interactive media. Books with a simple [[table of contents]] or [[Index (publishing)|index]] may be considered interactive due to the [[non-linear]] control mechanism in the medium, but are usually considered non-interactive since the majority of the [[user experience]] is non-interactive reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media psychology]] is the newest emerging dimension of media theory applied to interactive media. {{cite web |url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010440/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Effects on learning===
Interactive media is helpful in the four development dimensions in which young children learn: social and emotional, language development, cognitive and general knowledge, and approaches toward learning. Using computers and educational computer software in a learning environment helps children increase communication skills and their attitudes about learning. Children who use educational computer software are often found using more complex speech patterns and higher levels of verbal communication. A study found that basic interactive books that simply read a story aloud and highlighted words and phrases as they were spoken were beneficial for children with lower reading abilities. Children have different styles of learning, and interactive media helps children with visual, verbal, auditory, and tactile learning styles.&lt;ref&gt;Glaucoma, Christina R., M.A. The Effects of Interactive Media on Preschoolers' Learning: A Review of the Research and Recommendations for the Future. P. 13-17. Ed. Eileen Espresso, Patti Miller, and Christine Cordoba.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitive understanding===
Interactive media makes technology more intuitive to use. Interactive products such as smartphones, iPad's/iPod's, interactive whiteboards and websites are all easy to use. The easy usage of these products encourages consumers to experiment with their products rather than reading instruction manuals.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Stuart. "The Disadvantages and Advantages of Interactive Media." EHow. Demand Media, 10 May 2011. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Interactive media promotes dialogic communication. This form of communication allows senders and receivers to build long term trust and cooperation. This plays a critical role in building relationships. Organizations also use interactive media to go further than basic marketing and develop more positive behavioral relationships.&lt;ref&gt;DeYeso, Jennifer. "The Effect of Interactive and Traditional Media on Relationship Building." Slideshare. LinkedIn Corporation, 25 Apr. 2012. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on families==
The introduction of interactive media has greatly affected the lives and inner workings of families, with many family activities having integrated with technology quite seamlessly, allowing both children and parents to adapt to it as they see fit. However, parents have also become increasingly worried about the impact that it will have on their family lives. This is not necessarily because they are opposed to technology, but because they fear that it will lessen the time that they get to spend with their children. Studies have shown that although interactive media is able to connect families together when they are unable to physically, the dependence on this media also continues to persist even when there are opportunities for family time, which often leads the adults to believe that it distracts children more than it benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Katie Headrick; Takeuchi, Lori; Stevens, Reed. "Mapping the daily media round: novel methods for understanding families' mobile technology use." Learning, Media, and Technology. 21 Oct. 2017. Accessed 4 Feb. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Distributed interactive media===
The media which allows several geographically remote users to interact synchronously with the media application/system is known as Distributed Interactive Media. Some common examples of this type of Media include Online Gaming, Distributed Virtual Environment, Whiteboards which are used for interactive conferences and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Mauve, Martin; Vogel, Jiirgen (2001) "Consistency Control for Distributed Interactive Media" Sept. 30-Oct. 5, 2001, Ottawa, Canada 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A couple of basic examples of [https://www.interactivemedia.az/en/ interactive media] (also known as a company in Azerbaijan) are video games and websites. Websites, especially social networking websites provide the interactive use of text and graphics to its users, who interact with each other in various ways such as chatting, playing online games, sharing posts that may include their thoughts and/or pictures and so forth. Video games are also one of the common examples of Interactive Media as the players make use of the joystick/controller to interactively respond to the actions and changes taking place on the game screen generated by the game application, which in turn reacts to the response of the players through the joystick/controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|title=Interactive Media|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=28 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies and implementation==
Interactive media can be implemented using a variety of platforms and applications that use technology. Some examples include mobile platforms such as touch screen smartphones and tablets, as well as other interactive mediums that are created exclusively to solve a unique problem or set of problems. Interactive media is not limited to a professional environment, it can be used for any technology that responds to user actions. This can include the use of [[JavaScript]] and [[AJAX]] in web pages, but can also be used in programming languages or technology that has similar functionality.

One of the most recent innovations to use interactivity that solves a problem that individuals have on a daily basis is [[Delta Airlines]]'s "Photon Shower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/delta-teases-us-shower-beats-jet-lag-473471/|title=Delta teases us with 'shower' that beats jet lag - CNN Travel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device was developed as a collaboration between Delta Airlines and Professor [[Russell Foster]] of [[Cambridge University]]. The device is designed to reduce the effect of [[Jet lag|jet lag]] on customers that often take long flights across time zones. The interactivity is evident because of how it solves this problem. By observing what time zones a person has crossed and matching those to the basic known sleep cycles of the individual, the machine is able to predict when a person's body is expecting light, and when it is expecting darkness. It then stimulates the individual with the appropriate light source variations for the time, as well as an instructional card to inform them of what times their body expects light and what times it expects darkness. Growth of interactive media continues to advance today, with the advent of more and more powerful machines the limit to what can be input and manipulated on a display in real time is become virtually non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf | title=Technology and Interactive Media as Tools in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children from Birth through Age 8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324042025/http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031121333/https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|url=https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|title=Selected Examples of Effective Classroom Practice Involving Technology Tools and Interactive Media|archivedate=31 October 2012|publisher=|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exacttarget.com/blog/5-interactive-media-examples-of-the-new-mad-men/|title=Marketing|website=Salesforce.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moment redistribution''' refers to the behavior of [[statically indeterminate]] structures that are not completely [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], but have some reserve [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] capacity.  When one location first [[yield (engineering)|yields]], further application of load to the structure causes the [[bending moment]] to redistribute differently from what a purely elastic analysis would suggest.

When the load is applied to a beam, the beam has the property to resist it. When the beam is indeterminate, it forms sufficient number of hinges to make itself determinate. Hence in this process, few hinges are formed earlier and the rest are formed afterwards. Further increment in load does not increase the moment at the points where the plastic hinges are formed. The increased load increases the moment in the less stressed sections of the beam; hence due to this, further plastic hinges are formed. This  process of shift of application of moment in the beam is termed as moment redistribution in a beam.&lt;ref&gt;http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105105104/pdf/m15l38.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49069">'''New Primitivism''' ([[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: Novi primitivizam, Нови примитивизам) was a [[subculture|subcultural]] movement established in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] in March 1983. It primarily used music, along with subversive comedy on radio and television as its form of expression. Its protagonists and followers called themselves the '''new primitives'''. 

Even though the movement initially encompassed several bands in the city of Sarajevo, including some such as [[Plavi orkestar]] that quickly distanced themselves from it, the movement predominantly functioned as a banner that summarizes and encompasses the work of two rock bands [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] as well as ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'' radio segment that eventually grew into a television sketch show, the discourse of New Primitivism was seen as primarily irreverent and humorous.

The movement officially disbanded sometime in 1987, although the bands and television show continued up until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

==Characteristics==
Basing itself on the spirit of the Bosnian ordinary populace outside of the cultural mainstream, the movement was credited for introducing the jargon of Sarajevo [[mahala]]s (brimming with slang and Turkish [[loanword]]s) into the official Yugoslav public scene. Many of the New Primitivism songs and sketches involve stories of small people — coalminers, petty criminals, street hoodlums, provincial girls, etc. — being placed in unusual and absurd situations. There are comparisons between ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and the New Primitives' methods, as they share the short sketch form and utilize [[Surreal humour|absurdity]] as means of eliciting laughs from an audience. The embodiment of New Primitivism is a youth who both reads challenging works such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', but also does not mind getting into fistfights. The movement got established as a Sarajevan reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements that were sweeping the alternative music scene in Yugoslavia. Some of the movement's most notable traits were promoting and popularizing Sarajevan street jargon and slang that was not well known outside of Sarajevo, extolling the mentality and culture of the Sarajevan [[Mahala]], depicting local fringe characters such as petty criminals, alcoholics, lesser-known pop cultural figures, blue-collar workers and local streets hoodlums. Because of this, the movement was concidered locally patriotic and an eclectic expression of Sarajevan urban culture.

The movement's protagonists had a specific view of New Primitivism. Perhaps the most prominent of them, [[Nele Karajlić]], explicated it as being "created within clearly defined historical coordinates, both spatially and temporally, at the precise midpoint between the spot where [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in June 1914 and the spot where the Olympic flame was [[1984 Winter Olympics|lit]] in February 1984 while temporally, it took place sometime during the period between [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s death in May 1980 and the beginning of the [[Agrokomerc Affair]] in 1987" and seeing it as "resistance to any form of establishment - cultural, social, and political - not just the rock'n'roll one that dominated Sarajevo at the time with so-called 'dinosaur' bands like [[Bijelo Dugme]] and [[Indexi]], which the new primitives held in contempt to a certain extent".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s1B5rt_1CU Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's dominant method of social and cultural critique was to fully localize the narrative to Sarajevo, and use local urban legends, cultural and social phenomena and living fringe characters as catalysts for painting a wider political picture. In doing so, the movement became both a rigidly local expressional form that gave a platform to the language, culture and myths of the Sarajevan streets, while also breaking out into the wider Yugoslav arena. A major characteristic of the movement was the adoption of pseudonyms by all its leading figures, which tended to be either comical in nature or based on the semantics of nicknames that have always been very prevelent in Sarajevo. The main reason for this was so that none of the members could be ethnically identified. The second reason was to give a platform to the stylization of nicknames that was prominent in Sarajevo - a form of local patriotism and self-mockery. 

The movement's "chief ideologue" [[:sr:Goran Marić (menadžer)|Malkolm Muharem]] referred to New Primitivism simply as "the first Sarajevan bullet to hit its target since Princip assassinated Ferdinand in 1914".

==Origin of the term==
The movement's name — New Primitivism — got introduced as a mock reaction to two early 1980s pop-culture movements: [[New Romanticism]] in the West and [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] in the Yugoslav constituent republic of [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]]. On one hand, the term New Primitivism was a clear anti-reference to New Romantic, as the Sarajevo lads sought to be anything but romantic and sugarsweet while on the other hand, they also wanted to emphasize the stereotypes encountered in many popular Yugoslav jokes about Bosnians and Slovenians — the former portrayed as raw, unsophisticated, dim-witted, and openhearted, and the latter presented as stiff, cold, serious, distant, and calculated. In the artistic and expressional sense, New Primitivism was a reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements.

==History==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a generation of kids from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]], all born in the early to mid-1960s, was coming up. Raised within upper-middle-class families inhabiting post-[[World War II]] apartment buildings typical of communist Yugoslavia, their interests included music, football, and movies. They soon converged on music as their main activity and simultaneous with entering high school started forming bands despite possessing very limited musical skills. Most of their musical influences were found in [[Western world|Western]] popular culture — from early ones such as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Lou Reed]], the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. to those found later on the emerging punk scene.

By early 1980, the kids were able to adapt a cellar at the 19 Fuada Midžića Street low-rise apartment building into a makeshift rehearsal space where they held band practices, [[chamber play]]s, even an odd [[fashion show]]. Initially very informal with irregular rehearsals and frequently changing lineups (often through swapping band members), by 1981 the bands — named [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] — took on a more serious note. Adopting garage/punk rock sensibility, they started devoting more attention to songwriting and began playing small clubs around town. In parallel, from May 1981, some of the kids from both bands got a chance to collaborate on ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'', a comedy segment on ''Primus'' radio show that aired weekly, Saturday mornings, on [[Radio Sarajevo]]'s channel two.

===Forming a movement===
The idea to create a movement as an umbrella entity encompassing their entire activity had been tossed about for months during the second part of 1982 and early 1983 between the individuals in and around Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors — the band's manager [[Malkolm Muharem]], its main lyricist and mascot [[Elvis J. Kurtović]], and its singer [[Rizo Kurtović]].

Additional notable members of the movement included [[Nele Karajlić|dr. Nele Karajlić]], [[Sejo Sexon|mr. Sejo Sexon]], [[Dražen Ričl]], [[Boris Šiber]], [[Zenit Đozić]], and others from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]]. Along the way, individuals outside of the Koševo milieu, most notably [[Branko Đurić|Branko "Đuro" Đurić]], joined in and also became prominent. Despite being a bit older and not from the same neighbourhood, film director [[Emir Kusturica]] (who was already well-established with his award-winning movie ''[[Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]'') was an associate and friend of the crew; although his movies can not be directly associated with the movement, their spirit certainly shares some sentiment with New Primitivism. With the bands playing small demo gigs around the city, they encountered other up and coming rock bands such as [[Plavi orkestar]] and [[Crvena jabuka]] that also cultivated similar thematic narratives focused on stories of local small time characters, but would eventually move away from the aesthetic and turn towards the mainstream.  

The movement's wider unofficial unveiling was said have taken place at an Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors gig in Sarajevo's CEDUS club venue during early March 1983. Also playing the gig was Zabranjeno Pušenje. Influenced by movies like 1979's ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'' that portray the youth scene of London with subcultures like [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]], and [[teddy boy]]s, the guys from Koševo tried to create their own local version of that.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iWhGnwGUT0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=121 Damar Show];Pink BH, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The formal introduction of the new entity changed nothing in the internal group dynamic as they all continued functioning like a neighbourhood gang of friends, but it gave the press something to latch onto and made it easier to market the bands outside of the city. By his own admission, Muharem used the movement "to create an impression to those in Belgrade and Zagreb that there's something more going on in Sarajevo than there actually is".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeGWqOo7uAI#t=484s Rockovnik - 24. episode Anarhija All over Bascarsija];RTS, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to music and comedy on radio, the lads decided to expand their modes of expression now that they functioned as a movement — attempting to come up with a clothing style to associate with New Primitivism. The movement's unofficial look was thus born with a démodé style consisting of waist tight [[bell-bottoms|bell-bottom pants]], plaid [[suit jacket]]s, thin golden necklace worn above the shirt, and pointy shoes (the so-called ''špicoke'') — similar to the 1970s [[leisure suit]] look — which the lads adopted from petty hoodlums and small-time smugglers and pickpockets seen around [[Baščaršija]] selling, though not wearing, clothing items such as [[Levi's]] 501 jeans that were either smuggled in from [[Italy]] or counterfeit locally in Yugoslavia. Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors especially embraced this throwback look, with young crowds soon showing up to their club gigs dressed this way. Meanwhile, Karajlić came up with the movement's unofficial creed: "Tuđe hoćemo, svoje nemamo" ("What's not ours, we want; because ours, we haven't got."), a parody on one of the often used political slogans of the communist period: "Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo." ("What's not ours, we don't want; ours, we won't give up on.").
{{quote box|quote=''During summer 1983, after getting back from an out-of-town gig somewhere, we went to our favourite [[kafana]] Dedan at [[Baščaršija]] where our friend [[Branko Đurić|Đuro]] told us about a journalist from [[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]] looking for us to do an interview. We were convinced Đuro's fucking with us, but he insisted, telling us the guy had already looked for us at [[Televizija Sarajevo|TV Sarajevo]] (where of course no one ever heard of us), at [[Diskoton]] (where they were also clueless as to who we are), before finally resorting to asking about us from kafana to kafana and eventually ending up at Dedan, leaving a phone number with Đuro. This confirmed to us once more what we had already picked up on during our out-of-town gigs — that people outside of the city are taking our braggadocios and bombastic proclamations in the youth print about being the 'kings of Sarajevo' quite literally and quite seriously. In reality we were complete unknowns. Media outlets in Sarajevo didn't give two shits about us, but we noticed that our embellished stories found a receptive audience in youth print media from other Yugoslav cities. They especially lapped up our tales of this 'great new movement in Sarajevo called New Primitivism'.''&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/meteorski-uspon-elvisa-j-kurtovica/228133|title=Meteorski uspon Elvisa J.

One of the very first activities on the movement's behalf was writing an [[open letter]] to Sarajevo's own [[Goran Bregović]], the best known and the most established rock musician in Yugoslavia, who was at the moment going through a well-documented creative and commercial crisis with his band [[Bijelo Dugme]]'s [[Uspavanka za Radmilu M.|latest studio effort]] getting poor reviews and selling underwhelmingly, not to mention constant reports of infighting and vocalist [[Željko Bebek]]'s imminent departure. Dripping with jovial sarcasm and backhanded compliments, the new primitives' letter invited Bregović to join them, offering him a fresh start along with a creative reset.

===Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors get the ball rolling===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Elvis.j.kurtovic.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] before a concert in [[Kulušić]], [[Zagreb]].]] --&gt;
[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] were the first to establish a bit of a buzz on the scene. Promoted by Muharem, who in addition to the band's business side also handled many of its creative aspects, EJK&amp;HM were not only gigging in clubs around Sarajevo, but in 1983 also started playing clubs nationwide, in Belgrade ([[Studentski kulturni centar (Belgrade)|SKC]]), Zagreb ([[Kulušić]] and Lapidarij), Rijeka (Palah), Pula, etc., getting enthusiastic reactions from young club crowds everywhere. Though their sound was hardly original with straight covers of the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. dominating the repertoire, EJK&amp;HM live shows were a unique mixture of rock'n'roll with elements of [[performance art]] and [[stand-up comedy]], full of youthful exuberance with Elvis J. Kurtović, the band's lyrics writer and mascot, constantly interacting with the crowd between songs. They mostly played student clubs with their promotional activities strictly limited to printed press.&lt;ref name="damar"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GnqP6kskh8 Elvis J. Kurtovic @ Damar]&lt;/ref&gt; Muharem would get them publicity by talking up New Primitivism and ensuring journalists from youth-oriented papers — ''[[Džuboks]]'' and ''Reporter'' from Belgrade, ''Polet'' from Zagreb, and ''[[Mladina]]'' from Ljubljana — have the 'right angle' for the story while the band members would contribute by providing colourful interviews and quotable sound bytes often delivered in form of a [[manifesto]].

In late July 1983, the fledgling band received a huge boost after ''[[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]]'', a Yugoslavia-wide high-circulation weekly newsmagazine in the vein of ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Lui]]'', deployed its journalist [[Goran Gajić]] to Sarajevo for a story on the unconventional group.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Published as a two-page spread headlined "Meteorski uspon Elvisa J. Kurtovića" (Elvis J. Kurtović's Meteoric Rise) in a magazine that's circulated in 200,000 copies, the story was by far the biggest media exposure the band had gotten up to that point. Building upon talking points already well established and developed by Muharem and Kurtović through the country's youth print media, the ''Start'' piece was extremely affirmative and flattering for the EJK&amp;HM youngsters — proclaiming them to be "the next important thing in Yugoslav rock".&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Along with a new batch of the band members' trademark off-the-wall soundbytes sprinkled throughout, the article also re-published — on Muharem's insistence despite Kurtović's apparent opposition&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; — their sarcastic open letter to Goran Bregović that thus got a much bigger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jergović|first=Miljenko|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/miljenko-jergovic/miljenko/255037|title=Iz vremena kada očevi nisu znali protiv koga to pjevaju njihova djeca|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=27 February 2017|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding the wave of publicity generated by the ''Start'' piece, Muharem acted quickly in the fall of 1983 by ambitiously booking Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors for a double bill concert with [[D' Boys]] at Sarajevo's Đuro Đaković Hall, an all-seater venue holding almost a thousand people.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; The show sold out quickly and was a smashing success, a remarkable triumph for a band that at the time hadn't been on television yet and still had no studio recordings.&lt;ref name="damar"/&gt;

Muharem soon arranged for the band to get some time in Akvarijus studio in Belgrade during December 1983 in order to record material for their debut album whose production was originally supposed to be handled by Peđa Vranešević of [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], but was eventually done by [[Goran Vejvoda]] as well as Elvis J. Kurtović and Muharem themselves. [[Margita Stefanović]] from [[Katarina II]] made a guest appearance on the synthesizer during the album recording sessions as her band was recording its own [[Katarina II (album)|debut album]] in the same studio at the same time.

EJK&amp;HM and Muharem soon agreed a record contract with [[Založba kaset in plošč RTV Ljubljana|ZKP RTLj]] and their debut album ''[[Mitovi i legende o Kralju Elvisu]]'' came out in February 1984 right in the middle of the Winter Olympics being held in the city. Figuring that promoting the album during the Olympics would get them extra attention due to all the press and other visitors gathered in the city, EJK&amp;HM held a press junket that largely turned shambolic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/30-godina-mitova-i-legendi/175242|title=30 godina 'Mitova i legendi...'|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a series of club gigs at the popular student club Trasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/olimpijada-jurek-burek/74103|title=Olimpijada, Jurek, burek|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made one of their first proper TV appearances, lip-synching "Baščaršy Hanumen" on ''Hit meseca'' (Yugoslav counterpart to ''[[Top of the Pops]]'') while hamming it up for the cameras. The album release was followed by a promotional club tour of bigger Yugoslav cities, but since the record was selling poorly with less than 15,000 copies sold, the tour ended quickly and the deflated band members returned to Sarajevo.

Malkolm Muharem soon quit working with the band.

===''Das ist Walter'' released and ''Top lista nadrealista'' starts on television===

A few months later, in April 1984, Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' came out for [[Jugoton]] in limited issue of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label's extremely low commercial expectations. Recorded in immensely modest circumstances and over an unreasonably long period of 7 months due to reasons beyond their control, the album features punk and garage rock sensibility with songs referencing local toponyms and social strata such as an obscure Sarajevo movie theater, Bosnian coal miners, local thugs from various city neighbourhoods, a local hoodlum being incarcerated in the [[Zenica prison]] etc. Its initial sales were nothing to speak of.

Simultaneously with the album release, ''Top lista nadrealista'' moved to television as a weekly sketch comedy programme. The shows started airing on 2 June 1984 on [[BHT 1|TV Sarajevo]]'s channel two as well as on [[Yugoslav Radio Television|JRT]] exchange for the rest of the country. Despite being placed in a milieu well removed from their natural setting — their comedy sketches were essentially fillers in-between [[Narodna muzika|folk music]] numbers — the show eventually proved a good vehicle for reaching a wider audience. After the opening few episodes that were largely met with indifference, the show started gaining a bit of an audience outside of its Sarajevo youth core with whom it had immediately struck a cord.

This gradually increased viewership of ''Top lista nadrealista'' had a positive effect on ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' sales. Riding the buzz created by the TV show as well as the growing popularity of the "Zenica Blues" track (cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "San Quentin"), Karajlić's and Sexon's blend of punk and local storytelling began finding an increasingly receptive audience months after its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.story.rs/intervju/3070-nele-karajlic-trudim-se-da-budem-dobar-tata-i-muz.html Karajlic interview];''Story'', 4 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; No one was more surprised at this turn of events than the label itself as it was forced to order multiple new batches of the album copies on records and cassettes.

New Primitivism as a term also started catching on as Yugoslav media began using it when referencing the band's style or when talking about the television show. Also, another of the more popular songs on the album, "Anarhija All Over Baščaršija" (Anarchy All Over [[Baščaršija]]), explicitly mentions New Primitives, bringing them up in the context of "violent locals from [[Vratnik, Sarajevo|Vratnik]] who listen to [[narodna muzika|Yugoslav folk music]], attack [[hippie]]s, and are repulsed by the [[Western world|West]]".

On 15 September 1984 as ''Top lista nadrealista'' episodes resumed broadcasting following the summer break, the band played Sarajevo's Dom mladih on a bill that also included [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] in front of a raucous crowd of 4,500. The band was officially out of the clubs and now playing larger halls. In October, Zabranjeno Pušenje went to Belgrade for a show at [[Studentski kulturni centar|SKC]] where they were surprised to discover their newly found popularity. In addition to having to add an extra show in the same venue the next day due to popular demand, they also started getting recognized by kids on the street. The two SKC shows launched the band on an extensive and successful Yugoslavia-wide tour; on 4 November 1984 they sold out [[Hala sportova]], a sports arena in Belgrade with 6,000 in attendance. They would end up playing over 60 concerts on that tour.

In parallel, the album sales ended up hitting the 100,000 mark while the term New Primitives also became well established in the process. However, the increased profile also meant increased scrutiny as Karajlić and the band were about to find out.

===The 'Marshall' affair...===
At a concert in [[Rijeka]]'s [[Dvorana Mladosti]] before a crowd of some two and a half thousand people on Tuesday, 27 November 1984, the band inadvertently set off a firestorm of controversy.
{{quote box|quote=''Following my lawyer's advice, the defense I presented at the 'Marshal has croaked' court hearings was continuously denying I ever said the remark they accused me of saying. My lawyer, being an intelligent man fully aware of the particular point in time, politically, in Yugoslavia, knew the extent to which this mad witch-hunt could've gone to had I admitted to actually uttering the remark. He also knew 'Marshal has croaked', which still sounded like blasphemy in 1984, would soon take on a whole different contextual meaning. And really, within a short few years, figuratively speaking, 'Marshal has croaked' became an official political programme for many of the newly founded political parties that were in the process of gaining strength and eventually winning power all over Yugoslavia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0qZHB6XIRs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=50s |title=Glavni tok |agency=RTV Pink |date=1990s}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Nele Karajlić on the 1985-86 verbal offence court case against him|width=20%|align=right}}
During [[soundcheck]] before the show, the band's amplifier went bust to which Karajlić jokingly exclaimed: "Crk'o maršal" (The "Marshall has croaked!"), followed by a pause before adding: "Mislim na pojačalo" ("The [[Marshall Amplification|amplifier]], that is") (a [[switcheroo]] remark about the 1980 death of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]), getting a chuckle from a small group of people within the earshot. Liking the reaction he got during soundcheck, he decided to start the actual concert by delivering the same joke as an explanation to why the show is starting late.

There was hardly any negative reactions during the concert or immediately after it, and the band continued its tour with a triumphant concert at Ledena dvorana in Zagreb in front of 12,000 fans on 10 December 1984. Though a few write-ups mentioning Karajlić's marshal quip appeared in neutral tone in Zagreb-based papers leading up to the concert, it would be the op-ed piece by journalist Veljko Vičević in Rijeka-based daily newspaper ''[[Novi list]]'' that started the avalanche with far-reaching consequences. Headlined "Opak dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Sinister Smoke), Vičević strongly denounces the band for lack of morals and stepping over the line, and additionally reproaches the group members for things they said in the past such as "Tuđe hoćemo/nećemo, svoje nemamo".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQXINde0GM#t=276s Opak dim Zabranjenog pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the initial stone and the signal for numerous bodies of the communist system to criticize the band (as well as, by proxy, new primitives and ''Top lista nadrealista'') on various grounds. The controversy also served to open another front in the row between two internal factions wrestling for the control of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]'s SSO, the provincial branch of the [[League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Socialist Youth League]] (SSOJ), itself a youth wing of the [[one-party state|country's one and only political party]] — [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist League]] (SKJ). Since the Rijeka concert was organized by the local pro-[[Stipe Šuvar|Šuvar]] SSO in Rijeka, the rival pro-[[Vladimir Bakarić|Bakarić]] faction within the organization used Karajlić's Marshal quip to smear the organizing group.

By January 1985, news of the Rijeka flap made it back to Sarajevo where more journalists, most notably Pavle Pavlović in the ''As'' newspaper, were ready to condemn the band further. In his piece headlined "Otrovni dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Poisonous Smoke), Pavlović labels Karajlić's words "an insensitive association and piece of sarcasm that insults right to the heart". The columnist then trails off to even take ideological issue with the humorous sound bytes in radio jingles promoting the December 1984 release of the ''Top lista nadrealista'' radio material on audio cassette by [[Diskoton]]. He continues by predicting that "the young band's life span will be little longer than that of a [[butterfly]]" before adding that "sadly even such short time is enough to indoctrinate the impressionable kids with new thoughts, including continuous ridicule of everything that we've created so far as well as banal, low-brow tampering with the basic tenet of the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War|People's Liberation War]] — Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo". Pavlović concludes by musing "whether the time has come to extinguish Zabranjeno Pušenje's poisonous smoke for good".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/mcsonline/files/shared/Pavle_P.pdf Otrovni dim Zabranjenog Pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://protest.ba/v2/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Otrovni-dim-Zabranjenog-pu%C5%A1enja.jpg Otrovni dim...]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a communist country where verbal offence was defined as a crime and as such punishable by law, Karajlić and other band members were summoned for dozens of police questionings. Communist Yugoslavia had its [[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]]s and public criticism or ridicule, either veiled or open, of Tito, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|party]], or the People's Liberation War was grounds for severe punishment. Karajlić ended up being taken to court with a criminal charge that was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor one in a legal process that stretched on for years.

===...and its consequences===
However, an even bigger problem was that Zabranjeno Pušenje became blacklisted as a result of the Marshal episode. While not banned outright, their songs were taken off radio playlists, their access to television was restricted, and more than 30 of their already booked concerts in early 1985 ended up getting cancelled due to pressure from above that manifested itself through sudden introduction of administrative obstacles such as denying permits for the venues on the day of the show and so on.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Throughout January 1985, the new primitives experienced multiple bizarre manifestations of this sudden anti-Zabranjeno Pušenje hysteria in Sarajevo.

Each January, during winter school break, TV Sarajevo's daytime schedule consisted of various kids' shows reruns, and one such show happened to feature the band's hit song "Zenica Blues". Not being aware of that, the technician running the [[control room]] that day let the show air by mistake. Since Zabranjeno Pušenje were essentially banned from the station, TV Sarajevo executives found it sufficiently necessary to apologize for the oversight later that day in the station's central daily newscast ''Dnevnik 2'' and also to issue temporary suspensions both to the technician as well as to the executive in charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reDtowLheLA#t=733s Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

By association, the hysteria also spread to ''Top lista nadrealista'' activities. While promoting the freshly released audio cassette in Sarajevo containing the best of compilation of 'Top lista nadrealista' radio segment, there was such a stigma attached to the group's activity in the city that not a single journalists was brave enough to show up at the promotional press event at Muzikalije record store in [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer|Štrosmajerova]] Street, fearing that being seen there would be interpreted as a public show of support for beleaguered Karajlić and the rest of his mates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/bs/magazin-etika/cenzura-na-radiju-80-ih Cenzura na radiju 80-ih], media.ba, 6 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to rectify and calm the situation, members of Zabranjeno Pušenje issued a letter to all socio-political organizations within Sarajevo and the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the print media outlets that had been criticizing the band. The gist of the letter was the claim that they never insulted the image and legacy of Comrade Tito thus denying media reports claiming otherwise and labeling them "monstrous lies".&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"&gt;{{cite news|first=Slavoljub|last=Marković|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/02/zabranjeno-pusenje-afera-crko-marsal.html|title=O društveno-političkoj odgovornosti rock-zvezda: Filter ili muštikla|agency=''Reporter''|date=February 1985|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the letter was generally ignored within Sarajevo and SR Bosnia-Herzegovina as the only press outlets to publish it were Zagreb's youth paper ''Polet'' and later Belgrade's ''[[Politika]]''.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Due to all the problems and hassle suddenly associated with organizing a Zabranjeno Pušenje gig, local promoters began avoiding the band despite clear demand for their concerts. Finding itself increasingly isolated in addition to seeing its commercial momentum slip away, the band decided to invest all its energy into organizing a single high-profile gig that would hopefully as much as anything serve as a statement of encouragement for all potential promoters not to shy away from the band. Still, despite selling out [[Hala Pionir]] in Belgrade on Saturday, 16 February 1985 with more than 7,000 people in attendance, the concert didn't have the desired media effect and the band's downward slide continued with gigs now completely dried up.

Facing insurmountable obstacles, the group gave in temporarily, deciding to lay low for some time while some of the members went back to making ''Top lista nadrealista'' on Radio Sarajevo. However, in March 1985, the authorities put an end to that too, removing the segment for good from the radio schedule.

Just as the career of one New Primitivism band, Zabranjeno Pušenje, was suddenly spiraling downhill, another band from the same milieu, [[Plavi Orkestar]], was getting big.

Other bands that at one time or another identified with New Primitives include: [[Bombaj Štampa]], [[Plavi Orkestar]], [[Dinar (band)|Dinar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]], although they quickly moved on to more commercial and communicative forms of expression.

===''Soldatski bal''  hits it big===
Though the torch of New Primitivsm had primarily been carried by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Zabranjeno Pušenje, other bands were also associated with the movement.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PlavOrkestar cover of Svijet June 1985.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Despite [[Plavi Orkestar]]'s fragmentary association with New Primitivism, the movement arguably got its biggest media promotion via the enormous commercial success of the band's debut album ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' in early 1985.]] --&gt;
After splitting with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors following the lacklustre reception of their debut album, crafty manager Malkolm Muharem switched over to another local Sarajevo outfit — [[Plavi Orkestar]] — a band that had also been gigging on the city's student club scene for some time already and was now looking to take the next step by recording and releasing a studio album. Though also starting out as a garage/punk rock group that often crossed paths with Pušenje and EJK (Orkestar's bassist Ćera I even played on Pušenje's demo recordings before joining Orkestar while the bands also often held club gigs together), over time, especially after achieving stable lineup of Loša, Pava, Ćera I, and Ćera II in early summer 1983, Plavi Orkestar moved to more conventional forms of expression within Yugoslav general cultural context. In practice, that meant pretty much abandoning punk in favour of pop and openly flirting with Yugoslav commercial folk in their sound. Though opening doors for them commercially, this practice somewhat placed them on the fringes of New Primitivism. Compared to the two main new primitive outfits, their stage appearance was far more orderly and their lyrics were less cerebral.

Nevertheless, Muharem saw a new opportunity with the four fresh-faced lads each of whom just turned 20 having recently returned to the city from their respective year-long mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army|army]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/o-marusi-razglednici-iz-nisa-i-prestanku-pusenja/100032|title=O Maruši, razglednici iz Niša i prestanku pušenja|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 1984 when Muharem took the youngsters under his wing, the band barely existed as its main creative duo — frontman [[Saša Lošić]] and guitarist Mladen "Pava" Pavičić — were not on speaking terms and Pava left the band. Not deterred, Muharem took the remaining three members to Zagreb and through personal connections got [[Parni Valjak]]'s Husein "Hus" Hasanefendić to record a few more demos with them, while also managing to secure a pre-contract with Jugoton.

The news of the pre-contract signing brought Pavičić back into the fold and by January 1985 all four were off to Zagreb to record in [[SIM studio]]. The album named ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' came out in February 1985 and instantly created a sensation all over Yugoslavia, placing the young band among the most successful Yugoslav rock acts like Bijelo Dugme and [[Riblja Čorba]]. Muharem essentially stayed true to the promotional techniques he previously implemented with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors — print media and soundbytes — though the sarcastic bravado of EJK&amp;HM was now replaced with Plavi Orkestar's dreamy boyish charm. However, this time it had a tremendous commercial effect as the band embarked on a Yugoslavia-wide tour in late summer 1985 with scenes of thousands of screaming and fainting teenage girls repeated in town after town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/11/pop-fenomeni-plavi-orkestar-djeca-su.html Pop fenomeni: Plavi orkestar - Djeca su čisto poludjela!];September 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Named 'Bolje biti pijan nego star' (Better Drunk than Old) after the band's hit track, the tour included 140 concerts in sports arenas and other large venues throughout the country. Muharem additionally hired journalist-turned-filmmaker Goran Gajić to shoot a tour documentary thus reuniting with him two years after Gajić wrote a glowing summer 1983 piece on Elvis J. Kurtović in ''Start''. Furthermore, Gajić directed a video for Plavi Orkestar's hit track "Kad mi kažeš, paša" featuring actresses [[Tanja Bošković]], [[Sonja Savić]], journalist Mirjana Bobić-Mojsilović, and TV personality [[Suzana Mančić]]. The album ended up selling 550,000 copies. Though with unexpected and sudden success the band's sensibility quickly transformed even more into folkish pop as they almost morphed into a sugary [[boy band]], many media outlets still presented them as a new primitive group, giving the movement unprecedented promotion in Yugoslavia during the first half of 1985.

==Reaction and reception==
Initial wider media reaction to the movement wasn't positive. During New Primitivism's nascent stage, following a summer 1983 double-bill concert by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar at Belgrade's SKC, a [[blurb]] appeared in the high-circulation ''[[Politika]]'' daily reviewing the show, but also discussing the movement in general. In his negative review, rock critic Ljuba Trifunović placed New Primitivsm in the same context with commercial [[narodna muzika|folk]] singer [[Lepa Brena]]'s then current flirtation with rock sound ("[[naïve art|naïve]] rock"), expressing disappointment that "both appeared precisely when we began to think [[Yugoslav rock]] finally became immune to such diseases due to [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|new wave]] effectively washing away the so-called '[[Bijelo Dugme#.22Shepherd rock.22 years: rise to fame and .22Dugmemania.22 .281974.E2.80.9379.29|shepherd's rock]]' and all of its derivatives". Seeing New Primitivsm in continuity with several past offerings from the Sarajevo musical scene such as composer [[Nikola Borota Radovan]]'s opus, [[Jutro]], early [[Bijelo Dugme]], and [[Milić Vukašinović]]'s collaboration with [[Hanka Paldum]], Trifunović felt that adjective "new" was entirely superfluous in the movement's name: "Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar are representatives of this renewed and stripped-down [[primitive culture|primitivsm]], and even if some inconsequential differences do exist when comparing the two bands' interpretative [[wikt:dilettante|dilettantism]] (with EJK&amp;HM coming out on top), what's really depressing is their absolute creative [[pathos]] embodied in the creed 'let's be ourselves' - primitive Balkanoids".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];''Politika'', summer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

As the movement got more profiled in late 1983 and especially throughout 1984 with the emergence of Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album and the start of ''Top lista nadrealista'' on television, it began getting better media notices.

In July 1984, rock critic Darko Glavan wrote a detailed opinion piece on New Primitivism in general as well as EJK&amp;HM and Zabranjeno Pušenje specifically. Expressing mild approval, he summarized his personal acceptance of the movement: "If someone likes them, I'm not going to dissuade them, however, if someone doesn't like them, I'm not going to attempt convincing them otherwise". Furthermore, while noting new primitives are deserving of the media attention they've been receiving, he wondered whether they're getting too much publicity because "they are terrific as an added flavourful spice to a developed and varied rock scene, but can hardly function as the dominant trend".&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glavan|first=Darko|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/06/muzicko-leto-1984-darko-glavan-o-novom.html|title=Muzicko leto 1984, Darko Glavan o novom primitivizmu: Imaju li Elvis i Nele pretjerani publicitet?|agency=''Studio''|date=July 1984|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on EJK&amp;HM, he labelled them "Bosnia's answer to [[Sha Na Na]]", before proclaiming them an acceptable form of entertainment for the general masses and a welcome break from incoherent [[art rock]] pretentiousness. Though further expressing skepticism whether this is still enough for a conventional rock career, citing EJK&amp;HM's unwillingness to freshen up their repetitive jokes and yucks as a concern for their long term career prospects.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt; Glavan was more upbeat about Pušenje, finding them to be "more musical, more talented, and in the context of an [[LP record|LP]], simply stronger than EJK&amp;HM". Comparing Pušenje to [[The Clash]] in addition to extolling their artistic ambition that "saves them from becoming one-dimensional caricatures and additionally invokes locally flavoured stylized [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Do You Remember Dolly Bell?|Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]''", Glavan felt that, despite occasionally failing to properly articulate their inventiveness, the band has a fresh voice and a couple of great tracks off their debut album.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt;

[[Goran Bregović]] once referred to New Primitivism as "''the only authentic Yugoslav answer to [[punk subculture|punk]]''".

Novelist [[Miljenko Jergović]] considered it "a general cultural emancipatory movement that was supposed to rid the Bosnians of their eternal [[inferiority complex]] towards Zagreb and Belgrade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];Ogledalo, early 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

In his scathing 1993 rebuke of the movement, Muhidin Džanko, a professor at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, labeled New Primitivism an "exceptionally [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] movement" that "thanks to the charisma of its protagonists, managed to directly obstruct and even eliminate the national feelings of the Bosnian Muslim youth, majority of whom are proud members of the 'new primitive nation'". He furthermore saw the [[poetics]] of New Primitivism to be rooted in its specific language containing "supposed speech patterns and parlance of the Sarajevo [[Baščaršija|čaršija]] and [[mahala]]s", before rejecting it as a "cheap trick meant to lampoon the traditional verbal expression of Sarajevo Muslims and degrade their [[Oriental]] [[lexicology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Džanko|first=Muhidin|url=http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190|title=Sarajevski novi primitivizam - Pokret za destrukciju muslimanskog nacionalnog bića|agency=|date=1993|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoran Kostić (musician)|Zoran "Cane" Kostić]], the [[Partibrejkers]] frontman, wasn't a fan of the movement; in 1997 he mentioned it in passing during an interview: "Bosnians ([[Plavi Orkestar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]]) took over Belgrade sometime around 1986 and it was because of these raucous new primitive guys that they were able to pull that off. They were their [[Trojan Horse]]s. I never got into that new primitive thing precisely because I saw something else in it. I mean, in the end, their schtick enabled all these dumb bands such as [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2436/3.html Ispovest: Zoran Kostic Cane, partibrejker: BEZ TRIKA I FOLIRANJA];''NIN'', 5 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

New Primitivism as a sub-cultural movement retained prominence well after its demise.

To many it also gained added relevance in the context of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. Books like 2013's ''Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique'' written by Dalibor Mišina, assistant professor of sociology at [[Lakehead University]], devote a significant portion to the study of New Primitivism's overall significance in the last decade of SFR Yugoslavia's existence, arguing that the country could've survived had it adopted values propagated by New Primitivism and similar genres as its new cultural model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Shake-Rattle-Roll-Yugoslav-Critique/dp/1409445658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360563221&amp;sr=1-1 Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique]&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked in 2012 whether New Primitivism was a political or a cultural movement, Nele Karajlić said: {{cquote|''It was a fuckabout that got taken a little too seriously in the end. It was created as our answer to global musical trends that the Western music industry had been manufacturing and launching in regular intervals in order to sell more records. Whenever there's a lull in sales, the industry comes up with something called, say, [[New Romanticism]], for example. And then, a band appears and it's called [[Ultravox]], for example, so we all cut our hair like Ultravox and we buy that thing for a year or year and a half. And then it's time for New Something Else, and the same cycle is repeated over again..... As sensitive and receptive consumers of pop-culture we quickly realized the whole thing is a sham so we decided to "join" the musical industry by coming up with our own movement. New Primitivism would've been genius had it been taken over and fostered by a serious conceptual artist willing to invest at least as much energy in it as those Slovenian dudes did in their [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]]. However, speaking objectively, that was impossible because the guys in NSK took their thing seriously while we never got past the fucking around stage..... I should also add that the biggest difference between New Primitivism and NSK was the fact that "old primitivism" tangibly existed while the "Altslowenische Kunst", strictly speaking, never did''.&lt;ref&gt;"Smisao nadrealizma dr. Neleta Karajlića", Nebojša Grujičić &amp; Jovana Gligorijević, ''Vreme'' issue #1144, Belgrade, 6 December 2012, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://postimage.org/image/69sdmb66p/full/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussing the interest New Primitivism has been getting from social scientific circles, Elvis J. Kurtović wrote in his online column in 2013: {{cquote|''Once in a blue moon, I'll get a call from someone saying they're a researcher working at some university and they want to ask me questions about New Primitivism. My immediate reaction is to fuck with them. However, when they later send me a nicely bound hardcover book, I must say I'm filled with pride. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than seeing 30-year-old crap I wrote purely out of spite, indolence, or malevolence, now translated into English and dissected by serious people for deeper meaning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/hoce-hoce-al/101470|title=Hoće, hoće, al'...|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Orchestra Control Engine''' is a suite of software components (based on [[Linux]]/[[RTAI]]) used for the planning, development and deployment of [[Real-time computing|real-time]] control applications for industrial machines and robots.

Orchestra Control Engine has been developed by [http://www.sintesi-am.eu Sintesi SpA] in partnership with the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|Italian National Research Council]] and in collaboration with international industrial companies in the field of robotics and production systems.

Sintesi SpA is a company that develops mechatronic components and solutions. It has specialized in measurement, control and design technologies for robotics and production systems.

== Main features ==

Orchestra Control Engine is flexible because it can be customized. This is done visually. The solutions created are open (based on an open source framework) and are extendible. Modular components of the software allow a user to develop, debug and test control applications. For example, previously developed algorithms can be divided into functional units and reused indefinitely. All the units work together. The software can be distributed among various remote hardware devices which may be hundreds of meters apart. It also scalable in that it selects hardware which provides the best cost and performance for a particular operation. The system's parameters can be quickly reconfigured both on line and also at the time of a run.

== Suite components ==
[[Linux]]/[[RTAI]] creates Orchestra Control Engine's hard real time behaviour. Its "open source" characteristics allow changes to fit the users' requirements. Non hard real time components of orchestra Control Engine can be used with non-Linux platforms such as [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Macintosh]].

;Orchestra Core
A hard real time multithreaded engine operates in multicore/multiprocessor architectures. Within the scheme, modules can be filled in with more or less complex algorithms  which control the process. The run time engine loads the modules. The user can adapt the modules to the topology. For complex topology, multiple modules can be used or parallel loops can be implemented.

;Orchestra Run Time Manager
The run time manager controls the formalities of execution of the program; decides priorities within the operation; and manages the multi-thread and multiprocessor operations. It is made up of templates that define [[thread (yarn)|thread]] typologies according to the formalities of execution and from a part that manages the POU (Program Organization Unit).

;Orchestra Logic Programming
The logic programming of Orchestra Control Engine assists in the use of the five contemplated languages of the [[IEC 61131]] norm. It also assists in the use of the C/C++ language.

;Orchestra Path Programming
The path programming of Orchestra Control Engine assists in the writing of movement and workmanship mechanics. Piece manufacturing programs (part programs) can be edited according to the international [[ISO-DIN 60025]] standard and the American EIA [[RS274 D]] standard. It is also important for the interpretation of modules and in turn for the input which allows a [[Motion Control Loop]].

;Orchestra Designer
The designer is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] IDE. It assists development of motion control applications for different environments. This involves completing new modules, using code templates, allowing the adding and shaping of new blocks and testing the modules both independently and in a control scheme. It also automatically provides [[XML configuration files]] for each module and for the control loop.

;Orchestra Builder
The builder is a software tool that allows [[Simulink]] models to be automatically generated into Orchestra core compatible modules. It does this by making a definition for every parameter of the Simulink model. It can generate a function which initializes the loading of a newly developed control system and, it can generate the step function which holds the code for the logic of each module.

;Orchestra HMI
HMI is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application (therefore a cross-platform one), that looks for and interacts with different parts of a control system. Orchestra HMI has a graphic interface (including a touch screen) which can run on any common PC. It can be customised to suit the user and provides user authentication. Orchestra HMI allows the user to CN configure and plan the production island and command processes such as the starting  a motion program. The user can screen and edit processes. Orchestra HMI provides the visualization of signals coming from an OrchestraCore or an Orchestra Run Time Manager by means of graphic controls (indicators, 2D plots, LCD displays) and the 3D visualization of  machines and anthropomorphous manipulators.

;Orchestra Library
The library contains sets of modules, information from sensors, interfaces with external entities such as machines, robots, sensors and DAQ boards.

== Solutions ==
Orchestra Control Engine is a suite of programs. Using the various components in combination allows for flexibility. d

;Orchestra Motion Control Framework

The motion control framework allows users to develop motion control applications by integrating the best modules for their purpose. The modules may be ones already available or those the user develops using the orchestra designer and builder facilities.

The modules can be run so that the process has multiple threads. Parallelisms are identified and thus algorithms are refined. The modules can be "debugged" as they are completed if specific verifications are programmed. Alternatively, the modules can be completed in "release" mode if no special verifications are required.

The modules be completed with any number of entries, parameters, states and vectorial output in double precision floating point, as well as states of any other type. These characteristics are codified through XML files.

;Orchestra MultiPLC

Orchestra MultiPLC (multi programmable logic controller) is composed of Orchestra Run Time Manager, Orchestra Logic Programming and OrchestraHMI.  It allows the execution of a motion control application as one or more programs or functional blocks which may be reused. The controller's open schema accepts and translates XML files. The functional blocks can be prioritised within a series or programmed to operate periodically. New tasks may be added to the application.

;Orchestra Full for Numerical Control

Orchestra Full for [[numerical control|Numerical Control]] consists of Orchestra Motion Control Framework, OrchestraMulti PLC, and some other specific components:

'''OrchestraGCode''' interprets the [[G-code]] program received by the HMI: if the G-code instruction is one of motion, then it is sent to the MotionSupervisor, if not, OrchestraGCode will write the instruction to the appropriate software.

'''MotionSupervisor''' acts as an interface between the Motion Control Loop,  the Orchestra GCode, the ControllerSupervisor and the Logical Control Loop. Using information from the ControllerSupervisor, it selects either automatic or jog mode. In jog mode, MotionSupervisor provides axes to moves, direction and feed rates. In automatic and in semiautomatic mode, instructions on movement will come from the G-Code interpreter. 
The MotionSupervisor also collects error messages coming from the MotionControl Loop and sends them to the ControllerSupervisor.

'''ControllerSupervisor''' centralizes all the information related to Orchestra Control Engine. It receives information from the HMI, the Teach Pendant and other software components. Such information is sorted to the other components even if direct channels of communication among the various components for the specific information interchange are foreseen.

ControllerSupervisor sends error messages to OrchestraHMI. Local errors are handled in the software components in which they take place. Errors beyond the local level are handled by the ControllerSupervisor instigating a safety procedure and or showing the error to the user.

;Orchestra for Open Robot Controllers

Orchestra for Open Robot Controllers allows the feasibility of innovative industrial robot algorithms to be tested. It can integrate advanced sensors and functions. Its interface with a personal computer is via OrchestraCore. Its function is generally one of realization of movement rather than the logic of control and the generation of trajectory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">A '''potash works''' ({{lang-de|Aschenhaus}}, ''Aschenhütte'' or ''Potaschhütte'') was a subsidiary operation of a [[glassworks]] in the [[Early Modern Period]]. The latter needed [[potash]], as well as [[quartz]] and [[calcium carbonate|lime]] as [[raw material]]s for the manufacture of [[glass]]. Potash acted as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in the production process, that is by mixing it with [[quartz sand]] it significantly reduced the [[melting point]] of the latter. To make potash the glassworks built potash huts or works in the vicinity, in which [[wood ash]] and [[vegetable ash]] was gathered by [[ash burner]]s and initially washed in water and then vaporized; the whole process being known as [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]].

Contemporary witness, teacher and local historian, Lukas Grünenwald, recorded the recollections from his youth in [[Dernbach (Pfalz)|Dernbach]] in the [[Palatinate region]]:&lt;ref name="helmutseebach-2"&gt;Helmut Seebach: ''Altes Handwerk und Gewerbe in der Pfalz.'' Vol. 3: ''Pfälzerwald. Waldbauern, Waldarbeiter, Waldprodukte- und Holzwarenhandel, Waldindustrie und Holztransport.'' Bachstelz-Verlag, Annweiler-Queichhambach et al., 1994, {{ISBN|3-924115-13-3}}, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''These [[potash hut]]s were small, rectangular stone houses with a parlour and kitchen and a wood store above them. In the corner of the kitchen a large, round iron cauldron used for potash boiling stood on the brick stove and a chimney rose from there up to the [[gabled roof]]. In the three walls opposite the entrance were small windows. &lt;br&gt; The requisite [[wood ash]] was bought in all the villages far and wide and often laboriously carried home in sacks on hand carts and wagons on the then still poor roads. In the hut the ashes were first stored cold in grey [[wicker]] baskets, lined with linen, and stood on top of leaching vats. Water was poured over the ashes and they were thoroughly soaked until they were completely leached. &lt;br&gt; The [[mother liquour]] was then boiled on the stove, until only the valuable, white potash was left. This was sold for a high price to the glassworks.''|Lukas Grünenwald, 1875}}

The consumption of wood in the process of making potash was extremely high, which is why the glassworks were frequently established in areas of extensive forest (hence the term [[forest glass]]). For example, the documents of the forest glassworks of [[Spiegelberg]] in the [[Swabian-Franconian Forest]], which was in operation from 1705 to 1822, had an annual demand for potash of approximately 800 [[centner]]s. Because one [[cubic metre]] of wood (750 kg) only produced 1 kg of potash, this glassworks thus needed around 40,000 cubic metres of wood per year.

Even today the names of some settlements still recall the former potash works. For example, two hamlets in the municipality of [[Mainhardt]], Germany, are called ''Aschenhütte''.

A '''prokaryote''' is usually a [[unicellular organism]], sometimes a multi cellular organism, that lacks a [[biological membrane|membrane]]-bound [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], or any other membrane-bound [[organelle]].&lt;ref name="NCSU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/prokaryote/prokaryote1.html|title=Prokaryotes: Single-celled Organisms|author=NC State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''prokaryote'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πρό (''pro'') "before" and κάρυον (''karyon'') "[[nut (fruit)|nut]] or [[seed|kernel]]".&lt;ref name="bio1"&gt;Campbell, N.

The division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects the existence of two very different levels of cellular organization. Distinctive types of prokaryotes include [[extremophile]]s and [[methanogen]]s; these are common in some extreme environments.&lt;ref name=NCSU /&gt;

== Structure ==
Prokaryotes have a [[prokaryotic cytoskeleton]], albeit more primitive than that of the eukaryotes. Besides homologues of actin and tubulin ([[MreB]] and [[FtsZ]]), the helically arranged building-block of the [[flagellum]], [[flagellin]], is one of the most significant cytoskeletal proteins of bacteria, as it provides structural backgrounds of [[chemotaxis]], the basic cell physiological response of bacteria.  At least some prokaryotes also contain intracellular structures that can be seen as primitive organelles.  Membranous organelles (or intracellular membranes) are known in some groups of prokaryotes, such as vacuoles or membrane systems devoted to special metabolic properties, such as [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemolithotrophy]].  In addition, some species also contain carbohydrate-enclosed microcompartments, which have distinct physiological roles (e.g. [[carboxysome]]s or gas vacuoles).

Most prokaryotes are between 1&amp;nbsp;µm and 10&amp;nbsp;µm, but they can vary in size from 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm (''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'') to 750&amp;nbsp;µm (''[[Thiomargarita namibiensis]]'').

==Morphology==
Prokaryotic cells have various shapes; the four basic shapes of bacteria are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bauman RW, Tizard IR, Machunis-Masouka E |title=Microbiology |publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |date=2006 |isbn=0-8053-7693-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[bacillus (shape)|Bacilli]] – rod-shaped
* [[Spirochaete]] – spiral-shaped

The archaeon [[Haloquadratum]] has flat square-shaped cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoeckenius W | title = Walsby's square bacterium: fine structure of an orthogonal procaryote | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages = 352–60 | date = October 1981 | pmid = 7287626 | pmc = 216199 | url = http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7287626 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Bacteria and archaea reproduce through [[asexual reproduction]], usually by [[binary fission]]. Genetic exchange and recombination still occur, but this is a form of [[horizontal gene transfer]] and is not a replicative process, simply involving the transference of DNA between two cells, as in [[bacterial conjugation]].

==DNA transfer== 
DNA transfer between prokaryotic cells occurs  in bacteria and archaea, although it has been mainly studied in bacteria. In bacteria, gene transfer occurs by three processes.  These are (1) bacterial virus ([[bacteriophage]])-mediated [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], (2) [[plasmid]]-mediated [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], and (3) [[Transformation (genetics)|natural transformation]]. Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to reflect an occasional error during intracellular assembly of [[virus]] particles, rather than an [[adaptation]] of the host bacteria. The transfer of bacterial DNA is under the control of the bacteriophage’s genes rather than bacterial genes. Conjugation in the well-studied ''E. coli'' system is controlled by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for distributing copies of a plasmid from one bacterial host to another. Infrequently during this process, a plasmid may integrate into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfer part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium. Plasmid mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA (conjugation) also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.
[[File:Célula Procariota.ogv|thumb|left|250px|3D animation of a prokaryotic cell that shows all the elements that compose it]]
Natural bacterial [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium. Unlike transduction and conjugation, transformation is clearly a bacterial [[adaptation]] for DNA transfer, because it depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen I, Dubnau D | title = DNA uptake during bacterial transformation | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Sociality==
While prokaryotes are considered strictly unicellular, most can form stable aggregate communities.&lt;ref name=brock&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 13th| publisher = Benjamin Cummings| isbn = 9780321649638| vauthors = Madigan T | title = Brock biology of microorganisms| location = San Francisco| date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such communities are encased in a stabilizing polymer matrix ("slime"), they may be called "[[biofilms]]".&lt;ref name=costerton2007&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-68022-2_2 | chapter = Direct Observations | title = The Biofilm Primer | series = Springer Series on Biofilms | volume = 1 | pages = 3–4 | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-68021-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells in biofilms often show distinct patterns of [[gene expression]] (phenotypic differentiation) in time and space. Also, as with multicellular eukaryotes, these changes in expression often appear to result from [[cell signaling|cell-to-cell signaling]], a phenomenon known as [[quorum sensing]].

Biofilms may be highly heterogeneous and structurally complex and may attach to solid surfaces, or exist at liquid-air interfaces, or potentially even liquid-liquid interfaces. Bacterial biofilms are often made up of [[microcolony|microcolonies]] (approximately dome-shaped masses of bacteria and matrix) separated by "voids" through which the medium (e.g., water) may flow easily. The microcolonies may join together above the substratum to form a continuous layer, closing the network of channels separating microcolonies. This structural complexity—combined with observations that oxygen limitation (a ubiquitous challenge for anything growing in size beyond the scale of diffusion) is at least partially eased by movement of medium throughout the biofilm—has led some to speculate that this may constitute a [[circulatory system]] &lt;ref name=costerton1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costerton JW, Lewandowski Z, Caldwell DE, Korber DR, Lappin-Scott HM | title = Microbial biofilms | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 49 | issue =  | pages = 711–45 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 8561477 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.49.100195.003431 | url = http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.mi.49.100195.003431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many researchers have started calling prokaryotic communities multicellular (for example &lt;ref name="shapiro1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shapiro JA | title = Thinking about bacterial populations as multicellular organisms | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 52 | issue =  | pages = 81–104 | date = 1998 | pmid = 9891794 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.52.1.81 | url = http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/newton/math501/Sp05/Shapiro.pdf | authorlink = James A.

Differential cell expression, collective behavior, signaling, [[programmed cell death]], and (in some cases) discrete [[biological dispersal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chua SL, Liu Y, Yam JK, Chen Y, Vejborg RM, Tan BG, Kjelleberg S, Tolker-Nielsen T, Givskov M, Yang L | title = Dispersed cells represent a distinct stage in the transition from bacterial biofilm to planktonic lifestyles | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 5 | pages = 4462 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25042103 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms5462 | bibcode = 2014NatCo...5E4462C }}&lt;/ref&gt; events all seem to point in this direction. However, these colonies are seldom if ever founded by a single founder (in the way that animals and plants are founded by single cells), which presents a number of theoretical issues. Most explanations of [[Co-operation (evolution)|co-operation]] and the [[evolution of multicellularity]] have focused on high relatedness between members of a group (or colony, or whole organism). If a copy of a gene is present in all members of a group, behaviors that promote cooperation between members may permit those members to have (on average) greater fitness than a similar group of selfish individuals&lt;ref name=hamilton1964&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton WD | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

==Environment==
[[File:Anillo de la vida.png|thumb|250px|Phylogenetic ring showing the diversity of prokaryotes, and symbiogenetic origins of eukaryotes]]

Prokaryotes have diversified greatly throughout their long existence. The metabolism of prokaryotes is far more varied than that of eukaryotes, leading to many highly distinct prokaryotic types. For example, in addition to using [[photosynthesis]] or [[organic compound]]s for energy, as eukaryotes do, prokaryotes may obtain energy from [[inorganic compound]]s such as [[hydrogen sulfide]]. This enables prokaryotes to thrive in harsh environments as cold as the snow surface of [[Antarctica]], studied in [[cryobiology]] or as hot as undersea [[hydrothermal vent]]s and land-based [[hot spring]]s.

Prokaryotes live in nearly all environments on Earth. Some archaea and bacteria are [[extremophile]]s, thriving in harsh conditions, such as high temperatures ([[thermophile]]s) or high salinity ([[halophile]]s).&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Extremophile?topic=49540 ''Extremophile'', Encyclopedia of Earth, National Council of Science &amp; the Environment], eds. Monosson, E.; Cleveland, C.&lt;/ref&gt; Many archaea grow as [[plankton]] in the oceans. [[Symbiotic]] prokaryotes live in or on the bodies of other organisms, including humans.

== Classification ==
[[File:Tree of Living Organisms 2.png|thumb|right|250px|Phylogenetic and [[symbiogenesis|symbiogenetic]] tree of living organisms, showing the origins of [[eukaryote]]s and prokaryotes]]

In 1977, [[Carl Woese]] proposed dividing prokaryotes into the [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] (originally Eubacteria and Archaebacteria) because of the major differences in the structure and genetics between the two groups of organisms. Archaea were originally thought to be extremophiles, living only in inhospitable conditions such as extremes of [[temperature]], [[pH]], and [[radiation]] but have since been found in all types of [[habitat]]s. The resulting arrangement of Eukaryota (also called "Eucarya"), Bacteria, and Archaea is called the [[three-domain system]], replacing the traditional [[two-empire system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woese CR | title = There must be a prokaryote somewhere: microbiology's search for itself | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = March 1994 | pmid = 8177167 | pmc = 372949 | doi =  | url = http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8177167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sapp J | title = The prokaryote-eukaryote dichotomy: meanings and mythology | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 292–305 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15944457 | pmc = 1197417 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.69.2.292-305.2005 | url = http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15944457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widespread current model of the evolution of the [[origin of life|first living organisms]] is that these were some form of prokaryotes, which may have evolved out of [[protocell]]s, while the eukaryotes evolved later in the history of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmer C | title = Origins.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no consensus among biologists concerning the position of the eukaryotes in the overall scheme of cell evolution. Current opinions on the origin and position of eukaryotes span a broad spectrum including the views that eukaryotes arose first in evolution and that prokaryotes descend from them, that eukaryotes arose contemporaneously with eubacteria and archeabacteria and hence represent a primary line of descent of equal age and rank as the prokaryotes, that eukaryotes arose through a symbiotic event entailing an endosymbiotic origin of the nucleus, that eukaryotes arose without endosymbiosis, and that eukaryotes arose through a symbiotic event entailing a simultaneous endosymbiotic origin of the flagellum and the nucleus, in addition to many other models, which have been reviewed and summarized elsewhere.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The oldest known [[fossil]]ized prokaryotes were laid down approximately 3.5 billion years ago, only about 1 billion years after the formation of the Earth's crust. Eukaryotes only appear in the fossil record later, and may have formed from [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]] of multiple prokaryote ancestors. The oldest known fossil eukaryotes are about 1.7 billion years old.

While Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist, some have suggested that there is [[Life on Mars (planet)|evidence on Mars]] of fossil or living prokaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McSween HY | title = Evidence for life in a martian meteorite? | journal = GSA Today | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 1–7 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 11541665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McKay DS, Gibson EK, Thomas-Keprta KL, Vali H, Romanek CS, Clemett SJ, Chillier XD, Maechling CR, Zare RN | title = Search for past life on Mars: possible relic biogenic activity in martian meteorite ALH84001 | journal = Science | volume = 273 | issue = 5277 | pages = 924–30 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8688069 | doi = 10.1126/science.273.5277.924 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8688069 | bibcode = 1996Sci...273..924M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this possibility remains the subject of considerable debate and skepticism.&lt;ref name=disbelief&gt;{{cite web | title=After 10 years, few believe life on Mars | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_060806_mars_rock.html | last=Crenson | first=Matt | name-list-format = vanc | publisher=[[Associated Press]] (on space.com]) | date=2006-08-06 | access-date=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott ER | title = Origin of carbonate-magnetite-sulfide assemblages in Martian meteorite ALH84001 | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 104 | issue = E2 | pages = 3803–13 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 11542931 | doi = 10.1029/1998JE900034 | bibcode = 1999JGR...104.3803S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to eukaryotes==
[[Image:Celltypes.svg|thumb|left|350px|Comparison of eukaryotes vs. prokaryotes]]
The division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is usually considered the most important distinction or difference among organisms. The distinction is that eukaryotic cells have a "true" [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] containing their [[DNA]], whereas prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus. Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes contain large [[RNA]]/[[protein]] structures called [[ribosome]]s, which [[Translation (biology)|produce protein]].

Another difference is that [[ribosomes]] in prokaryotes are smaller than in eukaryotes. However, two organelles found in many eukaryotic cells, [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, contain ribosomes similar in size and makeup to those found in prokaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;The Molecular Biology of the Cell, fourth edition. Bruce Alberts, et al. Garland Science (2002) pg. 808 {{ISBN|0-8153-3218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of many pieces of evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts are themselves [[Endosymbiotic theory|descended]] from free-living bacteria. This theory holds that early eukaryotic cells took in primitive prokaryotic cells by [[phagocytosis]] and adapted themselves to incorporate their structures, leading to the mitochondria we see today.

The [[genome]] in a prokaryote is held within a DNA/protein complex in the [[cytosol]] called the [[nucleoid]], which lacks a [[nuclear envelope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanbichler M, Wang SC, Shapiro L | title = The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–21 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex contains a single, cyclic, double-stranded molecule of stable chromosomal DNA, in contrast to the multiple linear, compact, highly organized [[chromosome]]s found in eukaryotic cells. In addition, many important genes of prokaryotes are stored in separate circular DNA structures called [[plasmid]]s.&lt;ref name="bio1"/&gt; Like Eukaryotes, prokaryotes may partially duplicate genetic material, and can have a [[haploid]] chromosomal composition that is partially replicated, a condition known as [[merodiploid|merodiploidy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural genetic transformation generates a population of merodiploids in Streptococcus pneumoniae.|journal=PLOS Genetics|last1=Johnston |first1=C|last2= Caymaris |first2=S|last3=Zomer |first3=A|last4=Bootsma |first4=HJ|last5=Prudhomme |first5=M|last6=Granadel |first6=C|last7=Hermans |first7=PW|last8=Polard |first8=P|last9=Martin |first9=B|last10=Claverys |first10=JP|date=2013|pmid=24086154|volume=9|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prokaryotes lack [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. Instead, processes such as [[oxidative phosphorylation]] and [[photosynthesis]] take place across the prokaryotic [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harold FM | title = Conservation and transformation of energy by bacterial membranes | journal = Bacteriological Reviews | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 172–230 | date = June 1972 | pmid = 4261111 | pmc = 408323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prokaryotes do possess some internal structures, such as [[prokaryotic cytoskeleton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shih YL, Rothfield L | title = The bacterial cytoskeleton | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 729–54 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16959967 | pmc = 1594594 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00017-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michie KA, Löwe J | title = Dynamic filaments of the bacterial cytoskeleton | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 75 | pages = 467–92 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16756499 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142452 | url = http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SS/Lowe_J/group/PDF/annrev2006.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061117183040/http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SS/Lowe_J/group/PDF/annrev2006.pdf | deadurl = yes | archive-date = November 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the bacterial order [[Planctomycetes]] have a membrane around their nucleoid and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuerst JA | title = Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 59 | pages = 299–328 | date = 2005 | pmid = 15910279 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.59.030804.121258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further investigation revealed that Planctomycetes cells are not compartmentalized or nucleated and like the other bacterial membrane systems are all interconnected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santarella-Mellwig R, Pruggnaller S, Roos N, Mattaj IW, Devos DP | title = Three-dimensional reconstruction of bacteria with a complex endomembrane system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = e1001565 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23700385 | pmc = 3660258 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001565 | url = http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001565 | last-author-amp = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prokaryotic cells are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref name="bio1"/&gt; Therefore, prokaryotes have a larger [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]], giving them a higher [[metabolic rate]], a higher growth rate, and as a consequence, a shorter generation time than eukaryotes.&lt;ref name=bio1/&gt;

{{Anthropology of religion|Basic|image=[[File:Initiation ritual of boys in Malawi.jpg|center|280px]]|caption=Initiation ritual of boys in Malawi. The ritual marks the passage from child to adult male, each subgroup having its customs and expectations.}}

A '''rite of passage''' is a ceremony of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of [[social status|status in society]]. In [[cultural anthropology]] the term is the Anglicisation of ''rite de passage'', a French term innovated by the [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Arnold van Gennep]] in his work ''Les rites de passage'', "The Rites of Passage".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|1909|loc=Lay Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.

== Original conception ==
In English, Van Gennep's first sentence of his first chapter begins:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=I. The Classification of Rites}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. ... In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, "as a kind of house divided into rooms and corridors."&lt;ref name=Journet&gt;{{cite journal | first=Nicolas | last=Journet | title=Les rites de passage | journal=Sciences Humaines | date=1 January 2001 | number=112 | url=http://www.scienceshumaines.com/les-rites-de-passage_fr_1079.html | quote=chaque société générale peut être considérée comme une sorte de maison divisée en chambres et couloirs}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another; in the metaphor, he changes rooms.

Van Gennep further distinguishes between "the secular" and "the sacred sphere." Theorizing that civilizations are arranged on a scale, implying that the lower levels represent "the simplest level of development," he hypothesizes that "[[social groups]] in such a society likewise have magico-religious foundations." Many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase.  Passage between these groups requires a [[ceremony]], or ritual hence rite of passage.

The rest of Van Gennep's book presents a description of rites of passage and an organization into types, although in the end he despairs of ever capturing them all:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=X. Conclusions}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is but a rough sketch of an immense picture ...." He is able to find some universals, mainly two: "the sexual separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred." (Earlier the translators used secular for profane.) He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites. In the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively: pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, funerals and the like. He mentions some others, such as the territorial passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region, such as one where a different religion prevails.

==Stages==
Rites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation, as van Gennep described. "I propose to call the rites of separation from a previous world, ''preliminal rites'', those executed during the transitional stage ''liminal (or threshold) rites'', and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world ''postliminal rites''."&lt;ref&gt;van Gennep 1977: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. "The first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group ... from an earlier fixed point in the social structure."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 80.&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a detachment or "cutting away" from the former self in this phase, which is signified in symbolic actions and rituals. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army. He or she is "cutting away" the former self: the civilian.

The transition (liminal) phase is the period between states, during which one has left one place or state but has not yet entered or joined the next. "The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' ("threshold people") are necessarily ambiguous."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third phase (reaggregation or incorporation) the passage is consummated [by] the ritual subject."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 80&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed the rite and assumed their "new" identity, one re-enters society with one's new status. Re-incorporation is characterized by elaborate rituals and ceremonies, like debutant balls and college graduation, and by outward symbols of new ties: thus "in rites of incorporation there is widespread use of the 'sacred bond', the 'sacred cord', the knot, and of analogous forms such as the belt, the ring, the bracelet and the crown."&lt;ref&gt;van Gennep 1977: 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==

Laboratory experiments have shown that severe initiations produce [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson &amp; Mills 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that such dissonance heightens [[Interpersonal attraction|group attraction]] among initiates after the experience, arising from internal justification of the effort used.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kamau 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce [[conformity]] among new members.&lt;ref&gt;Keating ''et al.'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lodewijkx ''et al.'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural==
[[File:Hamer bull jumping (6) (29167685366).jpg|thumb|The [[Hamar people|Hamar]] are known for their custom of "bull jumping," which initiates a boy into manhood.]]
Initiation rites are seen as fundamental to human growth and development as well as socialization in many African communities. These rites function by ritually marking the transition of someone to full group membership.&lt;ref name="Shahadah"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/africanculture.html | title= African Culture Complex | accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also links individuals to the community and the community to the broader and more potent spiritual world.  Initiation rites are "a natural and necessary part of a community, just as arms and legs are natural and necessary extension of the human body".  These rites are linked to individual and community development. Dr. Manu Ampim identifies five stages; rite to birth, rite to adulthood, rite to marriage, rite to eldership and rite to ancestorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manuampim.com/AfricanInitiationRites.htm The Five Major African Initiation Rites] Prof. Manu Ampim&lt;/ref&gt; In Zulu culture entering womanhood is celebrated by the [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga]].

==Types and examples==
Rites of passage are diverse, and are found throughout many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional rites of passage programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as ''Man Up Global''. Typically the missing piece is the societal recognition and reincorporation phase. [[Adventure education]] programs, such as [[Outward Bound]], have often been described as potential rites of passage. Pamela Cushing researched the rites of passage impact upon adolescent youth at the Canadian Outward Bound School and found the rite of passage impact was lessened by the missing reincorporation phase.&lt;ref&gt;Cushing 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell (2003) presented more evidence of this lacking third stage and described the "Contemporary Adventure Model of a Rites of Passage" as a modern and weaker version of the rites of passage typically used by outdoor adventure programs.

'''Robby Cantarutti''' (born 17 June 1966) is an Italian [[architect]] and [[industrial designer]] from [[Venice]] and the best known practitioner of Italian [[Rationalism]].     
Cantarutti's works reflect an individualized and distinctive style. Most are located in [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]], including his Cabin at the River, where he lives with his family.[[File:Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricic.jpg|thumb|[[c:File:Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricic.jpg|Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricich]]|left]][[File:Chairs-table by Robby Cantarutti.jpg|thumb|chairs and table by Robby Cantarutti|left]]Cantarutti's work was influenced by his passions in life: [[architecture]] and nature. Cantarutti considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his [[architecture]] such crafts as wood, clear glass and raw [[ironwork]]. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as natural aging by [[atmospheric]] conditions.

==Style==
Under the influence of [[Bauhaus]] and [[Le Corbusier]], Cantarutti transcended mainstream [[Rationalism]], culminating in an organic style inspired by natural materials. Cantarutti's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by [[architects]]. His masterpiece, the Cabin at the River was also substance of the film “[https://pro-labs.imdb.com/title/tt6676214?d=inprod Cabin at the River]” directed  by [https://pro-labs.imdb.com/name/nm0890298/?ref_=sch_int Silvia Zeitlinger] and was awarded with the [http://www.arena-international.com/leafawards/winners-2016/2015-winners/ Green LEAF Award 2015] for Best Single House [[Architecture]] 2015. It is the most-photographed and filmed private [[building]] in [[Italy]]. Leading [[Lifestyle (sociology)|life style]] companies  like [[Illy]], [https://www.knoll.com Knoll] use the Cabin as a [[filming location]] for their promotion work.

==Furniture==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">Japanese {{nihongo|'''Shinjūkyō'''|神獣鏡||"deity and beast mirror"}} is an ancient type of round [[bronze mirror]] decorated with images of gods and animals from [[Chinese mythology]]. The obverse side has a polished mirror and the reverse has relief representations of legendary Chinese ''[[Shen (Chinese "spirit; god")|shen]]'' (神 "spirit; god"), ''[[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]]'' (仙 "transcendent; immortal"), and legendary creatures.
[[Image:Bronze Mirror in Ancient Japan.jpg|thumb|''Sankakuen-shinjūkyō'' from the Tsubai Ōtsukayama kofun in [[Yamashiro, Kyoto]]]]

The ''shinjūkyō'' style of bronze mirror originated in China and was frequently produced during the [[Han Dynasty]], [[Three Kingdoms]], and [[Six Dynasties]] (1st-6th centuries CE). With the spread of Chinese bronze casting technology, ''shinjūkyō'' were also produced in Japan and the [[Lelang Commandery]] and [[Daifang Commandery]] in the Korean peninsula. The ca. 297 CE ''Wei zhi'' (魏志 "Records of Wei"), which is part of the ''[[Sanguo zhi]]'' (三國志 "Records of the Three Kingdoms"), has the first historical reference to bronze mirrors in Japan. It chronicles tributary relations between Queen [[Himiko (queen)|Himiko]] of [[Wa (Japan)]] and the Wei court, and records that in 239 CE, Emperor [[Cao Rui]] sent presents to Himiko, including "one hundred bronze mirrors" (tr. Tsunoda 1951:15).

Archeological excavations of Japanese tombs from the [[Kofun period]] (3rd-7th centuries CE) have revealed numerous ''shinjūkyō'', and Japanese archeologists divide them into subtypes including: 
*{{nihongo|''sankakuen-shinjūkyō''|三角縁神獣鏡||"triangular-rimmed deity and beast mirror"}}
*{{nihongo|''gamontai-shinjūkyō''|画文帯神獣鏡||"wide image-band deity and beast mirror"}} 
*{{nihongo|''hirabuchi-shinjūkyō''|平縁神獣鏡||"flat-rimmed deity and beast mirror"}} 
Kurotsuka ''[[kofun]]'' tomb excavated in [[Nara Prefecture]] contained 33 ''sankakuen-shinjūkyō'' bronze mirrors. Some scholars (Edwards 1998, 1999, Nishikawa 1999) believe they are the original mirrors that Emperor Cao Rui presented to Queen Himiko, but others disagree.

'''''Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited''''' is an academic anthology edited by the British archaeologists [[Martin Carver]], Alex Sanmark and Sarah Semple which was first published by Oxbow Books in 2010. Containing nine separate papers produced by various scholars working in the fields of [[Anglo-Saxon archaeology]] and [[Anglo-Saxon history]], the book presents a number of new perspectives on [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] and, to a lesser extent, early [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]]. The collection &amp;ndash; published in honour of the archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]] &amp;ndash; was put together on the basis of a conference on "Paganism and Popular Practice" held at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2005.

Opening with a foreword by [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]], the book's first paper, written by Carver, examines how archaeologists can best understand Anglo-Saxon paganism, drawing from the works of Price and [[David Lewis-Williams]] in order to do so. The second, written by Semple, looks at how pagan Anglo-Saxons viewed their surrounding landscape, whilst the third, written by Julie Lund, delves into Anglo-Saxon votive depositions into water. The fourth paper, authored by [[Howard Williams (archaeologist)|Howard Williams]], looks at funerary practices, which is followed by Jenny Walker's study on the religious aspects of the hall.

The sixth paper, produced by [[Aleks Pluskowski]], delves into the roles of animals in Anglo-Saxon belief, while Chris Fern's following paper focuses on the role of the horse. The eighth paper, written by Sanmark, looks at conceptions of ancestors and the soul, while the ninth, co-authored by Sue Content and Howard Williams, looks at the subsequent understandings of Anglo-Saxon pagandom. In the afterword, written by historian [[Ronald Hutton]], the findings of the book are summarised and potential areas of future research highlighted.

The book received a mixed review in Charlotte Behr's review for the journal ''[[Anglo-Saxon England (journal)|Anglo-Saxon England]]'', and a positive one from Chris Scull in the ''British Archaeology'' magazine. It was praised by others looking at the field of Anglo-Saxon paganism, such as [[Stephen Pollington]].

==Background==

The origins for ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' came from a conference held in 2005 at the [[University of Oxford]]; based around the subject of "Paganism and Popular Practice", it had been organised by Sarah Semple and Alex Sanmark, two archaeologists who would go on to edit the volume. The decision to produce a book based on the papers presented at that conference gained a "renewed impetus" after two further academic conferences were held by the [[Sutton Hoo Society]], on the subjects of paganism and Anglo-Saxon halls respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection was published in honour of the archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]], "in appreciation of her studies of Anglo-Saxon paganism."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010]]. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword, archaeologist Neil Price commented on Meaney and her influential work, noting that most of the published studies that had previously delved into the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism came from her "monumental output", and that it was her "years spent patiently excavating Anglo-Saxon attitudes this collection honours."&lt;ref name="Price xiv"/&gt;

Previous understandings of the topic, well rooted in the ideas of its time, regarded the English as adherents of two consecutive religions: Paganism governed the settlers of the 4th&amp;ndash;6th century, but was superseded in the 7th&amp;ndash;10th century by Christianity. Of the two, Christianity, a religion of the book, documented itself thoroughly, while in failing to do so Paganism laid itself open to centuries of abuse, conjecture or mindless admiration."

}}
In the book's preface, written by Martin Carver, Alex Sanmark and Sarah Semple, the anthology's three objectives are laid out. The first of these is to establish that Anglo-Saxon paganism consisted of "a set of beliefs that varied from place to place" rather than being a dogmatic religion that was the same across England. The second objective is to show that the beliefs of the pagan Anglo-Saxons, "whether pure reason or intellectual mish-mash, [were] expressed in their material culture". Carrying on from the second, the third objective of the anthology was to show that through [[archaeology]], contemporary scholars can "rediscover" Anglo-Saxon belief.&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt;

Summing up their view of Anglo-Saxon paganism, the editors state that it "was not a religion with supraregional rules and institutions but a loose term for a variety of local intellectual world views".&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt; They also "extend the same courtesy to Christianity", noting that "Christianisation too hides a multiplicity of locally negotiated positions".&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt; Ultimately, the writers noted that neither "paganism nor Christianity are treated here as independent agents, out to confront and better each other. They are sources on which people, local people &amp;ndash; the true agents of Anglo-Saxon England &amp;ndash; eclectically drew.&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt;

===Price's "Foreword: Heathen Songs and Devil's Games"===

The book's foreword, entitled "Heathen Songs and Devil's Games", was written by the archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]], then a professor at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. Price had previously been involved in the investigation of the pre-Christian religious beliefs of northern Europe, authoring the influential book, ''[[The Viking Way (book)|The Viking Way: Religion and War in the Later Iron Age of Scandinavia]]'' (2002). In his foreword, Price comments positively on ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' as a whole, noting that it is "remarkable that the present book represents the first attempt for nearly two decades to present an overall survey of early English beliefs that cannot be firmly situated within a Christian frame."&lt;ref name="Price xiv"&gt;[[#Pric10|Price 2010]]. p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Price writes, ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' "simply represents the state of the art, with supporting references to the work on which it builds, and summarises with admirable caution and sensitivity most of what we currently know about the intricate mental world of the pre-Christian English. All future journeys through this difficult terrain must necessarily start here, and they could not have a better guide."&lt;ref name="Price xvi"&gt;[[#Pric10|Price 2010]]. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carver's "Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda"===
In the first paper of the anthology, written by Martin Carver of the [[University of York]], the author opens with a discussion of the work of Neil Price in his book ''The Viking Way'' (2002), which explored the existence of female shamans in pre-Christian Scandinavian society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeds to note that the work of Price and other academics has enabled contemporary scholars to understand historical paganism far better than ever before because they are "better equipped in that triad of disciplines"; archaeology, anthropology and history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Carver then goes on to discuss the work of the archaeologist [[David Lewis-Williams]] in his book ''[[The Mind in the Cave]]'' (2002), which Carver argued has "redefined the world of early spirituality for archaeologists". Carver expresses his opinion that both Lewis-Williams' theories and his multidisciplinary approach (using methods drawn from disciplines like anthropology, psychology, art and ethnology) can be employed in order to shed light on the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeds to point out several problems facing archaeologists in their study of Anglo-Saxon paganism,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; before looking at the ideas put forward by the archaeologists [[Colin Renfrew]] and [[Tim Insoll]] for how to best understand the cognitive aspects of historical religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting up a "programme for investigating Anglo-Saxon spirituality", Carver argues that those Anglo-Saxonist archaeologists who have focused their research on either the pagan or the Christian periods of Anglo-Saxon history need to interact with one another far more, before stating that the same is true for prehistorians and medievalists; in Carver's opinion, an understanding of the beliefs of the Early Anglo-Saxon period can only be achieved by understanding it as being, in part, a "continuum of prehistory".&lt;ref name="Carver 8"/&gt; Moving on to discuss the burial monuments of Anglo-Saxon England and their relations with those found elsewhere in north-western Europe, Carver argues that we can understand more about the beliefs of people at the time by looking at the spread of specific burial styles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 8&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; He then looks at the assembly sites found in Anglo-Saxon England, arguing that there is sufficient archaeological evidence for specific shrine structures, here drawing parallels with the work of archaeologist [[Leszek Słupecki]] in relation to the pagan shrines of Slavic Europe. Going on to reference several excavations in northern Europe, Carver discusses the theory that halls were also used as ritual spaces, and considers whether the same could be true of Anglo-Saxon England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third part of his paper, Carver deals with what he describes as "Christian variants", arguing that in his view, the archaeological evidence implies that "paganism and Christianity do not, in this period, describe homogenous intellectual positions or canons of practice. Pagan ideas and material vocabulary were drawn from a wide reservoir of cosmology and were recomposed as local statements with their own geographical and chronological context. I believe that the same kind of evidence, the evidence of monumentality, provokes us to a similar judgment of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Carver argues, most individuals in 7th-century England were neither clearly Christian or pagan, but adhered to elements of both in a syncretic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semple's "In the Open Air"===
In the second paper of the anthology, entitled "In the Open Air", Sarah Semple provides an overview of what she refers to as the "pre-Christian sacred landscape". Opening the article, Semple discusses the theoretical trends behind recent Anglo-Saxon scholarship and looks at how these can enlighten our understanding of the Anglo-Saxon landscape; in doing so she argues in favour of an interdisciplinary approach which uses historical sources to back up archaeology, before then arguing for the use of continental European parallels to shed light on the world of Early Mediaeval England. Finally she argues that the landscape archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England has to be seen as an extension of the earlier prehistoric and Romano-British landscape rather than in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sem10|Semple 2010]]. pp. 21&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially describing "natural places" in the landscape, Semple discusses how the pagan Anglo-Saxons may have understood their surroundings, looking at the manner in which fields and groves were devoted to deities. Proceeding to look at the way in which pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons viewed hilltops, she discusses their association with sites designated as ''[[hearg]]'' in Old English. Semple then looks at the role of fissures, hollows and pits, highlighting how Anglo-Saxons believed them to be inhabited by monsters and goblins, before examining similar ideas regarding water-places, which were believed to be inhabited by ''[[nicor]]'' and which also saw some votive depositions occurring in the Early Mediaeval. Discussing [[votive offerings]] to such water-places, she then discusses the Anglo-Saxon attitude towards "ancient remains, monuments and ruins", discussing the re-use of prehistoric burial mounds and Roman-period structures. Rounding off her paper, Semple discusses evidence for pagan temples and shrines in the Anglo-Saxon landscape, as well as sacred beams, poles and totems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sem10|Semple 2010]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lund's "At the Water's Edge"===
The anthology's third paper was produced by Julie Lund, then a Senior Lecturer in archaeology at the [[University of Oslo]] in Norway.  Entitled "At the Water's Edge", it looked at the relationship between the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons and watery areas such as rivers and lakes, relying particularly on comparisons from Scandinavia. Opening with a discussion of those [[votive offerings]] that had been deposited into water, it goes on to discuss the Early Mediaeval idea that objects, and in particular swords, had personalities, and how this might be related to their ritual deposition. Proceeding to discuss the role of rivers in the Anglo-Saxon cognitive landscape, it examines the archaeological evidence for votive deposits placed into them at this time, noting the wide array of weapons, but also jewellery and tools, which have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lun10|Lund 2010]]. pp. 49&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lund moves on to discuss the role of bridges, fords and crossings in both Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon contexts, arguing that they were significant sites in the latter's cognitive landscape, and that they were often used as the sites for votive offerings. She then discusses the role of lakes, noting that while there is ample evidence for votive deposition in Scandinavian lakes, there is currently none from Anglo-Saxon England. Finally, she looks at Christian attempts to suppress pagan ritual activity at watery places, and the revival which it experienced following the Scandinavian settlement of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lun10|Lund 2010]]. pp. 54&amp;ndash;66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Williams' "At the Funeral"===
The fourth paper in ''Signals of Belief'' was authored by Howard Williams, then a Professor of Archaeology at the [[University of Chester]]. Devoted to evaluating the evidence for pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon burial rites, it begins by explaining the approaches taken to this subject by earlier antiquarians and archaeologists. Moving on, Williams discusses the idea that mortuary practices in the Early Medieval Germanic-speaking world reflected pagan cosmology, eschatology, cosmogony and mythology, and describes those Scandinavian examples where aspects of the burial rituals have been interpreted as being symbolically related to elements of [[Norse mythology]]. Williams then discusses the role of cremation as a burial rite in Anglo-Saxon England, arguing that the whole cremation process must be viewed as a series of ritualised events rather than as a singular occurrence. Proceeding to discuss inhumation burials, Williams once more argues that there would have been a series of different ritualised scenes as the corpse was prepared, laid in the grave, and then covered in soil, rather than simply one singular layout of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil10|Williams 2010]]. pp. 67&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walker's "In the Hall"===
[[File:West Stow Hall 1.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstructed Anglo-Saxon Hall; Walker devoted her paper to discussing the ritual uses of such buildings.]]
The fifth paper of the anthology, authored by Jenny Walker, a graduate of the [[University of York]]'s Department of Archaeology, explores the role that the great wooden halls served as "ritual theatre[s]" in Anglo-Saxon paganism, using the Northumbrian site of [[Yeavering]] as a case study. Commenting on earlier approaches to understanding the relationship between religious practices and the Early Medieval hall both in England and Scandinavia, she highlights the influence of [[post-processual archaeology]] in altering earlier [[Culture-historical archaeology|culture-historical]] perspectives on this subject. Referencing the theories of sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]], Walker maintains that the role of both [[human agency]] and [[ideology]] in constructing the halls "as a political act" must be taken into account by archaeologists adopting a post-processual approach.

Proceeding to discuss the evidence for three of the halls excavated at Yeavering by archaeologist Brian Hope-Taylor in the early 20th century &amp;ndash; buildings A2, D2b and Bab &amp;ndash; she then goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for two Scandinavian examples, [[Uppåkra]] in Skana, Sweden, and Borg at [[Vestvågøy]], Norway, both of which show evidence for ritual activity. Concluding her paper, Walker emphasises the diversity in uses that halls in Anglo-Saxon England &amp;ndash; and wider Northwestern Europe &amp;ndash; had been put in the Early Medieval. Some, she asserts, would have been used for both socio-political and socio-religious activities, while others would have been explicitly reserved for just one of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal10|Walker 2010]]. pp. 83&amp;ndash;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluskowski's "Animal Magic"===
Aleks Pluskowski &amp;ndash; an Archaeology Lecturer at the [[University of Reading]] &amp;ndash; offers the anthology's six paper, an exploration of the role that non-human animals played in pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon religion. Opening with a discussion of the "zoomorphic" symbolism of [[Anglo-Saxon art|Early Anglo-Saxon art]], he also lists the various different species, both wild and domestic, that the people of Anglo-Saxon England would have been familiar with from their daily lives. Pluskowski then moves on to look at the zoomorphic symbolism found on shields, themselves symbols of adult masculinity in Anglo-Saxon England, before providing a discussion of the idea that animals offered "windows to cosmology", representing symbols of different mythological figures and cosmological places that contemporary scholarship is unaware of, in doing so referencing the work of Stephen Glosecki. Proceeding to examine the symbolic use of animals in Anglo-Saxon warfare, he rounds off this chapter by dealing with both comparisons from continental Europe and Scandinavia and by looking at the influence that Christianity had on re-deploying the symbolism of zoomorphic designs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plu10|Plusckowski 2010]]. pp. 103&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fern's "Horses in Mind"===
In his paper, Chris Fern, an independent archaeologist and Research Associate of the [[University of York]], explored the role of the horse in Anglo-Saxon paganism. Remarking that the horse was "a motif with socio-political, heroic and spiritual significance" for the early Anglo-Saxons, he begins with a brief overview of the importance of horses in the preceding prehistoric and Roman periods of British history. Moving on to explore the ceremonial usages of horses in Anglo-Saxon England, he first examines the archaeological evidence for horses who had been cremated or placed in inhumation burials, including those from sites such as the [[Snape ship burial]] who had been ritually beheaded. Fern follows this with an examination of horses depicted in Anglo-Saxon art, noting the predominance of motifs featuring either two fighting stallions or a warrior riding a horse, the latter being an image which Fern argues had been adopted from Imperial Rome. He also puts forward the theory that the geometric stamps found imprinted on pots represented horse branding marks.

Proceeding to look at horses featured in documents from the period, Fern discusses the mythological figures [[Hengist and Horsa]] who appear in [[Bede]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', as well as the role that the former played in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''. Turning his attention to the human consumption of [[Horse meat|horse flesh]] in this period, he argues that it was only eaten rarely, usually as "a sacred activity".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fer10|Fern 2010]]. pp. 128&amp;ndash;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanmark's "Living On"===
The penultimate paper in the anthology, "Living On: Ancestors and the Soul", is authored by Alexandra Sanmark, then a post doctoral Research Associate at the Millennium Institute Centre for Nordic Studies and Lecturer at the [[University of Western Australia]]'s Department of History. In it, she takes a primarily historical approach to studying Anglo-Saxon conceptions of the soul, utilising comparisons from [[Norse paganism]], which she recognises offers contemporary scholars "an echo or an analogy" of Anglo-Saxon paganism. Beginning by discussing the structure of Norse religious thinking, she describes the division between the "higher religion" devoted to the cult of the gods and the "lower religion" devoted to the veneration of [[animism|animistic]] deities; Sanmark includes the Norse "cult of the ancestors" within this latter category. Expanding on this by exploring the Norse conception of the soul and the manner it which it might migrate in an animal form, she then turns her attention to similar evidence from Anglo-Saxon England, in particular discussing the ideas regarding an Anglo-Saxon shamanic tradition advocated by Stephen Glosecki.

At first dealing with the literary evidence from Anglo-Saxon poems like ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'', she then turns her attention to the evidence from Anglo-Saxon art, again citing the theories of Glosecki. Looking at the link between an ancestor cult and places of burial &amp;ndash; namely [[burial mounds]], which she considers to be places of communication between the living and the dead &amp;ndash; she makes use of Norse historical texts and ethnographic evidence from Eastern Europe to argue that the Anglo-Saxons probably used burial mounds for the same purposes. Moving on to look at the relation between the ancestors and the ritual consumption of alcoholic beverages, she primarily makes use of Norse sources, before discussing the role of the malevolent ancestors in the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon worldview, highlighting the [[Anglo-Saxon Deviant Burial Customs|theories regarding deviant burials]] advocated by archaeologist [[Andrew Reynolds (archaeologist)|Andrew Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#San10|Sanmark 2010]]. pp. 158&amp;ndash;180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content and Williams' "Creating the Pagan English"===
The final paper of the anthology, "Creating the Pagan English: From the Tudors to the Present Day", is the product of a collaboration between Howard Williams and Sue Content, a doctoral student at the [[University of Chester]]'s Department of History and Archaeology. An overview of the history of Anglo-Saxon archaeological investigation into pre-Christian religion, it begins by looking at the manner in which the Anglo-Saxon pagans were glorified as proto-Protestants under the regime of the Tudor monarchs by the likes of [[Polydire Vergil]] and [[William Camden]], before highlighting how Roman Catholic writers such as [[Richard Verstegen]] counteracted this by portraying these pagans as barbaric. Chronologically proceeding to the 18th century, he discusses the ''Nenia Brittanica'', a proto-archaeological work authored by the Reverend James Douglas which discussed the material evidence for early Anglo-Saxon belief. Moving into the Victorian era, Content and Williams note that the period between ''circa'' 1845 and 1860 was important for the antiquarian investigation of Anglo-Saxon paganism, in particular making reference to the work of [[John Young Akerman]] and [[John Mitchell Kemble]]. They argue that following the deaths of these two figures, there was a period of stagnation in Anglo-Saxon archaeology lasting until 1910, when interest in the subject once more emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Con10|Content and Williams 2010]]. pp. 181&amp;ndash;200.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The book's afterword, entitled "''Caveats'' and Futures", was written by the English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] (1953&amp;ndash;), then working at the [[University of Bristol]]. At the time a Commissioner for [[English Heritage]], Hutton had previously written about Anglo-Saxon paganism in a chapter of his book ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles|The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton notes that the collection exposes Anglo-Saxon England as a "world of fluid religious identities" in which people "pick and mix between religious systems", developing "their own idiomatic and personal manifestations" of belief and practice.&lt;ref name="Hutton 2010 201"/&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic and popular reviews===
In a review published in the academic journal ''[[Anglo-Saxon England (journal)|Anglo-Saxon England]]'', Charlotte Behr of [[Roehampton University]] noted that ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' differed from many conference volumes in that the archaeologists who authored the book's papers appear to have undertaken "intense discussions" about how to carry out their research and interpret the evidence. Although she believed that there was much to commend in the anthology, she was wary that words like "superstitious", "magical", "numinous", "sacred", "sanctified" and "supernatural" had been used in a loose way as if they were synonyms despite the fact that they have distinct meanings. She was also critical of "two dozen spelling errors" and "minor factual mistakes" that made it into the text, but ultimately considered the presentation of the book to be "pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beh11|Behr 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert J. Wallis reviewed the book for ''[[Time and Mind|Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture]]'', noting that it would be enjoyed by those who liked the theoretical positions adopted in the 1990s, and that much of the language used is similar to that which has been employed in Bronze and Iron Age Studies. Expressing that its [[post-processualism|post-processualist]] angle has given Anglo-Saxon archaeology "a sharper edge", he opines that it constitutes essential reading for those interested in this area, but that a greater attention to anthropological theory, particularly regarding concepts of animism, shamanism, and totemism, needs to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal12|Wallis 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the [[Council for British Archaeology]]'s bimestrial magazine, ''British Archaeology'', the Early Medievalist Chris Scull praised ''Signals of Belief in Early England'', opining that it should be "required reading" for any researcher investigating Anglo-Saxon beliefs. Arguing that the book was "[s]timulating and provocative", he believed that the most successful essays were those that engaged directly with the "material evidence and near-contemporary texts" rather than those which used later Scandinavian sources. Scull furthermore expressed his view that archaeologists should now discard the terms "pagan" and "paganism" when "considering the belief-worlds of early England."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scu11|Scull 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
In the year following the publication of ''Signals of Belief in Early England'', the established Anglo-Saxonist [[Stephen Pollington]] published an overview of Anglo-Saxon paganism entitled ''The Elder Gods: The Otherworld of Early England''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol11|Pollington 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the late 1980s gene targeting in murine [[embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem (ES-)cells]] enabled the transmission of mutations into the mouse germ line and emerged as a novel option to study the genetic basis of regulatory networks as they exist in the genome. Still, classical [[gene targeting]] proved to be limited in several ways as gene functions became irreversibly destroyed by the marker gene that had to be introduced for selecting recombinant ES cells. These early steps led to animals in which the mutation was present in all cells of the body from the beginning leading to complex phenotypes and/or early lethality. There was a clear need for methods to restrict these mutations to specific points in development and specific cell types. This dream became reality when groups in the USA were able to introduce bacteriophage and yeast-derived site-specific recombination (SSR-) systems into mammalian cells as well as into the mouse &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brian |last1=Sauer |first2=Nancy |last2=Henderson |bibcode=1988PNAS...85.5166S |jstor=32380 |title=Site-Specific DNA Recombination in Mammalian Cells by the Cre Recombinase of Bacteriophage P1 |volume=85 |year=1988 |pages=5166–70 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.85.14.5166 |pmid=2839833 |issue=14 |pmc=281709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stephen |last1=O'Gorman |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Fox |first3=Geoffrey M. |last3=Wahl |bibcode=1991Sci...251.1351O |doi=10.1126/science.1900642 |jstor=2875533 |pmid=1900642 |title=Recombinase-mediated gene activation and site-specific integration in mammalian cells |year=1991 |journal=Science |volume=251 |issue=4999 |pages=1351–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rajewski"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/eji.200737819 |title=From a Dream to Reality |year=2007 |last1=Rajewsky |first1=Klaus |journal=European Journal of Immunology |volume=37 |pages=S134–7 |pmid=17972357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification, properties and dedicated applications==

Common genetic engineering strategies require a permanent modification of the target genome. To this end great sophistication has to be invested in the design of routes applied for the delivery of transgenes. Although for biotechnological purposes random integration is still common, it may result in unpredictable gene expression due to variable transgene copy numbers, lack of control about integration sites and associated mutations.  The molecular requirements in the stem cell field are much more stringent. Here, [[homologous recombination]] (HR) can, in principle, provide specificity to the integration process, but for eukaryotes it is compromised by an extremely low efficiency. Although meganucleases, zinc-finger- and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (ZFNs and TALENs) are actual tools supporting HR, it was the availability of site-specific recombinases (SSRs) which triggered the rational construction of cell lines with predictable properties. Nowadays both technologies, HR and SSR can be combined in highly efficient "tag-and-exchange technologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1534-5807(03)00399-X |title=Talking about a RevolutionThe Impact of Site-Specific Recombinases on Genetic Analyses in Mice |year=2004 |last1=Branda |first1=Catherine S. |last2=Dymecki |first2=Susan M. |journal=Developmental Cell |volume=6 |pages=7–28 |pmid=14723844 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[site-specific recombination]] systems have been identified to perform these DNA rearrangements for a variety of purposes, but nearly all of these belong to either of two families, tyrosine recombinases (YR) and serine recombinases (SR), depending on their [[site-specific recombination|mechanism]]. These two families can mediate up to three types of DNA rearrangements (integration, excision/resolution, and inversion) along different reaction routes based on their origin and architecture.&lt;ref name= "nern"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1111704108 |bibcode=2011PNAS..10814198N |title=Multiple new site-specific recombinases for use in manipulating animal genomes |year=2011 |last1=Nern |first1=A. |last2=Pfeiffer |first2=B.

[[File:Classification_of_site-specific_recombinases_according_to_mechanism.png|thumb|755x755px|'''Tyr- and Ser-SSRs from prokaryotes''' (phages; grey) '''and eukaryotes''' (yeasts; brown); a comprehensive overview (including references) can be found in.&lt;ref name="turan"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bode|first2=J.|year=2011|title=Site-specific recombinases: From tag-and-target- to tag-and-exchange-based genomic modifications|journal=The FASEB Journal|volume=25|issue=12|pages=4088–107|doi=10.1096/fj.11-186940|pmid=21891781|last1=Turan|first1=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The founding member of the YR family is the [[lambda integrase]], encoded by [[Bacteriophage| bacteriophage λ]], enabling the integration phage DNA into the bacterial genome. A common feature of this class is a conserved tyrosine nucleophile attacking the scissile DNA-phosphate to form a 3'-phosphotyrosine linkage. Early members of the SR family are closely related [[wiktionary:resolvase|resolvase]]&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;[[DNA invertase]]s from the bacterial transposons Tn3 and γδ, which rely on a catalytic serine responsible for attacking the scissile phosphate to form a 5'-phosphoserine linkage. These undisputed facts, however, were compromised by a good deal of confusion at the time other members entered the scene, for instance the YR recombinases [[Cre recombinase|Cre]] and [[FLP-FRT recombination|Flp]] (capable of integration, excision/resolution as well as inversion), which were nevertheless welcomed as new members of the "integrase family". The converse examples are PhiC31 and related SRs, which were originally introduced as resolvase/invertases although, in the absence of auxiliary factors, integration is their only function. Nowadays the standard activity of each enzyme determines its classification reserving the general term "recombinase" for family members which, per se, comprise all three routes, INT, RES and INV:

Our table extends the selection of the conventional SSR systems and groups these according to their performance. All of thesse enzymes recombine two target sites, which are either identical (subfamily A1) or distinct (phage-derived enzymes in  A2, B1 and B2).&lt;ref name="turan" /&gt; Whereas for A1 these sites have individual designations ("''FRT''" in case of Flp-recombinase, "''lox''P" for Cre-recombinase), the terms "''att''P" and "''att''B" (attachment sites on the phage and bacterial part, respectively) are valid in the other cases. In case of subfamily A1 we have to deal with short (usually 34 bp-) sites consisting of two (near-)identical 13 bp arms (arrows) flanking an 8 bp spacer (the crossover region, indicated by red line doublets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/BC.2000.103 |title=The Transgeneticists Toolbox: Novel Methods for the Targeted Modification of Eukaryotic Genomes |year=2000 |last1=Bode |first1=Jürgen |last2=Schlake |first2=Thomas |last3=Iber |first3=Michaela |last4=Schübeler |first4=Dirk |last5=Seibler |first5=Jost |last6=Snezhkov |first6=Evgeney |last7=Nikolaev |first7=Lev |journal=Biological Chemistry |volume=381 |issue=9–10 |pmid=11076013 |pages=801–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that for Flp there is an alternative, 48 bp site available with three arms, each accommodating a Flp unit (a so-called "protomer"). ''att''P- and ''att''B-sites follow similar architectural rules, but here the arms show only partial identity (indicated by the broken lines) and differ in both cases. These features account for relevant differences:

* recombination of two identical educt sites leads to product sites with the same composition, although they contain arms from both substrates; these conversions are reversible;
* in case of ''att''P x ''att''B recombination crossovers can only occur between these complementary partners in processes that lead to two different products (''att''P x ''att''B → ''att''R + ''att''L) in an irreversible fashion.

In order  to streamline this chapter the following implementations will be focused on two recombinases (Flp and Cre) and just one integrase (PhiC31) since their spectrum covers the tools which, at present, are mostly used for directed genome modifications. This will be done in the framework of the following overview.

[[File:Fig2A.png|thumb|600px|'''Recombination patterns depending on recombinase (sub-)family and target-site orientation.'''

GOI, "gene of interest"; [+/-], a positive-negative selection marker such as the hygtk-fusion gene. Note that interaction of two identical substrate sites (loxP x loxP or FRT x FRT) leads to products of the same composition, whereas recombination of two non-identical educts leads to two different hybrid sites (attP x attB → attR + attL)]]

== Reaction routes enabled by reversibly acting Tyr-Recombinases and a unidirectional Ser-Integrase ==

The mode integration/resolution and inversion (INT/RES and INV) depend on the orientation of recombinase target sites (RTS), among these pairs of ''att''P and ''att''B. Section C indicates, in a streamlined fashion, the way [[recombinase-mediated cassette exchange]] (RMCE) can be reached by synchronous double-reciprocal crossovers (rather than integration, followed by resolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/21.4.969 |title=Activity of yeast FLP recombinase in maize and rice protoplasts |year=1993 |last1=Lyznik |first1=Leszek A. |last2=Mitchell |first2=Jon C. |last3=Hirayama |first3=Lynne |last4=Hodges |first4=Thomas K. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=969–75 |pmid=8451196 |pmc=309231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gnf114 |title=Stable and efficient cassette exchange under non-selectable conditions by combined use of two site-specific recombinases |year=2002 |last1=Lauth |first1=M. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=30 |issue=21 |pages=115e |pmid=12409474 |last2=Spreafico |first2=F |last3=Dethleffsen |first3=K |last4=Meyer |first4=M |pmc=135837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note is the way reversible Flp-integration/resolution is modulated by 48 bp (in place of 34 bp minimal) ''FRT'' versions: the extra 13 bp arm serves as a Flp "landing path" contributing to the formation of the synaptic complex, both in the context of Flp-INT and Flp-RMCE functions (see the respective equilibrium situations). While it is barely possible to prevent the (entropy-driven) reversion of integration in section A for Cre and hard to achieve for Flp, RMCE can be completed if the donor plasmid is provided at an excess due to the bimolecular character of both the forward-  and the reverse reaction. Posing both ''FRT'' sites in an inverse manner will lead to an equilibrium of both orientations for the insert (green arrow). In contrast to Flp, the Ser integrase PhiC31 (bottom representations) leads to unidirectional integration, at least in the absence of an recombinase-directionality (RDF-)factor.&lt;ref name = "karow"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1517/14712598.2011.601293 |title=The therapeutic potential of phiC31 integrase as a gene therapy system |year=2011 |last1=Karow |first1=Marisa |last2=Calos |first2=Michele P |journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=1287–96 |pmid=21736536}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to Flp-RMCE, which requires two different ("heterospecific") ''FRT''-spacer mutants, the reaction partner (''att''B) of the first reacting ''att''P site is hit arbitrarily, such that there is no control over the direction the donor cassette enters the target (cf. the alternative products). Also different from [[Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange|Flp-RMCE]], several distinct RMCE targets cannot be mounted in parallel, owing to the lack of heterospecific (non-crossinteracting) ''att''P/''att''B combinations.

===Cre recombinase===

[[Cre recombinase|Cre]] ("causes recombination") is able to recombine specific sequences of DNA without the need for cofactors. The enzyme recognizes 34 base pair DNA sequences called ''lox''P ("locus of crossover in phage P1"). Depending on the orientation of target sites with respect to one another, Cre will integrate/excise or invert DNA sequences. Upon the excision (called "resolution" in case of a circular substrate) of a particular DNA region, normal gene expression is considerably compromised or terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10616-006-6550-0 |title=Recommended Method for Chromosome Exploitation: RMCE-based Cassette-exchange Systems in Animal Cell Biotechnology |year=2006 |last1=Oumard |first1=André |last2=Qiao |first2=Junhua |last3=Jostock |first3=Thomas |last4=Li |first4=Jiandong |last5=Bode |first5=Juergen |journal=Cytotechnology |volume=50 |pages=93–108 |pmid=19003073 |issue=1–3 |pmc=3476001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the pronounced resolution activity of Cre, one of its initial applications was the excision of ''lox''P-flanked ("floxed") genes leading to cell-specific gene knockout of such a floxed gene after Cre becomes expressed in the tissue of interest. Current technologies incorporate methods, which allow for both the spatial and temporal control of Cre activity.  A common method facilitating the spatial control of genetic alteration involves the selection of a tissue-specific [[promotor (biology)|promoter]] to drive Cre expression. Placement of Cre under control of such a promoter results in localized, tissue-specific expression. As an example, Leone et al. have placed the transcription unit under the control of the regulatory sequences of the [[myelin]] proteolipid protein (PLP) gene, leading to induced removal of targeted gene sequences in [[oligodendrocytes]] and [[Schwann cells]].&lt;ref name = "leone"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1044-7431(03)00029-0 |title=Tamoxifen-inducible glia-specific Cre mice for somatic mutagenesis in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells |year=2003 |last1=Leone |first1=Dino P |last2=Genoud |first2=S.Téphane |last3=Atanasoski |first3=Suzana |last4=Grausenburger |first4=Reinhard |last5=Berger |first5=Philipp |last6=Metzger |first6=Daniel |last7=MacKlin |first7=Wendy B |last8=Chambon |first8=Pierre |last9=Suter |first9=Ueli |journal=Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=430–40 |pmid=12727441  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific DNA fragment recognized by Cre remains intact in cells, which do not express the PLP gene; this in turn facilitates empirical observation of the localized effects of genome alterations in the myelin sheath that surround nerve fibers in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS).&lt;ref name=koenning&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1069-12.2012 |title=Myelin Gene Regulatory Factor is Required for Maintenance of Myelin and Mature Oligodendrocyte Identity in the Adult CNS |year=2012 |last1=Koenning |first1=M. |last2=Jackson |first2=S. |last3=Hay |first3=C.

In order to control temporal activity of the excision reaction, forms of Cre which take advantage of various [[ligand]] binding domains have been developed. One successful strategy for inducing specific temporal Cre activity involves fusing the enzyme with a mutated ligand-binding domain for the human [[estrogen receptor]] (ERt).  Upon the introduction of [[tamoxifen]] (an estrogen [[receptor antagonist]]), the Cre-ERt construct is able to penetrate the nucleus and induce targeted mutation. ERt binds tamoxifen with greater affinity than [[endogenous]] [[estrogens]], which allows Cre-ERt to remain [[cytoplasmic]] in animals untreated with tamoxifen. The temporal control of SSR activity by tamoxifen permits genetic changes to be induced later in [[embryogenesis]] and/or in adult tissues.&lt;ref name = "leone" /&gt; This allows researchers to bypass embryonic lethality while still investigating the function of targeted genes.

Recent extensions of these general concepts led to generating the "Cre-zoo", i.e. collections of hundreds of mouse strains for which defined genes can be deleted by targeted Cre expression.&lt;ref name="rajewski"/&gt;

The figure illustrates analogous double-reciprocal crossover principles for HR and RMCE, the major difference being the dramatically different requirements for homologous sequences, which are in the kb-range for HR but as short as ~50 bp for SSRs]]

===Flp recombinase===

In its natural host (S. cerevisiae) the [[FLP-FRT recombination|Flp/''FRT'']] system enables replication of a "2μ plasmid" by the inversion of a segment that is flanked by two identical, but oppositely oriented ''FRT'' sites ("flippase" activity). This inversion changes the relative orientation of replication forks within the plasmid enabling "rolling circle"—amplification of the circular 2μ entity before the multimeric intermediates are resolved to release multiple monomeric products. Whereas 34 bp minimal ''FRT'' sites favor excision/resolution to a similar extent as the analogue ''lox''P sites for Cre, the natural, more extended 48 bp FRT variants enable a higher degree of integration, while overcoming certain promiscuous interactions as described for phage enzymes like Cre- &lt;ref name="nern" /&gt; and PhiC31.&lt;ref name="turan"/&gt; An additional advantage is the fact, that simple rules can be applied to generate heterospecific ''FRT'' sites which undergo crossovers with equal partners but nor with wild type ''FRT''s. These facts have enabled, since 1994, the development and continuous refinements of [[recombinase-mediated cassette exchange]] (RMCE-)strategies permitting the clean exchange of a target cassette for an incoming donor cassette.&lt;ref name="turan"/&gt;

Based on the RMCE technology, a particular resource of pre-characterized ES-strains that lends itself to further elaboration has evolved in the framework of the EUCOMM (European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis) program, based on the now established Cre- and/or Flp-based "FlExing" (Flp-mediated excision/inversion) setups,&lt;ref name="turan" /&gt; involving the excision and inversion activities. Initiated in 2005, this project focused first on saturation mutagenesis to enable complete functional annotation of the mouse genome (coordinated by the International Knockout-Mouse Consortium, IKMC) with the ultimate goal to have all protein genes mutated via gene trapping and -targeting in murine ES cells.&lt;ref name = "bradley"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00335-012-9422-2 |title=The mammalian gene function resource: The international knockout mouse consortium |year=2012 |last1=Bradley |first1=Allan |last2=Anastassiadis |first2=Konstantinos |last3=Ayadi |first3=Abdelkader |last4=Battey |first4=James F. |last5=Bell |first5=Cindy |last6=Birling |first6=Marie-Christine |last7=Bottomley |first7=Joanna |last8=Brown |first8=Steve D. |last9=Bürger |first9=Antje |last10=Bult |first10=Carol J. |last11=Bushell |first11=Wendy |last12=Collins |first12=Francis S. |last13=Desaintes |first13=Christian |last14=Doe |first14=Brendan |last15=Economides |first15=Aris |last16=Eppig |first16=Janan T. |last17=Finnell |first17=Richard H. |last18=Fletcher |first18=Colin |last19=Fray |first19=Martin |last20=Frendewey |first20=David |last21=Friedel |first21=Roland H. |last22=Grosveld |first22=Frank G. |last23=Hansen |first23=Jens |last24=Hérault |first24=Yann |last25=Hicks |first25=Geoffrey |last26=Hörlein |first26=Andreas |last27=Houghton |first27=Richard |last28=Hrabé De Angelis |first28=Martin |last29=Huylebroeck |first29=Danny |last30=Iyer |first30=Vivek |journal=Mammalian Genome |volume=23 |issue=9–10 |pages=580–6 |pmid=22968824 |pmc=3463800|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts mark the top of various "tag-and-exchange" strategies, which are dedicated to tagging a distinct genomic site such that the "tag" can serve as an address to introduce novel (or alter existing) genetic information. The tagging step ''per se'' may address certain classes of integration sites by exploiting integration preferences of retroviruses or even site specific integrases like PhiC31, both of which act in an essentially unidirectional fashion.

The traditional, laborious "tag-and-exchange" procedures relied on two successive homologous recombination (HR-)steps, the first one ("HR1") to introduce a tag consisting of a selection marker gene. "HR2" was then used to replace the marker by the "GOI. In the first ("knock-out"-) reaction the gene was tagged with a selectable marker, typically by insertion of a hygtk ([+/-]) cassette providing G418 resistance. In the following "knock-in" step, the tagged genomic sequence was replaced by homologous genomic sequences with certain mutations. Cell clones could then be isolated by their resistance to ganciclovir due to loss of the HSV-tk gene, i.e. ("negative selection"). This conventional two-step tag-and-exchange procedure &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G. Roger |last1=Askew |first2=Thomas |last2=Doetschman |first3=Jerry B. |last3=Lingrel |pmid=8391633 |doi=10.1128/MCB.13.7.4115 |url=http://mcb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8391633 |year=1993 |title=Site-directed point mutations in embryonic stem cells: A gene-targeting tag-and-exchange strategy |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=4115–24 |pmc=359961 |journal=Molecular and Cellular Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  could be streamlined after the advent of RMCE, which could take over and add efficiency to the knock-in step.

===PhiC31 integrase===

Without much doubt, Ser [[integrase]]s are the current tools of choice for integrating transgenes into a restricted number of well-understood genomic acceptor sites that mostly (but not always) mimic the phage ''att''P site in that they attract an ''att''B-containing donor vector. At this time the most prominent member is PhiC31-INT with proven potential in the context of human and mouse genomes.

Contrary to the above Tyr recombinases, PhiC31-INT as such acts in a unidirectional manner, firmly locking in the donor vector at a genomically anchored target. An obvious advantage of this system is that it can rely on unmodified, native ''att''P (acceptor) and ''att''B donor sites. Additional benefits (together with certain complications) may arise from the fact that mouse and human genomes per se contain a limited number of endogenous targets (so called "''att''P-pseudosites"). Available information suggests that considerable DNA sequence requirements let the integrase recognize fewer sites than retroviral or even transposase-based integration systems openig its career as a superior carrier vehicle for the transport and insertion at a number of well established genomic sites, some of which with so called "safe-harbor" properties.&lt;ref name="karow" /&gt;

Exploiting the fact of specific (''att''P x ''att''B) recombination routes, RMCE becomes possible without requirements for synthetic, heterospecific ''att''-sites. This obvious advantage, however comes at the expense of certain shortcomings, such as lack of control about the kind or directionality of the entering (donor-) cassette.&lt;ref name="turan" /&gt; Further restrictions are imposed by the fact that irreversibility does not permit standard [[Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange|multiplexing-RMCE]] setups including "serial RMCE" reactions, i.e.,  repeated cassette exchanges at a given genomic ''locus''.

== Outlook and perspectives ==
Annotation of the human and mouse genomes has led to the identification of &gt;20 000 protein-coding  genes and  &gt;3 000 noncoding RNA genes, which guide the development of the organism from fertilization through embryogenesis to adult life. Although dramatic progress is noted, the relevance of rare gene variants has remained a central topic of research.
 
As one of the most important platforms for dealing with vertebrate gene functions on a large scale, genome-wide genetic resources of mutant murine ES cells have been established. To this end four international programs aimed at saturation mutagenesis of the mouse genome have been founded in Europe and North America (EUCOMM, KOMP, NorCOMM, and TIGM). Coordinated by  the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKSC) these  ES-cell repositories are available for exchange between international research units. Present resources comprise mutations in 11 539 unique genes, 4 414 of these conditional.&lt;ref name = "bradley" /&gt;

The relevant technologies have now reached a level permitting their extension to other mammalian species and to human stem cells, most prominently those with an [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|iPS (induced pluripotent)]] status.

[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|200px|The original cover of [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), in which he discusses the concept of the social contract theory]]

In both [[Moral philosophy|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], the '''social contract''' is a theory or model that originated during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and usually concerns the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the authority of the [[State (polity)|state]] over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;"For the name social contract (or original contract) often covers two different kinds of contract, and, in tracing the evolution of the theory, it is well to distinguish them. Both were current in the 17th century and both can be discovered in Greek political thought. ... [The first] generally involved some theory of the origin of the state. The second form of social contract may be more accurately called the contract of government, or the contract of submission....  Generally, it has nothing to do with the origins of society, but, presupposing a society already formed, it purports to define the terms on which that society is to be governed: the people have made a contract with their ruler which determines their relations with him. They promise him obedience, while he promises his protection and good government. While he keeps his part of the bargain, they must keep theirs, but if he misgoverns the contract is broken and allegiance is at an end." [[J. W. Gough]], ''The Social Contract'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1936), pp.{{nbsp}}2–3. Modern revivals of social contract theories have not been as concerned with the origin of the state.&lt;/ref&gt; Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented, either explicitly or [[tacit consent|tacitly]], to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler (or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining [[rights]].

Therefore, the relation between [[natural and legal rights]] is often a topic of social contract theory. The term takes its name from ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (French: ''Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique''), a 1762 book by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that discussed this concept.

Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy and [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Canon Law]], the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy. The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent of any political order that [[Thomas Hobbes]] termed the "[[state of nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ross Harrison writes that "Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term." See Ross Harrison, ''Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p.{{nbsp}}70. The phrase "state of nature" does occur, in  [[State of nature#History|Thomas Aquinas]]'s [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer19.htm ''Quaestiones disputatae de veritate'', Question 19, Article 1, Answer 13]. However, Aquinas uses it in the context of a discussion of the nature of the soul after death, not in reference to politics.&lt;/ref&gt; In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[conscience]]. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate, in different ways, why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.

Prominent of 17th- and 18th-century theorists of social contract and natural rights include [[Hugo Grotius]] (1625), [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651), [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] (1673), [[John Locke]] (1689), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1762), and [[Immanuel Kant]] (1797). Each solved the problem of political authority differently. Grotius posited that individual humans had [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. [[Thomas Hobbes]] famously said that in a "[[state of nature]]", human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". In the absence of political order and law, everyone would have unlimited natural freedoms, including the "right to all things" and thus the freedom to plunder, rape, and murder; there would be an endless "war of all against all" (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]''). To avoid this, free men contract with each other to establish political [[community]] ([[civil society]]) through a social contract in which they all gain security in return for subjecting themselves to an absolute sovereign, one man or an assembly of men. Though the sovereign's edicts may well be arbitrary and tyrannical, Hobbes saw absolute government as the only alternative to the terrifying anarchy of a state of nature. Hobbes asserted that humans consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government (whether monarchical or parliamentary). Pufendorf disputed Hobbes's equation of a state of nature with war.&lt;ref name="Patrick Riley 2006 pp. 347"&gt;Patrick Riley, ''The Social Contract and Its Critics'', chapter{{nbsp}}12 in ''The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought'', Eds. Mark Goldie and Robert Wokler, Vol{{nbsp}}4 of ''The Cambridge History of Political Thought'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp.{{nbsp}}347–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued that we gain civil rights in return for accepting the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others, giving up some freedoms to do so.

The central assertion that social contract approaches is that law and political order are not natural, but human creations. The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end—the benefit of the individuals involved—and legitimate only to the extent that they fulfill their part of the agreement. Hobbes argued that government is not a party to the original contract and citizens are not obligated to submit to the government when it is too weak to act effectively to suppress factionalism and civil unrest. According to other social contract theorists, when the government fails to secure their natural rights (Locke) or satisfy the best interests of society (called the "[[general will]]" in Rousseau), citizens can withdraw their obligation to obey, or change the leadership through elections or other means including, when necessary, violence.

Locke believed that [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] were inalienable, and therefore the rule of God superseded government authority, while Rousseau believed that democracy (self-rule) was the best way to ensure welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law. The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Social contract theories were eclipsed in the 19th{{nbsp}}century in favor of [[utilitarianism]], [[Hegelianism]], and [[Marxism]], and were revived in the 20th{{nbsp}}century, notably in the form of a [[Original position|thought experiment]] by [[John Rawls]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Riley 2006 pp. 347"/&gt;

==History==
The concept of the social contract was originally posed by [[Glaucon]], as described by [[Plato]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Book{{nbsp}}II.

{{quote|They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;—it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic, Book II. Quoted from http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.3.ii.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The social contract theory also appears in ''[[Crito]]'', another dialogue from Plato.  Over time, the social contract theory became more widespread after [[Epicurus]] (341-270 BC), the first philosopher who saw justice as a social contract, and not as existing in Nature due to divine intervention (see below and also [[Epicureanism#Ethics|Epicurean ethics]]), decided to bring the theory to the forefront of his society.  As time went on, philosophers of traditional political and social thought, such as Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau put forward their opinions on social contract, which then caused the topic to become much more mainstream.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Classical thought===
Social contract formulations are preserved in many of the world's oldest records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/enlightenment--33?print=1|title=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/enlightenment--33?print=1|website=www.timetoast.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist text of the second century BCE, [[Mahāvastu]], recounts the legend of Mahasammata. The story goes as follows:
{{quote|In the early days of the cosmic cycle mankind lived on an immaterial plane, dancing on air in a sort of fairyland, where there was no need of food or clothing, and no private property, family, government or laws. Then gradually the process of cosmic decay began its work, and mankind became earthbound, and felt the need of food and shelter. As men lost their primeval glory, distinctions of class arose, and they entered into agreements with one another, accepting the institution of private property and the family. With this theft, murder, adultery, and other crime began, and so the people met together and decided to appoint one man from among them to maintain order in return for a share of the produce of their fields and herds. He was called "the Great Chosen One" (Mahasammata), and he received the title of raja because he pleased the people.&lt;ref name="AL Basham pp 83"&gt;AL Basham, ''The Wonder That Was India'', pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his rock edicts, the Buddhist king [[Asoka]] was said to have argued for a broad and far-reaching social contract. The Buddhist ''vinaya'' also reflects social contracts expected of the monks; one such instance is when the people of a certain town complained about monks felling saka trees, the Buddha tells his monks that they must stop and give way to social norms.

[[Epicurus]] in the fourth century BCE seemed to have had a strong sense of social contract, with justice and law being rooted in mutual agreement and advantage, as evidenced by these lines, among others, from his ''Principal Doctrines'' (see also [[Epicureanism#Ethics|Epicurean ethics]]):

{{quote|31. Natural justice is a pledge of reciprocal benefit, to prevent one man from harming or being harmed by another.

32. Those animals which are incapable of making binding agreements with one another not to inflict nor suffer harm are without either justice or injustice; and likewise for those peoples who either could not or would not form binding agreements not to inflict nor suffer harm.

33. There never was such a thing as absolute justice, but only agreements made in mutual dealings among men in whatever places at various times providing against the infliction or suffering of harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vincent Cook |url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html |title=Principal Doctrines |publisher=Epicurus |date=2000-08-26 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Renaissance developments===
[[Quentin Skinner]] has argued that several critical modern innovations in contract theory are found in the writings from French Calvinists and Huguenots, whose work in turn was invoked by writers in the [[Low Countries]] who objected to their subjection to Spain and, later still, by Catholics in England.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought: Volume 2: The Age of the Reformation'' (Cambridge, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617), from the [[School of Salamanca]], might be considered an early theorist of the social contract, theorizing [[natural law]] in an attempt to limit the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] of [[absolute monarchy]]. All of these groups were led to articulate notions of popular [[sovereignty]] by means of a social covenant or contract, and all of these arguments began with proto-"state of nature" arguments, to the effect that the basis of politics is that everyone is by nature free of subjection to any government.

These arguments, however, relied on a corporatist theory found in Roman law, according to which "a populus" can exist as a distinct legal entity. Thus, these arguments held that a group of people can join a government because it has the capacity to exercise a single will and make decisions with a single voice in the absence of sovereign authority—a notion rejected by Hobbes and later contract theorists.

==Philosophers==

===Hugo Grotius (1625)===
In the early 17th century, [[Grotius]] (1583–1645) introduced the modern idea that individuals had ''natural rights'' that enabled self-preservation, employing this idea as a basis for moral consensus in the face of religious diversity and the rise of natural science. He seeks to find a parsimonious basis for a moral beginning for society, a kind of [[natural law]] that everyone could accept. He goes so far as to say in his ''[[De jure belli ac pacis|On the Law of War and Peace]]'' that even if we were to concede what we cannot concede without the utmost wickedness, namely that there is no God, these laws would still hold.

The idea was considered incendiary since it suggested that power can ultimately go back to the individuals if the political society that they have set up forfeits the purpose for which it was originally established, which is to preserve themselves. In other words, individual persons are sovereign. Grotius says that the people are ''sui juris'' (under their own jurisdiction). People have rights as human beings, but there is a delineation of those rights because of what is possible for everyone to accept morally; everyone has to accept that each person as an individual is entitled to try to preserve himself. Each person should, therefore, avoid doing harm to, or interfering with, another, and any breach of these rights should be punished.

===Thomas Hobbes' ''Leviathan'' (1651)===
{{main|Leviathan (Hobbes book)}}

The first modern philosopher to articulate a detailed contract theory was [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679). According to Hobbes, the lives of individuals in the [[state of nature]] were "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short", a state in which self-interest and the absence of rights and contracts prevented the "social", or society. Life was "anarchic" (without leadership or the concept of sovereignty). Individuals in the state of nature were apolitical and asocial. This state of nature is followed by the social contract.

The social contract was an "occurrence" during which individuals came together and ceded some of their [[natural rights|individual rights]] so that others would cede theirs.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. person{{nbsp}}A gives up his/her right to kill person{{nbsp}}B if person{{nbsp}}B does the same.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the establishment of the state, a sovereign entity like the individuals now under its rule used to be, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Human life was thus no longer "a war of all against all".

The state system, which grew out of the social contract, was, however, also anarchic (without leadership). Just as the individuals in the state of nature had been sovereigns and thus guided by self-interest and the absence of rights, so states now acted in their self-interest in competition with each other. Just like the state of nature, states were thus bound to be in conflict because there was no sovereign over and above the state (more powerful) capable of imposing some system such as social-contract laws on everyone by force. Indeed, Hobbes' work helped to serve as a basis for the [[Political realism|realism]] theories of international relations, advanced by [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]]. Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' that humans ("we") need the "terrour of some Power" otherwise humans will not heed the [[Golden Rule|law of reciprocity]], "(in summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|title=Leviathan|date=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Locke's ''Second Treatise of Government'' (1689)===
[[John Locke]]'s conception of the social contract differed from Hobbes' in several fundamental ways, retaining only the central notion that persons in a state of nature would willingly come together to form a state. Locke believed that individuals in a state of nature would be bound morally, by the Law of Nature, not to harm each other in their lives or possessions. Without government to defend them against those seeking to injure or enslave them, Locke further believed people would have no security in their rights and would live in fear. Individuals, to Locke, would only agree to form a state that would provide, in part, a "neutral judge", acting to protect the lives, liberty, and property of those who lived within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaba|first=Jeffery|date=Spring 2007|title=John Locke and the Meaning of the Takings Clause|url=https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3727&amp;context=mlr|journal=Missouri Law Review|volume=72|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hobbes argued for near-absolute authority, Locke argued for inviolate freedom under law in his [[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|''Second Treatise of Government'']]. Locke argued that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence (reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or "self-preservation"), along with elements of other rights (e.g. property will be liable to taxation) as necessary to achieve the goal of security through granting the state a monopoly of violence, whereby the government, as an impartial judge, may use the collective force of the populace to administer and enforce the law, rather than each man acting as his own judge, jury, and executioner—the condition in the state of nature.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ''Du contrat social'' (1762)===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), in his influential 1762 treatise ''[[The Social Contract]]'', outlined a different version of social contract theory, as the foundations of [[political rights]] based on unlimited [[popular sovereignty]]. Although Rousseau wrote that the British were perhaps at the time the freest people on earth, he did not approve of their [[representative government]]. Rousseau believed that liberty was possible only where there was direct rule by the people as a whole in lawmaking, where popular sovereignty was indivisible and [[inalienable right|inalienable]]. But he also maintained that the people often did not know their "real will", and that a proper society would not occur until a great leader ("the Legislator") arose to change the values and customs of the people, likely through the strategic use of religion.

Rousseau's political theory differs in important ways from that of Locke and Hobbes. Rousseau's collectivism is most evident in his development of the "luminous conception" (which he credited to [[Denis Diderot]]) of the [[general will]]. Rousseau argues a citizen cannot pursue his true interest by being an [[Ethical egoism|egoist]] but must instead subordinate himself to the law created by the citizenry acting as a collective.

{{quote|[The social contract] can be reduced to the following terms: ''Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will; and in a body we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole.''&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''Oeuvres complètes'', ed.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Gagnebin and M.&amp;nbsp;Raymond (Paris, 1959–95), III, 361; ''The Collected Writings of Rousseau'', ed.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kelley and R.&amp;nbsp;Masters (Hanover, 1990–), IV, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rousseau's striking phrase that man must "be forced to be free"&lt;ref&gt;''Oeuvres complètes'', III, 364; ''The Collected Writings of Rousseau'', IV, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; should be understood this way: since the indivisible and inalienable popular sovereignty decides what is good for the whole, then if an individual lapses back into his ordinary egoism and disobeys the law, he will be forced to listen to what was decided when the people acted as a collectivity (as [[citizen]]s). Thus, the law, inasmuch as it is created by the people acting as a body, is not a limitation of individual freedom, but rather its expression.

Thus, enforcement of laws, including [[criminal law]], is not a restriction on individual liberty: the individual, as a citizen, explicitly agreed to be constrained if, as a private individual, he did not respect his own will as formulated in the general will. Because laws represent the restraints of civil freedom, they represent the leap made from humans in the state of nature into civil society. In this sense, the law is a civilizing force, and therefore Rousseau believed that the laws that govern a people helped to mold their character.

===Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's individualist social contract (1851)===
While Rousseau's social contract is based on [[popular sovereignty]] and not on individual sovereignty, there are other theories espoused by [[individualist]]s, [[libertarians]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] that do not involve agreeing to anything more than [[Negative and positive rights|negative rights]] and creates only a limited state, if any.

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) advocated a conception of social contract that did not involve an individual surrendering sovereignty to others. According to him, the social contract was not between individuals and the state, but rather among individuals who refrain from coercing or governing each other, each one maintaining complete sovereignty upon him- or herself:

{{quote|What really is the Social Contract? An agreement of the citizen with the government? No, that would mean but the continuation of [Rousseau's] idea. The social contract is an agreement of man with man; an agreement from which must result what we call society. In this, the notion of commutative justice, first brought forward by the primitive fact of exchange, ... is substituted for that of distributive justice ... Translating these words, contract, commutative justice, which are the language of the law, into the language of business, and you have commerce, that is to say, in its highest significance, the act by which man and man declare themselves essentially producers, and abdicate all pretension to govern each other.|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|''[[The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century|General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1851)}}

===John Rawls' ''Theory of Justice'' (1971)===
Building on the work of Immanuel Kant with its presumption of limits on the state,&lt;ref&gt;• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland, 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/  "Liberalism"], 1.1, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', Part{{nbsp}}1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rawls]] (1921–2002), in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), proposed a contractarian approach whereby rational people in a hypothetical "[[original position]]" would set aside their individual preferences and capacities under a "[[veil of ignorance]]" and agree to certain general principles of justice and legal organization. This idea is also used as a [[game theory|game-theoretical]] formalization of the notion of fairness.

===David Gauthier's ''Morals By Agreement'' (1986)===
{{Main|Contractarian ethics}}
[[David Gauthier]] "neo-Hobbesian" theory argues that cooperation between two independent and self-interested parties is indeed possible, especially when it comes to understanding morality and politics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/#SH3b |title=Social Contract Theory [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2004-10-15 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauthier notably points out the advantages of cooperation between two parties when it comes to the challenge of the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. He proposes that, if two parties were to stick to the original agreed-upon arrangement and morals outlined by the contract, they would both experience an optimal result.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/#3 |title=Contractarianism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model for the social contract, factors including trust, rationality, and self-interest keep each party honest and dissuade them from breaking the rules.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

===Philip Pettit's ''Republicanism'' (1997)===
[[Philip Pettit]] (b. 1945) has argued, in ''Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government'' (1997), that the theory of social contract, classically based on the [[consent of the governed]], should be modified. Instead of arguing for explicit consent, which can always be [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured]], Pettit argues that the absence of an effective rebellion against it is a contract's only legitimacy.

==Critical theories==

===Consent of the governed===
An early critic of social contract theory was [[Rousseau]]'s friend, the philosopher [[David Hume]], who in 1742 published an essay "Of Civil Liberty". The second part of this essay, entitled "Of the Original Contract",&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;{{cite book|url= |author=Hume, David|title= Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay XII, Of The Original Contract|publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stresses that the concept of a "social contract" is a convenient fiction: {{quote|As no party, in the present age can well support itself without a philosophical or speculative system of principles annexed to its political or practical one; we accordingly find that each of the factions into which this nation is divided has reared up a fabric of the former kind, in order to protect and cover that scheme of actions which it pursues. ... The one party [defenders of the absolute and divine right of kings, or Tories], by tracing up government to the DEITY, endeavor to render it so sacred and inviolate that it must be little less than sacrilege, however tyrannical it may become, to touch or invade it in the smallest article. The other party [the Whigs, or believers in constitutional monarchy], by founding government altogether on the consent of the PEOPLE suppose that there is a kind of original contract by which the subjects have tacitly reserved the power of resisting their sovereign, whenever they find themselves aggrieved by that authority with which they have for certain purposes voluntarily entrusted him. |David Hume, "On Civil Liberty" [II.XII.1]&lt;ref name="Hume"/&gt;}}

Hume argued that [[consent of the governed]] was the ideal foundation on which a government should rest, but that it had not actually occurred this way in general. {{quote|My intention here is not to exclude the consent of the people from being one just foundation of government where it has place. It is surely the best and most sacred of any. I only contend that it has very seldom had place in any degree and never almost in its full extent. And that therefore some other foundation of government must also be admitted. |Ibid II.XII.20}}

===Natural law and constitutionalism===
Legal scholar [[Randy Barnett]] has argued&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.randybarnett.com/ Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty]'', Randy Barnett (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; that, while presence in the territory of a society may be necessary for consent, this does not constitute consent to ''all'' rules the society might make regardless of their content. A second condition of consent is that the rules be consistent with underlying principles of justice and the protection of natural and social rights, and have procedures for effective protection of those rights (or liberties). This has also been discussed by O.{{nbsp}}A. Brownson,&lt;ref name="brownson"/&gt; who argued that, in a sense, three "constitutions" are involved: first, the ''constitution of nature'' that includes all of what the Founders called "[[natural law]]"; second, the ''constitution of society'', an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it does establish the third, a ''constitution of government''. To consent, a necessary condition is that the rules be ''[[constitution]]al'' in that sense.

===Tacit consent===
The theory of an implicit social contract holds that by remaining in the territory controlled by some society, which usually has a government, people give consent to join that society and be governed by its government, if any. This consent is what gives legitimacy to such a government.

Other writers have argued that consent to join the society is not necessarily consent to its government. For that, the government must be set up according to a constitution of government that is consistent with the superior unwritten constitutions of nature and society.&lt;ref name="brownson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitution.org/oab/am_rep.htm |author=O. A. Brownson |title=''The American Republic: its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny'' |year=1866 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explicit Consent ===
The theory of an implicit social contract also goes under the principles of explicit consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/gaining-explicit-consent-under-the-gdpr-2/|title=Gaining explicit consent under the GDPR|date=2017-07-05|work=IT Governance Blog|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main difference between Tacit consent and explicit consent is that explicit consent is meant to leave no room for misinterpretation.  Moreover, you should directly state what it is that you want and the person has to respond in a concise manner that either confirms or denies the proposition.

===Voluntarism===
According to the will theory of contract, a contract is not presumed valid unless all parties voluntarily agree to it, either tacitly or explicitly, without coercion. [[Lysander Spooner]], a 19th-century lawyer and staunch supporter of a right of contract between individuals, argued in his essay ''[[No Treason]]'' that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. As a result, he maintains that such an agreement is not voluntary and therefore cannot be considered a legitimate contract at all.

Modern Anglo-American law, like European civil law, is based on a will theory of contract, according to which all terms of a contract are binding on the parties because they chose those terms for themselves. This was less true when Hobbes wrote ''Leviathan''; at that time more importance was attached to consideration, meaning a mutual exchange of benefits necessary to the formation of a valid contract, and most contracts had implicit terms that arose from the nature of the contractual relationship rather than from the choices made by the parties. Accordingly, it has been argued that social contract theory is more consistent with the contract law of the time of Hobbes and Locke than with the contract law of our time, and that certain features in the social contract which seem anomalous to us, such as the belief that we are bound by a contract formulated by our distant ancestors, would not have seemed as strange to Hobbes' contemporaries as they do to us.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kary, "Contract Law and the Social Contract: What Legal History Can Teach Us About the Political Theory of Hobbes and Locke", 31 Ottawa Law Review 73 (Jan. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Social work developed in the 19th century, with roots in voluntary philanthropy and [[grassroots organizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/charity-organization-societies-1877-1893/|title=Charity Organization Societies: 1877-1893 - Social Welfare History Project|date=February 4, 2013|work=Social Welfare History Project|access-date=December 29, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act of responding to social needs have existed long before then, primarily from private charities, and religious organizations.

== Definition ==
Social work is a broad profession that intersects with several disciplines. Social work organizations offer the following definitions: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work.  Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities and indigenous knowledge, social work'' ''engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance wellbeing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ifsw.org/policies/definition-of-social-work/|title=Global Definition of Social Work {{!}} International Federation of Social Workers|website=ifsw.org|language=en-US|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Federation of Social Workers]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Social work is a profession concerned with helping individuals, families, groups and communities to enhance their individual and collective well-being. It aims to help people develop their skills and their ability to use their own resources and those of the community to resolve problems. Social work is concerned with individual and personal problems but also with broader social issues such as poverty, unemployment, and domestic violence."  -&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casw-acts.ca/en/what-social-work|title=What is Social Work? {{!}} Canadian Association of Social Workers|website=www.casw-acts.ca|language=en|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Association of Social Workers]]                                                                                                                                  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Social work practice consists of the professional application of social work values, principles, and techniques to one or more of the following ends: helping people obtain tangible services; counseling and psychotherapy with individuals, families, and groups; helping communities or groups provide or improve social and health services; and participating in legislative processes.

==History==
{{Main article|History of social work}}
[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the 19th century.]]
The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,&lt;ref name="BoiseStateI"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I. Scientific Philanthropy (1860–1900) |work =The Social Work History Station |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-1.htm|accessdate = February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organization Society]] in the mid-19th century, which was founded by [[Helen Bosanquet]] and [[Octavia Hill]] in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155|title=1800s|work=Family Action: About Us|accessdate=November 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians identify COS as the pioneering organization of the [[social theory]] that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation.&lt;ref name="Lymbery" /&gt; COS had its main focus on individual casework. The second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief – 'relief of paupers'. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organization Society. The third consisted of social action – rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby [[poverty reduction|alleviate poverty]]. This approach was developed originally by the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]].&lt;ref name="Lymbery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/9812_039472ch02.pdf|author=Lymbery|title=The History and Development of Social Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundation basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"&gt;Popple, Philip R. and Leighninger, Leslie. Social Work, Social Welfare, American Society. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional social work originated in [[History of England#Modern England, 18th–19th centuries|19th century England]], and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based [[poverty]] and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of [[charity (practice)|charity]] work.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011" /&gt;

Other important historical figures that shaped the growth of the social work profession are [[Jane Addams]], who founded the [[Hull House]] in Chicago and won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1931; [[Mary Richmond|Mary Ellen Richmond]], who wrote Social Diagnosis, one of the first social work books to incorporate law, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, and history; and [[William Beveridge]], who created the social welfare state, framing the debate on social work within the context of social welfare prevision.

==Transtheoretical models==
Social work is an interdisciplinary profession, meaning it draws from a number of areas, such as (but not limited to) [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[politics]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[ecology]], [[education]], [[health]], [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[Counseling psychology|counseling]], including [[psychotherapy]]. Field work is a distinctive attribution to social work [[pedagogy]]. This equips the trainee in understanding the theories and models within the field of work. Professional practitioners from multicultural aspects have their roots in this social work [[Immersion journalism|immersion]] engagements from the early 19th century in the western countries. As an example, here are some of the models and theories used within social work practice:{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Profession==
[[Abraham Flexner]] in a 1915 lecture, "Is Social Work a Profession?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924014006617|title=Is social work a profession?|first=Abraham|last=Flexner|date=June 19, 2018|publisher=New York, The New York school of philanthropy|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; delivered at the National Conference on Charities and Corrections, examined the characteristics of a profession with reference to social work. It is not a 'single model', such as that of health, followed by medical professions such as nurses and doctors, but an integrated profession, and the likeness with medical profession is that social work requires a continued study for professional development to retain knowledge and skills that are [[evidence-based practice|evidence-based by practice standards]]. A social work professional's services lead toward the aim of providing beneficial services to individuals, dyads, families, groups, organizations and communities to achieve optimum psychosocial functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers: The Centre for Education &amp; Training | date=2011 | accessdate=November 8, 2016 | url=http://www.tcet.com/assets/pdf/nrc/employment/1-12-11/OCSWSSW.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its seven core functions are described by Popple and Leighninger as:
# Engagement — the social worker must first engage the client in early meetings to promote a collaborative relationship
# Assessment — data must be gathered that will guide and direct a plan of action to help the client
# Planning — negotiate and formulate an action plan
# Implementation — promote resource acquisition and enhance role performance
# Monitoring/Evaluation — on-going documentation through short-term goal attainment of extent to which client is following through
# Supportive Counseling — affirming, challenging, encouraging, informing, and exploring options
# Graduated Disengagement — seeking to replace the social worker with a naturally occurring resource&lt;ref&gt;Popple &amp; Leighninger, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Six other core values identified by the National Association of Social Workers' (NASW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606100446/http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-06-06|title=Code of Ethics (English and Spanish) – National Association of Social Workers|work=socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code of Ethics are:

# Service — help people in need and address social problems
# Social Justice — challenge social injustices
# Respect the dignity and worth of the person
# Give importance to human relationships
# Integrity — behave in a trustworthy manner
# Competence — practice within the areas of one's areas of expertise and develop and enhance professional skill

A historic and defining feature of social work is the profession's focus on individual well-being in a social context and the well-being of society.&lt;ref name="Crisp"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Crisp, B.R.|author2=Beddoe, L.|date=December 2012|title=Promoting Health and Well-being in Social Work Education|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social workers promote [[social justice]] and [[social change]] with and on behalf of clients.&lt;ref name="Stefaroi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefaroi, Petru|date=December 2014|title=Humane &amp; Spiritual Qualities of the Professional in Humanistic Social Work: Humanistic Social Work – The Third Way in Theory and Practice|location=Charleston|publisher=Createspace|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "client" can be an individual, family, group, organization, or community.&lt;ref&gt;NASW, Code of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadening scope of the modern social worker's role, some practitioners have in recent years traveled to war-torn countries to provide psychosocial assistance to families and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Kosovo Family Support Project:Offering Psychosocial Support for Families with Missing Persons |author1=Keough, Mary Ellen  |author2=Samuels, Margaret F. | journal=Social Work |date=October 2004 | volume=49 | issue=4 | pages=587–594 | doi=10.1093/sw/49.4.587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S.|year=2004|title=Banking the poor: Policies to bring low-income Americans into the financial mainstream|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area that social workers are focusing is risk management, risk in social work is taken as Knight in 1921 defined "If you don't even know for sure what will happen, but you know the odds, that is risk and If you don't even know the odds, that is uncertainty." Risk management in social work means minimising the risks while increasing potential benefits for clients by analysing the risks and benefits in duty of care or in decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllida Parsole. Risk assessment in social care and social work. 2001. Jessica Kingsley Publishers.pg. 17+&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, according to the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), a branch of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], professional social workers are the largest group of mental health services providers. There are more clinically trained social workers—over 200,000—than psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined. Federal law and the National Institutes of Health recognize social work as one of five core mental health professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Association of Social Workers |url=http://www.socialworkers.org/ |work=NASW |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of fields a social worker may be employed in are [[poverty relief]], [[life skills|life skills education]], [[community development]], [[rural development]], [[forensics]] and [[corrections]], [[legislation]], [[industrial relations]], [[project management]], [[child protection]], [[elder abuse|elder protection]], [[women's rights]], [[human rights]], [[systems theory|systems optimization]], [[Financial social work|finance]], [[drug rehabilitation|addictions rehabilitation]], [[child development]], [[Cross-cultural psychology|cross-cultural mediation]], [[occupational safety and health]], [[disaster management]], [[mental health]], [[psychosocial|psychosocial therapy]], [[disabilities]], etc.

==Qualifications==
[[File:Czythumbur.jpg|thumbnail|252x252px|right|Social Work training begins in a structured manner at higher educational institutions (universities and colleges), coupled with or followed by practical internships and externships.]]
The education of social workers begins with a bachelor's degree (BA, BSc, BSSW, BSW, etc.) or diploma in social work or a [[Bachelor of Social Services]]. Some countries offer postgraduate degrees in social work, such as a master's degree (MSW, MSSW, MSS, MSSA, MA, MSc, MRes, MPhil.) or doctoral studies (PhD and DSW (Doctor of Social Work)). Increasingly, graduates of social work programs pursue post-masters and post-doctoral study, including training in psychotherapy.

In the United States, social work undergraduate and master's programs are accredited by the [[Council on Social Work Education]]. A CSWE-accredited degree is required for one to become a state-licensed social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/careers/how-to-become-a-licensed-clinical-social-worker.html|title=How to Become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-dsw/|title=Online Doctorate of Social Work (DSW) Programs|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSWE even accredits online master's in social work programs in traditional and advanced standing options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-schools.html|title=Online MSW Programs: 2018's Full List of CSWE Accredited Schools|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, the New York [[Charity Organization Society]], which was the [[Columbia University School of Social Work]]'s earliest entity, began offering formal "social philanthropy" courses, marking both the beginning date for social work education in the United States, as well as the launching of professional social work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2vnns1wL8wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=history+of+columbia+university+school+of+social+work+first&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OKcgdIAK4S&amp;sig=ELBKCq_wU25ep2y0EYXYBo92vsg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigxZC1obDYAhVDRN8KHTjhC74Q6AEIXjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20columbia%20university%20school%20of%20social%20work%20first&amp;f=false|title=The Columbia University School of Social Work: A Centennial Celebration|last=Feldman|first=Ronald A.|last2=Kamerman|first2=Sheila B.|date=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231122825|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of countries and jurisdictions require [[Licensure|registration]] or [[licensure]] of people working as social workers, and there are mandated [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW, 2005). NASW Fact Sheet. Retrieved November 15, 2006 from http://www.socialworkers.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, a professional association sets academic requirements for admission to the profession. The success of these professional bodies' efforts is demonstrated in that these same requirements are recognized by employers as necessary for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cswna.org|title=Catholic Social Workers National Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional associations===
Social workers have a number of professional associations that provide ethical guidance and other forms of support for their members and for social work in general. These associations may be international, continental, semi-continental, national, or regional. The main international associations are the [[International Federation of Social Workers]] (IFSW) and the [[International Association of Schools of Social Work]] (IASSW).

The largest professional social work association in the United States is the [[National Association of Social Workers]]. There also exist organizations that represent clinical social workers such as The American Association of Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work. AAPCSW is a national organization representing social workers who practice psychoanalytic social work and psychonalysis. There are also a number of states with Clinical Social Work Societies which represent all social workers who conduct psychotherapy from a variety of theoretical frameworks with families, groups and individuals.  The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration (ACOSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration|url = http://www.acosa.org/joomla/|website = www.acosa.org|accessdate = October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional organization for social workers who practice within the community organizing, policy, and political spheres.

In the UK, the professional association is the [[British Association of Social Workers]] (BASW) with just over 18,000 members (as of August 2015).

The Code of Ethics of the US-based [[National Association of Social Workers]] provides a code for daily conduct and a set of principles rooted in 6 core values:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NASW Delegate Assembly|first=|date=1996|title=Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=ms_ArtLqzeI%3d&amp;portalid=0|journal=National Association of Social Workers|volume=2017 revision|pages=|via=socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siedlecki|first=Karen L.|last2=Salthouse|first2=Timothy A.|last3=Oishi|first3=Shigehiro|last4=Jeswani|first4=Sheena|date=2014-06-01|title=The Relationship Between Social Support and Subjective Well-Being Across Age |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=117|issue=2|pages=561–576|doi=10.1007/s11205-013-0361-4 |pmc=4102493|pmid=25045200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade unions representing social workers===
In the United Kingdom, just over half of social workers are employed by local authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Contemporary_History_of_Social_Work.html?id=MCyGoAEACAAJ|title=A contemporary history of social work: Learning from the past|last=Terry|first=Bamford|date=February 25, 2015|publisher=Policy Press: University of Bristol|year=2015|isbn=9781447322184|location=Bristol, United Kingdom|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of these are represented by [[UNISON]], the public sector employee union. Smaller numbers are members of the [[Unite the Union]] and the [[GMB (trade union)]]. The [[British Union of Social Work Employees]] (BUSWE) has been a section of the [[Community (trade union)]] since 2008.

While at that stage not a union, the [[British Association of Social Workers]] operated a professional advice and representation service from the early 1990s. Social Work qualified staff who are also experienced in employment law and industrial relations provide the kind of representation you would expect from a trade union in the event of grievance, discipline or conduct matters specifically in respect of professional conduct or practice. However, this service depended on the good will of employers to allow the representatives to be present at these meetings, as only trade unions have the legal right and entitlement of representation in the workplace.

By 2011 several councils had realized that they did not have to permit BASW access, and those that were challenged by skilled professional representation of their staff were withdrawing permission. For this reason BASW once again took up trade union status by forming its arms length trade union section, SWU (Social Workers Union). This gives legal right to represent its members whether the employer or [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) recognizes SWU or not.  At 2015 the TUC was still resisting SWU application for admission to congress membership and while most employers are not making formal statements of recognition until such a time as the TUC may change its policy, they are all legally required to permit SWU (BASW) representation at internal discipline hearings etc.

==Social workers in literature==
In 2011, a critic stated that "novels about social work are rare,"&lt;ref name="bounds"&gt;{{cite web

'''Swaffelen''' (or '''zwaffelen''') is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term meaning to hit one's [[penis]]—often repeatedly—against an object or another person's body. Swaffelen was named as the word of the year in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] in 2008.

The act of swaffelen often takes place in the form of teasing, crude humour or a degrading context, but can also be a [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]]. When the act is practised on a person, it is often the person's cheek that is hit. The penis is ideally semi-erect during the act. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Origin==
The term "swaffelen" is believed to have originated in English-speaking areas.&lt;ref name=UPI /&gt; It is believed to originate from Dutch words meaning swing, sway and swoop, as well as the German words for tail or penis (Schweif and Schwanz).&lt;ref name=UPI /&gt;&lt;ref name=Expatica /&gt;

==Media coverage==
In April 2008, the term received wide media attention in the Netherlands and Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Binnenland/article/detail/303064/2008/04/14/Zaak-swaffelaar-erg-opgeblazen.dhtml ''Algemeen Dagblad, 14 april 2008: Zaak 'swaffelaar' erg opgeblazen."]&lt;/ref&gt; when a Dutch student Joost Wanders committed the act on the [[Taj Mahal]] and uploaded the video to [[YouTube]]. The student was suspended for this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1038/Rotterdam/article/detail/256983/2008/04/09/Student-van-school-wegens-swaffelen.dhtml ''Algemeen Dagblad'', 9 april 2008: "Student van school wegens 'swaffelen'."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] TV program ''[[Spuiten en Slikken]]'' invited viewers to make their own videos of other objects being swaffeled. They also called for a ''BNN Nationale Swaffeldag'' (''BNN National Swaffel Day'') to be declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZS4LageGlQ BNN-uitzending over de ''BNN Nationale Swaffeldag'' op YouTube.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]] and the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]] were among the objects swaffeled in the submissions.

Swaffelen received further attention when [[Australian]] folk singer [[Iain Campbell Smith]] aka Fred Smith, on his return to Australia from Afghanistan{{when|date=March 2015}} released an album entitled "Dust of Uruzgan", consisting of songs responding to the war in Afghanistan, especially his comedic song ''Niet Swaffelen op de Dixi'' about Dutch soldiers in Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 2015 a firefighter in [[Enkhuizen]] was fired for swaffeling a colleague.&lt;ref name=ad.nl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kooijman|first1=Tim|title=Ontslag voor brandweerman na swaffelen van collega|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3827964/2015/01/12/Ontslag-voor-brandweerman-na-swaffelen-van-collega.dhtml|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=AD|date=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the topic of swearing in various languages arose, in episode 4, series N, of the British panel show ''[[QI]]'', one of the show's panelists, [[Jeremy Clarkson]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, mentioned the word,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=rockattack|title=Jeremy Clarkson on Dutch swear words (BBC Qi)|date=2016-11-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2dhjDE2Ro&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining it as meaning, ''specifically'', "...to bang your penis against The [[Taj Mahal]]."

It was featured in episode 5 of the [[Amazon Video]] show ''[[The Grand Tour (TV series)|The Grand Tour]]''.

==Word of the year==
Swaffelen was voted as the word of the year in a 2008 competition organized by [[Genootschap Onze Taal]] (Society for Our Language), Van Dale Uitgevers (Van Dale Publishers) and the newspaper [[De Pers]].&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch pick penis-shaking term as top word|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2008/12/17/Dutch-pick-penis-shaking-term-as-top-word/UPI-73411229494794/|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=UPI|date=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Expatica&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaffelen is Dutch word of the year|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Dutch-word-of-the-year-is-swaffelen.html|work=Dutch News|publisher=Expatica|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1108992.ece/Swaffelen_woord_van_het_jaar ''De Volkskrant'', 15 december 2008: "Swaffelen woord van het jaar."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The blog [[GeenStijl.nl]] encouraged readers to vote for "swaffelen".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/270096/Swaffelen-is-de-favoriet.html ''De Pers'', 16 december 2008.

'''''The Gnostic Paul''''' is a book by [[Elaine Pagels]], a scholar of [[gnosticism]] and professor of religion at [[Princeton University]]. In the work, Pagels considers each of the non-pastoral [[Pauline epistles]], and [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|questions about their authorship]]. The core of the book examines how the Pauline epistles were read by 2nd century [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinian]] gnostics and demonstrates that Paul could be considered a proto-[[gnostic]] as well as a proto-[[Catholic]]. 

Her treatment involves reading the Pauline corpus as being dual layered between a [[Pneumatic (Gnosticism)|pneumatic]], [[Gnosticism#Important terms and concepts|esoteric Christianity]] and a [[Christianity#Beliefs|psychic, exoteric Christianity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">[[Image:Pedalierdorgue3.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The '''tutti''' piston seen over the organ pedalboard]]
'''''Tutti''''' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] word literally meaning ''all'' or ''together'' and is used as a musical term, for the whole orchestra as opposed to the soloist. It is applied similarly to [[choir|choral]] music, where the whole section or choir is called to sing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutti|url=http://musicterms.artopium.com/t/Tutti.htm|work=Artopium musical terms|accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music examination boards may instruct candidates to "play in tuttis", indicating that the candidate should play both the solo and the tutti sections.

# An [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] may specify that a section leader (e.g., the principal violinist) plays alone, while the rest of the section is silent for the duration of the [[Solo (music)|solo]] passage, by writing '''''solo''''' in the music at the point where it begins and ''tutti'' at the point he wishes the rest of the section to resume playing.
# In [[Organ (music)|organ music]], it indicates that the '''full organ''' should be used: all stops and all couplers. Some organ consoles offer a toe stud or piston to toggle the tutti: pressing once activates all stops (although it does not physically move the stop knobs), and pressing again reverts to the previous registration.

{{Democracy}}
In [[political science]], a '''wave of democracy''' refers to a major surge of [[democracy]] in history. The term "Third Wave of Democracy" was first coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]], a political scientist at [[Harvard University]] in his article published in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' and further expounded in his 1991 book ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century]]''. 

Huntington describes global democratization as coming in three waves, the first beginning in the early 19th century and the third being a current event.&lt;ref name="huntington"&gt;{{cite news 
 
|url=http://www.4uth.gov.ua/usa/english/politics/whatsdem/whatdm13.htm 
|title=What Is Democracy? - Democracy's Third Wave 
|publisher=U.S. State Department
|accessdate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Seva Gunitsky of University of Toronto, have referred to 13 waves from the 18th century to the Arab Spring (2011-2012).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunitsky|first=Seva|date=2018|title=Democratic Waves in Historical Perspective|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/democratic-waves-in-historical-perspective/9452AFC439DD960F4D219246A7E7F51E|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=634–651|doi=10.1017/S1537592718001044|issn=1537-5927|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huntingon's three waves==
===First wave=== 
The First wave of democracy began in the early 19th century when [[suffrage]] was granted to the majority of white males in the [[United States]] ("[[Jacksonian democracy]]"). At its peak, the first wave saw 29 democracies in the world. This continued until 1922, when [[Benito Mussolini]] rose to power in [[Italy]]. The ebb of the first wave lasted from 1922 until 1942, during which the number of democracies in the world dropped to a mere 12.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

===Second wave===

The Second wave began following the Allied victory in [[World War II]], and crested nearly 20 years later in 1962 with 36 recognised democracies in the world. The Second wave ebbed as well at this point, and the total number dropped to 30 democracies between 1962 and the mid-1970s. But the "flat line" would not last for long, as the third wave was about to surge in a way no one had ever seen.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

Scholars have noted that the appearance of "waves" of democracy largely disappears when women's suffrage is taken into account; moreover, some countries change their positions quite dramatically: [[Switzerland]], which is typically included as part of the first wave, did not grant women the right to vote until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, Pamela. (2000). “Women's Suffrage in the Measurement of Democracy: Problems of Operationalization.” ''Studies in Comparative International Development'' 35(3): 92-111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third wave===

The Third wave began in 1974 ([[Carnation Revolution]], Portugal) and included the historic democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980s, Asia Pacific countries and regions ([[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]]) from 1986 to 1988, Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and sub-Saharan Africa beginning in 1989. The expansion of democracy in some regions was stunning. In Latin America only Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela were democratic by 1978 and only Cuba and Haiti remained authoritarian by 1995, when the wave had swept across twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schenoni, Luis and Scott Mainwaring|title=Hegemonic Effects and Regime Change in Latin America|journal=Democratization|doi=10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754?journalCode=fdem20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures there are well over 100 democracies in the world today{{when|date=November 2016}}, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{cn|date=November 2016}}  Many of these newer democracies are not fully "consolidated," however, meaning that while they have electoral institutions in place, political democracy remains fragile.  Reasons for this fragility include economic instability, continued elite dominance of politics, ongoing military interference in civilian affairs, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Larry. (1996). “Is the Third Wave Over?” ''Journal of Democracy'' 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries undergoing or having undergone a transition to democracy during a wave are subject to [[democratic backsliding]]. Political scientists and theorists believe that the third wave has crested and will soon begin to ebb, just as its predecessors did in the first and second waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagorski|first=Paul W.|title=Democratic Breakdown in Paraguay and Venezuela: The Shape of Things to Come for Latin America?|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–116|doi=10.1177/0095327X0303000104|url=http://afs.sagepub.com/content/30/1/87.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the period immediately following the onset of the "war on terror" after the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks on the United States, some backsliding was evident.  How significant or lasting that erosion is remains a subject of debate.

After the Great Recession of 2008, a number of countries backslided from democracy including Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Honduras and the Maldives. Some other countries have had democratic transitions however, such as Tunisia and the Gambia. There has also been limited democratic reform in some countries, such as Burma and Morocco. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Arab Spring==
Experts have associated the collapse of several dictatorships in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], phenomenon known as Arab Spring, with the events which followed the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. The similarity between the two phenomena inspired hope for a fourth wave of [[democratization]]. However, a few months after the apparent beginning of the transition, most of the Arab political openings closed, causing an inevitable pull-back. One of the most alarming cases was that of Egypt, where the government, controlled by the military, did not facilitate the democratic transition in any way. On the contrary, it strove to silence the protests by arresting peaceful protesters and by “trying them in military tribunals.”{{fact|date=March 2018}} A concrete example is provided by the story of [[Maikel Nabil Sanad|Maikel Nabil]], an Egyptian blogger convicted to be imprisoned for three years for “insulting the [[military]] establishment.” The main causes of the regression and crisis in all the affected countries are attributed to corruption, unemployment, social injustice, and autocratic political systems.

Despite the apparently unsolvable situation, the [[United Nations|UN]], under the administration of [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]], tried to work as a mediator between the governments and the protesters. Moreover, according to [[Larry Diamond]], the engagement of the [[United States|United States of America]] in the democratic transition of the Arab world was fundamental.
