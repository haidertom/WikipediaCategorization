      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">'''A Change of Hobbit''' (1972-1991) was one of the first [[science fiction, fantasy and horror bookstores]] established, and was a significant part of [[science fiction fandom]] generally and in Southern California particularly.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;Duke Helfand, [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-10/news/we-1280_1_science-fiction "For Science Fiction Fans, Old Habit Dies Hard : Change of Hobbit Devotees Are Already Mourning Bookstore Demise"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Feb. 10, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Gottlieb, [http://www.wordservices.com/hobbit/ "Escape Velocity: A History of A Change of Hobbit Bookstore"] (draft memoir, last visited March 31, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name references the [[hobbit]]s from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' series. Owner Sherry Gottlieb offered the use of her name to colleagues in Berkeley, who then established [[The Other Change of Hobbit]] bookstore in 1974; that store continues to operate in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="bdp1008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Bullock |work=The Berkeley Daily Planet |title=The Other Change of Hobbit is Living in South Berkeley |url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-08-10/article/36052?headline=The-Other-Change-of-Hobbit-Thrives-in-South-Berkeley |date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Change of Hobbit bookstore hosted numerous events, including, famously, [[Harlan Ellison]] in its front window, writing a story in public view, over the course of a week.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harlan Ellison]], ''[[Strange Wine]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The store was also a mainstay on author tours, as [[Anne Rice]] noted: "Authors around the world have dreamed of going to the Hobbit for signings. What's a West Coast tour if you can't visit Sherry?"&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt; The store was also notable for Gottlieb's pet boa constrictor, "Wrinklesnakeskin".&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;

Gottlieb first opened the store in Westwood, moved it to Westwood Boulevard, and then to Lincoln Boulevard in [[Santa Monica]]. In 1989, Gottlieb moved the store to its final location on 2nd Street in [[Santa Monica]].&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;

[[File:Messager André compositeur 1921.jpg|thumb|alt=head and shoulder shot of an elderly bald man with a large moustache|André Messager, 1921]]
'''André Charles Prosper Messager''' ({{IPA-fr|mɛsaʒe|lang}}; 30 December 1853&amp;nbsp;– 24 February 1929) was a French composer, organist, pianist and conductor. His compositions include eight ballets and thirty [[opéra comique|opéras comiques]], [[opérette]]s and other stage works, among which his ballet ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'' (1886) and opéra comique ''[[Véronique (operetta)|Véronique]]'' (1898) have had lasting success; ''[[Les p'tites Michu|Les P'tites Michu]]'' (1897) and ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' (1919) were also popular internationally.

Messager took up the piano as a small child and later studied composition with, among others, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Gabriel Fauré]]. He became a major figure in the musical life of Paris and later London, both as a conductor and a composer. Many of his Parisian works were also produced in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and some on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; the most successful had long runs and numerous international revivals. He wrote two operatic works in English, and his later output included [[Musical theatre#Early 20th century|musical comedies]] for [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Yvonne Printemps]].

As a conductor, Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London, at the head of the [[Opéra-Comique]], the [[Paris Opera|Paris Opéra]], the [[Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire]], and the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden. Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works, as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas, from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to [[Richard Strauss]], and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. In Paris he conducted the world premieres of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'', [[Jules Massenet|Massenet's]] ''[[Grisélidis]]'' and [[Gustave Charpentier|Charpentier]]'s ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]''.  At Covent Garden, he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint-Saëns and Massenet.

Messager's music became known for its melodic and orchestral invention, musical craftsmanship, and characteristically French elegance and grace. Although most of his works have been infrequently revived, historians of music consider him the last major figure in French opéra comique and opérette.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
[[File:Messager's-mentors.jpg|left|alt=four head and shoulder photos of middle-aged nineteenth-century men in semi-profile. All are wearing suits and have facial hair.|thumb|upright|Four of Messager's musical influences: clockwise from top left, [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]; [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]]; [[Eugène Gigout|Gigout]]; [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]]]]
Messager was born at [[Montluçon]] in central France on 30 December 1853, the son of Paul-Philippe-Émile Messager, a prosperous local tax collector, and his wife Sophie-Cornélie, ''née'' Lhôte de Selancy.&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled, "You would not find any musicians among my ancestors. When very young I learned the piano; but later on my intentions to become a composer met with such opposition from my father".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wagstaff, pp. 157 and 161&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven he was sent as a boarder to a [[Marist Brothers|Marist]] school where he continued his interest in the piano.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Wagstaff, John and [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]]. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/18492 "Messager, André"], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 March 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 1860s disastrous stock-market speculation brought Messager's family financial ruin and they could no longer afford to keep him at the Marist school.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; They dropped their objection to music as a profession, viewing a post as a church organist as a respectable and steady career. He was awarded a bursary to study at the [[École Niedermeyer de Paris|École Niedermeyer]] in Paris, an academy known for its focus on church music.&lt;ref&gt;Ferchault, Guy, and Jacqueline Gachet.

Fauré and Messager quickly moved from being master and pupil to being firm friends and occasional collaborators.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, pp. 51–63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Messager succeeded Fauré as ''organiste du chœur'' (choir organist) at [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], Paris, under the principal organist, [[Charles-Marie Widor]].&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 he won the gold medal of the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique with a symphony, the work being warmly received when performed by the [[Concerts Colonne]] at the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in January 1878.{{refn|Following its good reception the symphony was given several repeat performances soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He won further prizes for his [[cantata]]s ''Don Juan et Haydée'' and ''Prométhée enchaîné''.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;

In 1879 Fauré and Messager travelled to [[Cologne Opera|Cologne]] to see [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and later to [[Bavarian State Opera|Munich]] for the complete ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle, ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'' and ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''; in 1888 they went to [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]] for ''Die Meistersinger'' and ''[[Parsifal]]''.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent ''Souvenirs de Bayreuth'' (c. 1888).{{refn|The date is Nectoux's estimate.&lt;ref name=n541&gt;Nectoux, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; Wagstaff and Lamb in ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]'' put the date earlier, possibly 1880.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The work was not published during either composer's lifetime.

In 1878 Messager was appointed conductor at the [[Folies Bergère]], and he began his career composing for the stage with two short ballets, ''Fleur d'oranger'' (1878) and ''Les Vins de France'' (1879).&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 a former manager of the Folies, M. Comy, was appointed to run the new Eden Théâtre in Brussels.

Messager's career took a new turn in 1883 when the composer [[Firmin Bernicat]] died leaving an unfinished [[opérette]], ''[[François les bas-bleus]]''. Messager was invited to complete it; he orchestrated the entire work and composed between twelve and fifteen numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; It was staged in November 1883 at the [[Théâtre des Folies-Dramatiques]] and was an immediate critical and popular success.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 17 November 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later produced in London and New York.&lt;ref name=ftr/&gt;&lt;ref name=fus/&gt; In 1883, while deputising for Saint-Saëns as the soloist at a concert in [[Le Havre]], Messager met a young woman, Edith Clouette, whom he married in the same year.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Fauré played the organ at the ceremony,{{refn|As bride and bridegroom processed solemnly down the aisle Fauré mischievously included in his improvisation a tune from one of Messager's Folies Bergère ballets.&lt;ref name=harding124&gt;Harding, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and composed a mildly cynical song, "[[Madrigal (Fauré)|Madrigal]]", as a wedding present.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; There was one child of the marriage, Jean André Emile Charles (1886–1952).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.artlyriquefr.fr/personnages/Messager%20Andre.html "André Messager"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407135915/https://www.artlyriquefr.fr/personnages/Messager%20Andre.html |date=7 April 2018}}, Association l'Art Lyrique Français, accessed 7 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1883 Messager and [[Emmanuel Chabrier]] gave the first performance of the latter's ''[[Trois valses romantiques]]'' at the [[Société Nationale de Musique]]. The concert also included the premiere of the two-piano version of ''[[España (Chabrier)|España]]'', arranged by Messager.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, p. 47; and Wagstaff, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Messager and Chabrier were close friends until the latter's death in 1894. Both were known for their comic operas and opérettes, but Chabrier's one serious opera, ''[[Gwendoline (opera)|Gwendoline]]'', appealed strongly to Messager, who vowed to conduct it in Paris, which he later did.{{refn|Messager's first Paris performance of ''Gwendoline'' was on 12 May 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Delage, p. 625&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the vocal score of the work.{{refn|The score was published in 1890 in Paris by Enoch frères and Costallat; and in Brunswick by [[Henry Litolff]]s Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]] catalogue number 004260835; {{OCLC|497254214}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Following the success of ''François les bas-bleus'' Messager accepted simultaneous invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an opérette for the Folies-Dramatiques. The opérette, ''[[La fauvette du temple|La Fauvette du temple]]'', first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's early reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, and he was able to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 13 February 1886; "The Theatres", ''The Daily News'', 30 November 1885, p. 2; and "Occasional Notes", ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 17 November 1891, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet, ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'', which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police, and the production was temporarily shelved.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 25 October 1884, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the opening of ''La Fauvette du temple'' the Bouffes-Parisiens premiered Messager's opéra comique ''[[La Béarnaise]]'', with [[Jeanne Granier]] in the title role. It ran for three months and was successfully produced in Britain the following year with a cast including [[Florence St. John]] and [[Marie Tempest]], running for more than 200 performances.&lt;ref&gt;"La Bearnaise", ''The Era'', 2 October 1886, p. 9; "The London Theatres", ''The Era'', 9 October 1886, p. 14; and "The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 2 July 1887, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' said of this production that it gave Messager a secure footing in London, which led to important results later in his career.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Obituary, "M. André Messager", ''The Times'', 25 February 1929, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; A production of ''La Béarnaise'' in New York followed in 1887, under the title ''Jacquette''.&lt;ref name=traubner223/&gt;

In 1886 ''Les Deux Pigeons'' was finally produced at the Paris Opéra and was a box office triumph. It was Messager's last popular success for four years. His attempt at a more serious opera, ''[[Le bourgeois de Calais|Le Bourgeois de Calais]]'' (1888), was not well received. [[Richard Traubner]] remarks in ''Operetta: A Theatrical History'' on its "boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score";&lt;ref name=traubner223/&gt; a contemporary critic wrote, "That ''Le Bourgeois de Calais'' will have a successful career there is not the faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece."&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 16 April 1887, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale, ''[[Isoline (opera)|Isoline]]'' (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act opérette, ''[[Le mari de la reine|Le Mari de la reine]]'' (1889), which failed, although Messager thought it "the best of my flops".&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;&lt;ref name=traubner223&gt;Traubner, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Messager's fortunes revived in 1890 with ''[[La Basoche]]'', produced with much success at the [[Opéra-Comique]].&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; The critic who had pronounced so unfavourably on ''Le Bourgeois de Calais'' wrote of the new piece, "an exceptionally pleasing work&amp;nbsp;... a dainty piece which cannot fail to obtain widespread popularity."&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 7 June 1890, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  An English-language version was produced in London in 1891 by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].

''[[The New York Times]]'', 11 March 1893, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Messager was a dandy and a philanderer. The musical historian [[D. Kern Holoman]] describes him as "given to immaculately tailored suits emphasizing his thin frame, careful grooming with particular attention to his mustaches, fine jewelry, and spats&amp;nbsp;... a witty conversationalist with an inexhaustible store of anecdotes and ''bons mots''" and a womaniser.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, p. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1890s Edith Messager, tired of her husband's infidelities, divorced him. Shortly afterwards she became ill; her condition deteriorated, and Messager visited her daily. By the time of her death in 1892 the two had become close again, and Messager felt her loss deeply.&lt;ref name=hu129/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Messager's career as a conductor began to advance when he was invited to conduct ''Die Walküre'' at [[Marseille]]. As a composer the early 1890s brought him mixed fortunes. ''[[Madame Chrysanthème (opera)|Madame Chrysanthème]]'', staged at the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]] in 1893, was a setting of [[Pierre Loti]]'s story of a betrayed [[geisha]], a theme that later inspired Puccini's ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''; it was politely rather than enthusiastically received. ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', produced by Carte at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1894, was Messager's first opera written expressly for the London stage and was the only original [[Savoy opera]] by a French composer.&lt;ref name=traubner213&gt;Traubner, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; To assist him in what was for him (at the time) an unfamiliar idiom, Messager enlisted the help of the songwriter Dotie (Alice Maude) Davis (1859–1938), known professionally as [[Hope Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Coles, Clifton. [http://gsarchive.net/savoy/mirette/intro.html "''Mirette'': Introduction"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315174638/http://gsarchive.net/savoy/mirette/intro.html |date=15 March 2018 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 May 1998, accessed 15 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; She became Messager's second wife in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], Messager, concluding from the reception of ''La Basoche'' in London that it was unwise to offer the British public anything too intelligent, decided that the new opera was going to be as commonplace as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, II, p. 537 and III, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for 41 performances, was withdrawn and revised, and then ran for another 61 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Messager vetoed any production in Paris.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; His next opera, a serious work, ''[[Le chevalier d'Harmental (opera)|Le Chevalier d'Harmental]]'' (1896), was unsuccessful, and for a while he and his new wife withdrew to the English countryside near [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1897 Messager's career revived. He later recalled that he had received by post an unsolicited libretto:
{{quote|I was attracted by the gaiety of its subject, and putting aside my dark thoughts, I set to work on it with such enthusiasm that the work was completed in three months, and performed in the same year at the Bouffes, with great success.

In the 1913–14 season, he conducted a chronological cycle of Beethoven's symphonies and his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', as well as [[Requiem (Verdi)|Verdi's ''Requiem'']], for the Italian composer's centenary. Messager took the orchestra outside Paris to Lille, Lyon and Antwerp during these years.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, pp. 332–333&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War he took the orchestra on tour to Argentina (1916), Switzerland (1917), and the US and Canada (1918–19), giving concerts in more than 50 cities.&lt;ref&gt;"Imperial and Foreign News Items", ''The Times'', 23 August 1918, p. 5; and Wagstaff, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt; After their concert at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in October 1918, the orchestra and Messager received a prolonged ovation that was typical of their reception as the tour progressed.&lt;ref&gt;"French Orchestra Wins an Ovation", ''The New York Times'', 16 October 1918, p. 13; and Holoman, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of that tour Messager retired from his post.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beaucaire1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=theatre poster advertising Messager's ''Monsieur Beaucaire'' and other pieces playing at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh|Playbill from a 1920 production]]
In 1919 Messager's operetta ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' was premiered in [[Birmingham]] prior to a long run in the [[West End theatre|West End]]. The composer, who generally conducted British premieres of his works, was suffering from sciatica and could not even be in the audience for the first nights in either city.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The work received its Paris premiere at the [[Théâtre Marigny]] in 1925,&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; and it ran for 143 performances on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/monsieur-beaucaire-6740 ''Monsieur Beaucaire''], Internet Broadway Database, accessed 7 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1919 Messager resumed the musical directorship of the Opéra-Comique for the 1919–20 season, conducting among other works the first complete performance in France of ''[[Così fan tutte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===
In the 1920s, Messager kept pace with the change in fashion in musical theatre, consciously absorbing the styles of musical comedy, lightening his orchestration, but maintaining a Gallic flavour, mostly avoiding American dance-rhythm influences.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; He collaborated with [[Sacha Guitry]] on the musical comedies ''[[L'amour masqué|L'Amour masqué]]'' (1923) and ''Deburau'' (1926), starring [[Yvonne Printemps]].&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The former was a considerable success in Paris, but in London the official censor, the [[Lord Chamberlain#Theatre censorship|Lord Chamberlain]], declared it "unfit for the English public", and banned [[C. B. Cochran]]'s planned production starring Printemps and Guitry.&lt;ref&gt;"Bars L'Amour Masqué", ''The New York Times'', 22 January 1928, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In Messager's late stage works his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of the nineteenth century, with hints of Fauré and, particularly, Chabrier's ''[[L'étoile (opera)|L'Étoile]]''.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; Fauré, by 1923 too frail and deaf to go to the theatre, was lent a copy of the score of ''L'Amour masqué'' and wrote to Messager, "Your wit is the same as always – it never grows old – and so are your charm and very personal brand of music that always remains exquisite even amid the broadest clowning".&lt;ref name=harding147/&gt; Fauré died the following year, and Messager dedicated the music of ''Deburau'' to his memory.&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 [[Sergei Diaghilev]] persuaded Messager to conduct the Paris premieres of [[Georges Auric|Auric]]'s ballet ''Les Fâcheux'' and [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]]'s ''[[Les biches|Les Biches]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important updates to copyright law, though he was on the losing side of the case. He sued the [[BBC]] for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his consent. He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to [[George Edwardes]], whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast. The case established that as the broadcasting rights had not been specifically reserved, the Edwardes estate's rights included them.&lt;ref&gt;"Summary of Cases", ''The Times'', 9 November 1928, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short illness Messager died in Paris on 24 February 1929 aged 75.&lt;ref&gt;"André Messager", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 25 February 1929, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the [[Passy Cemetery]] near the graves of Debussy and Fauré.&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; His last completed work, the opérette ''[[Coups de roulis]]'', was running in Paris when he died.{{refn|At his death, Messager left some numbers for an unfinished work, ''Sacha'', to a libretto by [[Maurice Donnay]], [[André Rivoire]] and Léon Guillot de Saix. He had composed about a quarter of the score, which was completed by [[Marc Berthomieu]]. It was staged at the Théâtre Garnier, Monte Carlo in December 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://194.254.96.55/cm/?for=fic&amp;cleoeuvre=310 "Sacha"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223085326/http://194.254.96.55/cm/?for=fic&amp;cleoeuvre=310 |date=2014-12-23 }}, ''L'encyclopédie multimedia de la comédie musicale théâtrale en France (1918–1944)'', accessed 7 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} A contemporary critic commented, "Its tuneful melodies show that the veteran composer had lost nothing of the qualities that made ''Véronique'' such a success. Throughout his life Messager remained without a peer as a composer of light music."&lt;ref&gt;MacCormack, Gilson. "A Review of French Records", ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'', May 1929, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours and awards===
Messager was elected President of the [[Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques]] in 1926, the first composer to hold this office. In the same year he was elected to the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]]. In 1927 he was appointed Commander of the [[Légion d'honneur]].&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; In his native town of Montluçon, the music academy, opened in 2009, is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agglo-montlucon.fr/index.php/conservatoire.html "Conservatoire à rayonnement départemental pour la musique et l'art dramatique André Messager"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601213409/http://www.agglo-montlucon.fr/index.php/conservatoire.html |date=1 June 2016 }}, Montluçon Communauté, accessed 15 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, Messager was the subject of a large exhibition at the Musée des musiques populaires de Montluçon, recounting his biography and illustrating his works in the various genres. Among the ''comité d'honneur'' of the exhibition were the composer's three grandchildren, and the singers [[Susan Graham]], [[Felicity Lott|Dame Felicity Lott]] and [[Mady Mesplé]], the conductors [[John Eliot Gardiner|Sir John Eliot Gardiner]], [[John Nelson (conductor)|John Nelson]] and [[Michel Plasson]], and the director [[Jérôme Savary]].&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fauré-ecole-group-.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|alt=A group of 18 men in 19th century dress|Staff and students of the École Niedermeyer, 1871. Messager is in the middle row, second from right; his teachers [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] and [[Eugène Gigout|Gigout]] are in the front row, second from left and furthest right, respectively.]]
In his 1991 study of Messager, John Wagstaff writes that the composer's music is notable for its fine orchestration, easy-flowing melody, and skilfully written music, dance-like in character. Unlike his teacher Fauré,&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Messager enjoyed orchestrating. He said that musical ideas came to him "already clothed in the appropriate instrumental shades",&lt;ref name=h128&gt;Hughes, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; and after the concentrated effort of composing his scores he found it relaxing to work on "the handling of instruments, the balancing of different sonorities, the grouping of colours and the structuring of effects".&lt;ref name=hu129&gt;Hughes, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked that composers who had their music orchestrated by assistants presumably did not care if their helpers lacked "that indefinable sixth sense which would indicate the right combination of sonorities to carry out the original intentions of the composer". To Messager, passages often depended for their significance or flavour on the orchestral writing alone.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gervase Hughes]], in a study of French opérette, comments that Messager's only technical defect was "one all too common to many composers of operetta – too close an adherence to repetitive rhythmic figures and four-bar rigidity", although such was Messager's "innate artistry that criticism on that score would be academic pedantry".&lt;ref name=hu99/&gt; One of the composer's distinguishing characteristics was a liking for [[chromaticism]];&lt;ref name=ha127&gt;Harding, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; this appealed to a younger generation of composers. His "Eh que ne parliez-vous?", from ''La Basoche'', was quoted note-for-note by [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] in ''[[Les Mamelles de Tirésias]]''.&lt;ref name=ha127/&gt; Although Messager greatly admired Wagner, and was a celebrated conductor of his music, he distanced himself from Wagnerian influences in his own compositions. In ''Madame Chrysanthème'' he made use of [[leitmotif]]s, and included other references to Wagner, but such examples are rare in his works.&lt;ref name=w17&gt;Wagstaff, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballets apart, Messager composed thirty works for the stage; they fall into several different, or sometimes overlapping, genres; the most numerous are opéras comiques (9), opérettes (7) and comédies musicales (3).{{refn|There is no universally agreed dividing line between opéra comique and opérette; a 2003 study of opera suggests that the latter is essentially frivolous, and the former, though often (but not always) humorous, also has some element of genuine human interest and is seen as of loftier artistic intent.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree that opérette is "essentially" frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, "Introduction", second and third unnumbered pages.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The composer remarked late in his career:
{{quote|I have never intended to write what is nowadays called "opérette". This designation – which all too often has pejorative overtones – seems to have become common since the work of [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]. Many of my works&amp;nbsp;... were only called operéttes at the request of theatre directors who saw in that term some extra chance of success. Neither did I wish to compose [[opéra-bouffe]]s, the best examples of which were provided by the works of [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], where the element of parody is very dominant. My idea was always to continue the tradition of French opéra-comique (with dialogue) as established by [[opéra comique|Dalayrac]], [[François-Adrien Boieldieu|Boieldieu]] and [[Daniel Auber|Auber]].&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in English in Wagstaff, p. 164. Original French version published in Rohozinski, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

===Early stage works===

Although Messager called some of his early stage works opéras comiques they have, Gervase Hughes suggests, more in common with opérette than their composer acknowledged. Nevertheless, Messager introduced adventurous modern harmonic details in his early pieces, and strove to raise the artistic standards of opérette to that of opéra comique while retaining the essential panache of the genre.&lt;ref name=h94&gt;Hughes, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes finds the first stage works uneven in quality but ''[[La fauvette du temple|La Fauvette du temple]]'' (1884) to contain two fine expressive duets as well as waltzes and polkas with "an Offenbach lilt".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes judges the next two scores, ''[[La Béarnaise]]'' and ''La Fauvette'' (both 1885), less satisfying but nonetheless at least as good as anything by Messager's older contemporaries [[Robert Planquette|Planquette]], [[Gaston Serpette|Serpette]] and [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]].&lt;ref name=h93&gt;Hughes, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagstaff writes that the composer's most enduring work is the ballet score ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'' (1886).&lt;ref name=wv/&gt; The piece is based on the fable ''[[The Two Pigeons]]'' by [[Jean de La Fontaine]].&lt;ref name=harding124/&gt; The music is best known in the five-movement suite arranged from the full score, which includes the "Entrée de tziganes".&lt;ref name=DeuxROH&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/articles/rhapsody-the-two-pigeons-digital-programme-the-two-pigeons-production-photographs "The Two Pigeons"] {{webarchive| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317170225/http://www.roh.org.uk/articles/rhapsody-the-two-pigeons-digital-programme-the-two-pigeons-production-photographs |date=17 March 2018}}, Royal Opera House, accessed 17 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Messager revived the ballet in 1906 in London and in 1912 in Paris in a shortened, two-act version.&lt;ref&gt;Pougin, Arthur. Review in ''Le Ménéstrel Musique et Théatres'', 30 March 1912&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 [[John Lanchbery]] revised this for [[Frederick Ashton]]'s new version of the ballet, with a closing reconciliation scene from earlier music and a passage transcribed from ''Véronique''. This was first given at Covent Garden, is revived regularly by the [[Royal Ballet]] and has been staged by such other companies as [[CAPAB]] and [[Australian Ballet]].&lt;ref name=DeuxROH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, pp. 315 and 487&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Isoline (opera)|Isoline]]'' (1888), a musical fairy story ("conte des fées"), is neither an opérette nor an opéra comique. Writing in 1908, Fauré called it "one of the most poetic, most expressive works that have been written in France in the last twenty years",&lt;ref name=fauré&gt;''Quoted'' in Duteurtre, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; but it made little impact. The score remained in obscurity until 1930 when [[Reynaldo Hahn]] staged the ballet section of the work at Cannes.&lt;ref name=h125/&gt; The whole piece was revived at the Opéra-Comique in 1958; it failed again, but the ballet, unencumbered by the portentousness of the libretto, which weighs down the rest of the piece, has remained in the repertory.&lt;ref name=h125&gt;Harding, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In the discography section of his book on Messager, Wagstaff lists 13 recordings of the ballet music.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

===1890s stage works===
[[File:La-Basoche-Pick-Me-Up-1891.jpg|thumb|left|alt=black and white drawing of a stage scene showing a plaza with a man addressing a woman, both in aristocratic mediaeval costume|Scene from ''[[La Basoche]]'']]
The decade began well for Messager with the artistic and commercial success of ''[[La Basoche]]'' (1890). Février in his ''André Messager: Mon Maître, Mon Ami'' calls it "the last of the great nineteenth-century French comic operas" ("le dernier des grands opéras-comique français du XIX siècle")&lt;ref name=f49&gt;Février, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it of the greatest importance not only in Messager's career but in the history of French musical theatre.&lt;ref name=f49/&gt; Hughes says it has a good claim to be the composer's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=h93/&gt; The musicologist [[James Harding (music writer)|James Harding]] rates it "the best Messager had written to date&amp;nbsp;... one of his finest works".&lt;ref name=ha127/&gt; When the work was given in London, a year after its Parisian premiere, the reviewer in ''The Times'' called it, "A work of great beauty and charm", although "the influence of ''[[Die Meistersinger]]'' is felt to an extent that is almost absurd both in the bright overture and again in the procession of the guild, but elsewhere the music is as original as it is charming".&lt;ref&gt;"Royal English Opera", ''The Times'', 4 November 1891, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''[[Madame Chrysanthème (opera)|Madame Chrysanthème]]'' (1893), a four-act "lyric comedy" with no spoken dialogue, Messager reached a turning point in his development. The crux of the plot was the same as that later used by [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] for ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' (1904): a young Japanese [[geisha]] wooed and then abandoned by a foreign sailor.&lt;ref name=traubner213/&gt; Messager's treatment of the story was praised for its sensitivity – reviewers in the Parisian press applauded him for raising opérette to the level of "comédie lyrique"&lt;ref&gt;Février, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; – but he was a self-critical artist, and he felt he had strayed too far in the direction of opera and away from his chosen genre.&lt;ref name=h94/&gt; Harding suggests that the unusual seriousness of the score may be connected with the recent illness and death of Edith Messager.&lt;ref name=ha129&gt;Harding, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hughes and Harding comment that Messager's score is subtler than Puccini's,{{refn|Reviewing ''Madama Butterfly'' at the Opéra-Comique in December 1908, Fauré, whose view of Puccini's music was less favourable than it later became, made a plea for a revival of ''Madame Chrysanthème''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 299; and Wagstaff, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} but add that the almost total eclipse of ''Madame Chrysanthème'' by ''Madama Butterfly'' may be partly due to the relative effectiveness of their libretti.&lt;ref name=h130&gt;Harding, p. 130; and Hughes, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Messager's librettists ([[Georges Hartmann]] and Alexandre André) stuck closely to Loti's original with external local colour, whereas Puccini's, based on [[David Belasco]]'s stage play on the theme, added considerable extra incident to the mainly uneventful story, focusing on the private drama.&lt;ref name=h130/&gt;|group= n}} After this, Messager consciously simplified his style, greatly reducing the harmonic subtleties that had been characteristic of his earlier works.&lt;ref name=hu95&gt;Hughes, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The works from the middle of the decade were unsuccessful financially and artistically. ''[[Le chevalier d'Harmental|Le Chevalier d'Harmental]]'' (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first true opéra comique ("in a somewhat pretentious style") was a failure, and an unpretentious opérette in the same year, ''La Fiancée en loterie'', fared no better.&lt;ref name=hu95/&gt; After these disappointments Messager finished the 1890s with two considerable successes. Traubner describes ''Les P'tites Michu'' (1897) as "a sensational hit",&lt;ref name=t214&gt;Traubner, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; and Harding calls it the best of Messager's opérettes so far (classing ''Le Basoche'' as opéra comique, as did its composer).&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was not strikingly original: critics commented that its story of babies switched at birth was already very familiar from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.&lt;ref name=t214/&gt;{{refn|The device was a key plot point in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889).&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt; A similar plot device had earlier been used by Offenbach in ''[[L'île de Tulipatan]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Traubner describes the piece as "one of those unusual works that begin well enough and gets better and better".&lt;ref name=t214/&gt; Setting a scene in the market of [[Les Halles]] was not innovative, but Messager's chorus for the marchands and marchandes was out of the ordinary, and Traubner also singles out the duet for the Michus in Act 1: "clever, lilting&amp;nbsp;... pulsating with an elegance and grace that other operetta composers have failed to obtain".&lt;ref name=t214/&gt; He also judges the finales as outstanding, including a waltz number that in other hands would be predictable but is turned by Messager into something much more symphonic.&lt;ref name=t214/&gt;

The final work from the decade was ''Véronique''. Messager described it as an opéra comique, but commentators have classed it as a mixture of opérette and opéra comique.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 133; and Traubner, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The score contains two of the composer's best known numbers, the "Swing duet" ("Poussez, poussez l'escarpolette") and the "Donkey duet" ("De ci, de la").&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; When the work was revived at the [[the Proms|Proms]] in London in the 1960s, the music critic of ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Charming as it can prove in the theatre, the music alone is a little thin, with none of the piquancy that – thanks perhaps to Gilbert – redeems Messager's famous English contemporary Sullivan&amp;nbsp;... but ''Véronique'' has plenty of pretty things".&lt;ref&gt;"Véronique at the Proms", ''The Times'', 21 August 1967, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It became and has remained the composer's most performed musical theatre piece.&lt;ref name=wv&gt;Wagstaff, John.

Messager's work running opera houses in Paris and London limited his composing between ''Véronique'' and the period after the First World War. ''[[Fortunio (opera)|Fortunio]]'' (1907) was a rare example in his oeuvre of a [[sung-through]] opera. Eight decades later the critic [[Edward Greenfield]] described it as "a long-buried jewel of a piece&amp;nbsp;... an improbable cross between musical comedy and ''Tristan und Isolde''".&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "Fortunio smiles: uncovering a Messager gem of charm and romance", ''The Guardian'', 15 July 1988, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Unlike many of Messager's stage works, ''Fortunio'' was not seen in London shortly after the Parisian premiere: it was not given in Britain until 2001, when it was greeted as "an adorable blend of romanticism and Gallic cynicism" by ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', "a little-known delight" by ''The Times'', "pure joy" by ''[[The Independent]]'' and "tosh of the highest order" by ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Fortunio", ''The Guardian'', 14 July 2001, p. H17&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} From 1919 onwards Messager composed no more opéras comiques. Among his post-war stage works, ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'', a "romantic operetta" (1919), was his second work to an English libretto. French critics were inclined to look down on "Messager's English operetta" as over-sweet and sentimental to suit Anglo-Saxon tastes.&lt;ref name=h141&gt;Harding, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Harding comments that the composer was successful in his attempt to produce an English flavour: one number is "pure [[Edward German]]" and there is much pastiche throughout the score. Despite the critics the piece ran well not only in Britain and the US, but also in France, with more than 300 performances in Paris and a long life in French provincial theatres.&lt;ref name=h141/&gt;&lt;ref name=mbnote/&gt;

Of Messager's 1920s comédies musicales the best known is ''[[L'amour masqué|L'Amour masqué]]'' (1923). The [[Théâtre Édouard VII]] where it was premiered had a small orchestra pit, and Messager developed a new style of orchestration to deliver his desired musical effects with a small number of players. Harding comments that the piece was up-to-date enough to include a [[tango]], "a beautifully written example with luscious harmonies that by contrast show up the threadbare nature of most other efforts of the time".&lt;ref name=harding147&gt;Harding, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-stage works and role in French music===
[[File:André-Messager-c1888.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Head and shoulders photo of a youngish man with receding dark hair and large moustache, wearing striped suit|left|Messager in 1890]]
Messager wrote songs for solo voice with piano throughout his career. Like Fauré, he was fond of the poetry of [[Paul Armand Silvestre|Armand Sylvestre]], and from "La Chanson des cerises" in 1882 to the cycle ''Amour d'hiver'' in 1911 he set thirteen of Sylvestre's poems. Others whose verse he set ranged widely, from [[Victor Hugo]] to [[Frederic Weatherly]] (author of among other things "[[Danny Boy]]").&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In his old age Messager said that he would have liked to write more concert works, but had never had the opportunity.&lt;ref name=xd/&gt; The Symphony in A, written when he was 22, is on the normal classical plan with [[sonata form]] in the first and last movements, a songlike theme in the [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|adagio]] and a [[scherzo]] third movement. Looking back he described it as "très classique".&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; In notes to a 1992 recording of the piece, Xavier Deletang comments that although the influence of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and possibly [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] may be discernible, the work reveals a mastery of instrumentation and a quintessentially French flavour, particularly in the wind parts. The two main subjects of the Allegro ''con moto'' first movement are strongly contrasted, with the opening string theme followed by a chorale-like theme for the winds.&lt;ref name=xd&gt;Deletang, Xavier. Notes to Skarbo CD DSK 3921 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Messager was elected to membership of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1926 the influential musical journal ''[[Le Ménestrel]]'' remarked that this conferred on his chosen genre – opérette – official status and recognition;&lt;ref name=nytdeb&gt;"The Youthful Genius of Debussy", ''The New York Times'', 6 June 1926, p. X5&lt;/ref&gt; but his fame as a composer of light music has tended to obscure his considerable standing in contemporary serious musical circles. It was said of him that he had "seen all, heard all, and remembered all".&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The leading composers of the time valued his friendship and advice. Fauré called him "familiar with everything, knowing it all, fascinated by anything new".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Messager's younger colleague, the composer Reynaldo Hahn, wrote, "I do believe that no musician has ever loved music as much as André Messager did. In any case, it would be impossible to have a greater musical curiosity than he did, up to the end of his life, too."&lt;ref name=hahn&gt;Hahn, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Like Fauré, Messager wrote musical criticism for ''Le Figaro'' and other publications in the first decades of the 20th century. Unlike Fauré, who was known for his kindly reviews,&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, Jean-Michel. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09366 "Fauré, Gabriel (Urbain)"], ''Grove Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 7 April 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messager was frequently severe. His views carried weight: some of his criticisms were reported in the international press.&lt;ref&gt;"Events of Music Overseas", ''The New York Times'', 1 April 1923, p. X5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Fauré wrote of Messager, "There are not many examples in the history of music of an artist with such a complete education, of such profound knowledge, who consents to apply his gifts to forms regarded, nobody knows why, as secondary".&lt;ref name=fauré/&gt; ''[[Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]'' says of Messager, "His style may be described as enlightened eclecticism; his music was characteristically French, and more specifically Parisian, in its elegance and gaiety."&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; In his book ''Composers of Operetta'', Hughes comments that Messager combined "a flow of spontaneous melody worthy of Offenbach with a flair for economic workmanship at least the equal of Lecocq's" and in much of his music "a measure of Massenet's fluent grace, Saint-Saëns's aristocratic elegance, even Fauré's refined subtlety".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; He observes that Messager spanned an entire era: "Auber, [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] were still alive when he began his studies, yet he survived the First World War and witnessed the rise and decline of "[[les Six]]".&amp;nbsp;... For forty years he carried aloft the torch kindled by [[Adolphe Adam]] in 1834; after his death it soon flickered out".&lt;ref name=hu99&gt;Hughes, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conductor===
[[File:Messager-dirigeant-lorchestre-de-lOpéra.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=caricature of elderly man in evening dress conducting an orchestra|Messager conducting at the Opéra, 1908]]
The wide range of Messager's musical sympathies was noted by ''Le Menéstral'', which said that he "has served Wagner, Debussy, Fauré, Ravel and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] when their works were still struggling for recognition".&lt;ref name=nytdeb/&gt; He was widely admired as a conductor. He avoided extravagant gesturing on the podium; Harding records, "His manner was precise and undemonstrative. The baton flicked neatly here and there in a way that meant little to the audience behind him but conveyed volumes to the orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The music critic [[Pierre Lalo]] wrote that under Messager's direction, ''Parsifal'', without losing any of its grandeur, "assumed a French clarity, and a sobriety, nobility and order&amp;nbsp;... even the most famous Bayreuth conductors have not always been able to do this."&lt;ref&gt;Lalo, p. 146. ''Quoted'' in English in Wagstaff, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone shared Lalo's view; some audience members equated undemonstrativeness with dullness: Reynaldo Hahn commented, "[Messager] is not a master of the theatre ["chef du théâtre"], being too exclusively musical; he sets too much store by detail without feeling the spirit of the public behind him, and does not understand the variable musical flow that makes one hold one's breath, sigh and wait."&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wagstaff, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hahn admired Messager as an orchestral conductor:
&lt;blockquote&gt; André Messager is the most French of conductors; I mean that in this art he embodies sharpness. Grace and clarity are not uniquely French qualities: they are frequently found among the Italians and even some Germans. But sharpness is a French virtue, and nothing but French. M. André Messager has it to an exceptional degree, and it shows in how he writes, orchestrates, dresses, talks, and plays the piano. But it is when he conducts the orchestra that what one might call his organic sharpness shows itself most forcefully.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Reynaldo, in ''Musica'', September 1908, ''quoted'' in Duteurtre, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recordings===
In 1918 Messager conducted recordings in New York, with the [[Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire]], of ''Les Chasseresses'' and ''Cortège de Bacchus'' from ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' by [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]], Sérénade and Mules from ''Impressions d'Italie'' by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from ''Samson et Dalila'' and the Prelude to ''[[Le Déluge (Saint-Saëns)|Le Déluge]]'', both by Saint-Saëns, and 4½-minute extracts from ''[[Capriccio Espagnol|Capriccio espagnol]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and ''Le Rouet d'Omphale'' by Saint-Saëns.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, D. Kern.

[[File:Malagasy architectural map.gif|200px|thumb|alt=Map of Madagascar indicating the distribution of predominant construction material over the island|The distribution of traditional construction materials in Madagascar presents a predominance of earthen dwellings in the central Highlands and largely plant-based construction along the coasts, with intermediary zones making use of both material types.]]
The '''architecture of Madagascar''' is unique in Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the [[Bubungan Tinggi|construction norms and methods of Southern Borneo]] from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar are believed to have immigrated. Throughout [[Madagascar]] and the [[South Kalimantan|Kalimantan]] region of [[Borneo]], most traditional houses follow a rectangular rather than round form, and feature a steeply sloped, peaked roof supported by a central pillar.

Differences in the predominant traditional construction materials used serve as the basis for much of the diversity in Malagasy architecture. Locally available plant materials were the earliest materials used and remain the most common among traditional communities. In intermediary zones between the central highlands and humid coastal areas, hybrid variations have developed that use [[cob (material)|cob]] and sticks.  Wood construction, once common across the island, declined as a growing human population destroyed greater swaths of virgin rainforest for [[slash and burn]] agriculture and [[zebu]] cattle pasture. The [[Zafimaniry]] communities of the central highland montane forests are the only [[Malagasy people|Malagasy ethnic group]] who have preserved the island's original wooden architectural traditions; their craft was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] in 2003. As wood became scarce over time, wooden houses became the privilege of the noble class in certain communities, as exemplified by the homes of the Merina nobility in the 19th century [[Kingdom of Madagascar]]. The use of stone as a building material was traditionally limited to the construction of tombs, a significant feature of the cultural landscape in Madagascar due to the prominent position occupied by ancestors in Malagasy cosmology. The island has produced several distinct traditions in tomb architecture: among the [[Mahafaly]] of the southwest coast, the top of tombs may be stacked with the skulls of sacrificed zebu and spiked with ''[[aloalo]]'', decoratively carved tomb posts, while among the Merina, aristocrats historically constructed a small wooden house on top of the tomb to symbolize their ''andriana'' status and provide an earthly space to house their ancestors' spirits.

Traditional styles of architecture in Madagascar have been impacted over the past two hundred years by the increasing influence of European styles. A shift toward brick construction in the Highlands began during the reign of Queen [[Ranavalona II]] (1868–1883) based on models introduced by missionaries of the [[London Missionary Society]] and contacts with other foreigners. Foreign influence further expanded following the collapse of the monarchy and [[French Madagascar|French colonization]] of the island in 1896. Modernization over the past several decades has increasingly led to the abandonment of certain traditional norms related to the external orientation and internal layout of houses and the use of certain customary building materials, particularly in the Highlands. Among those with means, foreign construction materials and techniques – namely imported concrete, glass and wrought iron features – have gained in popularity, to the detriment of traditional practices.

== Origins ==
[[File:Rumah Bubungan Tinggi.jpg|thumb|alt=A large wooden house on high piles with a steeply sloping gabled roof |This house in South Kalimantan bears many of the iconic construction features brought from Borneo to Madagascar two thousand years ago: wood plank walls, piles to raise the house from the ground and a steeply sloping roof topped with crossed gable beams to form "roof horns."]]

== Plant-based construction ==

The vast majority of homes made of plant material are rectangular, low (one-story) houses with a peaked roof and are often built on low stilts.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  These architectural features are nearly identical to those found in parts of [[Architecture of Indonesia|Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Wake, C. Staniland." /&gt; Materials used for construction include [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] (near rivers), [[Juncaceae|rushes]] (in the southwest around [[Toliara]]), [[Didiereaceae|endemic succulents]] (as fencing in the south), wood (in the south and among the [[Zafimaniry]], and formerly common in the Highlands), [[bamboo]] (especially in the eastern [[rainforest|rain forests]]), [[papyrus]] (formerly in the Highlands around [[Alaotra|Lake Alaotra]]), grasses (ubiquitous), [[Arecaceae|palms]] (ubiquitous but prevalent in the west around [[Mahajanga]]) and [[raffia]] (especially in the north and northeast).&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

For much of the length of the eastern coast of Madagascar bordering the Indian Ocean, architecture is highly uniform: nearly all traditional homes in this region are built on low stilts and are roofed with [[thatch]] made of the fronds of the [[traveler's palm]] (''ravinala madagascariensis'').&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt; [[File:Bamboo House in Sambava Madagascar.JPG|200px|thumb|alt=Small, rectangular one-room house with walls and roof made of flattened bamboo|Woven bamboo walls, plank roofing]] The stilts, floor and walls are commonly made of the trunk of this same plant, typically after pounding it flat to make wide planks (for floors and roofing) or narrow strips (for walls). These strips are affixed vertically to the frame; the raffia plant is often used in the same way, in place of the traveler's palm, in the north.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt; When bamboo is used in place of ravinala, the long pounded sheets are often woven together to create walls with a checker-like pattern.&lt;ref name="Bloch"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bloch |first = Maurice | title = Placing the dead: tombs, ancestral villages and kinship organization in Madagascar |publisher = Berkeley Square House |location = London |year = 1971 |isbn =978-0-12-809150-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These traditional homes have no chimney. Their floor is covered in a woven mat with stones heaped in one corner where wood fires can be burnt to cook food; the smoke that accumulates blackens the ceiling and interior walls over time.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1940" /&gt; The doorways of these homes were traditionally left open or could be shut by a woven screen held closed with a leather strap;&lt;ref name="Chapman 1940" /&gt; today the entryway is frequently hung with a fabric curtain.&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book |last = Kottak |first = Conrad |title = Madagascar: Society and History |publisher = Carolina Academic Press |year = 1986 | isbn =978-0-89089-252-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations on this basic template can be found in all coastal regions using locally available material.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  The largest of the traditional coastal houses are found in the southeast among the [[Antemoro]], [[Tanala]] and [[Antefasy]] peoples, where homes can reach 18' long, 9' wide and 15' high.  Elsewhere along the coast homes are much smaller, averaging 10' long, 8' wide and 9' high.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

[[File:Villaggio Mahafaly.JPG|200px|thumb|left|alt=Small one-room rectangular house with walls made of twigs packed with earth|Lateral branches form the walls of traditional wooden Mahafaly houses in the southwest of Madagascar.]] It is believed that wood construction was formerly common in many parts of Madagascar but it has all but disappeared due to deforestation.&lt;ref name="Gade 1996" /&gt;  This is especially true in the Highlands where, until recently, wood had been a building material reserved for the [[andriana|aristocratic class]] due to its increasing rarity, leaving the lower classes to construct in other locally available materials such as reeds and grasses; sticks and branches are occasionally used where available, creating sporadic villages of wood typically within proximity to forest reserves.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  While the wooden architectural tradition among the aristocracy of the [[Merina]] has died out,&lt;ref name="Victor"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kus |first1 = Susan |last2 = Raharijaona |first2 = Victor | title = House to Palace, Village to State: Scaling up Architecture and Ideology |journal = American Anthropologist |series=New Series |issue = 102 |volume = 1 |pages = 98–113 |year = 2000 |doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.98}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least two ethnic groups can be said to have a continuing tradition of plank wood architecture: the [[Zafimaniry]] in the central Highlands, and the [[Antandroy]] in the far south. Each of these three traditions is described below.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

=== Merina aristocratic tradition ===
Among the Merina of the central Highlands, the Temanambondro ([[Antaisaka]]) people of the southeastern [[Manambondro]] region, and several other ethnic groups, deforestation rendered wood a valuable construction material only to be used by aristocrats.&lt;ref name="modern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gade 1996" /&gt;  Indeed, its traditional association with the royal ''andriana'' class led King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787–1810) to issue a royal edict forbidding construction in stone, brick or earth within the limits of [[Antananarivo]]&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt; and codifying a tradition in which only the houses of nobles were constructed from wood, while those of peasants were made from local plant materials.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last = Oliver |first = Samuel Pasfield | authorlink = Samuel Pasfield Oliver | title = Madagascar: an historical and descriptive account of the island and its former dependencies, Volume 2 |publisher = Macmillan |year = 1886 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lKtBAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition historically existed among a number of ethnic groups in Madagascar, particularly along the eastern coast where the preservation of rainforests continues to facilitate access to wood for construction.&lt;ref name="modern" /&gt;

Note the long ''tandrotrano'' extending past the roofline.]]
Traditional peasants' houses throughout Imerina featured a thick central pillar (''andry'') that supported the roof beam and a smaller upright beam at each corner extending into the ground to stabilize the structure.&lt;ref name="Victor" /&gt;  Unlike most coastal houses, Highland homes have never been raised on stilts but have always sat flush to the ground.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  To the south of the central pillar, in the area designated for sleeping and cooking, wooden or bamboo planks were occasionally installed for flooring, or woven mats were laid on the packed earth floor, which extended north past the pillar. Traditionally, the bed of the head of the family was in the southeast corner of the house.&lt;ref name="Victor" /&gt;  The northern area was distinguished by the hearth, delineated by three oblong stones set vertically into the ground. Houses and tombs were aligned on a north-south axis with the entrance on the west face.&lt;ref name="Nativel"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nativel | first = Didier | title = Maisons royales, demures des grands à Madagascar | publisher = Karthala Editions| year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8IOZLvSrspIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = December 1, 2010 | isbn =978-2-84586-539-6|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The north portion of the house was reserved for males and guests, while the south was for women, children and those of inferior rank. The northeast corner was sacred, reserved for prayer and offerings of tribute to the ancestors.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;

The houses of the nobles were constructed according to these same cultural norms, with several additions.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;  They were distinguishable from the outside by their walls made of upright wooden planks and the long wooden horns (''tandrotrano'') formed by the crossing of the roof beams at each end of the roof peak.  The length of the ''tandrotrano'' was indicative of rank: the longer the length, the higher the status of the noble family that lived within.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; The interior of the building was also somewhat modified, often featuring three central pillars rather than one and occasionally a wooden platform bed raised high off the ground.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;

After Andrianampoinimerina's edicts regarding construction materials in the capital were revoked in the late 1860s,&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; wooden construction was all but abandoned in Imerina and older wooden houses were rapidly replaced with new brick homes inspired by [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] missionaries' British-style dwellings.&lt;ref name="Gade 1996" /&gt;  The ''tandrotrano'' horns were gradually replaced by a simple decorative finial installed at the two ends of the roof peak.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  Other architectural norms such as the north-south orientation, central pillar and interior layout of homes were abandoned, and the presence of finials on roof peaks is no longer indicative of a particular social class.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;  Classic examples of Highland wooden architecture of the aristocratic class were preserved in the buildings of the [[Rova of Antananarivo|Rova compound of Antananarivo]] (destroyed in a fire in 1995 but under reconstruction)&lt;ref name="Trano manara"&gt;{{cite book |last = Frémigacci |first = Jean |title = Histoire d'Afrique |contribution = Le Rova de Tananarive: Destruction d'un lieu saint ou constitution d'une référence identitaire? | editor-last = Chrétien | editor-first = Jean-Pierre | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EwjjGtHsaZsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages = 421–444 | accessdate = December 1, 2010 | publisher = Editions Karthala | year = 1999 | isbn =978-2-86537-904-0|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the walled compound at [[Ambohimanga]], location of the wooden palaces of King Andrianampoinimerina and [[Ranavalona I|Queen Ranavalona I]].

=== Zafimaniry traditions ===
[[File:Zafimaniry Village Madagascar.jpg|200px|thumb|left|alt=Several large decoratively carved houses with peaked roofs made entirely of fitted wooden planks|The Zafimaniry construct wooden houses with solid doors and shuttered windows.]]
The Zafimaniry inhabit the heavily forested, rainy and temperate region of the Highlands to the east of [[Ambositra]].  Their homes are rectangular and large (15' long, 12' wide and 18' high) with a peaked roof, overhanging eaves, and wooden windows and doors.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  Many of the same standards found in the aristocratic architectural traditions of Imerina are present in the Zafimaniry structures, including the central wooden pillar supporting the roof beam, exclusive use of a [[tongue and groove]] joining technique and the orientation of building features such as windows, doors and the interior layout.&lt;ref name="Zafimaniry"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bloch |first = Maurice |title = About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond | contribution = The Resurrection of the House Amongst the Zafimaniry of Madagascar| editor1-last = Carsten | editor1-first = Janet |editor2-last = Hugh-Jones | editor2-first = Stephen | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AW8JczneTwoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = December 1, 2010 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |pages=69–83 |year = 1995 |isbn =978-0-521-47953-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zafimaniry houses are often elaborately decorated with carved, symmetrical, abstract patterns that are rich in complex spiritual and mythological symbolism.&lt;ref name="Zafimaniry" /&gt;  The architecture of the houses found in this region are considered to be representative of the architectural style that predominated throughout the Highlands prior to deforestation, and as such, they represent the last vestiges of a historic tradition and a significant element of Malagasy cultural heritage.  For this reason, the woodcrafting knowledge of the Zafimaniry was added in 2003 to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref name="Zafimaniry" /&gt;

=== Antandroy traditions ===
By contrast, the Antandroy inhabit the [[Madagascar spiny thickets]], an extremely dry and hot region in the south of Madagascar where unique forms of drought-resistant plants have evolved and thrived.  Their homes are traditionally square (not rectangular), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt; These homes traditionally had no windows and featured three wooden doors: the front door was the women's entrance, the door at the rear of the house was for children, and the third door was used by the men.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1940"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chapman | first = Olive | title = Primitive tribes in Madagascar | journal = The Geographical Journal | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–25 | year = 1940 | doi = 10.2307/1788495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fences are often constructed around Antandroy houses using [[Opuntia|prickly-pear cactus]] (''raketa'') or lengths of [[Didiereaceae|indigenous succulents]] from the surrounding spiny forests.&lt;ref name="Linton"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Linton | first = Ralph | title = Culture Areas in Madagascar | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 363–390 | year = 1928 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1928.30.3.02a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the central Highlands, power struggles between the Merina and [[vazimba]] principalities and later amongst Merina principalities over the centuries inspired the development of the fortified town in Imerina, the central region of the Highlands of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="Sibree"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sibree | first = James | title = Madagascar before the conquest | publisher = T.

Foreigners were responsible for several architectural innovations that blended the traditions of Highlands architecture with European sensibilities.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;  In 1819, Louis Gros designed the Tranovola for [[Radama I]] in the Rova complex, introducing the wraparound veranda supported by exterior columns.  Jean Laborde designed the Queen's Palace in the Rova (built 1839–1841) using this same model on an even grander scale by enlarging the building and adding a third-story veranda.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt;  The new wooden buildings constructed by Gros and Laborde transformed the ''tandrotrano'' of traditional aristocratic Merina homes into the a decoratively carved post affixed at each end of the gable peak.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

=== Local innovations ===
[[File:Ambalavao house.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Two-story brick house with peaked roof and simple second-floor covered veranda supported by four equidistant pillars |Typical brick houses with columns and west-facing veranda, near Antananarivo]]
In 1867, restrictions were relaxed on the aristocracy's use of stone and brick as building materials, before all restrictions on construction were abolished in 1869 by Queen [[Ranavalona II]], who had already commissioned Jean Laborde in 1860 to encase the exterior of her wooden palace at the Rova in stone.  The building took its final form in 1872 after James Cameron added stone towers to each corner of the palace.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt; The queen converted to Christianity in 1869 and that same year the London Missionary Society commissioned James Cameron to construct a private home for its missionaries.  He drew his inspiration from the work of Gros and Laborde to develop a multi-story wooden house with veranda and columns.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  This model exploded in popularity throughout Antananarivo and surrounding areas as an architectural style for the aristocracy, who had to that point continued to inhabit simple homes similar to the wooden palace of Andrianampoinimerina at [[Ambohimanga]]. These newly favored brick houses often featured shortened ''tandrotrano'' and elaborately carved verandas.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt; These homes can naturally range in color from deep red to almost white depending on the characteristics of the earth used in its construction.&lt;ref name="Bradt"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradt |first1=Hilary |last2= Austin |first2=Daniel |title=Madagascar |edition=9th |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |year=2007 |location=Guilford, CT |isbn=978-1-84162-197-5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vyNVb2q0RisC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, and particularly with the [[French Madagascar|colonization of Madagascar]] by the French, these earthen houses (known as ''trano gasy'' – "Malagasy house") underwent constant evolution.&lt;ref name="Testa, J.P."&gt;{{cite news|last=Andriamihaja |first=Nasolo Valiavo |title=Habitat traditionnel ancien par JP Testa (1970), Revue de Madagascar: Evolution syncrétique depuis Besakana jusqu'au trano gasy |newspaper=L'Express de Madagascar |location=Antananarivo |date=July 5, 2006 |url=http://www.madatana.com/article-trano-gasy.php |accessdate=December 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vm8o1KK7?url=http://www.madatana.com/article-trano-gasy.php |archivedate=January 16, 2011 |language=fr |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The simplest form of earthen house is one or more stories tall, rectangular, and features a thatched roof with slightly overhanging eaves to direct rain away from the foundation and thereby prevent its erosion.  Wealthier families replace the thatch with clay roofing tiles and construct a veranda on the west face of the building supported by four slender equidistant columns; this design is even more effective at protecting the building's foundations from the eroding effects of rainfall.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  Further expansion often entails the enclosure of the western veranda in wood and the construction of an open veranda on the eastern face of the building, and so forth, leading to wrap-around verandas, the connection of two separate buildings with a covered passage, the incorporation of French wrought-iron grills or glass panels into verandas, the application of painted concrete over the brick surface and other innovations.&lt;ref name="Testa, J.P." /&gt;  In suburban and rural zones, the ground floor of the ''trano gasy'' is often reserved as a pen for livestock, while the family inhabits the upper floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mouchet | first1 = Jean | last2 = Carnevale | first2 = Pierre |last3 = Manguin | first3 = Sylvie |title = Biodiversity of malaria in the world | publisher = John Libbey Eurotext | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hSUfzyxZRuwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page = 174 | accessdate = December 1, 2010 | isbn =978-2-7420-0616-8 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entrance typically faces west; the kitchen is often to the south, while the family sleeps in the northern part of the building.

== Mixed cob construction ==
On the eastern side of Madagascar, there is virtually no zone of transition between the earthen houses of the Highlands and the dwellings made of plant materials common to the coastal regions.  In the vast and sparsely populated expanses between the Highlands and the western coastal areas, however, inhabitants utilize locally available materials to construct dwellings that bear features of both regions.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;  Most often houses are small – one room and only one story high – constructed of a skeleton of horizontally arranged sticks affixed to the wooden house frame as pictured in the preceding section on wooden construction.  But unlike coastal homes where this stick skeleton would serve as a base for affixing plant material to form walls, earthen cob may be packed into the framework instead.  The roof is thatched to complete the dwelling.  These intermediary houses are also often distinguished by the presence of shortened Highlands-style wooden columns on the western face to support the elongated eave of the peaked roof, much as they support the verandas of the larger homes of Imerina.  The floor is typically packed dirt and may be covered with woven mats of grasses or raffia.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

== Tomb construction ==
According to the traditional beliefs of many Malagasy ethnic groups, one attains the status of "ancestor" after death.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt;  It is often believed that ancestors continue to watch over and shape events on Earth and can intervene on behalf of (or interfere with) the living.  As a consequence, ancestors are to be revered: prayers and sacrifices to honor or appease them are common, as well as the observation of the local ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboos) the ancestors may have established in life. Gestures of respect, such as throwing the first capful of a new bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to share it with the ancestors, are practiced throughout the island.&lt;ref name="Nativel" /&gt; The most visible emblem of the respect due to ancestors is the construction of the elaborate family tombs that dot the countryside in much of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Campbell |first = Gwyn | title = The Structure of Trade in Madagascar, 1750–1810 |journal = The International Journal of African Historical Studies |issue = 26 |volume = 1 |pages = 111–148 |year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the majority of Malagasy ethnic groups did not construct solid tombs for their dead.  Rather, the bodies of the deceased were left in a designated natural area to decompose. Among the [[Bara people]] of the southern arid plains, for instance, tombs may be built into natural features such as rock outcroppings or hillsides by placing the bodies within and partially or entirely sealing the space with stacked stones or zebu skulls. Alternately, among the [[Tanala]], the deceased may be placed in coffins made from hollowed-out logs and left in caves or a sacred grove of trees, sometimes covered over by wooden planks held down by small piles of stones.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt; It is said the [[Vazimba]], the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar, submerged their dead in the waters of a designated bog, river, lake or estuary, which was thereby considered sacred for that purpose.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1940" /&gt; The practice also existed among the earliest Merina, who submerged their dead chiefs in canoes into Highland bogs or other designated  waters.&lt;ref name="Linton" /&gt; Where tombs were built, minor variation in form and placement from one ethnic group to the next is overshadowed by common features: the structure is partially or fully subterranean, typically rectangular in design and made of stone that is either stacked loosely or cemented with masonry. Among the Merina and [[Betsileo]], some early stone tombs and burial sites were indicated by upright, unmarked standing stones.&lt;ref name="Acquier, Jean-Louis" /&gt;

=== Islamic origins of tomb construction ===
The earliest known rectangular stone tombs on Madagascar were most likely built by Arab settlers around the 14th century in the northwestern part of the island.&lt;ref name="Vérin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vérin | first = Pierre  |title = The history of civilisation in North Madagascar | year = 1986 | isbn =978-90-6191-021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar models emerged later among western (i.e. [[Sakalava]], Mahafaly) and highlands (i.e. Merina, Betsileo) peoples, first using unhewn stones and heaped or packed earth before transitioning toward masonry.&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bird | first = Randall |journal=African Arts |title=The Merina landscape in early 19th century highlands Madagascar | date = Winter 2005 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=18–23, 91–92 |jstor=20447730 | doi=10.1162/afar.2005.38.4.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Highlands, the transition to masonry was preceded by the construction of tombs from massive stone slabs collectively hauled by community members to the tomb site. Late 18th century Merina king Andrianampoinimerina is said to have encouraged the construction of such tombs, observing "A house is for a lifetime but a tomb is for eternity."&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt;

=== Highlands traditions ===

}}
In the Highlands of Imerina, the above-ground entrances of ancient tombs were originally marked by standing stones and the walls were formed of loosely stacked flat stones.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt; Examples of these ancient tombs can be found at some of the [[twelve sacred hills of Imerina]]. Where a body was not able to be retrieved for burial (as in times of war), a tall, unmarked standing stone (''vatolahy'', or "male stone") was sometimes traditionally erected in memory of the deceased.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt;
Andrianampoinimerina promoted more elaborate and costly tomb construction as a worthy expense for honoring one's ancestors. He also declared that the highest Merina ''andriana'' (noble) sub-castes would enjoy the privilege of constructing a small house on top of a tomb to distinguish them from the tombs of lower castes.&lt;ref name="Trano manara" /&gt;  The two highest ''andriana'' sub-castes, the ''Zanakandriana'' and the ''Zazamarolahy'', built tomb houses called ''trano masina'' ("sacred house"), while the tomb houses of the ''Andriamasinavalona'' were called ''trano manara'' ("cold house"). These houses were identical to standard wooden nobles' houses except for the fact that they had no windows and no hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Van Gennep | first = Arnold | title = Tabou et totémisme à Madagascar: étude descriptive et théorique | publisher = Ernest Leroux Editeur | year = 1904 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=koESAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages = 126–127 | accessdate = December 1, 2010|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Lamba (garment)|lamba]]-wrapped remains were laid to rest on stone slabs in the tomb below, the deceased's valuable possessions such as gold and silver coins, elegant silk lambas, decorative objects and more were placed in the ''trano masina'' or ''trano manara'', which was often decorated much like a regular room with comfortable furniture and refreshments such as rum and water for the deceased's spirit to enjoy.  The ''trano masina'' of King Radama I, which burned with other structures in the 1995 fire at the Rova palace compound in Antananarivo, was said to be the richest known.&lt;ref name="Trano manara" /&gt;

Today, tombs may be constructed using traditional methods and materials or incorporate modern innovations such as concrete.&lt;ref name="Concrete"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vogel | first = Claude | title = Les quatre-mères d'Ambohibaho: étude d'une population régionale d'Imerina (Madagascar) | publisher = Selaf | year = 1982 | isbn =978-2-85297-074-8|language=fr}}&lt;!--|accessdate = December 1, 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Inside, superimposed slabs of stone or concrete line the walls.  The bodies of the ancestors of an individual family are wrapped in silk shrouds and laid to sleep on these slabs.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt; Among the Merina, Betsileo and Tsihanaka, the remains are periodically removed for the [[famadihana]], a celebration in honor of the ancestors, wherein the remains are re-wrapped in fresh shrouds amid extravagant communal festivities before being once again laid to rest in the tomb.  The significant expense associated with tomb construction, funerals and reburial ceremonies honors the ancestors even as it counters the emergence of unequal wealth distribution in traditional communities.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;
[[File:Mahafaly tomb painted carved south Madagascar.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Low rectangular tomb carved and painted with geometric shapes |Mahafaly tomb with traditional painted decoration]]

=== Southern and western traditions ===
The tombs found in the southwest of Madagascar are among the most striking and distinctive.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufmann | first1 = J.C. | year = 2000 | title = Forget the Numbers: The Case of a Madagascar Famine | url = | journal = History in Africa | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 143–157 | doi=10.2307/3172111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like those in the Highlands they are generally rectangular and partially subterranean; modern tombs may incorporate concrete in addition to (or in place of) traditional stone.  They are distinguished from Highlands tombs by their elaborate decoration: images may be painted on the exterior of the tomb, recalling events in an ancestor's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Australian Museum |title=Burial – Madagascar |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Burial-Madagascar |accessdate=December 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vm95CxzM?url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Burial-Madagascar |archivedate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The roof of the tomb may be stacked with the horns of [[zebu]] sacrificed in the ancestor's honor at their funeral, and numerous [[aloalo]]—wooden funerary posts carved with symbolic patterns or images representing events in the life of the deceased—may be planted on top.  The tombs of the Mahafaly people are especially famed for this type of construction.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann" /&gt;  Among the Sakalava of the western coast, aloalo may be topped with erotic carvings evocative of the cycle of birth, life and death.&lt;ref name="Sibree" /&gt;

== Modern architecture ==
Foreign architectural influences, having arisen through increased European contact over the course of the 19th century, intensified dramatically with the advent of French colonization in 1896.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thomas | first = Philip | title = Conspicuous Construction: Houses, Consumption and 'Relocalization' in Manambondro, Southeast Madagascar | journal = The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 425–446 | date = September 1998 | doi = 10.2307/3034155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the past several decades, the increasing availability of relatively inexpensive modern construction materials imported from China and elsewhere has further reinforced a growing trend in urban areas away from traditional architectural styles in favor of more durable but generic structures using industrially produced materials such as concrete and sheet metal.&lt;ref name="Testa, J.P." /&gt; Certain modern innovations may be more highly esteemed than others. In the Manambondro region, for instance, corrugated sheet metal roofing was typically the least expensive and prestigious and most common addition to a traditional house. The replacement of locally sourced wood frames with factory-milled lumber was the next most common house modification, followed by the laying of a concrete foundation. Houses built entirely of concrete with glass windows and imported decorative balcony railings and window bars implied great wealth and the highest social status. Although low income levels have served to preserve traditional construction among the majority of the population of Madagascar, due to the prestige associated with modern architectural innovations, traditional construction is often abandoned as income increases.&lt;ref name="modern" /&gt;

A limited number of recently constructed homes in Antananarivo attempt to blend Malagasy architectural traditions with the comforts of modern house construction. These hybrids resemble traditional brick Highlands houses from the exterior, but use modern materials and construction techniques to efficiently incorporate electricity, plumbing, air conditioning and current kitchen features in a fully contemporary interior. This innovation is exemplified in the recent residential development at "Tana Water Front" in the Ambodivona district of downtown Antananarivo.&lt;ref name="Testa, J.P." /&gt;

The '''Art Gallery of South Australia''' (AGSA), located on the cultural [[boulevard]] of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] in [[Adelaide]], is one of three significant visual arts museums in the [[Australia]]n state of [[South Australia]]. It has a collection of over 38,000 works of art,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/About/visit.html Art Gallery of South Australia &gt; Visit] Retrieved 20 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; making it, after the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], the second largest state art collection in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archmedia.com.au/aa/aaissue.php?issueid=199605&amp;article=1&amp;typeon=1&amp;highlight=Adelaide Adelaide: Art Gallery of SA Extensions], ''Architecture Australia'', May/June 1996. Accessed on 2007-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was known as the National Gallery of South Australia until 1967 when the current name was adopted.

The Art Gallery is located adjacent to the [[State Library of South Australia]], the [[South Australian Museum]] and the [[University of Adelaide]]. AGSA is part of [[Adelaide]]'s North Terrace cultural precinct and had 712,994&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/About/docs/Annual_Report_2010_2011.pdf Annual Report of the Art Gallery of South Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; visitors in the year ended 30 June 2011. As well as its permanent collection, AGSA displays a number of visiting exhibitions each year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Exhibitions/|title=Art Gallery of South Australia :: Exhibitions :: Past Exhibitions|website=www.artgallery.sa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributes travelling exhibitions to regional galleries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Exhibitions/touring_exhibitions.html AGSA Touring Exhibitions 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103171644/http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Exhibitions/touring_exhibitions.html |date=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The gallery was established in 1881 and opened in two rooms of the public library by [[Prince Albert Victor]] and Prince George, later [[George V of Great Britain]]. The present building dates from 1900 and was extended in 1936 and 1962.&lt;ref name =C&amp;M&gt;Barbara Cooper and Maureen Matheson, ''The World Museums Guide'', McGraw-Hill, (1973) {{ISBN|9780070129252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent renovations and a significant extension of the building which opened in 1996 added contemporary display space without compromising the interior of the original Victorian building.

In 2016, the gallery participated in the large "Biennial 2016" art festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adelaidereview.com.au/arts/visual-arts/biennial-2016-a-thread-runs-through-it/ "Biennial 2016: A Thread Runs Through It"]. ''The Art Review'', May 10, 2016 by Annie van der Walt&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Art of the United Kingdom''' refers to all forms of visual art in or associated with the United Kingdom since the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 and encompass [[English art]], [[Scottish art]], [[Welsh art]] and [[Irish art]], and forms part of [[Western art history]]. During the 18th century Britain began to reclaim the leading place England had played in European art during the Middle Ages, being especially strong in portraiture and [[landscape art]]. Increasing British prosperity led to a greatly increased production of both [[fine art]] and the [[decorative arts]], the latter often being exported. The [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period resulted from very diverse talents, including the painters [[William Blake]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[John Constable]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. The Victorian period saw a great diversity of art, and a far larger quantity created than before. Much Victorian art is now out of critical favour, with interest concentrated on the Pre-Raphaelites and the innovative movements at the end of the 18th century.

The training of artists, which had long been neglected, began to improve in the 18th century through private and government initiatives, and greatly expanded in the 19th. Public exhibitions and the later opening of museums brought art to a wider public, especially in London. In the 19th century publicly displayed religious art once again became popular after a virtual absence since the [[Reformation]], and, as in other countries, movements such as the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and the [[Glasgow School]] contended with established [[Academic art]].

The British contribution to early [[Modernist art]] was relatively small, but since World War II British artists have made a considerable impact on [[Contemporary art]], especially with figurative work, and Britain remains a key centre of an increasingly globalized art world.

==Background==
[[File:Elizabeth I Unknown Artist 1570s.jpg|thumb|200px|Unknown artist, ''[[Portrait of Elizabeth I]]'', 1570s]] 
{{Main|English art|Irish art|Scottish art|Welsh art}}
The oldest surviving British art includes [[Stonehenge]] from around 2600 BC, and [[tin]] and [[gold]] works of art produced by the [[Beaker people]] from around 2150 BC.  The [[La Tène]] style of [[Celtic art]] reached the British Isles rather late, no earlier than about 400 BC, and developed a particular "Insular Celtic" style seen in objects such as the [[Battersea Shield]], and a number of bronze mirror-backs decorated with intricate patterns of curves, spirals and trumpet-shapes.  Only in the British Isles can Celtic decorative style be seen to have survived throughout the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]], as shown in objects like the [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] and the resurgence of Celtic motifs, now blended with Germanic [[interlace (art)|interlace]] and Mediterranean elements, in Christian [[Insular art]].  This had a brief but spectacular flowering in all the countries that now form the United Kingdom in the 7th and 8th centuries, in works such as the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]].  The Insular style was influential across Northern Europe, and especially so in later [[Anglo-Saxon art]], although this received new Continental influences.

The English contribution to [[Romanesque art]] and [[Gothic art]] was considerable, especially in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and monumental sculpture for churches, though the other countries were now essentially provincial, and in the 15th century Britain struggled to keep up with developments in painting on the Continent.  A few examples of top-quality English painting on walls or panel from before 1500 have survived, including the [[Westminster Retable]], [[The Wilton Diptych]] and some survivals from paintings in [[Westminster Abbey]] and the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 9–120, or see the references at the linked articles&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestant Reformation]]s of [[English Reformation|England]] and [[Scottish Reformation|Scotland]] were especially destructive of existing religious art, and the production of new work virtually ceased.  The [[Artists of the Tudor Court]] were mostly imported from Europe, setting a pattern that would continue until the 18th century.  The [[portraiture of Elizabeth I]] ignored contemporary European Renaissance models to create iconic images that border on [[naive art]].  The portraitists [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Anthony van Dyck]] were the most distinguished and influential of a large number of artists who spent extended periods in Britain, generally eclipsing local talents like [[Nicolas Hilliard]], the painter of [[portrait miniature]]s, [[Robert Peake the elder]], [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]], [[William Dobson]], and [[John Michael Wright]], a Scot who mostly worked in London.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Chapters 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape painting was as yet little developed in Britain at the time of the Union, but a tradition of [[marine art]] had been established by the [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son]] both called Willem van de Velde, who had been the leading Dutch maritime painters until they moved to London in 1673, in the middle of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called [[Acts of Union 1707]] came in the middle of the long period of domination in London of Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], a German portraitist who had eventually succeeded as principal court painter the Dutch Sir [[Peter Lely]], whose style he had adopted for his enormous and formulaic output, of greatly varying quality, which was itself repeated by an army of lesser painters.  His counterpart in Edinburgh, Sir [[John Baptist Medina]], born in Brussels to Spanish parents, had died just before the Union took place, and was one of the last batch of Scottish knights to be created.  Medina had first worked in London, but in mid-career moved to the less competitive environment of Edinburgh, where he dominated portraiture of the Scottish elite.  However, after the Union the movement was to be all in the other direction, and Scottish aristocrats resigned themselves to paying more to have their portraits painted in London, even if by Scottish painters such as Medina's pupil [[William Aikman (painter)|William Aikman]], who moved down in 1723, or [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 138–139; 151; 163&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an alternative, more direct, tradition in British portraiture to that of Lely and Kneller, tracing back to William Dobson and the German or Dutch [[Gerard Soest]], who trained [[John Riley (painter)|John Riley]], to whom only a few works are firmly attributed and who in turn trained [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]], a fine artist who trained [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]] who trained Joshua Reynolds and Joseph Wright of Derby.  Richardson also trained the most notable Irish portraitist of the period, [[Charles Jervas]] who enjoyed social and financial success in London despite his clear limitations as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 135–138; 147–150&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to the dominance of the "[[hierarchy of genres|lower genres]]" of painting was Sir [[James Thornhill]] (1675/76–1734) who was the first and last significant English painter of huge [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] allegorical decorative schemes, and the first native painter to be knighted.  His best-known work is at [[Old Royal Naval College|Greenwich Hospital]], [[Blenheim Palace]] and the [[cupola]] of [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, London]].  His drawings show a taste for strongly drawn realism in the direction his son-in-law [[William Hogarth]] was to pursue, but this is largely overridden in the finished works, and for Greenwich he took to heart his careful list of "Objections that will arise from the plain representation of [[Glorious Revolution#Invasion|the King's landing]] as it was in fact and in the modern way and dress" and painted a conventional Baroque glorification.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 131–133. The "objections" included that it was a dark night, the boat was small, the king not smartly dressed, and many of the nobles who accompanied him were by then out of favour.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Hogarth, he played the nationalist card in promoting himself, and eventually beat [[Sebastiano Ricci]] to enough commissions that in 1716 he and his team retreated to France, [[Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini]] having already left in 1713.  Once the other leading foreign painters of allegoric schemes, [[Antonio Verrio]] and [[Louis Laguerre]], had died in 1707 and 1721 respectively, Thornhill had the field to himself, although by the end of his life commissions for grand schemes had dried up from changes in taste.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 132–133; Pevsner, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1714 the new [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] conducted a far less ostentatious court, and largely withdrew from patronage of the arts, other than the necessary portraits.  Fortunately, the booming British economy was able to supply aristocratic and mercantile wealth to replace the court, above all in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 358-361&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Gate of Calais]]'', an anti-French satire by [[William Hogarth]], 1748]]

[[William Hogarth]] was a great presence in the second quarter of the century, whose art was successful in achieving a particular English character, with vividly moralistic scenes of contemporary life, full of both satire and pathos, attuned to the tastes and prejudices of the Protestant middle-class, who bought the [[engraving|engraved]] versions of his paintings in huge numbers. Other subjects were only issued as prints, and Hogarth was both the first significant British printmaker, and still the best known.  Many works were series of four or more scenes, of which the best known are: ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'' and ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' from the 1730s and ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' from the mid-1740s.  In fact, although he only once briefly left England and his own propaganda asserted his Englishness and often attacked the [[Old Master]]s, his background in [[printmaking]], more closely aware of Continental art than most British painting, and apparently his ability to quickly absorb lessons from other painters, meant that he was more aware of, and made more use of, Continental art than most of his contemporaries.

Like many later painters Hogarth wanted above all to achieve success at [[history painting]] in the [[Grand Manner]], but his few attempts were not successful and are now little regarded. His portraits were mostly of middle-class sitters shown with an apparent realism that reflected both sympathy and flattery, and included some in the fashionable form of the [[conversation piece]], recently introduced from France by [[Philippe Mercier]], which was to remain a favourite in Britain, taken up by artists such as [[Francis Hayman]], though usually abandoned once an artist could get good single figure commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 165; 168–179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teekanne Courtauld.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver teapot by Samuel Courtauld, London, 1748–49]]
There was a recognition that, even more than the rest of Europe given the lack of British artists, the training of artists needed to be extended beyond the workshop of established masters, and various attempts were made to set up [[academies]], starting with Kneller in 1711, with the help of Pellegrini, in Great Queen Street.  The academy was taken over by Thornhill in 1716, but seems to have become inactive by the time [[John Vanderbank]] and [[Louis Chéron]] set up their own academy in 1720.  This did not last long, and in 1724/5 Thornhill tried again in his own house, with little success. Hogarth inherited the equipment for this, and used it to start the [[St. Martin's Lane Academy]] in 1735, which was the most enduring, eventually being absorbed by the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.  Hogarth also helped solve the problem of a lack of exhibition venues in London, arranging for shows at the [[Foundling Hospital]] from 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish portraitist [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] worked in Edinburgh before moving to London by 1739.  He made visits of three years to Italy at the beginning and end of his career, and anticipated [[Joshua Reynolds]] in bringing a more relaxed version of "Grand Manner" to British portraiture, combined with very sensitive handling in his best work, which is generally agreed to have been of female sitters.  His main London rival in the mid-century, until Reynolds made his reputation, was Reynold's master, the stodgy [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 200-210&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wootton]], active from about 1714 to his death in 1765, was the leading sporting painter of his day, based in the capital of English [[horse racing]] at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], and producing large numbers of portraits of horses and also battle scenes and conversation pieces with a [[fox hunting|hunting]] or riding setting.  He had begun life as a page to the family of the [[Dukes of Beaufort]], who in the 1720s sent him to Rome, where he acquired a classicising landscape style based on that of [[Gaspard Dughet]] and [[Claude Lorraine|Claude]], which he used in some pure landscape paintings, as well as views of country houses and equine subjects.  This introduced an alternative to the various Dutch and Flemish artists who had previously set the prevailing landscape style in Britain, and through intermediary artists such as [[George Lambert (English painter)|George Lambert]], the first British painter to base a career on landscape subjects, was to greatly influence other British artists such as Gainsborough.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]] was the best of the native marine and townscape artists, though in the latter specialization he could not match the visiting [[Canaletto]], who was in England from nine years from 1746, and whose Venetian views were a favourite souvenir of the [[Grand Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 153–154, 157–160&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[antiquary]] and engraver [[George Vertue]] was a figure in the London art scene for most of the period, and his copious notebooks were adapted and published in the 1760s by [[Horace Walpole]] as ''Some Anecdotes of Painting in England'', which remains a principal source for the period.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;

From his arrival in London in 1720, the Flemish sculptor [[John Michael Rysbrack]] was the leader in his field until the arrival in 1730 of [[Louis-François Roubiliac]] who had a [[Rococo]] style which was highly effective in busts and small figures, though by the following decade he was also commissioned for larger works.  He also produced models for the [[Chelsea porcelain factory]] founded in 1743, a private enterprise which sought to compete with Continental factories mostly established by rulers. Roubiliac's style formed that of the leading native sculptor [[Sir Henry Cheere, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Cheere]], and his [[John Cheere|brother John]] who specialized in statues for gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Snowdin, 278-287, and see Index.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong London [[silversmithing]] trade was dominated by the descendants of [[Huguenot]] refugees like [[Paul de Lamerie]], [[Paul Crespin]], [[Nicholas Sprimont]], and the [[Louisa Courtauld|Courtauld family]], as well as [[Georges Wickes]].  Orders were received from as far away as the courts of Russia and Portugal, though English styles were still led by Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 100–106&lt;/ref&gt;  The manufacture of [[silk]] at [[Spitalfields]] in London was also a traditional Huguenot business, but from the late 1720s silk design was dominated by the surprising figure of [[Anna Maria Garthwaite]], a parson's daughter from [[Lincolnshire]] who emerged at the age of 40 as a designer of largely floral patterns in Rococo styles.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 214-215&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in France and Germany, the English adoption of the Rococo style was patchy rather than whole-hearted, and there was resistance to it on nationalist grounds, led by [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]] and [[William Kent]], who promoted styles in interior design and furniture to match the [[Palladianism]] of the architecture they produced together, also beginning the influential British tradition of the [[landscape garden]],&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), Chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] "the most influential of all English innovations in art".&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  The French-born engraver [[Hubert-François Gravelot]], in London from 1732 to 1745, was a key figure in importing Rococo taste in book illustrations and ornament prints for craftsmen to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 15–17; 29–31 and throughout.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern popular mind, English art from about 1750–1790 — today referred to as the "classical age" of English painting — was dominated by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]] (1723–1792), [[George Stubbs]] (1724–1806), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] (1727–1788) and [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (1734–1797).   At the time Reynolds was considered the dominant figure, Gainsborough was very highly reputed, but Stubbs was seen as a mere painter of animals and viewed as far a less significant figure than many other painters that are today little-known or forgotten. The period saw continued rising prosperity for Britain and British artists: "By the 1780s English painters were among the wealthiest men in the country, their names familiar to newspaper readers, their quarrels and cabals the talk of the town, their subjects known to everyone from the displays in the print-shop windows", according to [[Gerald Reitlinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 58 (quote), 59-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds returned from a long visit to Italy in 1753, and very quickly established a reputation as the most fashionable London portraitist, and before long as a formidable figure in society;, the public leader of the arts in Britain. He had studied both classical and modern Italian art, and his compositions discreetly re-use models seen on his travels. He could convey a wide range of moods and emotions, whether heroic military men or very young women, and often to unite background and figure in a dramatic way.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 217-230&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Wright of Derby]], ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'', 1768]]
The [[Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]] had been founded in 1754, principally to provide a location for exhibitions. In 1761 Reynolds was a leader in founding the rival [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], where the artists had more control.  This continued until 1791, despite the founding of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768, which immediately became both the most important exhibiting organization and the most important school in London.  Reynolds was its first President, holding the office until his death in 1792.  His published ''Discourses'', first delivered to the students, were regarded as the first major writing on art in English, and set out the aspiration for a style to match the classical grandeur of classical sculpture and [[High Renaissance]] painting.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 164–165, 225–227, and see Index.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Academy was established, Reynolds' portraits became more overly classicizing, and often more distant, until in the late 1770s he returned to a more intimate style, perhaps influenced by the success of [[Thomas Gainsborough]],&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 227-230&lt;/ref&gt; who only settled in London in 1773, after working in [[Ipswich]] and then [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].  While Reynolds' practice of aristocratic portraits seem exactly matched to his talents, Gainsborough, if not forced to follow the market for his work, might well have developed as a pure landscape painter, or a portraitist in the informal style of many of his portraits of his family.  He continued to paint pure landscapes for, largely for pleasure until his later years; full recognition of his landscapes came only in the 20th century. His main influences were French in his portraits and Dutch in his landscapes, rather than Italian, and he is famous for the brilliant light touch of his brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Chapter 18; Piper, 54-56; Mellon, 82&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] also became prominent in about 1770 and was active until 1799, though with a falling-off in his last years.  His portraits are mostly characterful but flattering images of dignified society figures, but he developed an obsession with the flighty young [[Emma Hamilton]] from 1781, painting her about sixty times in more extravagant poses.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 306-311&lt;/ref&gt;  His work was especially sought-after by American collectors in the early 20th century and many are now in American museums.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 84; Reitlinger, 434-437 with the remarkable numbers&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the period this generation had been succeeded by younger portraitists including [[John Hoppner]], [[Sir William Beechey]] and the young [[Gilbert Stuart]], who only realized his mature style after he returned to America.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt;

The Welsh painter [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]] returned to London from seven years in Italy in 1757, and over the next two decades developed a "sublime" landscape style adapting the Franco-Italian tradition of Claude and Gaspard Dughet to British subjects.  Though much admired, like those of Gainsborough his landscapes were hard to sell, and he sometimes resorted, as Reynolds complained, to the common strategem of turning them into [[history painting]]s by adding a few small figures, which doubled their price to about £80.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75; Waterhouse, 232-241&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to paint scenes set in Italy, as well as England and Wales, and his death in 1782 came just as large numbers of artists began to travel to Wales, and later the [[Lake District]] and Scotland in search of mountainous views, both for oil paintings and [[watercolour]]s which were now starting their long period of popularity in Britain, both with professionals and amateurs. [[Paul Sandby]], [[Francis Towne]], [[John Warwick Smith]], and [[John Robert Cozens]] were among the leading specialist painters and the clergyman and amateur artist [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]] was an important writer who stimulated the popularity of amateur painting of the [[picturesque]], while the works of [[Alexander Cozens]] recommended forming random ink blots into landscape compositions—even Constable tried this technique.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|[[John Singleton Copley]], ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778)]]
[[History painting]] in the grand manner continued to be the most prestigious form of art, though not the easiest to sell, and Reynolds made several attempts at it, as unsuccessful as Hogarth's.  The unheroic nature of modern dress was seen as a major obstacle in the depiction of contemporary scenes, and the Scottish gentleman-artist and art dealer [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] preferred classical scenes as well as painting some based on his Eastern travels, where his European figures by-passed the problem by wearing Arab dress.  He spent most of his adult life based in Rome and had at least as much influence on [[Neo-Classicism]] in Europe as in Britain.  The Irishman [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] was an influence on Blake but had a difficult career, and spent years on his cycle ''The Progress of Human Culture'' in the Great Room of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].  The most successful history painters, who were not afraid of buttons and wigs, were both Americans settled in London: [[Benjamin West]] and [[John Singleton Copley]], though one of his most successful works ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) was able to mostly avoid them, showing a rescue from drowning.  Smaller scale subjects from literature were also popular, pioneered by [[Francis Hayman]], one of the first to paint scenes from [[Shakespeare]], and [[Joseph Highmore]], with a series illustrating the novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]''.  At the end of the period the [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery]] was an ambitious project for paintings, and prints after them, illustrating "the Bard", as he had now become, and exposing the limitations of contemporary English history painting.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), 478-479; Waterhouse, Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] was mainly a portrait painter who also was one of the first artists to depict the [[Industrial Revolution]], as well as developing a cross between the conversation piece and history painting in works like ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768) and ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' (c. 1766), which like many of his works are lit only by candlelight, giving a strong [[chiaroscuro]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 332-342; Waterhouse, 285-289&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Blake - Nebuchadnezzar (Tate Britain).jpg|300px|left|thumb|[[William Blake]], ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (Blake)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'', after 1795]]
Paintings recording scenes from the theatre were another subgenre, painted by the German [[Johann Zoffany]] among others. Zoffany painted portraits and conversation pieces, who also spent over two years in India, painting the English [[Nawab#Nabob|nabobs]] and local scenes, and the expanding [[British Empire]] played an increasing role in British art.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 315-322&lt;/ref&gt;  Training in art was considered a useful skill in the military for sketch maps and plans, and many British officers made the first Western images, often in watercolour, of scenes and places around the world.  In India, the [[Company style]] developed as a hybrid form between Western and [[Indian art]], produced by Indians for a British market.

[[Thomas Rowlandson]] produced watercolours and prints satirizing British life, but mostly avoided politics. The master of the political [[caricature]], sold individually by print shops (often acting as publishers also), either hand-coloured or plain, was [[James Gillray]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 327-329&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on portrait-painting in British art was not entirely due to the vanity of the sitters. There was a large collector's market for portrait prints, mostly reproductions of paintings, which were often mounted in albums. From the mid-century there was a great growth in the expensive but more effective reproductions in [[mezzotint]], of portraits and other paintings, with special demand from collectors for early proof states "before letter" (that is, before the inscriptions were added), which the printmakers obligingly printed off in growing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 49, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

This period marked one of the high points in British decorative arts. Around the mid-century many [[porcelain]] factories opened, including [[Bow porcelain factory|Bow]] in London, and in the provinces [[Lowestoft#Lowestoft porcelain|Lowestoft]], [[Royal Worcester|Worcester]], [[Royal Crown Derby]], [[Liverpool porcelain|Liverpool]], and [[Wedgwood]], with [[Spode]] following in 1767. Most were started as small concerns, with some lasting only a few decades while others still survive today.  By the end of the period British porcelain services were being commissioned by foreign royalty and the British manufacturers were especially adept at pursuing the rapidly expanding international middle-class market, developing [[bone china]] and [[transfer-print]]ed wares as well as hand-painted true porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;snowdin, 236–242&lt;/ref&gt;

The three leading furniture makers, [[Thomas Chippendale]] (1718–1779), [[Thomas Sheraton]] (1751–1806) and [[George Hepplewhite]] (1727?–1786) had varied styles and have achieved the lasting fame they have mainly as the authors of pattern books used by other makers in Britain and abroad.  In fact it is far from clear if the last two named ever ran actual workshops, though Chippendale certainly was successful in this and in what we now call interior design; unlike France Britain had abandoned its [[guild]] system, and Chippendale was able to employ specialists in all the crafts needed to complete a redecoration.&lt;ref&gt;Snodin, 154–157&lt;/ref&gt;  During the period Rococo and [[Chinoiserie]] gave way to [[Neo-Classicism]], with the Scottish architect and interior designer [[Robert Adam]] (1728–1792) leading the new style.

Turner]] (1775–1851), the later two being arguably the most internationally influential of all British artists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6214553/JMW-Turners-feud-with-John-Constable-unveiled-at-Tate-Britain.html Stephen Adams, The Telegraph, September 22, 2009, ''JMW Turner's feud with John Constable unveiled at Tate Britain''] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6843533.ece Jack Malvern, The Sunday Times, September 22, 2009, ''Tate Britain exhibition revives Turner and Constable’s old rivalry''] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Turner's style, based on the Italianate tradition although he never saw Italy until in his forties, passed through considerable changes before his final wild, almost abstract, landscapes that explored the effects of light, and were a profound influence on the [[Impressionists]] and other later movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turner/gallery3d.htm Tate Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; Constable normally painted pure landscapes with at most a few genre figures, in a style based on Northern European traditions, but, like Turner, his "six-footers" were intended to make as striking an impact as any history painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/constableinfo.shtm ''Constable's Great Landscapes: The Six-Foot Paintings,'' National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC] Retrieved 9 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They were carefully prepared using studies and full-size [[oil sketch]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, 161–164; Mellon, 134; [http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate 2006 Constable exhibition] Tate Britain feature.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Turner was notorious for finishing his exhibition pieces when they were already hanging for show, freely adjusting them to dominate the surrounding works in the tightly-packed hangs of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's visionary style was a minority taste in his lifetime, but influenced the younger group of "[[Ancients (art group)|Ancients]]" of Samuel Palmer, [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]], [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]] and [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], who gathered in the country at [[Shoreham, Kent]] in the 1820s, producing intense and lyrical pastoral idylls in conditions of some poverty.  They went on to more conventional artistic careers and Palmer's early work was entirely forgotten until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 127–129&lt;/ref&gt; Blake and Palmer became a significant influence on modernist artists of the 20th century seen (among others) in the painting of British artists such as [[Dora Carrington]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BCduKb-ujO8C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=dora+carrington+and+blake&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zRujez6ton&amp;sig=5KCIez-7s2JfE4aPdpmj2vihl3U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bu3_TMzQNoGdlgfi2aHNCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dora%20carrington%20and%20blake&amp;f=false Dictionary of women artists] Retrieved 8 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker.

[[Thomas Lawrence]] was already a leading portraitist by the start of the 20th century, and able to give a Romantic dash to his portraits of high society, and the leaders of Europe gathered at the [[Congress of Vienna]] after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. [[Henry Raeburn]] was the most significant portraitist since the Union to remain based in Edinburgh throughout his career, an indication of increasing Scottish prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 96-98; Waterhouse, 330&lt;/ref&gt;  But [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] took the traditional road south, achieving great success with subjects of country life and hybrid [[genre painting|genre]] and history scenes such as ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'' (1822).&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Flaxman]] was the most thorough-going neo-classical English artist. Beginning as a sculptor, he became best known for his many spare "outline drawings" of classical scenes, often illustrating literature, which were reproduced as prints.  These imitated the effects of the classical-style reliefs he also produced.  The German-Swiss [[Henry Fuseli]] also produced work in a linear graphic style, but his narrative scenes, often from English literature, were intensely Romantic and highly dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Millais - Überfahrt nach Nordwest.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Everett Millais]], ''[[The North-West Passage]]'' (1878)]]

The [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] (PRB) achieved considerable influence after its foundation in 1848 with paintings that concentrated on religious, literary, and [[genre]] subjects executed in a colourful and minutely detailed style, rejecting the loose painterly brushwork of the tradition represented by "Sir Sloshua" Reynolds.  PRB artists included [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Ford Madox Brown]] (never officially a member), and figures such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[John William Waterhouse]] were later much influenced by aspects of their ideas, as was the designer [[William Morris]]. Morris advocated a return to hand-craftsmanship in the decorative arts over the industrial manufacture that was rapidly being applied to all crafts. His efforts to make beautiful objects affordable (or even free) for everyone led to his wallpaper and tile designs defining the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] aesthetic and instigating the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].

The Pre-Raphaelites, like Turner, were supported by the authoritative art critic [[John Ruskin]], himself a fine amateur artist. For all their technical innovation, they were both traditional and Victorian in their adherence to the [[history painting]] as the [[Hierarchy of genres|highest form of art]], and their subject matter was thoroughly in tune with Victorian taste, and indeed "everything that the publishers of steel engravings welcomed",&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 97&lt;/ref&gt; enabling them to merge easily into the mainstream in their later careers.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 139–146; Wilson, 79–81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leighton of Stretton, Frederick Leighton, Baron - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Lord Leighton]], 1855, ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna|Cimabue's celebrated Madonna is carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence]]'', 222 × 521 cm]]

While the Pre-Raphaelites had a turbulent and divided reception, the most popular and expensive painters of the period included [[Edwin Landseer]], who specialized in sentimental animal subjects, which were favourites of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. In the later part of the century artists could earn large sums from selling the reproduction rights of their paintings to print publishers, and works of Landseer, especially his ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|Monarch of the Glen]]'' (1851), a portrait of a Highland stag, were among the most popular. Like Millais' ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'' (1886) it was used on packaging and advertisements for decades, for brands of whisky and soap respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 149; Strong (1999), 540–541; Reitlinger, 97–99, 148–151 and elsewhere; he has detail throughout on reproduction rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late Victorian era in Britain the academic paintings, some enormously large, of [[Lord Leighton]] and the Dutch-born [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] were enormously popular, both often featuring lightly clad beauties in exotic or classical settings, while the allegorical works of [[George Frederic Watts|G.F. Watts]] matched the Victorian sense of high purpose.  The classical ladies of [[Edward Poynter]] and [[Albert Joseph Moore|Albert Moore]] wore more clothes and met with rather less success.

[[William Powell Frith]] painted highly detailed scenes of social life, typically including all classes of society, that include comic and moral elements and have an acknowledged debt to Hogarth, though tellingly different from his work.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 85; Bills, Mark, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8IPhEUcc3YC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Frith and the Influence of Hogarth''], in ''William Powell Frith: painting the Victorian age'', by Mark Bills &amp; [[Vivien Knight]], Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-12190-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12190-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all such artists the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] was an essential platform, reviewed at huge length in the press, which often alternated ridicule and extravagant praise in discussing works.  The ultimate, and very rare, accolade was when a rail had to be put in front of a painting to protect it from the eager crowd; up to 1874 this had only happened to Wilkie's ''[[Chelsea Pensioners]]'', Frith's ''[[The Derby Day]]'' and ''[[Salon d'Or, Homburg]]'' and Luke Filde's ''[[The Casual Ward]]'' (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 157; Wilson, 85; Frith's ''[[Salon d'Or, Homburg]]'' (1871), now [[Providence, Rhode Island]], is Frith's last great panorama, of the gambling at [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe|Homburg]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcnf5aTOkyEC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;l].&lt;/ref&gt;  A great number of artists laboured year after year in the hope of a hit there, often working in manners to which their talent was not really suited, a trope exemplified by the suicide in 1846 of [[Benjamin Haydon]], a friend of [[Keats]] and [[Dickens]] and a better writer than painter, leaving his blood splashed over his unfinished ''King Alfred and the First British Jury''.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

British history was a very common subject, with the Middle Ages, Elizabeth I, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and the [[English Civil War]] especially popular sources for subjects.  Many painters mentioned elsewhere painted historical subjects, including Millais (''[[The Boyhood of Raleigh]]'' and many others), Ford Madox Brown (''[[Cromwell on his Farm]]''), David Wilkie, Watts and Frith, and West, Bonington and Turner in earlier decades.  The London-based Irishman [[Daniel Maclise]] and [[Charles West Cope]] painted scenes for the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. [[Lady Jane Grey]] was, like Mary Queen of Scots, a female whose sufferings attracted many painters, though none quite matched ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'', one of many British historical subjects by the Frenchman [[Paul Delaroche]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1978), throughout. See Appendix I for a revealing full listing of pictures shown at the RA 1769–1904, analysed by subject&lt;/ref&gt;  Painters prided themselves on the increasing accuracy of their period settings in terms of costume and objects, studying the collections of the new [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and books, and scorning the breezy approximations of earlier generations of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1978), 47-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Redgrave - The Emigrants' Last Sight of Home.JPG|thumb|[[Richard Redgrave]], ''The Emigrants' Last Sight of Home'', 1858]]
Victorian painting developed the Hogarthian social subject, packed with moralizing detail, and the tradition of illustrating scenes from literature, into a range of types of genre painting, many with only a few figures, others large and crowded scenes like Frith's best-known works.  Holman Hunt's ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]'' (1853) and [[Augustus Egg]]'s set of ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]'' (1858) are of the first type, both dealing with "fallen women", a perennial Victorian concern.  As [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]] points out, these were paintings designed to be read like novels, whose meaning emerged after the viewer had done the work of deciphering it.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Peter. ''The Victorian Treasure House''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other "anecdotal" scenes were lighter in mood, tending towards being captionless ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons.

Towards the end of the 19th century the [[problem picture]] left the details of the narrative action deliberately ambiguous, inviting the viewer to speculate on it using the evidence in front of them, but not supplying a final answer (artists learned to smile enigmatically when asked).  This sometimes provoked discussion on sensitive social issues, typically involving women, that might have been hard to raise directly.  They were enormously popular; newspapers ran competitions for readers to supply the meaning of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[Orientalism]], though not as common as in France at the same period, had many specialists, including [[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for nine years in [[Cairo]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], a Scot who made lithographs of his travels in the Middle East and Italy, the nonsense writer [[Edward Lear]], a continual traveller who reached as far as [[Ceylon]], and [[Richard Dadd]]. Holman Hunt also travelled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to obtain authentic settings for his Biblical pictures.  The Frenchman [[James Tissot]], who fled to London after the fall of the [[Paris Commune]], divided his time between scenes of high society social events and a huge series of Biblical illustrations, made in watercolour for reproductive publication.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, 148–151&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Goodall]] specialized in scenes of Ancient Egypt.

A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]''. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."

Larger paintings concerned with the social conditions of the poor tended to concentrate on rural scenes, so that the misery of the human figures was at least offset by a landscape.  Painters of these included [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]], [[Luke Fildes]] (although he made his name in 1874 with ''[[Applicants for Admission to a Casual Ward]]''- see above), [[Frank Holl]], [[George Clausen]], and the German [[Hubert von Herkomer]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 89-91; Rosenthal, 144, 160–162; Reitlinger, 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Bell Scott]], a friend of the Rossettis, painted historical scenes and other types of work, but was also one of the few artists to depict scenes from heavy industry. His memoirs are a useful source for the period, and he was one of several artists to be employed for a period in the greatly expanded system of government art schools, which were driven by the administrator [[Henry Cole]] (the inventor of the [[Christmas card]]) and employed [[Richard Redgrave]], [[Edward Poynter]], [[Richard Burchett]], the Scottish designer [[Christopher Dresser]] and many others.  Burchett was headmaster of the "South Kensington Schools", now the [[Royal College of Art]], which gradually replaced the Royal Academy School as the leading British art school, though around the start of the 20th century the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] produced many of the forward-looking artists.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, 12-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Academy was initially by no means as conservative and restrictive as the [[Paris Salon]], and the Pre-Raphaelites had most of their submissions for exhibition accepted, although like everyone else they complained about the positions their paintings were given.  They were especially welcomed at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts]], one of the largest regional exhibiting organizations; the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] was founded in 1826 and opened its [[Royal Scottish Academy Building|grand new building]] in the 1850s.  There were alternative London locations like the [[British Institution]], and as the conservatism of the Royal Academy gradually increased, despite the efforts of [[Lord Leighton]] when President, new spaces opened, notably the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in [[Bond Street]], from 1877, which became the home of the Aesthetic Movement. The [[New English Art Club]] exhibited from 1885 many artists with Impressionist tendencies, initially using the [[Egyptian Hall]], opposite the Royal Academy, which also hosted many exhibitions of foreign art. The American portrait painter [[John Singer Sargent]] (1856–1925), spent most of his working career in Europe and he maintained his studio in London (where he died) from 1886 to 1907.

[[Alfred Sisley]], who was French by birth but had British nationality, painted in France as one of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]; [[Walter Sickert]] and [[Philip Wilson Steer]] at the start of their careers were also strongly influenced, but despite the dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] bringing many exhibitions to London, the movement made little impact in England until decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 57-62; Wilson, 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;  Some members of the [[Newlyn School]] of landscapes and genre scenes adopted a quasi-Impressionist technique while others used realist or more traditional levels of finish.

The late 19th century also saw the [[Decadent movement]] in France and the British [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic movement]]. The British-based American painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]], and the former [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are associated with those movements, with late Burne-Jones and Beardsley both being admired abroad and representing the nearest British approach to European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877 James McNeill Whistler, sued the [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned his painting ''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket''. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref name="blogs.princeton.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt; The jury reached a verdict in favor of Whistler but awarded him only a single farthing in nominal damages, and the court costs were split.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Lisa N., ''James McNeil Whistler'', pp. 51-52, {{ISBN|1-880908-70-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the case, together with huge debts from building his residence ("The White House" in [[Tite Street]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], designed with [[Edward William Godwin|E. W. Godwin]], 1877–8), bankrupted Whistler by May 1879,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/html/jmw.htm#Whistler's See The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920112539/http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/html/jmw.htm#Whistler's |date=20 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an auction of his work, collections, and house. Stansky&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stansky's review of Linda Merill's ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin'' in the ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', Vol. 24, No. 3  (Winter, 1994), pp. 536-537 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/206692]&lt;/ref&gt; notes the irony that the [[Fine Art Society|Fine Art Society of London]], which had organized a collection to pay for Ruskin's legal costs, supported him in etching [[The Stones of Venice (book)|"the stones of Venice"]] (and in exhibiting the series in 1883) which helped recoup Whistler's costs.

[[File:HelenCarte1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Sickert]], ''The Acting Manager or Rehearsal: The End of the Act'', (portrait of [[Helen Carte]]), c. 1885]]
Scottish art was now regaining an adequate home market, allowing it to develop a distinctive character, of which the "[[Glasgow Boys]]" were one expression, straddling [[Impressionism]] in painting, and [[Art Nouveau]], [[Japonism]] and the [[Celtic Revival]] in design, with the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] now their best-known member.  Painters included [[Thomas Millie Dow]], [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]], [[Joseph Crawhall III|Joseph Crawhall]] and [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]].

New printing technology brought a great expansion in book illustration with illustrations for [[children's books]] providing much of the best remembered work of the period. Specialized artists included [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and, from 1902, [[Beatrix Potter]].

The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the [[British Empire]], led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="taste"/&gt; [[British people]] used their art "to illustrate their knowledge and command of the natural world", whilst the permanent settlers in [[British North America]], [[Australasia]], and South Africa "embarked upon a search for distinctive artistic expression appropriate to their sense of national identity".&lt;ref name="taste"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/art/artandempire.htm|title=Art and Empire|publisher=britishempire.co.uk|accessdate=24 October 2008|last=McKenzie|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire has been "at the centre, rather than in the margins, of the history of British art".&lt;ref name="empire3"&gt;{{harvnb|Barringer et al|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous variety and massive production of the various forms of British decorative art during the period are too complex to be easily summarized.  Victorian taste, until the various movements of the last decades, such as [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]], is generally poorly regarded today, but much fine work was produced, and much money made.  Both [[William Burges]] and [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]] were architects committed to the [[Gothic Revival]], who expanded into designing furniture, metalwork, tiles and objects in other media. There was an enormous boom in re-Gothicising the fittings of medieval churches, and fitting out new ones in the style, especially with [[stained glass]], an [[British and Irish stained glass (1811–1918)|industry revived from effective extinction]].  The revival of furniture painted with images was a particular feature at the top end of the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style07a/index.html Gothic Revival] Feature from the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From its opening in 1875 the London department store [[Liberty &amp; Co.]] was especially associated with imported Far Eastern decorative items and British goods in the new styles of the end of the 19th century. [[Charles Voysey (architect)|Charles Voysey]] was an architect who also did much design work in textiles, wallpaper furniture and other media, bringing the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] into [[Art Nouveau]] and beyond; he continued to design into the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O73429/wallpaper-print-the-saladin/.html Voysey wallpaper]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, V&amp;A Museum&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. H. Mackmurdo]] was a similar figure.

==20th century==
[[File:The City A fallen lift shaft (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 893).jpg|thumb|[[Graham Sutherland]], ''The City a fallen lift shaft'' (1941)]]
In many respects, the Victorian era continued until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and the Royal Academy became increasingly ossified; the unmistakably late Victorian figure of [[Frank Dicksee]] was appointed President in 1924. In photography [[Pictorialism]] aimed to achieve artistic indeed painterly effects; [[The Linked Ring]] contained the leading practitioners.  The American [[John Singer Sargent]] was the most successful London portraitist at the start of the 20th century, with [[John Lavery]], [[Augustus John]] and [[William Orpen]] rising figures.  John's sister [[Gwen John]] lived in France, and her intimate portraits were relatively little appreciated until decades after her death.  British attitudes to [[modern art]] were "polarized" at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Whittle5"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittle et al|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modernist]] movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; [[Impressionism]] was initially regarded by "many conservative critics" as a "subversive foreign influence", but became "fully assimilated" into British art during the early-20th century.&lt;ref name="Whittle5"/&gt; The Irish artist [[Jack Butler Yeats]] (1871–1957), was based in Dublin, at once a [[Romanticism|romantic painter]], a [[Symbolism (art)|symbolist]] and an [[Expressionism|expressionist]].

[[Vorticism]] was a brief coming together of a number of [[Modernist]] artists in the years immediately before 1914; members included [[Wyndham Lewis]], the sculptor [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Malcolm Arbuthnot]], [[Lawrence Atkinson]], the American photographer [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Frederick Etchells]], the French sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], [[Cuthbert Hamilton]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], [[William Roberts (painter)|William Roberts]], [[Edward Wadsworth]], [[Jessica Dismorr]], [[Helen Saunders]], and [[Dorothy Shakespear]]. The early 20th century also includes [[The Sitwells]] artistic circle and the [[Bloomsbury Group]], a group of mostly English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, including painter [[Dora Carrington]], painter and [[art critic]] [[Roger Fry]], [[art critic]] [[Clive Bell]], painter [[Vanessa Bell]], painter [[Duncan Grant]] among others. Although very fashionable at the time, their work in the visual arts looks less impressive today.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 127–129; Mellon, 182–186&lt;/ref&gt; British modernism was to remain somewhat tentative until after World War II, though figures such as [[Ben Nicholson]] kept in touch with European developments.

[[Walter Sickert]] and the [[Camden Town Group]] developed an English style of Impressionism and [[Post-Impressionism]] with a strong strand of social documentary, including [[Harold Gilman]], [[Spencer Gore (artist)|Spencer Frederick Gore]], [[Charles Ginner]], [[Robert Bevan]], [[Malcolm Drummond]] and [[Lucien Pissarro]] (the son of French Impressionist painter [[Camille Pissarro]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=59 Camden Town Group, Tate] Retrieved 7 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Where their colouring is often notoriously drab, the [[Scottish Colourists]] indeed mostly used bright light and colour; some, like [[Samuel Peploe]] and [[John Duncan Fergusson]], were living in France to find suitable subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=265 Scottish Colourists, Tate] Retrieved 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially inspired by Sir [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910), a Scottish landscape painter associated with Impressionism.
 
The reaction to the horrors of the First World War prompted a return to pastoral subjects as represented by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Eric Ravilious]], mainly a printmaker. [[Stanley Spencer]] painted mystical works, as well as landscapes, and the sculptor, printmaker and [[typographer]] [[Eric Gill]] produced elegant simple forms in a style related to [[Art Deco]]. The [[Euston Road School]] was a group of "progressive" realists of the late 1930s, including the influential teacher [[William Coldstream]]. [[Surrealism]], with artists including [[John Tunnard]] and the [[Birmingham Surrealists]], was briefly popular in the 1930s, influencing [[Roland Penrose]] and [[Henry Moore]]. [[Stanley William Hayter]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaking|printmaker]] associated in the 1930s with [[Surrealism]] and from 1940 onward with [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley William Hayter (1901 − 1989) |url=http://collection.britishcouncil.org/collection/artist/5/17693 |work=Art Collection |publisher=British Council |accessdate=5 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715104006/http://collection.britishcouncil.org/collection/artist/5/17693 |archivedate=15 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 Hayter founded the legendary ''Atelier 17'' studio in Paris.  Since his death in 1988, it has been known as ''Atelier Contrepoint.''

Munnings was President of the Royal Academy 1944–1949 and led a jeering hostility to Modernism.  The photographers of the period include [[Bill Brandt]], [[Angus McBean]] and the diarist [[Cecil Beaton]].



Henry Moore emerged after [[World War II]] as Britain's leading sculptor, promoted alongside [[Victor Pasmore]], [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] by the [[Festival of Britain]].  The "London School" of figurative painters including [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], and [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]] have received widespread international recognition,&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 219-225&lt;/ref&gt; while other painters such as [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]] and [[John Craxton]] are characterized as [[Neo-Romantics]]. [[Graham Sutherland]], the Romantic landscapist [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] (a prolific and popular lithographer), the sculptor [[Elisabeth Frink]], and the industrial townscapes of [[L.S. Lowry]] also contributed to the strong figurative presence in post-war British art.

[[File:LucienFreud.jpg|thumb|200px|Lucian Freud]]
According to William Grimes of ''[[The New York Times]]'' "Lucien Freud and his contemporaries transformed figure painting in the 20th century. In paintings like ''Girl With a White Dog'' (1951-52), Freud put the pictorial language of traditional European painting in the service of an anti-romantic, confrontational style of portraiture that stripped bare the sitter’s social facade. Ordinary people — many of them his friends — stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist’s ruthless inspection."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/arts/lucian-freud-adept-portraiture-artist-dies-at-88.html "Lucian Freud, Figurative Painter Who Redefined Portraiture, Is Dead at 88"].

==Contemporary art==
[[Postmodern art|Post-modern]], contemporary British art, particularly that of the [[Young British Artists]], has been said to be "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture&amp;nbsp;... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barringer et al|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual [[Turner Prize]], founded in 1984 and organized by the Tate, has developed as a highly publicized showcase for contemporary British art.  Among the beneficiaries have been several members of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBA) movement, which includes [[Damien Hirst]], [[Rachel Whiteread]], and [[Tracey Emin]], who rose to prominence after the [[Freeze (exhibition)|''Freeze'' exhibition]] of 1988, with the backing of [[Saatchi Gallery|Charles Saatchi]] and achieved international recognition with their version of [[conceptual art]]. This often featured [[Installation art|installations]], notably Hirst's [[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living|vitrine containing a preserved shark]]. The Tate gallery and eventually the Royal Academy also gave them exposure. The influence of Saatchi's generous and wide-ranging patronage was to become a matter of some controversy, as was that of [[Jay Jopling]], the most influential London gallerist.

The [[Sensation (art exhibition)|''Sensation'' exhibition]] of works from the Saatchi Collection was controversial in both the UK and the US, though in different ways.  At the Royal Academy press-generated controversy centred on ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', a very large image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]], but when the show travelled to New York City, opening at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in late 1999, it was met with intense protest about ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'' by [[Chris Ofili]], which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was smeared with elephant dung, although Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small [[collage]] images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional [[cherubim]]. Among other criticism, New York Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it "sick stuff" and threatened to withdraw the annual $7 million City Hall grant from the [[Brooklyn Museum]] hosting the show, because "You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion."&lt;ref name=storm&gt;

In 1999, the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] figurative painting group which includes [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] was founded as a reaction to the YBAs.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Sarah.

[[Antony Gormley]] produces sculptures, mostly in metal and based on the human figure, which include the 20 metres (66&amp;nbsp;ft) high ''[[Angel of the North]]'' near [[Gateshead]], one of the first of a number of very large public sculptures produced in the 2000s, ''[[Another Place (sculpture)|Another Place]]'', and ''[[Event Horizon (sculpture)|Event Horizon]]''.  The Indian-born sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] has public works around the world, including ''[[Cloud Gate]]'' in [[Chicago]] and ''[[Sky Mirror]]'' in various locations; like much of his work these use curved mirror-like steel surfaces.  The [[environmental sculpture]]s of British [[Land art|earth works artist]] [[Andy Goldsworthy]] have been created in many locations around the world.  Using natural found materials they are often very ephemeral, and are recorded in photographs of which several collections in book form have been published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/mar/11/art.features3 The Observer, 2007 interview with Andy Goldsworthy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grayson Perry]] works in various media, including ceramics.

'''''The Book and Author Luncheon''''' was created in 1938 by the [[American Booksellers Association]]. The program provided a prominent forum for authors to speak to the public about their works in one of the largest markets for books in the United States, New York City. 

The ABA partnered with the [[New York Herald Tribune]] early in its first year, and with [[WNYC]] in its 11th season, in 1948. It would air on WNYC until the luncheon's end, in 1974. The Book and Author Luncheon produced 8 events per year, each with 2 to 4 speakers. It was held at a variety of locations in Manhattan, most frequently at the [[Waldorf Astoria]]. Though it predominantly featured authors as speakers, it drew from a wide variety of notable figures during its 31-year run. Some of its famous guest speakers include [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[James A. Michener]], [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Robert Moses]], [[Rachel Carson]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] and [[Marian Anderson]], among many, many others. It was hosted for the majority of its run by [[New York Herald Tribune]] Book Review editor [[Irita Bradford Van Doren]].

}}

A '''Caganer''' ({{IPA-ca|kəɣəˈne}}) is a [[figurine]] depicted in the act of [[defecation]] appearing in [[nativity scene]]s in [[Catalonia]] and neighbouring [[Traditions of Catalonia|areas with Catalan culture]] such as [[Andorra]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], and [[Northern Catalonia]] (in southern [[France]]). It is most popular and widespread in these areas, but can also be found in other areas of [[Spain]] ([[Region of Murcia|Murcia]]), [[Portugal]], and southern [[Italy]] ([[Naples]]).

The name "El Caganer" literally means "the crapper" or "the shitter". Traditionally, the [[figurine]] is depicted as a peasant, wearing the traditional Catalan red cap (the [[barretina]]) and with his trousers down, showing a bare backside, and defecating.

== Origins ==
The exact origin of the Caganer is unknown, but the tradition has existed since at least the 18th century.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12059969|title=A traditional Nativity scene, Catalan-style|journal=BBC News|date=23 December 2010|accessdate=23 December 2010|last1=Rainsford|first1=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the society [http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/castella/figura/figuracaganer.htm Amics del Caganer] (Friends of the Caganer), it is believed to have entered the nativity scene by the late 17th or early 18th century, during the Baroque period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/catala/figura/figuracaganer.htm Amics del Caganer (Friends of the Caganer)]. Consulted 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garske/&gt;  An [[Iberians|Iberian]] [[votive deposit]] was found near Tornabous in the [[Urgell (comarca)|Urgell]] depicting a holy Iberian warrior defecating on his [[falcata]]. This led to a brief altercation between the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] and the Departament d'Arqueologia in the Conselleria de Cultura of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] as to whether the find can be regarded as a proto-caganer (which would place the origin of this tradition far earlier than previously thought) or just a representation of a pre-combat ritual.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Tradition ==
In [[Catalonia]], as well as in the rest of  [[Spain]] and in most of [[Italy]] and Southern [[France]], traditional Christmas decorations often consist of a large model of the city of Bethlehem, similar to the [[Nativity scene]]s of the English-speaking world but encompassing the entire city rather than just the typical manger scene. This ''pessebre'' is often a reproduction of a pastoral scene—a traditional Catalan ''masia'' (farmhouse) as the central setting with the child in a manger, and outlying scenes including a washerwoman by a river, a woman spinning, shepherds herding their sheep or walking towards the manger with gifts, the Three Wise Men approaching on camel back, a scene with the angel and shepherds, the star pointing the way, etc. Commonly materials such as moss will be used to represent grass, with cork used to represent mountains or cliffs. Another variant is to make the setting oriental, with the Wise Men arriving by camel and the figures dressed accordingly.

The caganer is a particular and highly popular feature of modern Catalan nativity scenes. It is believed to have entered the nativity scene by the late 17th or early 18th century, during the Baroque period.&lt;ref name="amicsdelcaganer.cat"&gt;[http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/catala/figura/figuracaganer.htm ''El Caganer'', by Jordi Arruga and Josep Mañà. (Barcelona: Alta Fulla, 1992), reproduced on the website Amics del Caganer (Friends of the Caganer)]. Consulted 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Eminent folklorist [[Joan Amades]] called it an essential piece and the most popular figure of the nativity scene. It can also be found in other parts of southwestern [[Europe]], including [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], the region just south of the [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] in [[Spain]] (where they are called ''cagones''), [[Naples]] (''cacone'' or ''pastore che caca'') and [[Portugal]] (''cagões'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amicsdelcaganer.net/his6.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215171316/http://www.amicsdelcaganer.net/his6.htm |archivedate=2008-12-15 |df= }} Amics del Caganer&lt;/ref&gt; There is a sculpture of a person defecating hidden inside the cathedral of [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Province of Salamanca]], though this is not part of a nativity scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/pessebre.pdf Jordi Bilbeny, ''Les arrels precristianes del pessebre de Nadal'' (The Pre-Christian Roots of the Nativity Scene)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (article in Catalan). Consulted 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanying [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Saint Joseph the Betrothed|Joseph]], [[Jesus]], the [[shepherd]]s and company, the caganer is often tucked away in a corner of the model, typically nowhere near the manger scene. A tradition in Catalonia is to have children find the hidden figure.

== Explanations ==

{{Original research section|date=July 2014}}
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2014}}

Possible reasons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.caganer.com/en/info/the-caganer-s-history-12|title = Caganer.com|date = |accessdate = |website = Caganer|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for placing a figure representing a person in the act of emptying his bowels in a scene which is widely considered [[holy]] include:
* The Caganer, by creating feces, is [[fertilize|fertilizing]] the Earth. According to the ethnographer [[Joan Amades]], it was a "customary figure in nativity scenes [pessebres] in the 19th century, because people believed that this deposit [symbolically] fertilized the ground of the nativity scenes, which became fertile and ensured the nativity scene for the following year, and with it, the health of body and peace of mind required to make the nativity scene, with the joy and happiness brought by Christmas near the hearth. Placing this figurine in the nativity scene brought good luck and joy and not doing so brought adversity."&lt;ref name="amicsdelcaganer.cat"/&gt;
* Many modern caganers represent celebrities and authority figures. By representing them with their pants down, the caganer serves as a leveling device to bring the mighty down.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Brad. Les virtuts cíviques del caganer. Caramella: Revista de música i cultura popular No. 25, pp. 47-50 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;
* As to the charge of blasphemy, as Catalan anthropologist Miguel Delgado has pointed out, the grotesque, rather than a negation of the divine may actually signify an intensification of the sacred, for what could be more grotesque than the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, a bloody public torture and execution as the defining moment in the story of Christianity?&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Ruiz, Manuel. 2001. Luces iconoclastas: Anticlericalism, espacio, y ritual en la España contemporánia, Ariel Antropología. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his essay ''Les virtuts cìviques del caganer'' ("The Civic Virtues of the Defecator"), American anthropologist Brad Erickson argues that Catalans use the caganer to process and respond to contemporary social issues such as immigration and the [[Caganer#Controversy surrounding Barcelona's civility ordinance|imposition of public civility regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Brad. Les virtuts cìviques del caganer. Caramella: Revista de música i cultura popular. No. 25, pp. 47-50 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Further opinions:&lt;ref&gt;The following opinions are translated from [http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/catala/figura/figuracaganer.htm ''El Caganer'', by Jordi Arruga and Josep Mañà. (Barcelona: Alta Fulla, 1992), reproduced on the website Amics del Caganer (Friends of the Caganer)]. Consulted 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The caganer was the most mischievous and out-of-place character of the pessebre's [otherwise] idyllic landscape; he was the "Other", with everything that entails, and as the "Other", was accepted, in a liberal vein, as long as he did not aim to occupy the foreground. The caganer represented the spoilsport that we all have inside of us, and that's why it is not surprising that it was the most beloved figure among the children and, above all, the adolescents, who were already beginning to feel rather like outsiders at the family celebration." {{ill|Agustí Pons|ca}}
* "The caganer is a hidden figure and yet is always sought out like the lost link between transcendence and contingency. Without the caganer, there would be no nativity scene but rather a liturgy, and there would be no real country but just the false landscape of a model." [[Joan Barril]]
* "The caganer seems to provide a counterpoint to so much ornamental hullabaloo, so much emotive treacle, so much contrived beauty." {{ill|Josep Murgades|ca}}
* "The caganer is, like so many other things that have undergone the filtering of a great many generations, a cult object; with the playful, aesthetic and superficial devotion that we feel towards all the silly things that fascinate us deep down." {{ill|Jordi Soler|es|Jordi Soler (escritor)}}

== Local reactions ==
The practice is tolerated by the [[Catholic]] church within the areas where the Caganer is popular. Although the tradition generally has popular support, opinion is divided as to whether it is wholly appropriate and not all nativity scenes in Catalonia include caganers.

== Similar traditions ==
The Caganer is not the only defecating character in the Catalan Christmas tradition&amp;mdash;another is the ''[[Tió de Nadal]]'', which also makes extensive use of the image of fecal matter (it is a log, i.e. tió which, having been "fed" for several weeks, is told to defecate on Christmas Eve and "magically" produces candy for children, a candy that has supposedly come from its bowels). Other mentions of feces and defecation are common in Catalan folklore: indeed, a popular Catalan saying for use before a meal is ''menja bé, caga fort i no tinguis por a la mort!''  ("Eat well, shit heartily, and don't be afraid of death!"). In his book ''Barcelona'', architecture critic and locale historian [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] gives a good introduction to this earthy tradition.

The Caganer can also be found in other European cultures, either as an import or a minor local tradition:
*In France: ''Père la Colique'' ("Father [[Cholic]]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavi.univ-paris3.fr/phalese/aragon/perelacolique.htm Reference to this figure on the website: Centre de recherches Hubert de Phalèse - Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris III] (in [[French language|French]]). Accessed on 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In France this figure seems to date from the 1930s or 40s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/colique Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Léxicales]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Murcia]], the region just south of the Valencian Community in [[Spain]] (where they are called ''cagones'')&lt;ref name=Arruga&gt;{{cite book|title=El Caganer|author1=Arruga, J.  |author2=Mañá, J.|publisher=Alta Fulla|year=1992|url=http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/castella/figura/figuracaganer.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible translations of the caganer concept into other languages include:
*In the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]/[[Flemish]]: ''Kakkers / Schijterkes'' ("Pooper"/"Little Pooper")
*In [[German language|German]]: ''Choleramännchen'' or ''Hinterlader'' ("Little Cholera Man" or "Breech-loader")

== Traditional vs. modern portrayals ==
[[File:Caganers.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Modern caricature caganers for sale]]
The traditional caganer is portrayed as a Catalan [[peasant]] man (i.e. a farmer or shepherd) wearing a typical hat called a ''[[barretina]]'' &amp;mdash; a red stocking hat with a black band. At least since the late 1970s, the figure of a traditional Catalan peasant woman was also added, wearing traditional garb including the long black hairnet.

The Catalans have modified this tradition a good deal since the 1940s. In addition to the traditional caganer design, one can easily find other characters assuming the Caganer position, such as [[nun]]s, [[devil]]s, [[Santa Claus]], celebrities, athletes, historical figures, politicians, Spanish royalty, [[UK|British]] royalty,&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; and other famous people past and present. Just days after his election as US president in 2008, a "pooper" of [[Barack Obama]] was made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://au.truveo.com/Obama-pooper-get-one-this-xmas/id/286101039 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206081335/http://au.truveo.com/Obama-pooper-get-one-this-xmas/id/286101039 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== At markets and exhibits ==
Caganers are easiest to find before Christmas in holiday markets, like the one in front of the [[Cathedral of Santa Eulalia]], which has many tables of Caganers. Every year new figures are created, and some people collect them. Caganers are the focal point of at least one association ([http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/angles/index.htm Els Amics del Caganer, i.e. Friends of the Caganer]), which puts out a regular bulletin ([http://www.amicsdelcaganer.cat/catala/caganofil/caganofil.htm "El Caganòfil"]), and have even been featured in art exhibits.

In recent years a urinating statue, or Pixaner, has also appeared, but it has not taken root or gained any serious popularity.

== Controversy surrounding Barcelona's civility ordinance ==
[[File:Pessebre a la plaça de Sant Jaume - caganer.JPG|thumb|The caganer in the 2011 official nativity scene in Barcelona's [[Plaça de Sant Jaume]]]]
In 2005, the Barcelona city council provoked a public outcry by commissioning a nativity scene which did not include a caganer. The local government was reported to have countered these criticisms by claiming that the Caganer was not included because a civility ordinance&lt;ref&gt;Suñé, Ramon. 2006a. La nueva ordenanza del civismo impera desde hoy en Barcelona. La
Vanguadia, January 25.&lt;/ref&gt; had made [[public defecation]] and [[public urination]] illegal, meaning that the caganer was now setting a bad example.&lt;ref&gt;Caganer, Amics del. 2005. Nova polèmica amb la figura del Caganer 2005 [cited. Available from http://www.amicsdelcaganer.org/index1.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Barcelona's Christmas Crapper Canned | publisher=Scoop | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0512/S00250.htm | date=2005-12-25 | first=Jeremy | last=Rose }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many saw this as an attack on Catalan traditions. One writer of a letter to the editor asserted, "A nativity scene without a caganer is not a nativity scene."&lt;ref&gt;Castells, E. 2005. La ausencia de 'caganer' en el pesebre de Sant Jaume enfrenta a los políticos. La Vanguardia de Barcelona, 30/11/2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second writer offered a win-win solution. He suggested including the caganer but also placing a figure of a police officer with a pen and clipboard next to him, writing a ticket for the infraction. The writer said this would achieve three objectives: respect tradition, comply with the ordinance and educate the public about how it is being reinforced, and finally, demonstrate how important it is to respect the law.&lt;ref&gt;Giménez, Joaquín. 2005. Multa al 'caganer'. La Vanguardia de Barcelona, 29/11/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the head of Parks and Gardens publicly denied prohibiting the caganer in the first place, saying that it was the artistic decision of the artist commissioned by the city to design and install the pessebre.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, E. 2005. La ausencia de 'caganer' en el pesebre de Sant Jaume enfrenta a los políticos.
La Vanguardia de Barcelona, 30/11/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a campaign against the caganer's absence called ''Salvem el caganer'' (Save the caganer), and widespread media criticism, the 2006 nativity restored the caganer, who appeared on the northern side of the nativity near a dry riverbed.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
A '''devotional song''' is a [[hymn]] which accompanies religious observances and rituals. Traditionally devotional music has been a part of [[Christian music]], [[Hindu music]], [[Sufi music]], [[Buddhist music]], [[Islamic music]]  and [[Jewish music]]

Each major religion has its own tradition with devotional hymns. In the West, the devotional has been a part of the [[liturgy]] in [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and others, since their earliest days. A devotional is a part of the prayer service proper and is not, in these contexts, ornamentation.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], church music in general was hotly debated. Some [[Puritan]]s objected to all ornament and sought to abolish choirs, hymns, and, inasmuch as liturgy itself was rejected, devotionals.

In Eastern and Near-Eastern religions, devotionals can function as communion prayer and meditation. These are sung in particular [[rhythms]] which are sustained over a prolonged period to give practitioners a [[mysticism|mystical]] experience. In [[Hindu music]], the genre arising out of the [[Bhakti movement]] (devotion), it takes forms like [[Bhajan]], [[Kirtan]] and [[Aarti]].&lt;ref name="GoswamiThielemann2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Saurabh Goswami|author2=[[Selina Sharma|Selina Thielemann]]|title=Music and Fine Arts in the Devotional Traditions of India: Worship Through Beauty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEnT57bbZG8C|year= 2005|pages=2–10|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-811-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nijenhuis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmie Te Nijenhuis|title=Kīrtana: Traditional South Indian Devotional Songs: Compositions of Tyāgarāja, Muttusvāmi Dīkṣitar and Śyāma Śāstri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BI8sygAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-90-04-20933-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Edible Book Festival''' is an annual event usually held on or around April 1, which is also known as '''Edible Book Day'''.&lt;ref name="week"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/theWeekContent.do?BV_ID=@@@&amp;contentType=EDITORIAL&amp;sectionName=TheWeek%20Lifestyle&amp;programId=1073755413&amp;contentId=6895557 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714032142/http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/theWeekContent.do?BV_ID=%40%40%40&amp;contentType=EDITORIAL&amp;sectionName=TheWeek%20Lifestyle&amp;programId=1073755413&amp;contentId=6895557 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = July 14, 2011 |title = Write Bite |date = March 21, 2010 |work = [[The Week]] |publisher = Malayala Manorama Publications |location = Kochi, Kerala |access-date = March 18, 2010 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The global event has been celebrated since 2000 in various parts of the world, where "edible books" are created, displayed, and small events are held. The creations are photographed and then consumed.&lt;ref name="week"/&gt; Regular contributors to the site are groups from Australia, Brazil, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, The Netherlands, Russia, and Hong Kong. The event was initiated by Judith A. Hoffberg and Béatrice Coron in 2000.&lt;ref name="week"/&gt;

[[Image:Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.jpg|thumb|Title page of "Physiologie du Goût" ("Physiology of Taste") by French gastronome [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] (1755–1826) with a portrait of the author. 1848 edition.]]
The official website &lt;nowiki&gt;Books2Eat.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; says that the International Edible Book Festival is held to commemorate "the birthday of French gastronome [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] (1755–1826), noted for his book ''Physiologie du goût'', a witty meditation on food", though [[April Fools' Day]] is also related as "the perfect day to eat your words and play with them as the 'books' are consumed on the day of the event".&lt;ref name="books2eat"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.books2eat.com |title = International Edible Book Festival |publisher = Diffusion [[Adage]] |access-date = April 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', as regards eating one's words.)

==Rules==
The participation rules per a related site are:&lt;ref name="books2eat"/&gt;
* The event must be held on April 1 or around it
* "All edible books must be 'bookish' through the integration of text, literary inspiration or, quite simply, the form."
* "Organizations or individual participants must register with the festival’s organization ... and see to it that the event is immortalized on the international festival website ( http://www.books2eat.beatricecoron.com/ )." It should be noted that this site is collecting photographs for publication in a book. 

==Celebrations==

In 2005, the festival was a joint initiative of forum book art and the Museum of Work, [[Hamburg]], where pastry chefs made edible books. The "book art" was displayed, photographed, and then eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Heinz Stefan |last = Bartkowiak |chapter = The Sixth International Book Festival: 2005 |title = Kompendium zeitgenössischer Handpressendrucke, Malerbücher, Künstlerbücher, Einblattdrucke, Mappenwerke und Buchobjekte |trans-title = Compendium of Contemporary  Fine Prints, Artists' Books, Broadsides, Portfolios  and Book Objects |language = German, English |location = Hamburg |publisher = Bartkowiaks Forum Book Art |year = 2005 |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=VFa4ctd1ReUC&amp;pg=PA25 |page = 25 |isbn = 9783935462044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the event was celebrated in [[Los Angeles]], too, at the Los Angeles Book Arts Center as the ''Annual International Edible Book High/Low Tea'' on April 2, where artists were encouraged to create and consume tomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q18EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 |title = 6th Annual International Edible Book High/Low Tea |date = Apr 2005 |work = Los Angeles Magazine |page = 156 |access-date = March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 [[Indianapolis Monthly]] described the [[Indianapolis]] festival as a "quirky event" held on April Fools' Day, "celebrating both food and literature."

A [[University of Florida]] library holds the event as the '''Edible Book Contest''' in April, in connection with [[National Library Week]]. There are two rules for the contest: Entries should be edible, and they must somehow relate to a book. Besides edible books, other entries include "edible book trucks" and "edible bookmarks". The event kicks off with viewing of the entries, each of which has an information card describing the book title, author, and creator of the book art. The "books" are judged by a panel of judges and by public voting. Awards are given in categories like: Most Creative, Least Edible, Best Overall Fiction, Best Overall Non-Fiction, and Best Children's Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Malanchuk |first = Iona R. |title = Librarians As Community Partners: An Outreach Handbook |editor-first = Carol |editor-last = Smallwood |publisher = ALA Editions |year = 2010 |pages = 3–5 |chapter = Bake a Book and they will come |url = https://books.google.com/?id=O_-iFcSpsMYC&amp;pg=PA5 |isbn = 9780838910061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the event is planned to be held on April 15 and the award categories are: Best Overall Entry, Best Book Theme, Best Pun, Best Adult Book, and Best Children's Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.uflib.ufl.edu/news/2010/03/15/call-for-readers-and-edible-book-entries/ |title = Call for Readers and Edible Book Entries |date = March 15, 2010 |publisher = UF Library |access-date = March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An edible book.jpg|thumb|A cake with exposed layers resembling pages]]

Perkins Library at [[Hastings College]] in Nebraska (US) celebrated [[Banned Books Week]] 2008 by holding an edible book contest.  The event invited guests to consume cooked dishes and baked goods that resembled covers of banned books or reflected their content.  A reporter sums up the aptly named event: "Our celebration took Sir [[Francis Bacon]]'s famous words quite literally: 'Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and the other few to be chewed and digested.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Mark R. |last = Gould |title = The Library PR Handbook: High-Impact Communications |publisher = ALA Editions |year = 2009 |pages = 51–52 |chapter = Additional Tasty Examples of Food as a Promotional Tool |url = https://books.google.com/?id=zbUe2e-Z2b4C&amp;pg=PA51 |isbn = 9780838997260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the British newspaper [[Metro (British newspaper)|''Metro'']] ran a story that they would begin producing the newspaper on an edible "Sweet tasting paper" claiming to bring customers "news in the best possible taste".  The newspaper later clarified this was nothing more than an [[April Fools' joke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.worldofdeals.co.uk/other-electronics-deals/top-15-april-fools-2011-shopping-and-deals-pranks |title = Top 15 April Fool’s 2011 Shopping and Deals Pranks |date = April 1, 2011 |access-date = April 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Episodic storytelling''' is when a story is narrated through [[episode|episodes]], as opposed to chapters, which are typically seen in novels. The term used in [[literature]] to refer to a body of work composed of episodes or similar installments is [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]. [[episodic fiction|Serials]] are also known as [[episodic fiction]]. 

Multiple episodes are usually grouped together into a [[Serial (radio and television)|series]] through a unifying [[story arc]]. Episodes may not always contain the same characters, but each episode draws from a broader group of characters, or cast, all of whom exist in the same [[story world]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[theoretical physics]], '''explicit symmetry breaking''' is the breaking of a [[symmetry]] of a [[theory]] by terms in its defining [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] (most typically, to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] or the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]) that do not respect the symmetry. Usually this term is used in situations where these symmetry-breaking terms are small, so that the symmetry is approximately respected by the theory. An example is the spectral line splitting in the [[Zeeman effect]], due to a magnetic interaction perturbation in the Hamiltonian of the atoms involved.

Explicit symmetry breaking differs from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. In the latter, the defining equations respect the symmetry but the [[ground state]] ([[vacuum state|vacuum]]) of the theory breaks it.&lt;ref&gt;Castellani, E. (2003) "On the meaning of Symmetry Breaking" in Brading, K. and Castellani, E. (eds)  Symmetries in Physics: New Reflections, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicit symmetry breaking is also associated with electromagnetic radiation. A system of accelerated charges results in electromagnetic radiation when the geometric symmetry of the electric field in free space is explicitly broken by the associated electrodynamic structure under time varying excitation of the given system. This is quite evident in an antenna where the electric lines of field curl around or have rotational geometry around the radiating terminals in contrast to linear geometric orientation within a pair of transmission lines which does not radiate even under time varying excitation.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha &amp; Amaratunga (2016) "Explicit Symmetry Breaking in Electrodynamic Systems and Electromagnetic Radiation" Morgan Claypool, Institute of Physics, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''''' is a 2001 [[guide book]] written by British author [[J. K. Rowling]] (under the [[pen name]] of the fictitious author [[Newt Scamander]]) about the [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter|magical creatures]] in the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]]. The original version, illustrated by the author herself, purports to be [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s copy of the textbook of the same name mentioned in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (or ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in the US), the first novel of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. It includes several notes inside it supposedly handwritten by Harry, [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]], detailing their own experiences with some of the beasts described, and including in-jokes relating to the original series.

In a 2001 interview with publisher [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]], Rowling stated that she chose the subject of [[magical beasts (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]] because it was a fun topic for which she had already developed a lot of information in earlier books. Rowling's name did not appear on the cover of the first edition, the work being credited under the pen name "Newt Scamander", who, in the books, wrote this textbook as seen on Harry's supply list for his first year.

The book benefits the charity [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. Over 80% of the cover price of each book sold goes directly to poor children in various places around the world. According to Comic Relief, sales from this book and its companion ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' have raised over £17&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicrelief.com/news/2009-07/harry-potter-book-profits-go-comic-relief |title=News |publisher=[[Comic Relief]] |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314132659/http://www.comicrelief.com/news/2009-07/harry-potter-book-profits-go-comic-relief |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2013, [[Warner Bros.]] and Rowling announced they would be producing a [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film inspired by the book]], being the first in a series of five such films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/786672299374157824?lang=en-gb | title="Five films exactly". JK Rowling Twitter feed | date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling herself was the screenwriter. She came up with a plan for a movie after Warner Bros. suggested the idea. The story features Newt Scamander as a main character and is set in [[New York City]], 70 years before Harry's story started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/warner-bros-j-k-rowling-team-for-new-harry-potter-inspired-film-series/ |title= Warner Bros, J.K.

On 14 March 2017 a new edition of the book, with cover illustrations by Johnny Duddle and interior illustrations by Tomislav Tomic, was published with six new creatures and a foreword by Newt Scamander. It is assumed to be a new copy as it does not feature any handwritten notes. Proceeds from this edition are donated to [[Lumos (charity)|Lumos]] as well as Comic Relief.

On 7 November 2017 a new edition was published with illustrations by Olivia Lomenech Gill, featuring the aforementioned 2017 text. On 1 February 2018 a Kindle in Motion edition, featuring these illustrations with movement, was released for compatible devices.

==Synopsis==
===Original version===
''Fantastic Beasts'' purports to be a reproduction of a textbook owned by [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and written by [[Cryptozoology|magizoologist]] Newt Scamander, a character in the fictional ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. In the series, magizoology is the study of [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter|magical creatures]].

[[Albus Dumbledore]], headmaster of [[Hogwarts]], provides the foreword and explains the purpose of the special edition of this book (the [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] charity). At the end, he tells the reader, "...The amusing creatures described hereafter are fictional and cannot hurt you." He repeats the Hogwarts motto: "Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus", [[Latin]] for "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".

''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' contains the history of magizoology and describes 85 magical species found around the world. Scamander says that he collected most of the information found in the book through observations made over years of travel across five continents. He notes that the first edition was commissioned in 1918 by Augustus Worme of [[Places in Harry Potter#Obscurus Books|Obscurus Books]]. However, it was not published until 1927. It is now in its fifty-second edition.

In the [[Harry Potter universe]], the book is a required textbook for first-year [[Hogwarts]] students, having been an approved textbook since its first publication. In his foreword to the book, [[Albus Dumbledore]] notes that it serves as an excellent reference for wizarding households in addition to its use at [[Hogwarts]].

The book features doodles and comments added by [[Ron Weasley]]. The comments would appear to have been written around the time of the fourth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]].'' These doodles add some extra information for fans of the series (for example the "[[Acromantula]]" entry has a comment confirming that [[Hogwarts]] is located in Scotland) along with comic relief (such as Ron saying "you're not kidding" when talking about the Hungarian Horntail being the most fearsome dragon of all, a reference to Harry's encounter with one in the fourth book).

The cover design of the first edition of the book features apparent claw marks from an unidentified animal.

===2017 text===
This edition features six new creatures: the [[Hidebehind|hidebehind]], the [[hodag]], the [[horned serpent]], the [[Snallygaster|snallygaster]], the thunderbird and the wampus cat, in addition to the original 75, and the illustrations are replaced. Newt Scamander in the foreword stated the reason the six new creatures were not previously included is because MACUSA president Seraphina Picquery requested the more important American creatures not be mentioned to deter wizarding sightseers at a time when the US wizarding community were subject to greater persecution than their European counterparts, and after Scamander had contributed to a breach of the International Statute of Secrecy in New York.


===Fictional biography===
{{in-universe|section|date=January 2015}}
Newton Artemis Fido "Newt" Scamander is the fictional author of ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'', born in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/newt-scamander&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "About the Author" section of the book, Scamander became a magizoologist because of his own interest in fabulous beasts and the encouragement of his mother, an enthusiastic [[Hippogriff]] breeder. In [[Hogwarts]], he was sorted into [[Hufflepuff]] house.

After being expelled from [[Hogwarts]], Scamander joined the [[Ministry of Magic]] in the [[Ministry of Magic#Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures|Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. His career included a brief stint in the Office of [[House-elf]] Relocation, a transfer to the [[Ministry of Magic#Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures|Beast Division]], the creation of the Werewolf Register in 1947, the 1965 passage of the Ban on Experimental Breeding, and many research trips for the Dragon Research and Restraint Bureau. His contributions to [[Magizoology]] earned him an Order of Merlin, Second Class in 1979.

When retired, he lived in [[Dorset]] with his wife [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)#Cast|Porpentina]] and their pet Kneazles: Hoppy, Milly and Mauler. He had a grandson named Rolf, who married [[Luna Lovegood]] (a character who appeared in the last three ''Harry Potter'' novels) some time after the events of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.

In the film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', Newt Scamander's name appeared on the Marauder's Map. 

In the film adaptation of ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', it is mentioned that Scamander was expelled from Hogwarts following an unspecified incident involving one of his creatures, but Albus Dumbledore argued in his defence.

===Role in the ''Harry Potter'' series===
Scamander himself does not appear in the seven Harry Potter books. He is mentioned in passing in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' as the author of ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''. He is the central character of the [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film adaptation of ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'']], in which he is portrayed by [[Eddie Redmayne]].

:''This article is about Filipino women who create art in the Philippines. For women as subject of art in the Philippines, see [[Women in Philippine art]].''
'''Filipino women artists''' started contributing to Philippine art when the [[History of the Philippines|Philippines]] was still a colonial province of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] (1521–1898).&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt; They have continued to participate as art creators after [[World War II]] through modern times by either following the traditional way of making art or by departing from such tradition by embracing modernism and other modes of expressing themselves through art.

==Spanish era (1521–1898)==
===Sculpting===
The first Filipino woman to achieve a level of prominence in the art world, while the [[Philippines]] was under the management of [[Spain]], was sculptor Pelagia Mendoza y Gotianquin (1867-1939). The first female student at the ''[[Academia de Dibujo y Pintura]]'' (Academy of Drawing and Painting), Mendoza studied sculpting under the mentorship of Agustin Saez and Lorenzo Rocha. Her bust of [[Christopher Columbus]] won an award during the quattrocentenial celebration of the [[Discovery of the Americas]].&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

===Painting===
In the field of painting in the Philippines, the works of art of [[Carmen Zaragoza y Rojas]] became notable. Zaragoza was the painter of the masterpiece known as Dos Inteligentias (literally “Two Intellectuals”, 1892), a painting that won Zaragoza a prize during the 1892 anniversary of Christopher Columbus and his discovery of the Americas. Two years later, during the 1895 Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (1895 Regional Exposition in the Philippines), Zaragoza would be awarded a copper medal for creating two landscapes.&lt;ref name=NCCA&gt;{{cite web|last=Flores|first=Patrick|title=Birthing Women Artists|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?i=58&amp;subcat=13|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts (May 30, 2003)|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable Filipino women painters during the time of Zaragoza were Concha Paterno, Adele Paterno, Conception de Montilla, Patricia Reyes, Ana Garcia Plana, Josefa Majo, Concepcion Ortiz, Olimpia Teran de Abella, Rafaella Calanta, and Femina David.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

Another woman painter who excelled in the field of [[art in the Philippines]] was Paz Paterno. Her important painting known as ''Still Life'' was decorated with native fruits such as [[lanzones]] (''Lansium domesticum''), bananas, [[mabolo]]s (velvet apple, ''Diospyros blancoi''), [[Sugar-apple|atis]] (sugar-apple, the fruit of ''[[Annona squamosa]]''), [[balimbing]]s (carambola or starfruit, fruit of ''[[Averrhoa carambola]]''), [[pili nut]]s, and coconuts.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

==After World War II (1946-present)==
After World War II, new female artists emerged carrying the modernistic themes in their art. Among these artists were painters such as Anita Magsaysay-Ho, the first Filipino woman abstractionist Nena Saguil,&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt; and Philippine Art Gallery owner Lyd Arguilla. During the 1970s and the 1980s, women printmakers and graphic artists began contributing their works of imagery to the Philippine art scene, such as Brenda Fajardo, Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi, and Imelda Cajipe-Endaya. This period also saw the emergence of women art collectives in the Philippines such as ''[[Kasibulan]],'' for which these artists where members of. Women sculptors like Agnes Arellano, Julie Lluch, Genera Banzon, and Francesca Enriquez also made their noteworthy impressions to the field of sculpting by creating non-traditional statues.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

Ofelio Gelvezon-Tequi, a pioneer in the print-making industry, created a notable printed portrait of a widow standing next to the casket of her dead husband. The casket in the image was draped with a [[Philippine flag]], while the widow was standing and holding vigil next to the coffin. Gelvezon-Tequi also produced works made of acrylic-on-paper in 1995. Her masterpieces later focused on portraits of Filipino women such former Philippine President [[Corazon Aquino]], the assassins of her husband [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], and about plotters of [[coup d'etat]]s.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

As a mixed-media artist, Brenda Fajardo used art to describe folk magic and [[Philippine mythology|folklore]] of the [[Aeta people|Sulod people]] (part of the Aeta ethnic group) of [[Panay]] province.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt; Fajardo is a member of Faculty of Arts at the [[University of the Philippines]] in [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]. She was also the curator of the Vargas Museum of Art located inside the Diliman campus of the University of the Philippines. She was a visiting professor at the St. Norbert College in the United States.&lt;ref name=VIA&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyer|first=Robert|title=Two Women Artists: Strong Filipino Women (5)|url=http://www.viatimes.com/_archive/vt_1204/philippines.html|publisher=VIA Times|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Nena Saguil (died in 1994) expressed her artistry through the use of pen and ink to draw abstract images employing dots, bubble, vortices, and rays, including an imagery of an "enlarged [[hymen]]" and "a woman cleaning a toilet bowl splattered with human excrement".&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt; Saguil moved to France to live in Paris.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

Imelda Cajipe-Endaya ventured in making fragmented artistic scenes by recycling materials found in the household to depict the life and responsibilities of the Filipina domestic helper working in the Philippines and abroad, to integrate their unseen roles as the working wife, mother, and daughter while being miles away from their motherland or from their hometowns in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

[[Paulina Constancia]] is considered one of the most prolific and inspiring female artists in Cebu, Philippines. She is a multifaceted artist best known for her bright colored, whimsical narratives painted on quilts and tiles that are also reflected in her writing. Paulina has exhibited her art in the Philippines, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico &amp; in various cities in the United States &amp; Canada. In 1997, she was presented by the [http://reocities.com/CollegePark/quad/1490/iii1cen1.htm Philippine Centennial Coordinating Council of Northeast USA] in a show called "Here's to Sunny!" at the Philippine Center in New York City. In 2000, her collection of painted quilts called "Kleur en ik in de geheime tuin /Hue &amp; I in a Secret Garden" was  presented by the [http://www.haarlemmermeer.nl/gemeenteraad/Millenniumdoelen/Vereniging_Haarlemmermeer_Cebu VHC-Vereniging Haarlemmermeer-Cebu] (sister cities organization of Haarlemmermeer and Cebu) at the Centrum voor Kunst en Cultuur in Hoofddrop and Kunst 2001  Gallery in Badhoevedorp.

Another noteworthy Filipino woman artist was painter&lt;ref name=VIA/&gt; and sculptor Elsie "Inday" Cadapan whose 1997 sculpture was unveiled for display by former Philippine President [[Corazon Aquino]] on October 30, 1997 at the front lobby of the [[Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS) building.

==Art as rehabilitation tool==
On April 21, 2012, the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported that Alma Quinto launched the "House of Comfort Art Project", a program of the House of Comfort Art Network (ARTHOC), a non-governmental organization that uses art to help sexually abused Filipino women and girls through their rehabilitation. The project employs the use of scrap materials to teach women how to create miniature houses, as a means of expressing their feelings long after the occurrence of abuse and build positive experiences in their minds and to once again become in control of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rebekah|first=Curtis|title=Sexually abused Filipino women find solace in art|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20120421161400-f1bzu/|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation (21 April 2012)|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Diptych Barberini Louvre OA9063 whole.jpg|thumb|left|Barberini Ivory on display at the [[Louvre]].]]
[[Image:Ivory Ariadne Bargello.jpg|thumb|Panel of a possible imperial diptych representing the empress [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]], [[Bargello]].]]
In [[Late Antiquity]], an '''imperial diptych''' is a theoretical type of [[ivory]] [[diptych]], made up of two leaves of five panels each and each with a central panel representing the emperor or empress.  They are so-named in contrast to [[consular diptych]]s.  They were produced as unique examples, whereas each consular diptych was produced in large numbers to offer to the emperor on certain occasions, principally a nobleman's entry to the consulship.

No complete example of an imperial diptych survives and so their existence is contested.  The ivories specialist R. Delbrück has theorised that the 19 surviving fragments of ivory panels which clearly do not belong to the usual type of consular diptychs constitute evidence of imperial diptychs, despite having many characteristics in common with consular diptychs.  The iconography of these diptychs  obeys a stereotypical scheme, as illustrated by the [[Barberini ivory]], which is the best example of the posited type - an imperial diptych's programme would be made up of a central figure of the emperor or empress, figures of dignitaries on its side panels, an upper register showing a personification of Constantinople or a medallion with a bust of Christ and a lower register showing barbarians making offerings to the emperor.  However, the fact that the Barberini ivory was almost certainly not a diptych, but some kind of imperial [[icon]] without a second panel is a serious argument against the existence of the imperial diptych type.

The two panels representing the empress [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]], in the [[Bargello]] in [[Florence]] and the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]], also belong to the hypothesied imperial diptych type.  They are the only central panels of such a diptych (other than the Barberini ivory) to survive, since all other fragments of such diptychs are from side panels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5084">'''Judy Small''', is a judge of the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia]] who was previously an Australian entertainer, folk singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Known for her feminist, often patriotic, and political songs, usually following a traditional theme, she  produced twelve albums, hundreds of songs and has been described as being among the most popular political singers in Australia, with many such songs, based on topical factual events like the [[Montreal Massacre]], and she enjoys to sing about real people and issues, stating "If an audience comes away thinking about issues it is a worthwhile performance". She toured the country and internationally, playing primarily in clubs and pubs, and at various conventions.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090109133402/http://www.greenleft.org.au/1993/107/5828].

==Biography==
Judy Small was born in [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales]]. She moved to Sydney in 1972, studying psychology and began her career as a singer and songwriter in the late 1970s, inspired by the folk boom of the 1960s and describing her influences as such folk singers as [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Joan Baez]] and [[The Seekers]]. She now lives in [[Melbourne]]. Her songs have been recorded by [[Ronnie Gilbert]], [[Eric Bogle]], [[The McCalmans]], [[The Corries]], [[Charlie King (folk singer)|Charlie King]] and [[Priscilla Herdman]] among others. Several have been translated into a number of languages. One of her successful ballads is "The White Bay Paper Seller", based on newspaper seller and Sydney icon Beatrice Bush. Apart from her own repertoire she is a great interpreter of song both traditional and contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.com/artists/judy-small/biography/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judysmall.com.au/2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful performance at the [[Vancouver Folk Music Festival]] in 1982 she became a full-time singer-songwriter. Over the next the 16 years, she regularly toured in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand. In 1990, she received the "Mo" Award - [[Mo Awards]] for Australian Folk Performer of the Year and in 1997 was the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]] Artist of the Year. She was also invited to Beijing for the United Nations Women's Conference NGO Forum - [[UN]] in 1995, where she sang to thousands of women from all over the world. People had been asking for some years for Judy Small, to release an album recorded live, so they can hear her introductions and stories of her songs, which have become much a part of the show, as her actual concert performance, so a concert was recorded called "Live at the Artery" in her  home town of Melbourne and subsequently was released as a double CD Collection set, spanning her 35-plus years of hits.

Judy Small retired from full-time performance in 1998. She became a family lawyer in Melbourne working for [[Victoria Legal Aid]], but continued to write new songs and to perform regularly. In March 2013, she was appointed to a position with the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, and retired fully from performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2013/First%20quarter/28March2013-AppointmentstotheFederalMagistratesCourtofAustralia.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507083525/http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2013/First%20quarter/28March2013-AppointmentstotheFederalMagistratesCourtofAustralia.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judysmall.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

Judy Small's songs cover a wide range of topics and styles, especially social justice, equity and harmony with a particular emphasis on [[feminism]] and [[peace]]. Among the most popular are "Mothers, Daughters, Wives", "Women of Our Time", "One Voice in the Crowd" and "Global Village".

==Awards and recognition==
In 1990, she was awarded the [[Mo Award]] for Australian Folk Performer of the Year. In 1997 she was the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]] Artist of the Year. In 1995, she was invited to Beijing for the United Nations Women's Conference NGO Forum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.com/artists/judy-small/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Australian Rhymes Magazine named her club/pub entertainer/performer of the year,  in which she released a double CD, tie-in collection of her greatest hits, titled "Live at the Artery".

==Description==

''La Barca de Aqueronte'' is a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic]]-style painting based by Hidalgo on his reading of [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']] while in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pez/&gt;  It is Hidalgo’s interpretation of damned souls journeying across the [[River Acheron]] towards the gates of hell or [[Hades]].&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pez/&gt;  The protagonist of the painting is the boatman of classical mythology named [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]],&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pez/&gt; who is depicted as the personification of the merciless harvester of condemned souls with "eyes of coal" glaring forebodingly from the shadows at the boarding commuters.  Charon is presented at the right side of the canvas as a lone figure with a shroud.  He was positioned in opposition to a red-colored sky.  Charon’s facade is forbidding and obscured in the shadows and his [[oar]] is glinting like the [[rapier]] of a slayer.  An [[:wikt:offset|offset]] on the left side of the image is the “diagonal disturbance” composed of plummeting and helpless unclothed bodies heading into Charon’s water vessel.  The “diagonal movement” on the left-side of the painting is described to be subdued shades of pink and blue in “strong tension” with the right side of the work of art.  This portion of the painting is the steady “solitary form” in black color going against the shimmering red backdrop.  Measuring 80.65&amp;nbsp;cm x 108.59&amp;nbsp;cm, ''La barca de Aqueronte'' is a "companion piece" to Hidalgo’s other painting, ''[[La Laguna Estigia]]'' ([[The River Styx]]).&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pez/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Felix Resureccion Hidalgo &amp; the Generation of 1872|last=Roces|first=Alfredo|publisher=Eugenio Lopez Foundation, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=971-1005-32-8|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==

Hidalgo finished ''La barca de Aqueronte'' in 1887 when he was thirty-four years old.  Hidalgo made charcoal studies of Charon that are representative of the divine and nude [[Greco-Roman]] heroes molded in the [[Renaissance]] style. These studies can also be found in the Lopez Museum and Library collection. On the same year, [[José Rizal]], key leader of the [[Propaganda Movement]], published the novel ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]''.&lt;ref name=Pez&gt;[http://pezseum.blogspot.com/2009/11/navigating-underworld-felix.html  Felix R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3785">'''The Little Carib Theatre''' (LCT) was established in Woodbrook, [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], in 1947 by [[Beryl McBurnie]] "to showcase the vibrant and rich culture of the Trinbagonian people".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080319143419/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Places/places_Woodbrook.html A Brief History of Woodbrook], Nalis.gov.tt.&lt;/ref&gt; The first permanent folk-dance company and theatre in Trinidad, it has been described as "the mecca of West Indian folk dance".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fraser, [http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sunday-mix/Keeping-Little-Carib-alive-216253651.html "Keeping Little Carib alive"], ''Saturday Express'' (Trinidad), 20 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the only dance theatre of its kind in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Spark, [http://socanews.com/news/little-carib-theatre-brings-caribbean-dance-to-london "Little Carib Theatre brings Caribbean dance to London"], ''Soca News'', 29 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Little Carib Theatre was formally opened in November 1948. The foundation stone was laid by [[Paul Robeson]], who at the time was visiting Trinidad, and whom the founder Beryl McBurnie had met in New York.&lt;ref name=Raymond&gt;Judy Raymond, [http://caribbean-beat.com/issue-20/beryl-mcburnie-first-lady-dance#axzz3tRDzalgO "Beryl McBurnie: the First Lady of Dance"], ''[[Caribbean Beat]]'', Issue 20 (July/August 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pearl Connor]], [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/29/guardianobituaries1 "Beryl McBurnie" (obituary)], ''The Guardian'' (London), 29 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, the work of the Little Carib Dance Company had been recognised and celebrated overseas, having performed at such events as the Caribbean Festival of Arts in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1952, the [[Jamaica]] Tercentenary Celebrations in 1955 and the opening of the Federal Parliament of [[Toronto]] in April 1958. In the 1960s the Little Carib building had to be closed down and was re-built in three years.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;

Many of the plays of [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Derek Walcott]] were first staged at the Little Carib Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/NGO-pays-tribute-to-Derek-Walcott-296153751.html "NGO pays tribute to Derek Walcott"], ''Sunday Express'' (Trinidad), 12 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Banham, Errol Hill, George Woodyard (eds), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qtlUwQAvKxoC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=little+carib+theatre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Tro34hcYjL&amp;sig=xiv2RJgIbkbK4y2vALmeHO_aE8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR1ejom6fdAhUHEVAKHUk9DnMQ6AEwJXoECC4QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20carib%20theatre&amp;f=false ''The Cambridge Guide to African and Caribbean Theatre''], Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; where he held weekly theatre workshops&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt; as founding director, from 1959 to 1971, of what became the [[Trinidad Theatre Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changeperformingarts.com/artists/walcott.html "Derek Walcott"], Change Performing Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadtheatreworkshop.com/#!history/chp0 "History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708173538/http://www.trinidadtheatreworkshop.com/ |date=2013-07-08 }}, Trinidad Theatre Workshop.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Magicians Association of Korea''' (variously also translated as the '''DPRK Magicians Association''' or the '''Korea Magic Association of DPRK''') is the national [[magic (illusion)|magicians']] association of [[North Korea]].

== History ==

Though [[Kim Jong-Il]] had made efforts to develop magic on a [[Juche]] basis in 1971,&lt;ref name="newmagic" /&gt; it was not until 2001 that a dedicated nationwide magicians' society was established.  The Magicians Association of Korea was founded on 24 October of that year, with headquarters in [[Pyongyang]] and ten branches across Korea.  Its goal is to contribute to the development of performance magic in the DPRK, and to foster cooperation with magicians and magicians' organizations abroad.&lt;ref name="founded" /&gt;

In 2002, the association was making arrangements to join the [[International Jugglers' Association]],&lt;ref name="newmagic" /&gt; and it was admitted to the [[Fédération Internationale des Sociétés Magiques]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="fism" /&gt;

== Activities ==

The association has developed magic acts for performance in the DPRK and abroad.  These have included [[Kim Chol (magician)|Kim Chol]]'s series of large-scale performances at Pyongyang's [[May Day Stadium]] in April 2011, and a touring performance in China in August 2011.&lt;ref name="large-scale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="longway" /&gt;

== Notable members ==

* [[Kim Chol (magician)|Kim Chol]] (vice-chairman)&lt;ref name="large-scale" /&gt;

The '''Mausoleo Schilizzi''' (Schilizzi Mausoleum), also known as the '''Mausoleum of Posillipo''' or ''Ara Votiva per i Caduti della Patria'' is a monumental [[mausoleum]] built in the 1880s in a [[Egyptian Revival architecture|Neo-Egyptian]] style. It is located at [[Posillipo]], and overlooks the bay from atop a hillside.

==History==
The Mausoleum was commissioned by the wealthy banker Matteo Schilizzi as a mausoleum to be placed in the [[Cemetery of Poggioreale]], and the designs were by [[Alfonso Guerra]]. By the 1920s, the building was bought by the municipality, moved to the present site, and  to serve as a mausoleum for soldiers and patriots. The work was completed by Alfonso's son, Camillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mausoleo Schilizzi di Napoli Municipalità 1: cosa vedere e visitare, guida con informazioni|url = http://www.geoplan.it/luoghi-interesse-italia/monumenti-provincia-napoli/cartina-monumenti-napoli-municipalita-1/monumenti-napoli-municipalita-1-mausoleo-schilizzi.htm|website = www.geoplan.it|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caryatids at the entrance are by [[Giovanni Battista Amendola]].

'''Mediology''' (French: ''médiologie''), broadly indicates a wide-ranging method for the analysis of [[cultural transmission]] in society and across societies, a method which challenges the conventional idea that 'technology is not culture'. The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action.

==Overview==
The term was first coined and introduced in French as "médiologie" by the French intellectual [[Régis Debray]] in the "Teachers, Writers, Celebrities" section of his book ''Le pouvoir intellectuel en France'', (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's ''Transmitting Culture'' (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007.

The practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory.

Mediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as [[media sociology]] is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as [[semiotics]] does). It differs from the models put forward by [[communication studies]], in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of [[religion]]s, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology "would like to bring to light the function of [[Media (communication)|medium]] in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any [[milieu]]. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty [[linguistic]] or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which "material technologies and symbolic forms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; combine to produce things such as [[rituals]], [[architecture]], [[flags]], special sites, customs, [[typefaces]] and [[book binding]]s, smells and sounds, [[body language|bodily gestures and postures]], all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people.

Debray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non-media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the [[bicycle]], which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early [[modernist]] art and cinema.

A mediologist might thus make an examination "within a system" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of "the interaction between systems" (e.g. how [[painting]] and [[early photography]] influenced each other), or even of "the interactions across systems" (e.g. the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, [[telegraph]] and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars).

Debray is generally critical of some of the ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] (whom he sees as being overly [[Technological determinism|technologically determinist]]), and of the French [[sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. He also tries to step beyond [[Antonio Gramsci]], in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article.  The first, by the screenwriter [[Yvette Biro|Yvette Bíró]] (''Wide Angle'' magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's ''Vie et Mort de l'Image'', in which she claimed to have discerned "traces of a strong, vulgar [[Marxist]] school of thought".

The second review, by [[Pramod Nayor]] of the University of Hyderabad (''Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory'', Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of ''Transmitting Culture'' (2004).  In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School cultural studies]] ranging from "[[Raymond Williams]] through [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites [[Bruno Latour]], [[Eugene Thacker]] and [[Dwight Atkinson]] - have also examined science in relation to "intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture"

An article by Steven Maris in ''Fibreculture'' No.12 [http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue12/issue12_maras.html] similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in "the French academic scene" and that thus "Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal". Maris also notes that mediology "predates much of the [current academic] interest in networked cultures and new media".

Physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] have criticized Debray's work for using [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''. Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled "À l'ombre des lumières : Débat entre un philosophe et un scientifique", which so far has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main;jsessionid=DCNAOEIEBKEB?ISUM_ID=center&amp;ISUM_SCR=nwExternalServiceScr&amp;ISUM_CIPH=T9aJnOHAgwQV8T2hIQ5D3Du3v4I5zbXVbG3CxvkJy7s_&amp;ISUM_URL=rtE--JVQ7nRU10QjZURxmHAxjLLIW3DXPzmc29-XDq1dc8FTO2YT0563J3xcF8aK |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816160928/http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main |archivedate=August 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticisms, the six-volume ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (2004) wrote of Debray that "His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it." (Vol.4, page 1394).

A '''monologist''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|ɪ|s|t|,_|-|ɡ|ɪ|s|t}}), or interchangeably '''monologuist''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ə|ɡ|ɪ|s|t}}), is a solo artist who recites or gives [[oral interpretation|dramatic readings]] from a [[monologue]], [[soliloquy]], [[poetry]], or work of literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monologue |title=Monologue |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the entertainment of an audience.  The term can also refer to a person who monopolizes a conversation; and, in an obsolete sense, could describe a bird with an unchanging, repetitive song.&lt;ref&gt;"Monologist."

==Dramatic monologist==
A '''dramatic monologist''' is a term sometimes applied to an actor performing in a [[monodrama]] often with accompaniment of [[music]]. In a monodrama the lone player relays a story through the eyes of a central character, though at times may take on additional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis, Patrice (1998).

Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|9780802081636}}. "Monodrama", pp.&amp;nbsp;217–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era the more successful practitioners of this art have been actresses frequently referred to by the French term “diseuse”.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Technique  By Joseph Twadell Shipley 1964 p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - the December 21, 1935 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tennyson's Rapture: Transformation in the Victorian Dramatic Monologue  By Cornelia D.

==Diseuse==
'''Diseuse''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|d|iː|ˈ|z|ɜː|z}}, {{IPAc-en|us|d|iː|ˈ|z|uː|z}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|diseuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|diseuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; French for "teller", also called talkers, storytellers, dramatic-singers or dramatic-talkers,&lt;ref&gt;Theater Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaver County Times (Earl Wilson column) March 9, 1972 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  is a term, at least on the English-speaking stage, that appears to date back only to the last decade of the 19th century. The early uses of “diseuse” as a theatrical term in the American press seem to coincide with [[Yvette Guilbert|Yvette Guilbert’s]] tour of New York City in the mid-1890s.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mars Semi-Weekly Sentinel''. Lemars, Iowa. January 09, 1896. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine]]'' in a February 1896 article on Guilbert described the term as a "newly-coined and specific title".&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmopolitan''. February 1896. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TheaterDictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Diseuse is the feminine form of the French word ''diseur'' "teller", a derivative of ''dire'' "to say, to tell", which in turn came from [[Latin]] ''dīcere''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster's Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that over the last century or so few male actors became noteworthy performing solely as a dramatic monologist, though many well known actors have played in monodramas over their careers.

The publication ''Theatre World'' wrote in a 1949 piece: "In our time we have fallen under the spell of three remarkable women practising the art of the diseuse—[[Ruth Draper]], [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]], and [[Joyce Grenfell]]. Each of these great artists has the gift of crowding the stage with imaginary figures who become so vivid as to be practically visible, but as all of these artists happen to be members of the fair sex it could be assumed that they possess a magic denied the mere male of the theatre." The article goes on to suggest that [[Sid Field]] was an actor of comparable talents.&lt;ref&gt;"Whispers from the Wings", by "Looker On". ''Theatre World''. April 1949 (vol. 45, no. 291), p.&amp;nbsp;32. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVNXAAAAIAAJ Snippet preview on Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book "''The Guest List''" by Ethan Mordden, the art of the diseuse is defined as "a speaker of lyrics: in effect, one who uses the music to get to the words".&lt;ref&gt;The Guest List: How Manhattan Defined American Sophistication—from the Algonquin Round Table to Trumam capote's Ball” by Ethan Mordden (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 21, 1935, edition of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' an entertainment columnist wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The English language does not contain a word which perfectly describes the performance of Ruth Draper, who comes to the [[Regional Enterprise Tower|Nixon]] next Thursday for the first time in several years to give a different program at each of her four performances here. "Speaking Portraits" and "Character Sketches" are the two terms most frequently applied to Miss Draper's work; and yet it is something more than that. "Diseuse" is the French word, but that is more readily applicable to an artist like Yvette Guilbert or Raquel Meller. Monologist is wholly inadequate. The word "Diseuse" really means "an artist in talking" so that may be the real term to use in connection with Miss Draper.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joyce Grenfell wrote in ''Darling Ma: Joyce Grenfell's Letters to her Mother 1932–1944'', "What makes a good diseuse is a capacious verbal (and visual) imagination, and an excellent oral delivery. Call these witty ladies Diseuses of the Heart and Lungs. I do."&lt;ref&gt;Darling Ma: letters to her mother, 1932–1944 by Joyce Grenfell  1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral interpretation==

'''Oral interpretation''', sometimes called dramatic reading or interpretative reading, is the oral staging of a work of literature, prose or poetry, by a person who reads rather than memorizes the material. Typically they are performed by solo artists who – unlike players in a monodrama – do not assume or tell the story through any one character, but do so instead with oral nuances to bring the story alive with their interpretation of how the creator of the piece intended the story to be told.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Communication  By James Fernandes  2005 p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studygs.net/interpretive.htm |title=Studyygs.net |publisher=Studygs.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soliloquist==

The term soliloquist can apply to a monologist reciting a [[soliloquy]], usually from a play, to entertain an audience. Passages in which characters orally reveal their thoughts are probably most associated with the works of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/soliloquy |title= definition of soliloquy by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orchestre des Champs-Élysées''' is an orchestra that specializes in the performance of music from the period from roughly 1750 to the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt; That is, it covers the period from the flourishing of [[Haydn]] to that of [[Mahler]].&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt; It performs each work on instruments from the period of the composer's lifetime.&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt;

It was established in 1991.

==Venues==
As of 2010, the Orchestra has been in residence at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Elysées]] in Paris, and at the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels, for several years.&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt; It has performed in such venues as the [[Concertgebouw]] (Amsterdam), the [[Musikverein]] (Vienna), the [[Barbican Centre]] (London), [[Alte Oper]] (Frankfurt), the Philharmonic Halls in [[Berliner Philharmonie|Berlin]] and [[Gasteig|Munich]], the [[Gewandhaus]] (Leipzig), the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] (New York), [[Parco della Musica]] (Rome) and the Auditoriums of Dijon and [[Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre|Lucerne]].&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt;

==Critical reaction==
Writing for Music Web International, Margarida Mota-Bull wrote: "for the first time, I felt differently towards this Symphony and this is entirely due to Herreweghe's, and the Orchestre des Champs-Élysées's credit....there was a light at the end of the tunnel, a triumph over adversity, which I believe was an interpretation very close to the composer’s intentions....this interpretation of the "Scottish" by Philippe Herreweghe and the Orchestre des Champs-Élysées was truly wonderful and arguably, one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing."&lt;ref name="mwi-mota" /&gt;

'''Palestinian costumes''' are the traditional [[clothing]] worn by [[Palestinians]]. Foreign travelers to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of the costumes worn, particularly by the [[fellaheen]] or village women. Many of the handcrafted garments were richly embroidered and the creation and maintenance of these items played a significant role in the lives of the region's women.

Though experts in the field trace the origins of Palestinian costumes to ancient times, there are no surviving clothing [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from this early period against which the modern items might be definitively compared. Influences from the various [[empires]] to have ruled Palestine, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Rome]] and the [[Byzantine empire]], among others, have been documented by scholars largely based on the depictions in art and descriptions in literature of costumes produced during these times.

Until the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the [[fabric]], colours, [[Cut (clothing)|cut]], and [[embroidery]] motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.&lt;ref name=Grutz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm|author=Jane Waldron Grutz|date=January–February 1991|title=Woven Legacy, Woven Language|publisher=Saudi Aramco World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Image:Young women of Bethlehem in costume, Holy Land-LCCN2002725085.tif|thumb|widthpx|Palestinian young woman of Bethlehem in costume, Holy Land, between 1890 and 1900]]
Geoff Emberling, director of the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] Museum, notes that Palestinian clothing from the early 19th century to [[World War I]] show "traces of similar styles of clothing represented in art over 3,000 years ago."&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/06/061109.palestinianclothing.shtml|title=Palestinian women used clothes to make more than a fashion statement|publisher=University of Chicago News Office|date=9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanan Munayyer, collector and researcher of Palestinian clothing, sees examples of proto-Palestinian attire in artifacts from the Canaanite period (1500 BCE) such as Egyptian paintings depicting [[Canaanites]] in A-shaped garments.&lt;ref name=Twair&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat McDonnell Twair|date=October 2006|title=Sovereign Threads|publisher=Palestine Heritage Foundation|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Newsletter_December_2006.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munayyer says that from 1200 BC to 1940 AD, all Palestinian dresses were cut from natural fabrics in a similar A-line shape with triangular sleeves.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt; This shape is known to [[archaeology|archaeologists]] as the "Syrian tunic" and appears in artifacts such as an ivory engraving from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] dating to 1200 BC.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneal&gt;{{cite web|author=Denise O'Neal|date=September–October 2005|title=Threads of Tradition:An Exhibition of Palestinian Folk Dress at Antiochian Village|publisher=Palestine Heritage Association|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Threads%20of%20Tradition_Antiochian%20Museum.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Palestine: Ancient and Modern'' (1949) produced by the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, [[Winifred Needler]] writes that:{{quote|No actual clothing from ancient Palestine has survived and detailed descriptions are lacking in the ancient literature. In their length, fullness, and use of pattern these modern garments bear a general resemblance to the costumes of [[West Asia]]tic people seen in ancient Egyptian and [[Assyrian empire|Assyrian]] monuments. The dress of the daughters of [[Zion]] mentioned in [[Isaiah]] 3:22-24, with 'changeable suits of apparel,' 'mantles,' 'wimples,' 'hoods,' 'vails,' and 'girdles', suggests that feminine city fashions of Isaiah's day may have resembled modern Palestinian country dress.&lt;ref name=Needler&gt;{{harvnb|Needler|1949|p. 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Needler also cites well-preserved costume artifacts from late Roman-Egyptian times consisting of "loose linen garments with patterned woven bands of wool, shoes and sandals and linen caps," as comparable to modern Palestinian costumes.[6]

The shift from [[weaving|woven]] to [[embroidery|embroidered]] designs was made possible by artisanal manufacture of fine needles in [[Damascus]] in the 8th century. Embroidered dress sections, like the square chest piece (qabbeh) and decorated back panel (shinyar) prevalent in Palestinian dresses, are also found in costume from 13th century [[Andalusia]]. Each village in Palestine had motifs that served as identifying markers for local women.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt; Common patterns included the eight-pointed star, the moon, birds, palm leaves, stairs, and diamonds or triangles used as amulets to ward off the evil eye.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt;

==Social and gender variations==
Traditionally, Palestinian society has been divided into three groups: villagers, townspeople, and [[Bedouins]]. Palestinian costumes reflected differences in the physical and social mobility enjoyed by men and women in these different groups in Palestinian society.

The villagers, referred to in Arabic as ''[[fellaheen]]'', lived in relative isolation, so that the older, more traditional costume designs were found most frequently in the dress of village women. The specificity of local village designs was such that, "A Palestinian woman's village could be deduced from the embroidery on her dress."&lt;ref name=Weirp68&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Townspeople, ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''beladin'') had increased access to news and an openness to outside influences that was naturally also reflected in the costumes, with town fashions exhibiting a more impermanent nature than those of the village. By the early 20th century, well to-do women (and men) in the cities had mostly adopted a Western style of dress. Typically, [[Ghada Karmi]] recalls in her autobiography how in the 1940s in the wealthy Arab district of [[Katamon]], Jerusalem, only the maids, who were local village women, donned traditional Palestinian dresses.

Due to their nomadic life-style, Bedouin costume reflected tribal affiliations, rather than their affiliations to a localized geographic area.

As in most of the [[Middle East]], clothing for men had a more uniform style than women's clothing.

==Weaving and fabrics==
[[File:Scandein0012.jpg|thumb|Bedouin woman in [[Jerusalem]], 1880s]]
Woolen fabrics for everyday use were produced by weavers in [[Al-Majdal, Askalan|Majdal]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Ramallah]], and [[Jerusalem]]. The wool could be from sheep, goats or camels.&lt;ref name=Gillowp112&gt;Gillow, John (2010) ''Textiles of the Islamic World''. Thames and Hudson. {{ISBN|978-0-500-51527-3}}. p.112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kawar, Widad Kamel (2011) ''Threads of Identity''. Melisende. {{ISBN|978-9963-610-41-9}}. p.185.&lt;/ref&gt; Weaving among the [[Bedouins]] was and is still traditionally carried out by women to create domestic items, such as tents, rugs, and pillow covers. Thread is spun from sheep's wool, colored with [[natural dyes]], and woven into a strong fabric using a ground loom.&lt;ref name=Sunbula&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |title=Craft traditions from Palestine |publisher=Sunbula |accessdate=July 18, 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321111836/http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |archivedate=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linen woven on hand-[[loom]]s and cotton were mainstay fabrics for embroidered garments,&lt;ref name=Balfourp143/&gt; though cotton was not widely used until the end of the 19th century when it began to be imported from Europe.&lt;ref name=Gillowp112/&gt; Fabrics could be left uncoloured or dyed various colours, the most popular being deep blue using [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo]], others being black, red and green. In 1870 there were ten dyeing workshops in the [[Muristan|Murestan]] quarter of Jerusalem, employing around 100 men.&lt;ref name=Baldenp164&gt;Baldensperger, 1903,  p.[https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme35pale#page/164/mode/2up 164]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weir, ''Palestinian Costumes''. p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shelagh Weir, the colour produced by indigo (''nileh'') was believed to ward off the evil eye, and frequently used for coats in the Galilee and dresses in southern Palestine.&lt;ref name=Balfourp143&gt;Balfour-Paul, 1997, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigo dyed heavy cotton was also used to make sirwals or shirwals, cotton trousers worn by men and women that were baggy from the waist down but tailored tight around the calves or ankles. The wealthier the region, the darker the blue produced; cloth could be dipped in the vat and left to set as many as nine times. Dresses with the heaviest and most intricate embroidery, often described as 'black', were made of heavy cotton or linen of a very dark blue.&lt;ref name=Balfourp144/&gt; Travellers to Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries represented pastoral scenes of peasant women donned in blue going about their daily tasks, in art and literature.&lt;ref name=Balfourp143/&gt;

Because of the hot climate and for reasons of prestige, dresses were cut voluminously, particularly in the south, often running twice the length of the human body with the excess being wrapped up into a belt. For more festive dresses in southern Palestine, silks where imported from [[Syria]] with some from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Kawarp41/&gt; For example, a fashion of the Bethlehem area was to interlay stripes of indigo-blue linen with those of silk.&lt;ref name=Balfourp144&gt;Balfour-Paul, 1997, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashions in towns followed those in [[Damascus]], Syria.&lt;ref name=Kawarp41&gt;Kawar. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some producers in [[Aleppo]], [[Hama]] and Damascus produced styles specifically for the Palestinian market.&lt;ref name=Gillowp110&gt;Gillow. p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Weavers in [[Homs]] produced belts and some shawls exclusively for export to [[Nablus]] and Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of cloth for traditional Palestinian costumes and for export throughout the [[Arab world]] was a key industry of the destroyed village of [[Al-Majdal, Askalan|Majdal]]. Majdalawi fabric was produced by a male weaver on a single treadle loom using black and indigo cotton threads combined with fuchsia and turquoise silk threads. While the village no longer exists today, the craft of Majdalawi weaving continues as part of a cultural preservation project run by the Atfaluna Crafts organization and the Arts and Crafts Village in [[Gaza City]].&lt;ref name=Sunbula/&gt;

==Palestinian embroidery==
[[File:Peasant woman.jpg|thumb|right| Village woman, circa 1900]]
Diverse motifs were favored in Palestinian embroidery and costume as Palestine's long history and position on the international trade routes exposed it to multiple influences.&lt;ref name=PCAback&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/pc_background.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20050630085338/http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/pc_background.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-30 |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |title=Palestinian costume: Background }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the appearance of synthetically dyed threads, the colors used were determined by the materials available for the production of natural dyes: "reds" from insects and pomegranate, "dark blues" from the indigo plant: "yellow" from saffron flowers, soil and vine leaves, "brown" from oak bark, and "purple" from crushed murex shells.&lt;ref name=USAID&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/asalah.htm?2 |title=Palestinian Embroidery |publisher=USAID |date=September 2002 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024012528/http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/asalah.htm?2 |archivedate=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahin writes that the use of red, purple, indigo blue, and saffron reflected the ancient color schemes of the Canaanite and Philistine coast, and that Islamic green and Byzantine black were more recent additions to the traditional palette.&lt;ref name=Shahinp71&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelagh Weir, author of Palestinian costume (1989) and Palestinian embroidery (1970), writes that cross-stitch motifs may have been derived from oriental carpets, and that couching motifs may have origins in the vestments of Christian priests or the gold thread work of Byzantium.&lt;ref name=Weirp13/&gt; Simple and stylized versions of the cypress tree (saru) motif are found throughout Palestine.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt;

Longstanding traditions of embroidery were found in the Upper and Lower Galilee, in the Judean Hills and on the coastal plain.&lt;ref name=Weirp13&gt;Weir, 1970, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Weir on embroidery distribution patterns in Palestine indicates there was little history of embroidery in the area from the coast to the [[Jordan River]] that lay to the south of [[Mount Carmel]] and the [[Sea of Galilee]] and to the north of [[Jaffa]] and from [[Nablus]] to the north. Decorative elements on women's clothing in this area consisted primarily of braidwork and appliqué.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt; "Embroidery signifies a lack of work," an Arab proverb recorded by Gustaf Dalman in this area in 1937 has been put forward as a possible explanation for this regional variation.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt;

Village women embroidering in locally-distinctive styles was a tradition that was at its height in Ottoman-ruled Palestine.&lt;ref name="Chicago"/&gt; Women would sew in items to represent their heritage, ancestry, and affiliations. Motifs were derived from basic geometric forms such as squares and rosettes.&lt;ref name =PCAback/&gt; Triangles, used as amulets, were often incorporated to ward off the "evil eye", a common superstition in the Middle East. Large blocks of intricate embroidery were used on the chest panel to protect the vulnerable chest area from the evil eye, bad luck and illness.&lt;ref name=USAID/&gt; To avoid potential jinxes from other women, an imperfection was stitched in each garment to distract the focus of those looking.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; 
[[File:Bethlehengirlsintraditionaldresspre1918.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Girls in [[Bethlehem]] costume pre-1918, Bonfils Portrait]]
Girls would begin producing embroidered garments, a skill generally passed to them by their grandmothers, beginning at the age of seven. Before the 20th century, most young girls were not sent to school, and much of their time outside of household chores was spent creating clothes, often for their marriage trousseau (or ''jhaz'') which included everything they would need in terms of apparel, encompassing everyday and ceremonial dresses, jewelry, veils, headdresses, undergarments, kerchiefs, belts and footwear.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shahinp73&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, new influences introduced by European pattern books and magazines promoted the appearance of curvilinear motifs, like flowers, vines or leaf arrangements, and introduced the paired bird motif which became very popular in central Palestinian regions.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt; John Whitting, who put together parts of the [[MOIFA]] collection, has argued that "anything later than 1918 was not indigenous Palestinian design, but had input from foreign pattern books brought in by foreign nuns and Swiss nannies".&lt;ref name=Stillmanpix&gt;Stillman, 1979, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that the changes did not set in before the late 1930s, up to which time embroidery motifs local to certain villages could still be found. Geometric motifs remained popular in the Galilee and southern regions, like the Sinai Desert.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt;

==Men's clothing==
Some professions, such as the Jaffa boatmen, had their own unique uniforms. The horse or mule drivers (''mukaaris''), widely used between the towns in an age before proper roads, wore a short embroidered jacket with long sleeves slit open on the inside, red shoes and a small yellow woolen cap with a tight turban.&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger. 1903. p.[https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme35pale#page/340/mode/2up 340].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-1948==
{{Expand section|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Ramallah 2000.jpg|thumb|Front of dress (qabbeh) sold as cushion cover, Ramallah, 2000.]]
The [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] led to a disruption in traditional modes of dress and customs, as many women who had been displaced could no longer afford the time or money to invest in complex embroidered garments.&lt;ref name="Embroidering Identities"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saca|first1=Iman|title=Embroidering Identities: A Century of Palestinian Clothing|date=2006|publisher=THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE MUSEUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO|isbn=1-885923-49-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Widad Kawar]] was among the first to recognize the new styles developing after the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]].

New styles began to appear in the 1960s. For example, the "six-branched dress" named after the six wide bands of embroidery running down from the waist.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Shelagh (1989) ''Palestinian Costume''. British Museum. {{ISBN|0-7141-1597-5}}. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  These styles came from the refugee camps, particularly after 1967. Individual village styles were lost and replaced by an identifiable "Palestinian" style.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Margarita (2007) ''PALESTINIAN EMBROIDERY MOTIVES. A Treasury of Stiches 1850-1950''. Melisende. {{ISBN|978-1-901764-47-5}}.  p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shawal, a style popular in the [[West Bank]] and [[Jordan]] before the [[First Intifada]], probably evolved from one of the many [[NGO|welfare]] embroidery projects in the [[Palestine refugee camps|refugee camps]]. It was a shorter and narrower fashion, with a western cut.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Shelagh (1989) ''Palestinian Costume''. British Museum. {{ISBN|0-7141-1597-5}}. pp. 88, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Income generating projects in the refugee camps and in the Occupied Territories began to use embroidery motifs on non-clothing items such as accessories, bags and purses. With the evolution of the different groups distinct styles are beginning to be appear. Sulafa the UNRWA project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unspecial.org/UNS623/UNS_623_T30.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the Gaza Strip has exhibited work at [[Museum of International Folk Art|Santa Fe]] in America. Atfaluna,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atfaluna.net/crafts/index.php?categoryID=135&lt;/ref&gt; also from Gaza, working with deaf people, sells its products through the internet. West Bank groups include the Bethlehem Arabs Women's Union,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bethlehemwomenarabunion.org/embroidery.html&lt;/ref&gt; Surif Women's Cooperative,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/2701&lt;/ref&gt; Idna,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hadeel.org/index.php?main_page=manufacturers_about&amp;manufacturers_about_id=15&lt;/ref&gt; the Melkite Embroidery Project (Ramallah).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.melkitecenter.ps/&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lebanon]] Al-Badia,&lt;ref&gt;http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/360/362/najdeh/images/embroidery/&lt;/ref&gt; working in the Refugee Camps, is known for high quality embroidery in silk thread on dresses made of linen. The Jerusalem-based [[Fair Trade]] organisation Sunbula,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunbula.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is working to improve the quality and presentation of items so that they can be sold in European, American and Japanese markets.

==Geography==
*[[Jerusalem]]: The Jerusalem elite followed [[Damascus]] fashions which in turn were influenced by those of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court in [[Istambul]]. Fabrics were imported from Syria with several specialist shops on the [[Mamilla|Mamilla Road]]. Wedding dresses were ordered from [[Aleppo]] and [[Turkey]]. From the beginning of the 20th century the upper classes began to wear European styles.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar, Widad Kamel (2011) ''Threads of Identity''. Melisende. {{ISBN|978-9963-610-41-9}}. pp. 41,177,179,191.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Galilee]]: Collections reveal that there was a distinct Galilee women's style from at least the middle of the 19th century. The standard form was a coat (Jillayeh), tunic and trousers.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Sheilagh (2006) ''Embroidery from Palestine''. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-2573-2}}. pp. 17, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-stitch was not used much, the women preferring patchwork patterns of diamond and rectangular shapes, as well as other embroidery techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Kawal. p.287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Margarita (2007) ''Palestinian Embroidery Motives. A Treasury of Stitches 1850-1950''. Rimal. {{ISBN|978-1-901764-47-5}}. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, [[Henry Baker Tristram|H.B. Tristram]] described costumes in the villages of [[Al-Bassa|El Bussah]] and [[Isfia]] as being either "plain, patched or embroidered in the most fantastic and grotesque shapes".&lt;ref name=Weirp80&gt;Weir, 1989, p.80, citing  H. B. Tristram's (1865) ''The Land of Israel, a Journal of Travels in Palestine'', p. [https://archive.org/stream/landisrael00unkngoog#page/n93/mode/2up 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the beginning of the 20th century Turkish/Ottoman fashions began to dominate: such as baggy trousers and cord edging.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Sheilagh (1989) ''Palestinian Costume''. British Museum. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-1597-9}}. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2006). p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Materials, particularly silks, were brought from Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the arrival of European colour-fast dyes the Galilee was an important area for the growing of [[Indigo dye|indago]] and [[sumac]] which were used for creating blue and red dyes.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nablus]]:Women's dresses from villages in the Nablus area were the least ornate in the whole of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner.  pp 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Brown, Sarah (1980) ''Palestinians and their Society. 1880-1946.'' Quartet. {{ISBN|0-7043-3343-0}}. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tahriri work.jpg|thumb|right|Modern couching stitch from Bayt Jalla traditionally used on panels of ''malak'' wedding dress.]]
*[[Bethlehem]]: Wadad Kawar describes Bethlehem as having been "the Paris of Central Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Both it and neighbouring [[Beit Jala|Bayt Jalla]] were known for their fine [[Couching|Couching Stitch]] work. This technique was used extensively in the panels for ''malak'' (queen) wedding dresses. The malak dress was popular amongst brides from the villages around Jerusalem. So much so that the panels began to be produced commercially in Bethlehem and Bayt Jalla. Amongst the wealthier families it was the fashion for the groom to pay for the wedding dress so the work often became a display of status.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow. p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p.207.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ramallah]]: great variety of very distinguishable finely executed patterns.
[[File:Doll in Ramallah style dress.jpg|thumb|Doll in wedding-dress typical of Ramallah area  popular before 1948. Made by [[YWCA]] project in [[Jalazone]] RC. c. 2000.]]
*[[Lifta]] (near [[Jerusalem]]), and [[Bayt Dajan]] (near [[Jaffa]]) were known as being among the wealthiest communities in their areas, and their embroideresses among the most artistic. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm]

==Garment types==

===Basic dress===
*'''[[Thawb|Thob]]''', loose fitting robe with sleeves, the actual cut of the garment varied by region.
***'''qabbeh''';  the square chest panel  of the Thob, often decorated
***'''diyal'''; brocaded back hem panel on the Bethlehem dress.
***'''shinyar''';  lower back panel of the dress, decorated in some regions
*'''Libas'''; pants,
*'''Taqsireh'''[http://www.palestineheritage.org/Taqsireh_Velvet02%20002.jpg]; short embroidered jacket worn by the women of [[Bethlehem]] on festive occasions. The gold couching of the jackets often matched the dress. Simpler jackets were used over everyday dresses. The name is derived from the Arabic verb "to shorten", (Stillmann, p.&amp;nbsp;36),
*'''Jubbeh'''; jacket, worn by men and women,
*'''Jillayeh'''; embroidered ''jubbeh'', often the embroidered outer garment of a wedding costume,
*'''Shambar'''; large veil, common to the Hebron area and southern Palestine.

===Headdress===
{{main|Palestinian keffiyeh}}
[[File:Woman wearing Keffiyeh.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing fishnet pattern keffiyeh, Paris]]
The women in each region had their distinctive headdress. The women embellished their headdresses with gold and silver coins from their bridewealth money. The more coins, the greater the wealth and prestige of the owner (Stillman, p.&amp;nbsp;38);
*'''Shaṭweh'''[http://www.ntcsites.com/palestine/clothes/view.nhtml?profile=clothes&amp;UID=10009], [http://www.palestineheritage.org/Shatwehs%206.gif], [http://www.palestineheritage.org/dec_201.gif], a distinctive conical hat,  "shaped rather like an upturned flower pot", only carried by married women. Used mainly in [[Bethlehem]], also in [[Lifta]] and [[Ayn Karim|Ain Karm]], (in the District of Jerusalem), and  [[Beit Jala]] and [[Beit Sahour|Beit Sahur]] (both near Bethlehem) (Stillman p.&amp;nbsp;37)
*'''Smadeh'''[http://www.palestineheritage.org/wpe18726.gif], used in [[Ramallah]], consists of an embroidered cap, with a stiff padded rim. A row of coins, tightly placed against another, is placed around the top of the rim. Additional coins might be sown to the upper part or attached to  narrow, embroidered bands. As with the other women's head-dresses, the ''smadeh'' represented the wearers bridal wealth, and acted as an important cash reserve. One observer wrote in 1935: "Sometimes you see a gap in the row of coins and you guess that that a doctor's bill has had to be paid, or the husband in America has failed to send money" (quoted in Stillman, p.&amp;nbsp;53.)
*'''Araqiyyeh'''[http://www.palestineheritage.org/Iraqiyyeh.gif], used in  [[Hebron]]. The words ''araqiyyeh'' and ''taqiyyeh'' have been used since the Middle Ages in the Arab world  to denote small, close-fitting head-caps, usually of cotton, which were used by both sexes. The original purpose was to absorb sweat (Arab: "araq"). In the whole of Palestine the word  ''taqiyyeh''  continued to be used about the simple scull-cap used nearest to the hair. In the Hebron area, however, the word ''araqiyyeh''  came to denote the embroidered cap with a pointed top a married woman would wear over her ''taqiyyeh''. During her engagement period a woman of the Hebron area would sow and embroider her  ''araqiyyeh'', and embellish the rim with coins from her bridal money. The first time she would wear her  ''araqiyyeh'' would be on her wedding day. (Stillman, p.&amp;nbsp;61)

The styles of [[headwear]] for men have always been an important indicator of a man's civil and religious status as well as his political affiliation: A [[turban]] being worn by a townsman and a [[kaffiyeh]] by a countryman. A white turban signifying an Islamic judge ''[[qadi]]''. In the 1790s, the Ottoman authorities instructed the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hassan al-Husayni, to put a stop to the fashion of wearing green and white turbans which they regarded as the prerogative of officially appointed judges.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe, Illan (2010) ''The Rise and Fall of a Palestinian Dynasty. The Husaynis 1700-1968''. Saqi, {{ISBN|978-0-86356-460-4}}. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, white turbans were also worn by supporters of the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Yaman political faction]], while the opposing [[Qais]] faction wore red.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 66, citing p. 141 of C. T. Wilson (1906) ''Peasant Life in the Holy Land'', London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] reported that Muslim men from Jerusalem usually wore white linen turbans, called ''shash''. In Hebron, it would be of red and yellow silk, in Nablus red and white cotton. Men in Jaffa wore white and gold turbans, similar to the style in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Palestine Exploration Fund. Quarterly Statement for 1912. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; A green turban indicated a descendant of [[Muhammed]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger, Philip G. (1905) ''The Immovable East''. Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Report. p. [https://archive.org/stream/immovableeaststu00balduoft#page/n83/mode/2up/search/green 51].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1880 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] style of [[tarboush]] or fez began to replace the turban amongst the [[effendi]] class.&lt;ref&gt;Weir Shelagh ''Palestinian Costume'' p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tarboush'' had been preceded by a rounder version with blue tassel which originated from the [[Magreb]]. The arrival of the more vertical [[Young Turk]] version was emancipating for the Christian communities since it was worn by all civil and military officials regardless of religion. The exception being the [[Armenians]] who adopted a black style.&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger, 1903,  p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme35pale#page/342/mode/2up 342].&lt;/ref&gt;

The European styles, ''Franjy'' hat (''burneiTah''), were not adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger, 1903,  p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme35pale#page/64/mode/2up 65]&lt;/ref&gt;

The kaffiyeh replaced the tarbush in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shoes===
Residents of the major towns, [[Jerusalem]], [[Jaffa]], [[Ramleh]], [[Lydd]], [[Hebron]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Nablus]], wore soft white sheepskin shoes with the point in front turned up: low cut, not above the ankle, and yellow for men. Before the mid-19th century non-Muslims wore black shoes. Village men wore a higher style fastened at the front with a leather button which provided protection from thorns in the fields. Bedouin wore sandals, made by wandering shoemakers, usually Algerian Jews.  The Arabic name for sandal, ''na'l'', is identical to that used in the Bible. On special occasions Bedouin men wore long red boots with blue tassels and iron heels, ''jizmet'', which were made in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger, Philip G. (1903) ''Palestine Exploration Fund Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections of Palestinian costumes==
Examples of Palestinian costumes and related artifacts are housed in several museums and collections, both public and private.

===Public collections===
[[File:OIMPalcost3cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bride's wedding attire from [[Bayt Jibrin]] in an exhibition at [[Oriental Institute, Chicago]]. ]]
The following is a list of some of the public collections:
*[[British Museum]] in [[London]]. The British Museum holds over 1,000 pre-1948 items in its Palestinian costume collection. Though not on permanent display, highlights of the collection were featured in Shelagh Weir's major 1989 "Palestinian costume" exhibition. Weir's monograph remains the seminal publication on traditional Palestinian costume.
*The [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]] holds one of the most sizable collections of Palestinian costumes. In 1986-7, the Museum held a major exhibit, "Embroideries from the Holy Land" and, in 1988, published Ziva Amir's ''The Development and Dissemination of the Chest-Panel of the Bethlehem Embroidery''. An [[art historian]], Amir traces the development of motifs (e.g., the floral vase) and the geographic spread of styles. An Israeli, Amir worked closely with Palestinian locals in Gaza and the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Shifra Epstein in ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 104, No. 412. (Spring, 1991), pp. 229-231. (JSTOR)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Providence Black Repertory Company (Black Rep)''' was a 501c3 [[non profit]] [[arts]] organization based in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], USA. It offered programming inspired by the cultural traditions of the [[African Diaspora]] in Theater, Education, and Public Programs. It operated from 1996 till 2009.

==History==
Founded in 1996 by Artistic/Executive Director Donald W. King, and Chairman Michael S. Van Leesten, The Providence Black Repertory Company grew from a public program at [[AS220]] called Xxodus Presents Miss Fannie's Soul Food Kitchen. Black Rep produced its first stage production, The Island, on the third floor of a former print shop on Washington St. in [[Downcity Providence]].

Ten years later, Black Rep was located at 276 Westminster St. in a facility that includes performance and rehearsal space as well as a café and lounge. Black Rep offers programming such as a Latin Jazz series, drumming workshops for youth, premiers of new American plays, and Sound Session, a music festival produced in partnership with The City of Providence's Department of Art, Culture &amp; Tourism.  Across the three program areas Black Rep contextualizes artistic work through humanities panels, discussions, printed materials, and outreach.

In 2006, Black Rep celebrated its 10th Anniversary as a Downcity Providence cultural institution.

According to a 2/1/2010 article published in the Providence Journal, "Established in 1996, '''the Black Rep was closed in December 2009''' after the organization failed to keep a positive cash flow. The group was granted a hardship request to throw its annual New Year’s Eve party, in the hopes that revenue from the event could have helped pay off some debt. It wasn’t enough...".

==Theater==

The Theater experience at the Black Rep is informed by an approach that places the deliberate investigation of cultural, social, historical and political consciousness and conscience at the center of the creative process.  Each season includes three mainstage productions and three readings of new American plays through the First Look Reading Series for plays in development.  Mainstage productions have included plays by [[Amiri Baraka]], Aisha Rahman, [[Athol Fugard]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Sam Shepard]], Cheryl West, [[María Irene Fornés]], and [[August Wilson]], as well as original stage adaptations of the poetry of [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Kevin Young (poet)]].  Each December, The Black Rep’s Affiliate Artist company develops a workshop production showcasing its own work in process while providing a chance for audiences to be part of its development.

==Public Programs==

Black Rep’s Public Programs present live music, poetry, and other performance-based art of the African Diaspora six nights a week in the Xxodus Café. Each week night of public programming is informed by a particular musical tradition of the African Diaspora. Monday is Polyphonic, an open mic for artists working in forms of musical expression deriving from the Blues (Hip Hop, Acoustic Solo, Rock etc.). Tuesday is Maroon Society, Black Rep's Caribbean Culture series where selectors spin Reggae, Dub, Ska, and Dancehall. Wednesday is Latin Jazz &amp; Salsa. Thursdays is Afro-Sonic, a Deep House night with live West African drumming. Friday is Ecclection, a night for Hip Hop, R&amp;B, Funk and Soul. Saturday is the Neon Soul Cabaret, which plays host to Black Rep's house band, [http://www.myspace.com/neonsoulcollective Neon Soul Collective] - a group indebted to the various styles of music played in the café throughout the week.  Each season of Public Programs culminates with [http://www.providencesoundsession.com Providence Sound Session], a genre-defying summer music festival co-produced with The City of Providence's Department of Art, Culture &amp; Tourism.

==Education==

Each season is accompanied by Education programs, including student matinees, in-school residencies, and after-school workshops.  Artist Educators bring Black Rep’s interdisciplinary approach into the community through workshops in music, dance, theater, poetry and video production.  Teaching methodologies stress collaboration and value students’ cultural heritage and experience, with the goal of developing youth and adults who recognize the importance and power of the art and culture of the African Diaspora and embrace the values of community and democracy that are part of these traditions.

==Artist Development==

Black Rep is committed to Artist Development, offering opportunities for musicians and performers to participate in master classes, workshops, and career development activities.  At Black Rep, local artists have an opportunity to network, share resources, and build their careers through employment.
Artists who look to the organization to provide them with creative opportunities come from many different places of cultural origin. Almost 86% are locally or regionally based in Rhode Island and Southeastern New England, 11% are based in New York, and 3% are based in other states, or internationally. The Company has attracted artists from [[Nigeria]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Local artists who have worked at Black Rep identify as African-American, Haitian, Cape Verdean, Hispanic/Latino, Caribbean, Native American, Caucasian/White, Mixed Heritage and Filipino.

==Partnerships==

The Black Rep had partnerships and collaborations with local cultural and educational institutions including [[Brown University]]’s Rites and Reason Theatre and [[Rhode Island College]]’s MFA Program in Performance and Society.  Collaborative projects include new play development, co-production, and mentoring of young artists.

==Awards and recognition==
The [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in Washington D.C. recently invited Black Rep to join their Capacity Building Program for Culturally Specific Performing Arts Organizations.  Other recognition includes the 2004 Arts &amp; Business Council of RI Jabez Gorham Award for Most Outstanding Arts Organization, 2003 New England Theatre Conference Regional Award for Outstanding Achievement in American Theatre, and the 2003 Citizens Bank Community Champion Award (in Education).

'''Putlog holes''' or '''putlock holes'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/putlog&lt;/ref&gt; are small holes made in the walls of structures to receive the ends of poles (small round logs) or beams, called [[putlog]]s or putlocks, to support a [[scaffolding]].&lt;ref&gt;''Putlog holes.'' In: {{cite book |date=2015 |editor1-last= Weyer |editor1-first=Angela |editor2-last=Roig Picazo |editor2-first=Pilar |editor3-last=Pop |editor3-first=Daniel |editor4-last=Cassar |editor4-first=JoAnn |editor5-last=Özköse |editor5-first= Aysun |editor6-last=Vallet |editor6-first=Jean-Marc |editor7-last=Srša |editor7-first= Ivan |title=EwaGlos.

A historically common type of scaffolding, putlog holes date from ancient Roman buildings. The term putlock and the newer term putlog date from the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0)© Oxford University Press 2009. Putlog, putlock, n.&lt;/ref&gt; and are still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Chudley, R., and Roger Greeno. ''Building construction handbook''. 8th ed. Oxford: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, 2010. 140-144. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Putlogs may be supported on the outer ends by vertical poles (standards), cantilevered by one end being firmly embedded in the wall, or cantilevered by penetrating the wall to provide scaffolds on both sides. Putlogs may be sawn off flush with the wall if they cannot be removed,&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Jean Pierre. ''Roman building: materials and techniques''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994. 151-152. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but exterior putlog holes are typically filled in as the scaffold is removed to prevent water from entering the walls. Interior putlog holes may be left open, particularly if not in a finished space.

The inconsequential size and the spacing of the holes meant that they did not affect the solidity of the walls, and in well-preserved castles, like [[Beaumaris Castle|Beaumaris]], the ancient putlog holes can be seen to this day.

[[Image:StackRemainderedBooks.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A stack of books with remaindering markings on the bottom next to the spine.]] '''Remaindered books''' or '''remainders''' are printed books that are no longer selling well and whose remaining unsold copies are liquidated by the publisher at greatly reduced prices. While the publisher may take a net loss on the sales of these books, they are able to recover at least some of their sunken costs on the sale and clear out space in the warehouses.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news | first=Roger | last=Cohen | coauthors= | title=Book Notes | date=1991-08-07 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1DF173DF934A3575BC0A967958260 | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-29 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of remaindered books may be marked by the publisher, distributor, or bookseller to prevent them from being returned.  "Remainder marks" have varied over the years, but today most remainders are marked with a stroke with a felt-tipped marker across the top or bottom of the book's pages, near the spine.

Only [[hardcover]]s and [[paperback|trade paperback]]s (paperback books, often larger than "pocket" paperbacks, sold "to the trade" or directly to sales outlets) are typically remaindered. [[Mass market paperback]]s ("pocket" paperback books sold through a third-party distributor) usually become [[stripped book]]s rather than remaindered books. A book that might retail for $20 will typically be purchased by someone specializing in remainders for $1 and resold for approximately $5.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

==In the United States==
Since the ''[[Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue]]'' decision of 1979 in the [[United States]] and its adverse effects on the keeping of inventories for several years, books in the United States have been remaindered much earlier and in greater quantities than prior to the decision. Since that 1979 decision, the number of unsold books that have simply been destroyed (by being burned or recycled into paper or cardboard) instead of being sold at a large reduction has also risen greatly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin O'Donnell, Jr]], [http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/how-thor-power-hammered-publishing/ "How Thor Power Hammered Publishing"] in ''[[The Bulletin of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]]'', Spring 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Robin Boyd Award for Residential Architecture''' is an [[Australia]]n architectural prize presented by the [[Australian Institute of Architects]] since 1981.

The award is presented in memory of the Australian architect [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] (1919 - 1971) and is awarded to houses that set new benchmarks in terms of meeting the client’s needs, responding to its site and providing shelter which is at the leading edge of house design. While the award recognises private residences, their outstanding design excellence has resulted in many of these homes being widely recognised as residential icons.

'''''Seeing Double''''' is a British musical-comedy film starring [[British people|British]] pop-group, [[S Club]]. Written by [[Kim Fuller]] and [[Paul Alexander (British writer)|Paul Alexander]], and directed by [[Nigel Dick]], the film mostly features songs from the group's [[Seeing Double (album)|album of the same name]] including "[[Don't Stop Movin' (S Club 7 song)|Don't Stop Movin']]" and "[[Never Had a Dream Come True]]".

==Plot==
The film opens with a creepy castle  in [[Hollywood]]: Victor Gaghan, an evil scientist, is creating his S Club clones and chanting the words "S Club, S Club, S Club" and as he says this he is joined by fans awaiting the group as they arrive in [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]] for their last show of their tour. After spending the day promoting and performing, the group gets excited about having some time off. Their manager, Alistair however shoots down their joy informing them that they will be leaving for Los Angeles at seven in the morning the next day. At the hotel, the S Club members ignore Alistair and after they get into their room, Alistair is attacked by the scientist's assistant Susan Sealove.

The next morning, the members of S Club awaken to find Alistair gone having been left with his bill. Instead of using a credit card that Rachel finds to pay the bill, they use it on pampering themselves and after going bankrupt Hannah thinks she is going crazy when she sees the cloned S Club performing live on TV at a nearby cafe. After the others start thinking they are uncanny lookalikes the members all decide to quickly leave the hotel and fly to LA but suddenly they are busted and thrown in jail and get wrongly accused of impersonating S Club and trying to run out on the hotel bill despite telling the jailer they are the real S Club and innocent.

In jail, they learn that the warden likes to dance and to escape, they sing "Don't Stop Movin'" and get to their friend Natalie. She helps them get to LA by disguising them as English World Cup football fans so that they can stop whoever is impersonating them and not get arrested again by the Spanish police.

In Los Angeles, the group tries but fails to get close to their doubles, so they decide to switch out their Hannah, Rachel and Jon for their copies. After getting the clones to tell them that they are copies, Bradley, Tina and Jo decide to do something about it after tracking down Gaghan based on his recent online purchases of S Club memorabilia including their underwear, only for them to get caught by his goons.

Both sets of S Club are taken back to Eagle Peak, (Gaghan 's secret mountain laborotory) where Gaghan tells to the originals that he is going to take over the world through music because celebrities attract more attention than politicians (as well as the obviously greater appeal in seeing naked singers emerging from the cloning tubes as opposed to politicians). The clones save the band and then both groups have to save all of the clones he has created including clones of [[AC/DC]]'s [[Angus Young]], King of Rock &amp; Roll [[Elvis Presley]], [[Will Smith]] as [[Men in Black (film series)|Men In Black]]'s Agent K, [[Victoria Beckham]] (as Posh Spice), [[Robbie Williams]], [[Eminem]], King of Pop [[Michael Jackson]], [[Elton John]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[George Michael]], Pop Idol star [[Gareth Gates]], and [[Groucho Marx]] (of the [[Marx Brothers]]). Both S Clubs sing "Who Do You Think You Are?" and the original group is able to stop the place from self-destructing whilst the Michael Jackson clone stops Gaghan and Sealove from escaping in their helicopter. Jon then says how they have released a new bunch of cloned pop acts including [[Britney Spears]], [[Nsync]], and [[Nelly Furtado]] into the world and that they should be quiet about it. Clone Alistair suddenly appears and tries to kill the real S Club when suddenly the real Alistair knocks him out. Dr Gaghan and Sealove are later arrested and the group wonder what to do with their clones when Alistair reminds them of their very busy schedules.

At the end, the real S Club are seen at the beach and the clones are taking their place. They have decided that the clones will take their place when they want a holiday, and the same vice versa. (It is also mentioned that the clones are getting paid in boomerangs.) The Gareth Gates clone is also seen talking to Rachel and the film ends.

==Production==
The film only had 3 weeks to be filmed in, due to other commitments that was taking place with [[S Club]]. The film also saw [[Jo O'Meara]] suffering from intense back pains, meaning she was unable to be fully active during film, with several running shots of her having to be performed by a [[body double]]. O'Meara also sits out during several [[Choreography (dance)|dance routines]], most noticeably during "Dance" where the scene had to be re-written after she was unable to perform the routine due to the back pains. During all routines in the film, O'Meara is seen sitting out of the routines, with the other 5 members performing the routine as a five-piece. Due to O'Meara's back pains, she did a lot of [[voice over]] work, but her [[body double]] performed the active actions, such as the scene where O'Meara is being chased by [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatians]].

==Box office==

The film was released throughout the United Kingdom on 11 April 2003, after receiving its world premier in [[London's]] [[Leicester Square]]. The film received large publicity during a 2003 tour S Club did, alongside [[S Club 8]]. The film was also released worldwide, where it became a success mainly in the United Kingdom, where it opened at the box office at #4.

The film marks the final appearance that [[S Club]] did with [[19 Management]] which involved them acting. It also marked the movie debut of [[Gareth Gates]].

{{distinguish|Signal (magazine)|AFCEA#SIGNAL Magazine}}

'''Magazine ''Signal''''' with the subtitle "International Review of Signalist Research" was the periodical of [[Signalism]], international [[avant-garde]] creative movement. The magazine was founded in 1970 in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;Šram Godehard, [http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/12887 „Signal – internacionalna revija za signalistička istraživanja“], in: ''Signalizam u svetu'', Belgrade, 1984, pp. 14-15 (originally published in 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Founder and editor-in-chief was [[Miroljub Todorović]].

The movement was significantly boosted by the magazine, publishing multilingual works of neo avant-garde poets, fiction writers, essayists and visual artists from Europe, North and South America, Japan and Australia.

Nine issues of ''Signal'' appeared between 1970 and 1973,&lt;ref&gt;No. 1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; presenting a number of domestic and international artists, as well as printing bibliographical data about the avant-garde publications all around the world.

'''''The Battle of San Romano''''' is a set of three paintings by the [[Florence|Florentine]] painter [[Paolo Uccello]] depicting events that took place at the [[Battle of San Romano]] between Florentine and Sienese forces in 1432. They are significant as revealing the development of [[linear perspective]] in early [[Italian Renaissance painting]], and are unusual as a major secular commission. The paintings are in [[egg tempera]] on wooden panels, each over 3 metres long. According to the [[National Gallery]], London,&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paolo-uccello-the-battle-of-san-romano Paolo Uccello ''The Battle of San Romano'' NG583]&lt;/ref&gt; the panels were commissioned by a member of the [[Palazzo Bartolini Salimbeni|Bartolini Salimbeni family]] in Florence sometime between 1435 and 1460. The paintings were much admired in the 15th century; [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] so coveted them that he purchased one and had the remaining two forcibly removed to the [[Palazzo Medici]]. They are now divided between three collections, the National Gallery, the [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], Florence, and the [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.

The three paintings are:

File:Uccello Battle of San Romano Uffizi.jpg|'''''Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino unseats Bernardino della Ciarda at the Battle of San Romano''''' (dating uncertain, {{circa|1435–1455}}),  tempera on wood, 182 × 320&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], Florence
File:Paolo Uccello 016.jpg|'''''The Counterattack of [[Micheletto Attendolo|Michelotto da Cotignola]] at the Battle of San Romano''''' ({{circa|1455}}), wood panel, 182 × 317&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Uffizi panel was probably designed to be the central painting of the [[triptych]] and is the only one signed by the artist.  The sequence most widely agreed among art historians is: London, Uffizi, Louvre, although others have been proposed.  They may represent different times of day: dawn (London), mid-day (Florence) and dusk (Paris) – the battle lasted eight hours. 

In the London painting, Niccolò da Tolentino, with his large gold and red patterned hat, is seen leading the Florentine cavalry. He had a reputation for recklessness, and doesn't even wear a helmet, though he sent two messengers (the departure of the two messengers, depicted centre, top) to tell his allied army of Attendolo to hurry to his aid as he is facing a superior force.&lt;ref&gt;Private Life of a Masterpiece, BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground, broken lances and a dead soldier are carefully aligned into orthogonals, so as to create an impression of perspective. Similar to that of a tapestry, the landscape rises up in a picture plane as opposed to receding deeply into space. This illusion of a backdrop and a perspective theme resembling a stage, depicts the war as a theatrical ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Janson's History of Art" The Western Tradition Eighth Edition|last=Davis, Denny, Hofrichter, Jacobs, Roberts, Simon|first=|publisher=Laurence King Publishing LTD|year=2011|isbn=9780205685172|location=London|pages=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three paintings were designed to be hung high on three different walls of a room, and the perspective designed with that height in mind, which accounts for many apparent anomalies in the perspective when seen in photos or at normal gallery height.

Many areas of the paintings were covered with gold and silver leaf. While the gold leaf, such as that found on the decorations of the bridles, has remained bright, the silver leaf, found particularly on the armour of the soldiers, has oxidized to a dull grey or black.  The original impression of the burnished silver would have been dazzling.  All of the paintings, especially that in the Louvre, have suffered from time and early restoration, and many areas have lost their modelling.&lt;ref name="DG"/&gt;

The panels were a subject in the BBC series ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'', 2005.

==References in popular culture==
The dark horse in the Louvre panel, mounted by Micheletto Attendolo, can be seen painted in a tapestry, in the first segment ("Metzengerstein") of the 1968 omnibus film ''[[Spirits of the Dead]]''.
In the 4th Episode (Lucrezia's Wedding) of the 2011 TV Series ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]'', the London and Louvre panel is shown adorning the dining hall walls of the Florentine Prince when cardinal Della Rovere visits him in Florence.

'''''The Crystal Bucket''''' is the second selection of [[Clive James]]'s television criticism for ''[[The Observer]]'', for which the [[British Press Awards]] named him 'Critic of the Year' in 1981: "His contribution to the art and enjoyment of TV criticism over the past ten years has been immense. His work is deeply perceptive, often outrageously funny and always compulsively readable."

First published the same year, the volume covers 1976–79; its title is taken from [[Walter Raleigh]]'s ''The Passionate Man's Pilgrimage''.  It is dedicated to the poet [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]]. The compilation ends not with a review but with a tribute to James's friend [[Joyce Grenfell]] who had died at the end of November 1979:  "Joyce Grenfell's death gave pause for thought to all who knew her. Her faith was profound. So was her humour, which was so devoid of malice that some people called her sentimental. She wasn't. She was just greatly good."

Writing in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', [[Gavin Ewart]] expressed the view that James, "didn't get where he is today just by being funny. He is humane, liberal and compassionate.... What he writes is always pertinent and always witty. We owe him a deep debt of gratitude."

'''''The Entombment''''' is a [[glue-size]] painting on [[linen]]&lt;ref&gt;Also known as ''Tiichlein'' or ''[[Tüchlein]]'', a technique in which pigments were bound in glue and painted on a cloth treated with glue, it was a delicate and fragile technique. See Spronk, 8&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Dieric Bouts]]. It shows a scene from the biblical [[entombment of Christ]], and was probably completed between 1440 and 1455&lt;ref name="K509"&gt;Koch, 509&lt;/ref&gt; as a wing panel for a large hinged [[polyptych]] [[altarpiece]]. The now-lost altarpiece is thought to have contained a central crucifixion scene flanked by four wing panel works half its height – two on either side – depicting scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']]. The smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to Bouts' 1464–67 ''Altar of the Holy Sacrament''. The larger work was probably commissioned for export to Italy, possibly to a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] patron whose identity is lost.&lt;ref name="C44"&gt;Campbell, 44&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Entombment'' was first recorded in a mid-19th century [[Milan]] inventory and has been in the [[National Gallery]], London since its purchase on the gallery's behalf by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] in 1861.

The painting is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief. It shows four female and three male mourners grieving over the body of Christ. They are, from left to right, [[Nicodemus]], [[Salome (disciple)|Mary Salome]], [[Mary of Clopas]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]], [[John the Evangelist]], [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]].

It is one of the few surviving 15th-century paintings created using glue-size, an extremely fragile medium lacking durability. ''The Entombment'' is in relatively poor condition compared to [[panel painting]]s of similar age. Its colours are now far duller than when it was painted; they would, however, always have appeared as [[:commons:File:Dieric Bouts - The Entombment - WGA02961 Colour adjusted.jpg|less intense and brilliant]] than those of comparable oil or tempera paintings on panel.&lt;ref name="NGA2"&gt;Bomford, David.

==Painting==

===Description===
''The Entombment'' shows Christ's body, wrapped in a white linen shroud and still wearing a [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]], as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb. He is attended by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing. Among the group of mourners standing at Christ's side, the three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while the two men look directly at Christ; these gazes are reversed with the couple kneeling at his feet.&lt;ref name="NGA1" /&gt; The background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills. Bouts is considered an innovative painter of landscapes, even in his portrait work where they are included as distant views seen through open windows. The vista in ''The Entombment'' is regarded as one of his finest, and is typically  composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky.&lt;ref&gt;Potterton, Homan. ''The National Gallery, London''. London: Thames and Hudson, 1977. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dieric Bouts Entombment detail1.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Detail showing [[Nicodemus]] supporting the lifeless body of Christ. Loss of pigment is visible in areas of Nicodemus' headdress.]]

The [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] [[Nicodemus]] supports Christ as he is lowered, and can be identified by his similarity to [[Simon the Pharisee]] in another canvas attributed to Bouts, ''Christ in the House of Simon''.&lt;ref name="C41"&gt;Campbell, 41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|The Virgin]] wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]], and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid to let go of her dead son. She is supported by [[John the Evangelist]], who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, [[Salome (disciple)|Mary Salome]] stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. [[Mary of Clopas]] is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalen]] is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green [[tabard]] at the feet of Christ is probably [[Joseph of Arimathea]], who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name="C41"/&gt;

[[File:Bouts Entombment detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail showing the heads of [[Mary Salome]],  [[Mary of Clopas]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|The Virgin]]. The loss of paint (in the red cloth) and film of dirt (in the top right corner) are clearly visible.]]

''The Entombment'' is painted on linen tightly woven with 20 to 22 vertical and between 19 and 22 horizontal threads per centimetre.&lt;ref&gt;It is difficult to determine the direction of the weaving because the [[selvage]]-edge is missing, making [[weft]] from [[warp (weaving)|warp]] indistinguishable. See Campbell 40&lt;/ref&gt; The cloth is [[Spinning (textiles)|Z-spun]] (tightly spun) and [[Plain weave|tabby woven]]&lt;ref name="C40"/&gt; with [[flax]] perhaps combined with cotton.&lt;ref name = "L517"/&gt; The cloth support is lined, unusually, with similar but more finely woven linen [[hanging scroll|mounted]] on a wooden stretcher. Before the paint was applied, the linen was first mounted on a temporary stretcher and outlined with a brown border – now visible on the lower border – which was used as a guide to cut the picture down before framing.&lt;ref&gt;Guiding borders of this type are often found just under the frames of works from the period.&lt;/ref&gt; Glue-sizing consists of creating a [[Distemper (paint)|distemper]] by mixing pigments in water and then using a glue-base derived from boiled animal skin and other tissues as a binder.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton, 187&lt;/ref&gt; The pigments were applied to a linen cloth, treated with the same glue sizing,  fixed in turn to its frame by glue.&lt;ref name="J10"/&gt;  The paint saturated the cloth,  often leaving an image on the reverse side, which was lined with an additional cloth.&lt;ref name = "D187"&gt;Dunkerton, 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigments bound in glue had an optical quality that rendered  them opaque in appearance and unusually vivid. Unlike oil, which makes chalk appear translucent, chalk mixed in glue is rendered as stark white. Similarly,  more expensive pigments assume brilliant opacity in a glue medium.&lt;ref name = "D187"/&gt;  The whites are [[chalk]] in areas mixed with [[lead paint|lead white]], especially in the Magdalen's mantle and [[veil]], Christ's [[shroud]] and the Virgin's veil.&lt;ref name="C40"/&gt; The artist used four blue pigments, an unusual number for paintings of the period, with [[indigo]] predominating.  As a plant-derived pigment, indigo it has a tendency to fade over time.&lt;ref name="NGA2"/&gt; [[Azurite]] and lead-white line the under-paint, while the landscape contains indigo mixed with lead-tin yellow. The sky and Nicodemus' collar are painted with lighter and less intense azurite, while the Virgin's dress is azurite mixed with [[ultramarine]] and [[smalt]], a blue ground-glass pigment.&lt;ref name="C40"/&gt; ''The Entombment'' is one of the earliest Western pictorial works of art in which the use of smalt could be ascertained and its presence proves that the pigment was not invented during the sixteenth century, as had previously been believed.&lt;ref&gt;B. Mühlethaler and J. Thyssen, "Smalt", In : A. Roy [ed.], ''Artist's Pigments: A handbook of Their Characteristics'', volume 2, 1993, p. 113-130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entombment Bouts detail Landscape.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Detail showing distant hillside landscape in the left-hand corner. The nail holes are visible here in the skyline, and extend across the top of the painting. Note the layer of dirt across the midground and the black spot to the right of the second tree.]]
The greens are mostly [[verdigris]], although those predominant in the landscape are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is [[malachite]] mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from [[cinnabar]] and [[vermilion]] made from [[rubia]] and insect dyes.&lt;ref name="c30"/&gt; Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible to the effects of light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance.&lt;ref name="NGA2"/&gt; The black pigments are generally [[bone char|bone black]]s but in places from [[charcoal]].&lt;ref name="c30"&gt;Campbell, 30&lt;/ref&gt; The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.&lt;ref name="C40"/&gt;

The cloth support is visible in areas where the paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes can be seen in the lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was initially covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional [[joiner]]s who worked independently of the painter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 29&lt;/ref&gt; The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down.&lt;ref name="J62" /&gt; The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails;&lt;ref name="C40"/&gt; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.&lt;ref name ="L520"&gt;Leonard, 520&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condition===
Painting on linen cloth using glue size as a binder was at the time a relatively inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="J11"&gt;Jones, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as [[Gloss (material appearance)|matt]] and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work is one of the best preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using [[Oil paint|oil]] or [[Tempera|egg tempera]]. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.&lt;ref name="J62" /&gt;

The colours would have first appeared bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken the tone and render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by [[Conservation-restoration|restorers]], but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, it is impossible to do so without removing large amounts of pigment.&lt;ref name="NGA2" /&gt; The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's [[tabard]], once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.&lt;ref name="NGA2"/&gt;

{{double image|left|Dieric Bouts -The Annunciation - GCLA 85.PA.24.jpg|200|Dieric Bouts - Resurrection.jpg|200|''Annunciation'', [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], 90&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;74.5 cm. This tempera on linen may have been placed at the top left-hand corner of the polyptych.&lt;ref name="k514"&gt;Koch, 514&lt;/ref&gt;|''Resurrection'', [[Norton Simon Museum]], tempera on linen, 90&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;74.3 cm. It is believed to have been the lower image on the right wing.&lt;ref name="k514"/&gt;}}
It is possible to see the degree to which the technique allowed Bouts, in the words of art historian Susan Jones, to "[achieve such] sophistication&amp;nbsp;... to create both fine linear detail and subtle tonal transitions."&lt;ref name="J11"/&gt; Jones notes that the sky would have appeared with the same clear and pale blue that is still intact in a narrow strip along the top of the work, which has been protected from light and dirt by a frame. In its current condition the muted landscape appears to echo the sorrow of the mourning figures.&lt;ref name="J62" /&gt;

X-ray analysis shows that there were a few preparatory drawings made with chalk before the paint was applied.&lt;ref name ="L520"/&gt; This is left exposed in some areas, most noticeably in the Virgin's veil and mantle and in Christ's shroud.&lt;ref name="C40"&gt;Campbell, 40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infrared photography]] reveals little underdrawing but indicates that the canvas underwent several changes before completion; Mary Salome was repositioned slightly to the left, the sizes of Nicodemus' arm and shoulder were reduced, and the Magdalen's face was painted over the Virgin's mantle.&lt;ref name="C40"/&gt;

The cloth on which the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, probably by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece.&lt;ref name = "L517"/&gt; It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858).&lt;ref name="C38"&gt;Campbell, 38&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support.&lt;ref&gt;''National Gallery Technical Bulletin'', Volume 18, 1997. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The row of rust-stained nail holes running along the top of the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended.&lt;ref name="J62"&gt;Jones, 62&lt;/ref&gt; This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared.&lt;ref name ="L520"/&gt;

===Polyptych===
[[File:Dieric Bouts - The Crucifixion - RMFAB 8181.jpg|thumb|240px|Bouts' ''Crucifixion'' (before 1464).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dieric Bouts – ''The Crucifixion''|url=http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/nl/de-collectie/dirk-bouts-de-kruisiging?letter=b&amp;artist=bouts-dirk|publisher=[[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Robert Koch proposed that this ruined panel now in Brussels was the center piece of the lost ''Scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' polyptych.&lt;ref name="k514"/&gt;]]
[[Charles Eastlake]] saw the work in 1858 and again in 1860 during visits to Milan to purchase [[Early Netherlandish painting|Northern Renaissance art]] on behalf of the National Gallery.&lt;ref name="D27"&gt;Davies, 27&lt;/ref&gt; He also viewed three companion pieces but was told they were not on sale.  His notes described each of these other works, which he titled: ''Annunciation'' (now in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]), ''Adoration of the Kings'' (now in a private collection in Germany) and ''Presentation'' (or ''Resurrection''; now in the [[Norton Simon Museum]], [[Pasadena, California]]).&lt;ref name="k514"/&gt; These works are the same size as ''The Entombment'', have similar colouring and pigmentation and are painted using the same glue-size technique, but are not as well preserved. It is probable that all were re-lined and stretched at the same time by the same restorer, indicating that they were kept together until shortly before ''The Entombment'' was acquired by the National Gallery.&lt;ref name="C42"&gt;Campbell, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adoration of the Maji.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pen and ink copy of the ''Adoration of the Magi'' (or "Kings") by an unknown artist. [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]].]]
Art historian Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on the similarity of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part [[polyptych]] altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, 513&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 ''Altar of Holy Sacrament'', whose four wing panels are the same length as ''The Entombment'', he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places ''The Entombment'' on the upper right-hand wing, above the ''Adoration''.&lt;ref name="C42"/&gt;

The large centre canvas has not been positively identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged ''Crucifixion'', now in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;153.5&amp;nbsp;cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels.&lt;ref name="k514"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C42"/&gt; Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works had fallen out of fashion by the 17th century, and would have had more value as single panels.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance and attribution==
Bouts did not inscribe any of his paintings, which makes attribution and dating difficult. His developing skill with [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and unified [[vanishing point]]s is used by art historians to date his works from the period. Although its colourisation is among the best of his work, the perspective is clumsy in areas, thus the painting can be assumed to date no later than 1460. Bouts often quoted visual passages from artists and paintings that influenced his work, so the influences are well established and datable.  Along with the companion ''Resurrection'', British art historian [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] believes the work shows influences from [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent]]'' (c. 1435) and ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' (1440s), which places it after 1440.&lt;ref name="C44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell sees the influence of the ''Miraflores Altarpiece'' in the representation of Christ's dead body, while British art historian [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] speculated that a [[relief]] in the architecture of van der Weyden's center panel may have informed the positioning of Bouts' mourners. See Campbell 44&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Koch dates it to between 1450 and 1455.&lt;ref name="K509"/&gt;

During a period of aggressive acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of Britain's collection, it was acquired for the [[National Gallery]] in 1860 in Milan from the Guicciardi family by Charles Lock Eastlake for just over [[pound sterling|£]]120, along with a number of other Netherlandish works.&lt;ref name="C44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, Gerald. "The Economics of Taste: The Rise and Fall of Picture Prices, 1760–1960". London: Barrie and Rockliff, 1961. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Eastlake's notes mention that the works were "originally in the possession of the Foscari family".&lt;ref name="D27"/&gt; The Foscaris were a wealthy Venetian family which included [[Francesco Foscari]] who was [[Doge of Venice]] at the time the work was painted; the dramatic story of him and his son is told in [[Lord Byron]]'s play ''[[The Two Foscari (Byron)|The Two Foscari]]'', and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] opera ''[[I due Foscari]]''. There is no documentary evidence to substantiate the claim that the painting came from the Foscari  collection, and some art historians believe that representatives of the Guicciardis invented this provenance to impress Eastlake. [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] considers the provenance "probable", noting that a descendant, Fergio Foscari (1732–1811), an ambassador to Saint Petersburg, squandered his fortune and may have been forced into selling pictures belonging to the family.&lt;ref name="C44"/&gt; Campbell speculates that the painting was produced on commission for export to Venice, noting that unrolled linen would have been easier to transport than canvas, and that the row of holes just below the upper border could be explained if it had been stretched, mounted and framed by someone other than Bouts or a member of his workshop.&lt;ref name="C44"&gt;Campbell, 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The companion pieces in the Guicciardi collection (''Annunciation'', ''Adoration of the Kings'', and ''Resurrection'') were similar works in glue-size, though of lesser quality; Eastlake's notebooks mention that they were "not so good (not so well preserved)".&lt;ref name="k514"/&gt; Their style and size are similar to ''The Entombment'', suggesting that they were probably pieces that would have formed part of the larger polyptych.&lt;ref name="C40"/&gt; ''The Entombment'' was attributed to [[Lucas van Leyden]] at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Macfall, Haldane. "A History of Painting: The Renaissance in the North and the Flemish Genius Part Four". Whitefish, Montana: Kessinger Publishing, 1911. 34&lt;/ref&gt; though Eastlake thought that, given its emotional power, it might be a van der Weyden.&lt;ref&gt;Van Leyden and van der Weyden were often mistaken for each other due to the similarity of their surnames, both of which have many different spellings in the historical and art historical records.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b203"&gt;Borchert, 203&lt;/ref&gt; Bouts studied under van der Weyden, and was strongly influenced by his work.&lt;ref name="C41"/&gt; Davies proposed in 1953 that the figuration and pose in ''The Entombment'' may have been informed by a small [[grisaille]] [[relief]] in the arch of the central panel of van der Weyden's ''Miraflores Altarpiece''.&lt;ref name="C41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch, 515&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting arrived in London from Milan in 1861, but was not attributed to Bouts until 1911. Two known copies exist: an unsophisticated panel sold in Munich to a private collector in 1934, and an oak panel attributed to a follower  which is in [[Kreuzlingen]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="C38"/&gt;

The influence of Netherlandish painting spread to central Europe in the late 15th century, and many copies or designs based on the work of the Netherlandish masters were produced. The influence of Bouts' ''Entombment'' can be seen in the German artist [[Martin Schongauer]]'s c. 1480  engraving of the same name; it not only has compositional similarity but echoes Bouts' use of emotive gesture, posture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, Till-Holger.

"'''Thumbelina'''" {{IPAc-en|ˌ|θ|ʌ|m|b|ə|ˈ|l|iː|n|ə}} ({{lang-da|Tommelise}}) is a literary fairy tale written by Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] first published by C. A. Reitzel on 16&amp;nbsp;December 1835 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, with "The Naughty Boy" and "The Traveling Companion" in the second installment of ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]''. "Thumbelina" is about a tiny girl and her adventures with appearance- and marriage-minded toads, moles, and [[cockchafers]]. She successfully avoids their intentions before falling in love with a flower-fairy prince just her size.

"Thumbelina" is chiefly Andersen's invention, though he did take inspiration from tales of miniature people such as "[[Tom Thumb]]". "Thumbelina" was published as one of a series of seven fairy tales in 1835 which were not well received by the Danish critics who disliked their informal style and their lack of morals. One critic, however, applauded "Thumbelina".&lt;ref&gt;Wullschlager 2002, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest English translation of "Thumbelina" is dated 1846. The tale has been adapted to various media including television drama and animated film.

==Plot==
In the first English translation of 1847 by [[Mary Howitt]], the tale opens with a beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a [[barley]]corn in exchange for food. After the barleycorn is planted and sprouts, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a [[toad]] who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly [[fish]] and a [[butterfly]], Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a [[stag beetle]] who later discards her when his friends reject her company.

Thumbelina tries to protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits. She is finally given shelter by an old [[Wood mouse|field mouse]] and tends her dwelling in gratitude. The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a [[Mole (animal)|mole]], but Thumbelina finds the prospect of being married to such a creature repulsive because he spends all his days underground and never sees the sun or sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.

At the last minute, Thumbelina escapes the situation by fleeing to a far land with a [[swallow]] she nursed back to health during the winter. In a sunny field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking, and they wed. She receives a pair of wings to accompany her husband on his travels from flower to flower, and a new name, Maia.

In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s version of the story, a [[bluebird]] had been viewing Thumbelina's story since the beginning and had been in love with her since. In the end, the bird is heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower-fairy prince, and flies off eventually arriving at a small house. There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself, who chronicles the story in a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1992|pp=221&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hans Christian Andersen was born in [[Odense, Denmark]] on 2&amp;nbsp;April 1805 to Hans Andersen, a shoemaker, and Anne Marie Andersdatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An only child, Andersen shared a love of literature with his father, who read him ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' and [[La Fontaine's Fables|the fables]] of [[Jean de la Fontaine]]. Together, they constructed panoramas, pop-up pictures and toy theatres, and took long jaunts into the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:C.A. Jensen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Andersen in 1836]]

Andersen's father died in 1816,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and from then on, Andersen was left to his own devices.  In order to escape his poor, illiterate mother, he promoted his artistic inclinations and courted the cultured middle class of Odense, singing and reciting in their drawing-rooms.  On 4&amp;nbsp;September 1819, the fourteen-year-old Andersen left Odense for Copenhagen with the few savings he had acquired from his performances, a letter of reference to the ballerina Madame Schall, and youthful dreams and intentions of becoming a poet or an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years of rejections and disappointments, he finally found a patron in Jonas Collin, the director of the Royal Theatre, who, believing in the boy's potential, secured funds from the king to send Andersen to a grammar school in [[Slagelse]], a provincial town in west [[Zealand]], with the expectation that the boy would continue his education at [[Copenhagen University]] at the appropriate time.

At Slagelse, Andersen fell under the tutelage of Simon Meisling, a short, stout, balding thirty-five-year-old classicist and translator of Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]''. Andersen was not the quickest student in the class and was given generous doses of Meisling's contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You're a stupid boy who will never make it", Meisling told him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|2005|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meisling is believed to be the model for the learned mole in "Thumbelina".&lt;ref name="FrankP76"/&gt;

Fairy tale and folklorists Iona and Peter Opie have proposed the tale as a "distant tribute" to Andersen's confidante, Henriette Wulff, the small, frail, hunchbacked daughter of the Danish translator of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] who loved Andersen as Thumbelina loves the swallow;&lt;ref name="OpieP219"/&gt; however, no written evidence exists to support the theory.&lt;ref name="FrankP76" /&gt;

==Sources and inspiration==
"Thumbelina" is essentially Andersen's invention but takes inspiration from the traditional tale of "[[Tom Thumb]]" (both tales begin with a childless woman consulting a supernatural being about acquiring a child). Other inspirations were the six-inch Lilliputians in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', [[Voltaire]]'s short story "[[Micromégas]]" with its cast of huge and miniature peoples, and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s hallucinatory, erotic tale "[[Master Flea|Meister Floh]]", in which a tiny lady a span in height torments the hero. A tiny girl figures in Andersen‘s prose fantasy "A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager" (1828),&lt;ref name="FrankP76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|2005|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a literary image similar to Andersen's tiny being inside a flower is found in E. T. A. Hoffmann's "Princess Brambilla” (1821).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|2005|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and critical reception==
Andersen published two installments of his first collection of ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]'' in 1835, the first in May and the second in December. "Thumbelina" was first published in the December installment by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen. "Thumbelina" was the first tale in the booklet which included two other tales: "The Naughty Boy" and "The Traveling Companion". The story was republished in collected editions of Andersen's works in 1850 and 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=10 |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen: Thumbelina |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reviews of the seven tales of 1835 did not appear until 1836 and the Danish critics were not enthusiastic. The informal, chatty style of the tales and their lack of morals were considered inappropriate in children's literature. One critic however acknowledged "Thumbelina" to be "the most delightful fairy tale you could wish for".&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critics offered Andersen no further encouragement. One literary journal never mentioned the tales at all while another advised Andersen not to waste his time writing fairy tales. One critic stated that Andersen "lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry [...] and would not study models". Andersen felt he was working against their preconceived notions of what a fairy tale should be, and returned to novel-writing, believing it was his true calling.&lt;ref name="AndersenP335"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen|2000|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical reaction to the 1835 tales was so harsh that he waited an entire year before publishing "[[The Little Mermaid]]" and "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]" in the third and final installment of ''Fairy Tales Told for Children''.

==English translations==

In 1861, Alfred Wehnert translated the tale into English in ''Andersen's Tales for Children'' under the title Little Thumb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfUuAAAAMAAJ&amp;vq=little+thumb&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Andersen's Tales for Children|last=Andersen|first=Hans Christian|date=1861|publisher=Bell and Daldy|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Howitt]] published the story as "Tommelise" in ''Wonderful Stories for Children'' in 1846. However, she did not approve of the opening scene with the witch, and, instead, had the childless woman provide bread and milk to a hungry beggar woman who then rewarded her hostess with a barleycorn.&lt;ref name="OpieP219"/&gt; [[Charles Boner]] also translated the tale in 1846 as "Little Ellie" while Madame de Chatelain dubbed the child 'Little Totty' in her 1852 translation. The editor of ''The Child's Own Book'' (1853) called the child throughout, 'Little Maja'. 

H. W. Dulcken was probably the translator responsible for the name, 'Thumbelina'. His widely published volumes of Andersen's tales appeared in 1864 and 1866.&lt;ref name="OpieP219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. H.B. Paulli translated the name as 'Little Tiny' in the late-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eastman||p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[Erik Christian Haugaard]] translated the name as 'Inchelina' in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugaard|1983|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeffrey and Diane Crone Frank translated the name as 'Thumbelisa' in 2005.  Modern English translations of "Thumbelina" are found in the six-volume complete edition of Andersen's tales from the 1940s by [[Jean Hersholt]], and Erik Christian Haugaard's translation of the complete tales in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Classe|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
For fairy tale researchers and folklorists Iona and Peter Opie, "Thumbelina" is an adventure story from the feminine point of view with its moral being people are happiest with their own kind. They point out that Thumbelina is a passive character, the victim of circumstances whereas her male counterpart Tom Thumb (one of the tale's inspirations) is an active character, makes himself felt, and exerts himself.&lt;ref name="OpieP219"/&gt;

Folklorist [[Maria Tatar]] sees “Thumbelina” as a runaway bride story and notes that it has been viewed as an allegory about arranged marriages, and a fable about being true to one's heart that upholds the traditional notion that the love of a prince is to be valued above all else. She points out that in Hindu belief, a thumb-sized being known as the innermost self or soul dwells in the heart of all beings, human or animal, and that the concept may have migrated to European folklore and taken form as Tom Thumb and Thumbelina, both of whom seek transfiguration and redemption. She detects parallels between Andersen's tale and the Greek myth of [[Demeter]] and her daughter, [[Persephone]], and, notwithstanding the pagan associations and allusions in the tale, notes that "Thumbelina" repeatedly refers to [[Christianity|Christ‘s suffering and resurrection]], and the Christian concept of [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2008|pp=193–194, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager indicates that “Thumbelina” was the first of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the [[swallow]] as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen's identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP163"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Sale believes Andersen expressed his feelings of social and sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. [[The Little Mermaid]], for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina's inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply ''different''. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sale|1978|pp=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacqueline Banerjee views the tale as a failure story. “Not surprisingly,“ she writes, “”Thumbelina“ is now often read as a story of specifically female empowerment.“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/genre/childlit/fairytales3.html |last=Banerjee |first=Jacqueline |year=2008 |title=The Power of "Faerie": Hans Christian Andersen as a Children's Writer |publisher=The Victorian Web: Literature, History, &amp; Culture in the Age of Victoria |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susie Stephens believes Thumbelina herself is a grotesque, and observes that “the grotesque in children’s literature is [...] a necessary and beneficial component that enhances the psychological welfare of the young reader“. Children are attracted to the cathartic qualities of the grotesque, she suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidlavery.net/grotesque/The_Grotesque_In/grotesquechildrensliterature.html |last=Stephens |first=Susie |title=The Grotesque in Children’s Literature |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Rosenblatt in his essay "Thumbelina and the Development of Female Sexuality" believes the tale may be analyzed, from the perspective of [[Psychosexual development|Freudian psychoanalysis]], as the story of female masturbation.  Thumbelina herself, he posits, could symbolize the clitoris, her rose petal coverlet the labia, the white butterfly "the budding genitals", and the mole and the prince the anal and vaginal openings respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1998|pp=123,126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Animation===
The earliest animated version of the tale is a silent, black-and-white release by director Herbert M. Dawley in 1924.&lt;ref name="IMDb7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015411/|title=Thumbelina (1924)|date=27 September 1924|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lotte Reiniger]] released a 10-minute cinematic adaptation in 1954 featuring her "[[silhouette]]" puppets.&lt;ref name="IMDb6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213627/|title=Däumlienchen (1954)|author=boblipton|date=13 October 2013|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 [[Soyuzmultfilm]] released ''[[:ru:Дюймовочка (мультфильм, 1964)|Dyuymovochka]]'', a half-hour Russian adaptation of the fairy tale directed by [[Leonid Amalrik]].&lt;ref name="IMDb5"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188580/ |title=Dyuymovochka (1964) |author=TheLittleSongbird |date=19 October 2013 |work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the screenplay by [[Nikolai Erdman]] stayed faithful to the story, it was noted for satirical characters and dialogues (many of them turned into catchphrases).&lt;ref&gt;Petr Bagrov. ''[http://seance.ru/n/25-26/andersen/svinarka-i-pastuh/ Swine-herd and Stableman. From Hans Christian to Christian Hans]'' article from [[:ru:Сеанс (журнал)|Seance]] № 25/26, 2005 {{ISSN|0136-0108}} (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a Japanese version was released called ''Oyayubihime (Princess Thumb)'';&lt;ref name="IMDb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456456/|title=H.C. Andersens eventyrlige verden: Tommelise (Video 2005) - IMDb|date=29 March 2005|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 世界名作童話 おやゆび姫 ''(Sekai Meisaku Dōwa Oyayubi-hime; World Classic Fairytale Princess Thumb)'', a [[Toei Animation]] [[anime]] movie, with character designs by [[Tezuka Osamu]] from 1978. In 1992, The [[Golden Films]] released of ''[[Thumbelina (1992 film)|Thumbelina]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name="IMDb3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0135000/|title=Thumbelina (Video 1992)|author=TheLittleSongbird|date=8 June 1992|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Tom Thumb Meets Thumbelina]]'' afterwards. A Japanese animated series adapted the plot, and made it into a movie, ''[[Thumbelina: A Magical Story]]'' (1992), released in 1993.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clements |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Clements |author2=[[Helen McCarthy]]  |title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 |date=2001-09-01 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-64-7 |oclc=47255331 |page=399 |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] released the animated film ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]'' (1994),&lt;ref name="IMDb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111419/|title=Thumbelina (1994)|author=MissyBaby|date=30 March 1994|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]], with [[Jodi Benson]] as the voice of Thumbelina. 

The 2002 direct-to-DVD animated movie, ''[[The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina]]'', brought together the two most famous tiny people of literature, with Thumbelina voiced by [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185143/ ''The Adventures of Tom Thumb &amp; Thumbelina''], Internet Movie Database. Accessed Oct. 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2009 direct-to-DVD animated movie, ''[[Barbie Thumbelina|Barbie Presents Thumbelina]]'', where [[Barbie]] tells the story of the Twillerbees, with Thumbelina as the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001O3M370 |title=Barbie Thumbelina |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a modern-day tale. She meets Makena, the daughter of a wealthy couple, who became the Twillerbees' only hope for saving their home (which was being torn down due to a building construction by Makena's parents). At the end, Barbie waves at Thumbelina and her friends before the Twillerbees magically make a plant grow in the sight of a little girl, revealing it is a true story.

In 2015, a modernized version of Thumbelina appears in the [[Disney Junior]] series, ''[[Goldie and Bear]]''. In the episode ''Thumbelina's Wild Ride'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5339018/|title=Thumbulina's Wild Ride/Big Bad House Guest|author=|date=10 December 2015|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thumbelina (voiced by [[Debby Ryan]] with her singing voice provided by [[Shannon Chan-Kent]]) is hired to [[babysit]] for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink and slides into the river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbelina and can't wait for the next time she babysits.

===Live action===
On June 11, 1985, a television dramatization of [[Thumbelina (Faerie Tale Theatre episode)|the tale was broadcast]] as the 12th episode of the [[television anthology series|anthology series]] ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]''. The production starred [[Carrie Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/printer/faerietaletheatre.php|title=DVD Verdict Review - Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection|work=dvdverdict.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617011745/http://www.dvdverdict.com/printer/faerietaletheatre.php|archivedate=2011-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the tale was filmed in 1970 as an advertisement for "[[Pirates World]]", a now-defunct Florida theme park. Directed by [[Barry Mahon]] and with [[Shay Garner]] in the title role, this version was reused in its entirety as filler material for "Santa Claus and the Ice Cream Bunny", a rival to such films as "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "Manos: the Hands of Fate" for the title of most inept film ever made.&lt;ref name="IMDb8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134149/|title=Thumbelina (1970)|author=emasterslake|date=15 January 2011|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trouble''''' is a free independent monthly magazine for the promotion of visual and performing arts and culture. ''Trouble Magazine'', a company that is co-directed by artists Steve and Melissa Proposch, publishes and distributes the title in the [[AppStore]] and online at [http://www.troublemag.com/ troublemag.com].

==History and profile==
''Trouble'' was started in [[Newstead, Victoria|Newstead, Australia]], in 2004. The first issue featured a cover image of ''The Young Family'' (2002-3) by [[Patricia Piccinini]], which had been recently acquired by the [[Bendigo Art Gallery]]. The first magazine consisted of 16 black and white pages, and the 1,000 copies that were printed soon disappeared from around 50 chosen outlets around Bendigo and Castlemaine in central Victoria. In 2011 a CAB audit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auditbureau.org.au/about_cab.php Audit Bureaux of Australia – Circulations Audit Board]{{Failed verification|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the magazine’s circulation confirmed a figure of 20,000 free copies of ''Trouble'' being distributed nationally in Australia each month. ''Trouble'' magazine is edited and designed by Steve Proposch, and continues to publish contemporary material of particular interest to artists, performers and arts consumers.

In August 2013 ''Trouble'' developed an IOS app.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/app/id668359617?mt=8 Trouble magazine app]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

The documentary follows the story of [[Jon Alpert]]'s 1979 trip with Cuban politician [[Fidel Castro]]. Fidel had granted Alpert permission to accompany him on his plane trip to the [[United Nations]], where he was expected to give a speech as the president of the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned countries]]. Alpert, a young journalist with experience reporting on Cuban affairs, had expected to use the material for a piece with his employer at the time, NBC, only for the piece to never air, something that Suárez claims was done due to NBC not wanting to show Castro as a charismatic person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/tele/castro-viaje-fidel-5659310|title=Castro, en un 'Viaje con Fidel'|date=2016-11-29|work=El Periódico|access-date=2017-03-06|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro allowed Alpert access to both himself and his private rooms during the entirety of his trip, something that he had not previously granted to any journalists from North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2901078/0/tcm-emitira-documental-viaje-con-fidel-por-muerte-dirigente-cubano/|title=TCM emitirá el documental Un viaje con Fidel por la muerte del dirigente cubano|first=|date=|work=20 minutos.es - Últimas Noticias|access-date=2017-03-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpert later stated that he was initially extremely nervous but grew more comfortable around Castro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clasesdeperiodismo.com/2016/11/26/mira-completo-el-documental-un-viaje-con-fidel/|title=Mira completo el documental “Un viaje con Fidel”|website=Clases de Periodismo|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wall of Discovery''' is an environmental artwork that includes a 253-foot-long printed "blackboard" located in the center of the [http://www.scholarswalk.umn.edu/discovery/index.html Scholars Walk] on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus. This installation was designed to celebrate the discoveries, inventions and creations of alumni and faculty of the University that have brought significant changes to the world in which we live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarswalk.umn.edu/discovery/index.html|title=University of Minnesota: Scholars Walk|website=www.scholarswalk.umn.edu|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method used to capture the work was first to create an extensive list of notable U of M graduates in as many fields as possible. Extensive research was done by [[Minneapolis]] design firm [[LA ink]] that led to the finding of many original hand written notes and diagrams chronicling the discoveries by these scholars. The documents were then [[Image scanning|scanned]] and [[Image editing|retouched]], pixel by pixel, until they looked as if they were rendered in chalk on a chalkboard. 20 Glass edge lit panels were also designed to both illuminate the walkway and possibly inspire current students toward future discoveries.

An installation of this nature has never before been attempted by a major institution like the University of Minnesota.

The Artwork was submitted to the SEGD design competition in 2007 and won their "Honor Award" the highest achievement category. That same year it also received the AIA Minnesota Honor Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://segd.org/content/wall-discovery|title=Wall of Discovery|last=Makowski|first=Ann|date=2013-10-28|website=segd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his mid-teens, Bartram was noted for the quality of his botanic and ornithological drawings. He also had an increasing role in the maintenance of his father's [[Bartram's Garden|botanic garden]], and added many rare species to it.

In 1773, he embarked upon a four-year journey through eight southern colonies. Bartram made many drawings and took notes on the native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|native American Indians]]. In [[Timeline of Florida History|1774]], he explored the St. Johns River, where he had memorable encounters with aggressive alligators, and also visited a principal [[Seminole]] village at [[Cuscowilla]], where his arrival was celebrated with a great feast. He met Ahaya the [[Cowkeeper]], chief of the Alachua band of the Seminole tribe. When Bartram explained to the Cowkeeper that he was interested in studying the local plants and animals, the chief was amused and began calling him ''Puc Puggy'' (the flower hunter).&lt;ref&gt;Bartram, William.

University of Georgia Press, Athens, 1998,  p118&lt;/ref&gt; Bartram continued his explorations of the Alachua Savannah, or what is today [[Paynes Prairie]]. William Bartram wrote of his experiences exploring the Southeast in his book ''Travels through North &amp; South Carolina, East &amp; West Florida, the Cherokee Country, the Extensive Territories of the Muscogulges, or Creek Confederacy, and the Country of the Chactaws, Containing an Account of the Soil and Natural Productions of Those Regions, Together with Observations on the Manners of the Indians'', published in 1791 and which is today simply known as ''[[Bartram's Travels]]''. [[E. G. Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis]], in their book, ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'', name Bartram as "the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical forests of Florida."&lt;ref name=Squier&gt;{{cite book|last=Squier|first=E.G.|title=Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley|year=1848|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Washington, D.C.|page=46|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival in Georgia==
[[File:William Bartram Trail marker.jpg|thumb|William Bartram Trail marker in [[McIntosh County, Georgia]], USA]]
William Bartram arrived in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] on March 31, 1773. He learned that a Native American congress was to take place in [[Augusta, Georgia]] in June and was invited by Superintendent of Indian affairs, [[John Stuart (loyalist)|John Stuart]], to join the party that would survey a new land cession. After attending to some business Bartram travelled on to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], arriving in that city on either April 11 or 12. While he awaited the beginning of the Native American congress he travelled to the coast of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He first visited some rice plantations in [[Midway, Georgia|Midway]] then travelled on to [[Darien, Georgia|Darien]] where he was the guest of [[Lachlan McIntosh]].

In ''Travels'' Bartram related an incident at this point that most probably took place in 1776. As he travelled through the sparsely populated country of South Georgia, he encountered an "intrepid Siminole" who had resolved upon killing the next white man he met, but was disarmed by Bartram's unexpected friendliness.

During his trip along the coast Bartram revisited the region of [[Fort Barrington]] on the [[Altamaha River]]. John and William Bartram had discovered two new trees there in 1765, but they had no flowers for the season was late. William described these trees in ''Travels'', the [[Franklinia|Franklin tree]] (''Franklinia alatamaha'') and [[Pinckneya pubens|fevertree]] (''Pinkneya pubens''). The story of the Franklin tree is fascinating for it no longer exists in the wild and all living trees are descended from seeds collected by William Bartram.

Bartram then travelled to [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] and explored the area while he awaited the conclusion of the Native American congress. The conference ended on June 3, 1773 with the Treaty of Augusta. In return for dissolving their debts to the traders in Augusta, the [[Muscogee people|Creeks]] and [[Cherokee]]s gave up  674,000 acres of land in northeast Georgia. Bartram joined the survey party as it marked the boundary. An incident occurred at a place known as the Great Buffalo Lick when the Native Americans questioned the accuracy of the surveyor's course. When the surveyor said it was right because the compass told him so the chief, Young Warrior, said that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;… the little wicked instrument was a liar; and he would not acquiesce in its decisions, since it would wrong the Indians out of their land. This mistake (the surveyor proving to be in the wrong) displeased the Indians; the dispute arose to that height, that the Chief and his party had determined to break up the business, and return the shortest way home, and forbad the surveyors to proceed any farther: however, after some delay, the complaisance and prudent conduct of the Colonel made them change their resolution; the Chief became reconciled, upon condition that the compass should be discarded, and rendered incapable of serving on this business; that the Chief himself should lead the survey; and, moreover, receive an order for a very considerable quantity of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Bartram, William. ''The Travels of William Bartram, Naturalist Edition''. Edited with Commentary and an Annotated Index by Francis Harper. University of Georgia Press, Athens, 1998, p26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bartram returned to Savannah in mid-July and spent the fall and winter on the coast of Georgia, exploring the Altamaha River, writing his report, and preparing his seeds for shipment to England.

== To Florida again ==
In March, 1774, Bartram began his much anticipated trip to [[East Florida]]. He landed on the north end of [[Amelia Island]] and travelled through Old Fernandina to [[Earl of Egmont|Lord Egmont's]] plantation where modern [[Fernandina Beach, Florida|Fernandina]] now stands. Bartram was entertained by Stephen Egan, Egmont's agent, who rode with him around the entire island observing the plantation and Indian mounds. Bartram and Egan sailed from Amelia Island through the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] to the [[St. Johns River]] and to the Cow Ford ([[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]) where Bartram purchased a little sailboat. 
In three days Bartram landed at the plantation of [[Francis Philip Fatio]] at [[Switzerland, Florida|Switzerland]]. There he received information concerning the recent disturbances at Spalding's Stores. He paused the next day at Fort Picolata where he had failed as a planter seven years earlier.
Bartram then kept to the west bank, or Indian shore, the river being the division between Indian country on the west bank and English land on the east. He observed a [[Seminole Indians|Seminole]] village on the bluff where [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]] now stands and where he was invited to a watermelon feast that summer. Just south of Palatka, at Stokes Landing, James Spalding built his Lower Store where Bartram made his headquarters while in Florida. One day while working at his desk Bartram heard a disturbance in the adjacent Indian camp. Stepping outside he discovered his Seminole neighbors were alarmed by a large rattlesnake that had entered their camp. They entreated "Puc Puggy" to come kill the snake, which Bartram reluctantly agreed to do. Later he saw three young men approaching. He wrote:

{{Quote|I observed one of them was a young prince who had, on my first interview with him, declared himself my friend and protector, when he told me that if ever occasion should offer in his presence, he would risk his life to defend mine or my property. This young champion stood by his two associates, one on each side of him, the two affecting a countenance and air of displeasure and importance, instantly presenting their scratching instruments, and flourishing them, spoke boldly, and said that I was too heroic and violent, that it would be good for me to loose some of my blood to make me more mild and tame, and for that purpose they were come to scratch me; they gave me no time to expostulate or reply, but attempted to lay hold on me, which I resisted, and my friend, the young prince, interposed and pushed them off, saying that I was a brave warrior and his friend, that they should not insult me, when instantly they altered their countenance and behaviour; they all whooped in chorus, took me friendly by the hand, clapped me on the shoulder and laid their hands on their breasts in token of sincere friendship, and laughing aloud, said I was a sincere friend to the Siminoles,…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartram|first1=William|title=The Travels of William Bartram, Naturalist Edition. Edited with Commentary and an Annotated Index by Francis Harper|date=1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bartram joined Spalding's traders in mid-April on a trip to Cuscowilla ([[Micanopy, Florida|Micanopy]]) and Alachua Savannah, now [[Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park]]. Late in May Bartram travelled up the St. Johns' River to Spalding's Upper Store at present day [[Astor, Florida|Astor]] and to [[Blue Spring State Park|Blue Spring]]. Some of the most memorable events in ''Travels'' occurred during this trip upriver when a wolf stole his fish as Bartram slept, he was jostled and threatened by alligators while fishing from his boat, and he was witness to a territorial battle between two of the monsters. He wrote:

{{Quote|Behold him rushing forth from the flags and reeds. His enormous body swells. His plaited tail brandished high, floats upon the lake. The waters like a cataract descend from his opening jaws. Clouds of smoke issue from his dilated nostrils. The earth trembles with his thunder. When immediately from the opposite coast of the lagoon, emerges from the deep his rival champion. They suddenly dart upon each other. The boiling surface of the lake marks their rapid course, and a terrific conflict commences. They now sink to the bottom folded together in horrid wreaths. The water becomes thick and discoloured. Again they rise, their jaws clap together, re-echoing through the deep surrounding forests. Again they sink, when the contest ends at the muddy bottom of the lake, and the vanquished makes a hazardous escape, hiding himself in the muddy turbulent waters and sedge on a distant shore. The proud victor exulting returns to the place of action. The shores and forests resound his dreadful roar, together with the triumphing shouts of the plaited tribes around, witnesses of the horrid combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartram|first1=William|title=The Travels of William Bartram, Naturalist Edition. Edited with Commentary and an Annotated Index by Francis Harper|date=1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the summer Bartram made another excursion to Alachua Savannah and on to the [[Suwannee River]]. He travelled one last time up the St. Johns River in September and left Florida forever in November, 1774.

==Exploration of the Cherokee Nation==

On April 22, 1775 Bartram left Charleston, South Carolina on horseback to explore the Cherokee Nation.&lt;ref name="lcc73084685p306"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bartram, William |title=Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida |publisher=University of Virginia Press (by arrangement with The Beehive Press) |location=Charlottesville |year=1980 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi=|id={{LCC|F213 .B282 1792a|lccn=73084685}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing through Augusta May 10,&lt;ref name="lcc73084685p318"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bartram, William |title=Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida |publisher=University of Virginia Press (by arrangement with The Beehive Press) |location=Charlottesville |year=1980 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi=|id={{LCC|F213 .B282 1792a}}|lccn=73084685}} p318&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth on May 15 ({{coord|35.328003|-82.874571|type:landmark_region:US|display=inline}}),&lt;ref name="lcc73084685p324"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bartram, William |title=Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida |publisher=University of Virginia Press (by arrangement with The Beehive Press) |location=Charlottesville |year=1980 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi=|id={{LCC|F213 .B282 1792a}}|lccn=73084685}} p324&lt;/ref&gt; a few days later he left Fort Prince George and [[Keowee]] ({{coord|34.863616|-82.901575|type:landmark_region:US|display=inline}}) after not being able to procure a guide .&lt;ref name="lcc73084685p331"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bartram, William |title=Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida |publisher=University of Virginia Press (by arrangement with The Beehive Press) |location=Charlottesville |year=1980 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi=|id={{LCC|F213 .B282 1792a}}|lccn=73084685}} p331&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his botanizing, Bartram aptly described the journey:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…all alone in a wild Indian country, a thousand miles from my native land, and a vast distance from any settlements of white people.&lt;ref name="lcc73084685p329"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bartram, William |title=Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida |publisher=University of Georgia Press |location=Athens|year=1980 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi=|id={{LCC|F213 .B282 1792a}}|lccn=73084685}} p329&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was now after noon; I approached a charming vale, amidst sublimely high forests, awful shades! Darkness gathers around, far distant thunder rolls over the trembling hills; the black clouds with august majesty and power, moves slowly forwards, shading regions of towering hills, and threatening all the destructions of a thunderstorm; all around is now still as death, not a whisper is heard, but a total inactivity and silence seems to pervade the earth; the birds afraid to utter a chirrup, and in low tremulous voices take leave of each other, seeking covert and safety; every insect is silenced, and nothing heard but the roaring of the approaching hurricane; the mighty cloud now expands its sable wings, extending from North to South, and is driven irresistibly on by the tumultuous winds, spreading his livid wings around the gloomy concave, armed with terrors of thunder and fiery shafts of lightning; now the lofty forests bend low beneath its fury, their limbs and wavy boughs are tossed about and catch hold of each other; the mountains tremble and seem to reel about, and the ancient hills to be shaken to their foundations: the furious storm sweeps along, smoaking through the vale and over the resounding hills; the face of the earth is obscured by the deluge descending from the firmament, and I am deafened by the din of thunder; the tempestuous scene damps my spirits, and my horse sinks under me at the tremendous peals, as I hasten for the plain.&lt;ref name="lcc73084685p341"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bartram, William |title=Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida |publisher=University of Virginia Press (by arrangement with The Beehive Press) |location=Charlottesville |year=1980 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi=|id={{LCC|F213 .B282 1792a}}|lccn=73084685}} p341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I began to ascend the [http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1013870 Jore Mountains], which I at length accomplished, and rested on the most elevated peak; from whence I beheld with rapture and astonishment, a sublimely awful scene of power and magnificence, a world of mountains piled upon mountains.

==Return to Philadelphia==
Bartram returned to Philadelphia in January 1777 and assisted his brother John in all aspects of running [[Bartram's Garden]].
[[Image:BartramTravels.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Frontispiece and title page of "Travels"]]
In the late 1780s, he completed the book for which he became most famous, ''Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, the Cherokee Country, etc.''.  It was considered at the time one of the foremost books on American natural history. Many of Bartram's accounts of historical sites were the earliest records,  including the Georgia mound site of [[Ocmulgee National Monument|Ocmulgee]]. In addition to its contributions to scientific knowledge, ''Travels'' is noted for its original descriptions of the American countryside.  Bartram's writing influenced many of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writers of the day. [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] are known to have read the book, and its influence can be seen in many of their works.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although Bartram has often been characterized as a recluse, all evidence shows that he remained active in commercial, scientific, and intellectual pursuits well into the nineteenth century. He tutored nieces and nephews, penned a number of essays, contributed to several works anonymously, and helped run the family horticultural business. In 1802, Bartram met the school teacher [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] and began to teach him the rudiments of [[ornithology]] and natural history illustration. Wilson's ''American Ornithology'' includes many references to Bartram and the area around [[Bartram's Garden]]. Among Bartram's more significant later contributions were the illustrations for his friend [[Benjamin Smith Barton]]'s explanation of the Linnaean system, ''Elements of Botany'' (1803–04).

After the War of 1812, when many of his colleagues, contacts, and friends had died, Bartram settled into a long period of work, observation, and study at the family's garden in Kingsessing. He maintained a "Diary" that records bird migrations, plant life, and the weather. He refused a request to teach botany at the University of Pennsylvania, and in his sixties, declined an invitation from President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to accompany an expedition up the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] in the [[Louisiana Territory]], in 1806. He died at his home at the age of 84.

==Namesakes==
Numerous places and sites are named in his honor:

In the [[folklore]] of [[Nepal]], the '''Yeti''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɛ|t|i}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yeti "Yeti"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ne|यती}}, {{lang-bo|གཡའ་དྲེད}}) or '''Abominable Snowman''' is an [[ape]]-like creature taller than an average human, that is said to inhabit the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] and [[Siberia|Siberian]] regions of [[East Asia]]. The names ''Yeti'' and ''Meh-Teh'' are commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of their history and mythology. Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century.

The scientific community has generally regarded the Yeti as a [[legend]], given the lack of evidence of its existence.&lt;ref name=bigfoot&gt;{{cite book |title=Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality |author=Napier, John | authorlink=John R. Napier |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-525-06658-3 |publisher=N. Abbot |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one genetic study, researchers matched DNA from hair samples found in the Himalaya with a prehistoric bear from the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic analysis of hair samples attributed to yeti, bigfoot and other anomalous primates |date=July 2014 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=281 |issue=1789 |pages=20140161 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0161|pmid=24990672 |last1=Sykes |first1=B.

==Etymology and alternate names==
{{Contains Tibetan text|section}}

The word ''Yeti'' is derived from {{bo|t=གཡའ་དྲེད་|w=g.ya' dred|z=Yachê}}, a compound of the words {{bo|t=གཡའ་|w=g.ya'|z=ya}} "rocky", "rocky place" and ({{bo|t=དྲེད་|w=dred|z=chê}}) "bear".&lt;ref name=pranBobay &gt;{{cite journal |author=Pranavananda, Swami |title=The Abominable Snowman | journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society | volume= 54|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stonorState &gt;Stonor, Charles (30 January 1954). ''The Statesman in Calcutta''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swanp882884 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Swan, Lawrence W.|title=Abominable Snowman|date=18 April 1958|journal=Science |pages=882–84|volume=127| issue = 3303|pmid=17733822 |doi=10.1126/science.127.3303.882-b|bibcode=1958Sci...127..882S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IzzardP2122 &gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Pranavananda&lt;ref name=pranBobay /&gt; states that the words "ti", "te" and "teh" are derived from the spoken word 'tre' (spelled "dred"), Tibetan for bear, with the 'r' so softly pronounced as to be almost inaudible, thus making it "te" or "teh".&lt;ref name=pranBobay /&gt;&lt;ref name=izzardp199&gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sherpa and the Snowman|author=Stonor, Charles |year=1955 |publisher=Hollis and Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used by Himalayan peoples do not translate exactly the same, but refer to legendary and indigenous wildlife:

* '''Michê''' ({{bo|t=མི་དྲེད་|w= mi dred|z=Michê}}) translates as "man-[[bear]]".&lt;ref name=swanp882884 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dzu-teh'''&amp;nbsp;– 'dzu' translates as "[[cattle]]" and the full meaning translates as "cattle bear", referring to the [[Himalayan brown bear]].&lt;ref name=stonorState /&gt;&lt;ref name=izzardp199 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pranavananda, Swami  |year = 1955|volume=30| pages = 99–104|journal=Indian Geographical Journal, July–Sept|title=Abominable Snowman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jacksonMM &gt;{{cite book |author=Jackson, John A. |title=More than Mountains |year=1955|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Migoi''' or '''Mi-go''' ({{bo|t=མི་རྒོད་|w=mi rgod|z=Migö/Mirgö}}) translates as "wild man".&lt;ref name=izzardp199 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jacksonMM /&gt;
* '''Bun Manchi'''&amp;nbsp;– Nepali for "jungle man" that is used outside Sherpa communities where '''yeti''' is the common name.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mirka'''&amp;nbsp;– Another name for "wild-man". Local legend holds that "anyone who sees one dies or is killed". The latter is taken from a written statement by [[Frank Smythe]]'s [[Sherpa people|sherpas]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kang Admi'''&amp;nbsp;– "Snow Man".&lt;ref name=jacksonMM /&gt;

===The "Abominable Snowman"===
The name "Abominable Snowman" was coined in 1921, the same year Lieutenant-Colonel [[Charles Howard-Bury]] led the [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition]]&lt;ref name=buryP121124 &gt;{{cite journal |author= Howard-Bury, Charles |date=February 1921|title=Some Observations on the Approaches to Mount Everest | journal=The Geographical Journal|volume= 57|pages=121–24|doi=10.2307/1781561|issue= 2 |jstor= 1781561 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yourghusband, Francis |author2=Collie, H. Norman |author3=Gatine, A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=February 1922|title=Mount Everest" The reconnaissance: Discussion | journal=The Geographical World Journal | volume= 59|pages=109–12|doi=10.2307/1781388|issue= 2 |jstor= 1781388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he chronicled in ''Mount Everest The Reconnaissance, 1921''.&lt;ref name=howardBury141 &gt;{{cite book |author=Howard-Bury, Charles  |year=1921|title=Mount Everest The Reconnaissance, 1921|publisher=Edward Arnold|chapter=19|page=141|isbn=978-1-135-39935-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Howard-Bury includes an account of crossing the [[Lhakpa La]] at {{convert|21000|ft|abbr=on}} where he found footprints that he believed "were probably caused by a large 'loping' grey wolf, which in the soft snow formed double tracks rather like a those of a bare-footed man". He adds that his Sherpa guides "at once volunteered that the tracks must be that of 'The Wild Man of the Snows', to which they gave the name 'metoh-kangmi'".&lt;ref name=howardBury141 /&gt; "Metoh" translates as "man-bear" and "Kang-mi" translates as "snowman".&lt;ref name=pranBobay /&gt;&lt;ref name=swanp882884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jacksonMM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion exists between Howard-Bury's recitation of the term "metoh-kangmi"&lt;ref name=buryP121124 /&gt;&lt;ref name=howardBury141 /&gt; and the term used in [[Bill Tilman]]'s book ''Mount Everest, 1938''&lt;ref name=tilmanP127137&gt;Tilman, pp. 127–37&lt;/ref&gt; where Tilman had used the words "metch", which does not exist in the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]],&lt;ref name=izzardP24 &gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and "kangmi" when relating the coining of the term "Abominable Snowman".&lt;ref name=swanp882884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jacksonMM /&gt;&lt;ref name=tilmanP127137 /&gt;&lt;ref name=straus-Vol123 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Straus, William L., Jr., |journal=Science|volume= 123|title=Abominable Snowman|date=8 June 1956|pages= 1024–25| issue= 3206|doi=10.1126/science.123.3206.1024 |pmid=17800969|bibcode=1956Sci...123.1024S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of "metch" being a misnomer is provided by Tibetan language authority Professor [[David Snellgrove]] from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] at the [[University of London]] (ca. 1956), who dismissed the word "metch" as impossible, because the consonants "t-c-h" cannot be conjoined in the Tibetan language."&lt;ref name=izzardP24 /&gt; Documentation suggests that the term "metch-kangmi" is derived from one source (from the year 1921).&lt;ref name="tilmanP127137"/&gt; It has been suggested that "metch" is simply a misspelling of "metoh".

The use of "Abominable Snowman" began when Henry Newman, a longtime contributor to ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' in [[Calcutta]], writing under the pen name "Kim",&lt;ref name=IzzardP2122 /&gt; interviewed the porters of the "Everest Reconnaissance expedition" on their return to Darjeeling.&lt;ref name=tilmanP127137 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kirtley, Bacil F. | title=Unknown Hominids and New World legends | pages=77–90|journal=Western Folklore | volume=23|date=April 1964| doi=10.2307/1498256 | issue= 1304 |jstor= 1498256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Masters, John | title=The Abominable Snowman | page=31|publisher= Harpers | volume=CCXVIII|date=January 1959 | issue= 1304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman mistranslated the word "metoh" as "filthy", substituting the term "abominable", perhaps out of artistic license.&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, Ch. 2, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As author Bill Tilman recounts, "[Newman] wrote long after in a letter to ''The Times'': The whole story seemed such a joyous creation I sent it to one or two newspapers".&lt;ref name=tilmanP127137 /&gt;

==History==
===Pre-19th century===
According to H. Siiger, the Yeti was a part of the pre-Buddhist beliefs of several Himalayan people. He was told that the [[Lepcha people]] worshipped a "Glacier Being" as a God of the Hunt. He also reported that followers of the [[Bön]] religion once believed the blood of the "mi rgod" or "wild man" had use in certain mystical ceremonies. The being was depicted as an apelike creature who carries a large stone as a weapon and makes a whistling swoosh sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B0C-IhEKrSEC&amp;pg=PA423|chapter=The Abominable Snowman |author=Siiger, H. |title=Himalayan anthropology: the Indo-Tibetan interface |editor =Fisher, James F. |page=423|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9789027977007|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
In 1832, [[James Prinsep]]'s ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' published trekker [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|B. H. Hodgson]]'s account of his experiences in northern Nepal. His local guides spotted a tall, bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, which seemed to flee in fear. Hodgson concluded it was an [[orangutan]].

An early record of reported [[footprint]]s appeared in 1899 in [[Laurence Waddell]]'s ''Among the Himalayas''.{{fact|date=June 2018}} Waddell reported his guide's description of a large apelike creature that left the prints, which Waddell thought were made by a bear. Waddell heard stories of bipedal, apelike creatures but wrote that "none, however, of the many Tibetans I have interrogated on this subject could ever give me an authentic case. On the most superficial investigation it always resolved into something that somebody heard tell of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waddell, Laurence Austine | authorlink=Laurence Waddell |title=Among the Himalayas |year=1899 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PueCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 |page=223 |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp;amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
The frequency of reports increased during the early 20th century, when Westerners began making determined attempts to scale the many mountains in the area and occasionally reported seeing odd creatures or strange tracks.

In 1925, [[N. A. Tombazi]], a photographer and member of the Royal Geographical Society, writes that he saw a creature at about {{convert|15000|ft|abbr=on}} near [[Zemu Glacier]]. Tombazi later wrote that he observed the creature from about {{convert|200|to|300|yd|abbr=on}}, for about a minute. "Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf [[rhododendron]] [[Shrub|bushes]]. It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes." About two hours later, Tombazi and his companions descended the mountain and saw the creature's prints, described as "similar in shape to those of a man, but only six to seven inches long by four inches wide...&lt;ref&gt;{{convert|6|to|7|in|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prints were undoubtedly those of a biped."&lt;ref&gt;Abell, George Ogden and Singer, Barry (1981) ''Science and The Paranormal: Probing the Existence of The Supernatural'', Scribner, p. 32. {{ISBN|0-684-16655-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eric Shipton yeti footprint.png|left|thumb|Alleged Yeti footprint found by Michael Ward and photographed by Eric Shipton taken at Menlung Glacier on the 1951 Everest Expedition with Edmund Hillary in Nepal]]
Western interest in the Yeti peaked dramatically in the 1950s. While attempting to scale [[Mount Everest]] in 1951, [[Eric Shipton]] took photographs of a number of large prints in the snow, at about {{convert|6000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. These photos have been subject to intense scrutiny and debate. Some argue they are the best evidence of Yeti's existence, while others contend the prints are those of a mundane creature that have been distorted by the melting snow.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, C. (2008).

Peter Byrne reported finding a yeti footprint in 1948, in northern [[Sikkim]], India near the [[Zemu Glacier]], while on holiday from a [[Royal Air Force]] assignment in India.&lt;ref name="sikkim"&gt;{{Cite book | last = McLeod| first = Michael| title = Anatomy of a beast: obsession and myth on the trail of Bigfoot| publisher = University of California Press| year = 2009| page = 54| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_6FmjJYd13wC&amp;pg=PA54| isbn = 978-0-520-25571-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]] reported seeing large footprints while scaling Mount Everest. Hillary would later discount Yeti reports as unreliable. In his first autobiography Tenzing said that he believed the Yeti was a large ape, and although he had never seen it himself his father had seen one twice, but in his second autobiography he said he had become much more sceptical about its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man of Everest&amp;nbsp;— The Autobiography of Tenzing|author=Tenzing Norgay (told to and written by James Ramsey Ullman) |year=1955 |publisher=George Harrap &amp; Co, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were many large footprints which could not be identified. These flattened footprint-like indentations were attributed to erosion and subsequent widening of the original footprint by wind and particles.

On 19 March 1954, the ''Daily Mail'' printed an article which described expedition teams obtaining hair specimens from what was alleged to be a Yeti [[scalp]] found in the [[Pangboche]] monastery. The hairs were black to dark brown in colour in dim light, and fox red in sunlight. The hair was analysed by Professor [[Frederic Wood Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dobson, Jessie | title= Obituary: 79, Frederic Wood-Jones, F.R.S.: 1879–1954 |journal=Man | volume=56 |date=June 1956 |pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Wilfred E. le Gros Clark| title= Frederic Wood-Jones, 1879–1954 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume= 1 |date=November 1955 | pages=118–134| doi= 10.1098/rsbm.1955.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; an expert in human and comparative anatomy. During the study, the hairs were bleached, cut into sections and analysed microscopically. The research consisted of taking [[Micrograph|microphotographs]] of the hairs and comparing them with hairs from known animals such as bears and orangutans. Jones concluded that the hairs were not actually from a scalp. He contended that while some animals do have a ridge of hair extending from the pate to the back, no animals have a ridge (as in the Pangboche "scalp") running from the base of the forehead across the pate and ending at the nape of the neck. Jones was unable to pinpoint exactly the animal from which the Pangboche hairs were taken. He was, however, convinced that the hairs were not of a bear or [[anthropoid ape]]. He suggested that the hairs were from the shoulder of a coarse-haired hoofed animal.&lt;ref&gt;Izzard&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sławomir Rawicz]] claimed in his book ''The Long Walk'', published in 1956, that as he and some others were crossing the Himalayas in the winter of 1940, their path was blocked for hours by two bipedal animals that were doing seemingly nothing but shuffling around in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rawicz, Sławomir|year=1956|title=The Long Walk|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|chapter=22|pages=258–60|isbn=978-1-59921-975-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1957, an American [[Tom Slick]] funded a few missions to investigate Yeti reports. In 1959, supposed Yeti [[feces]] were collected by one of Slick's expeditions; fecal analysis found a [[Parasitism|parasite]] which could not be classified. The United States government thought that finding the Yeti was likely enough to create three rules for American expeditions searching for it: obtain a Nepalese permit, do not harm the Yeti except in self-defense, and let the Nepalese government approve any news reporting on the animal's discovery.&lt;ref name="bedard20110902"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/09/02/documents-show-feds-believed-in-yeti?google_editors_picks=true | title=Documents Show Feds Believed in the Yeti | work=US News and World Report | date=2 September 2011 | accessdate=2 September 2011 |author1=Bedard, Paul |author2=Fox, Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, actor [[James Stewart]], while visiting India, reportedly smuggled  the so-called [[Pangboche Hand]], by concealing it in his luggage when he flew from India to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anomalist.com/milestones/stewart.html |title=Milestones – Jimmy Stewart |publisher=Anomalist.com |date=2 July 1997 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Edmund Hillary|Sir Edmund Hillary]] mounted an expedition to collect and analyze physical evidence of the Yeti. Hillary borrowed a supposed Yeti scalp from the Khumjung monastery then himself and Khumjo Chumbi (the village headman), brought the "scalp" back to London &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/23/yeti-scalp-nepal-edmund-hillary,&lt;/ref&gt; where a small sample was cut off for testing. Marca Burns made a detailed examination of the sample of skin and hair from the margin of the alleged Yeti scalp and compared it with similar samples from the [[Himalayan serow|serow]], [[Tibetan blue bear|blue bear]] and [[Asian black bear|black bear]]. Burns concluded the sample "was probably made from the skin of an animal closely resembling the sampled specimen of Serow, but definitely not identical with it: possibly a local variety or race of the same species, or a different but closely related species."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 29787501|title = Report on a Sample of Skin and Hair from the Khumjung Yeti Scalp|journal = Genus|volume = 18|issue = 1/4|pages = 80–88|last1 = Burns|first1 = Marca|year = 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the 1960s, belief in the yeti was relatively common in Bhutan and in 1966 a Bhutanese stamp was made to honor the creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Bhutan Stamp Shows 'Abomidable Snowman' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QrhIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UQENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5041,5654462 |newspaper=Associated Press via The Morning Record |date=10 December 1966 |author=Kronish, Syd }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century belief in the being has declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-17/news/17125008_1_bhutan-yeti-abominable-snowman |author=Sullivan, Tim  |agency=Associated Press |date=17 August 2008 |title=Yeti myth dying out as Bhutan modernizes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, British mountaineer [[Don Whillans]] claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling [[Annapurna]].&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, Jim (2005) ''The villain: the life of Don Whillans'', The Mountaineers Books, pp. 261–62, {{ISBN|0099416727}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Whillans, while scouting for a campsite, he heard some odd cries which his Sherpa guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. The next day, he observed a few human-like footprints in the snow, and that evening, viewed with binoculars a bipedal, ape-like creature for 20 minutes as it apparently searched for food not far from his camp.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 1983, Himalayan conservationist [[Daniel C. Taylor]] and Himalayan natural historian Robert L. Fleming Jr. led a yeti expedition into Nepal's Barun Valley (suggested by discovery in the Barun in 1972 of footprints alleged to be yeti by Cronin &amp; McNeely&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Edward W. (1979) ''The Arun: A Natural History of the World's Deepest Valley'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p. 153, {{ISBN|0395262992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The Taylor-Fleming expedition also discovered similar yeti-like footprints (hominoid appearing with both a hallux and bipedal gait), intriguing large nests in trees, and vivid reports from local villagers of two bears, ''rukh balu'' ('tree bear', small, reclusive, weighing about {{convert|150|lb|kg|-1}}) and ''bhui balu'' ('ground bear', aggressive, weighing up to {{convert|400|lb|kg|-1}}). Further interviews across Nepal gave evidence of local belief in two different bears. Skulls were collected, these were compared to known skulls at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[American Museum of Natural History]], and [[British Museum]], and confirmed identification of a single species, the [[Asiatic black bear]], showing no morphological difference between 'tree bear' and 'ground bear.'&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 106–20.&lt;/ref&gt; (This despite an intriguing skull in the [[British Museum]] of a 'tree bear' collected in 1869 by Oldham and discussed in the ''Annals of the Royal Zoological Society''.)

===21st century===
In 2004, [[Henry Gee]], editor of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', mentioned the Yeti as an example of a legend deserving further study, writing, "The discovery that ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' survived until so very recently, in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as Yetis are founded on grains of truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/news041025-2|title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology|year=2004|last1=Gee|first1=Henry|journal=Nature News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2007, American television presenter [[Joshua Gates]] and his team ([[Destination Truth]]) reported finding a series of footprints in the Everest region of Nepal resembling descriptions of Yeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7122705.stm |title='Yeti prints' found near Everest |accessdate=1 December 2007 |author=Haviland, Charles  |date=1 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the footprints measured {{convert|33|cm|abbr=on}} in length with five toes that measured a total of {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}} across. Casts were made of the prints for further research. The footprints were examined by [[Jeffrey Meldrum]] of Idaho State University, who believed them to be too [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] accurate to be fake or man-made, before changing his mind after making further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Daegling, David J. (2004) ''Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America's Enduring Legend'', AltaMira Press, p. 260, footnote 21, {{ISBN|0-7591-0538-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009, Gates made another investigation during which he discovered hair samples. A forensic analyst concluded that the hair contained an unknown DNA sequence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syfy.com/destinationtruth/episodes/season/3/episode/309/the_bhutan_yeti The Bhutan Yeti | Episodes | Destination Truth].

On 25 July 2008, the BBC reported that hairs collected in the remote [[Garo Hills]] area of [[North-East India]] by Dipu Marak had been analyzed at [[Oxford Brookes University]] in the UK by primatologist Anna Nekaris and [[microscopy]] expert Jon Wells. These initial tests were inconclusive, and ape conservation expert [[Ian Redmond]] told the BBC that there was similarity between the cuticle pattern of these hairs and specimens collected by Edmund Hillary during Himalayan expeditions in the 1950s and donated to the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], and announced planned [[DNA]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawson|first=Alastair|title='Yeti hair' to get DNA analysis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7525060.stm|publisher=BBC|date=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis has since revealed that the hair came from the [[Himalayan goral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7666900.stm 'Yeti hairs' belong to a goat] By Alastair Lawson&amp;nbsp;— BBC News&amp;nbsp; – 11:20 GMT, Monday, 13 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Chinese scientists and explorers in 2010 proposed to renew searches in the [[Shennongjia]] Forestry District of [[Hubei]] province, which was the site of expeditions in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2010-10/12/content_21102561.htm |title=Search for ape man continues against the odds |publisher=China.org.cn |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story then claimed that border patrol soldiers captured a hairy two-legged female creature similar to a gorilla that ate meat and vegetation.

==Possible explanations==
The misidentification of Himalayan wildlife has been proposed as an explanation for some Yeti sightings, including the ''chu-teh'', a [[Colobinae|langur]] monkey&lt;ref name=Chu-Teh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabernet.demon.co.uk/JAJ/E2K1954/slides/7.%20Yeti%20from%20Book-bw.html |title=Everest to Kangchenjunga 1954 " Viewing 7.

A well publicized expedition to [[Bhutan]] initially reported that a hair sample had been obtained which by [[DNA]] analysis by Professor [[Bryan Sykes]] could not be matched to any known animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091810/http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=18&amp;id=149706&amp;usrsess=1 Mystery Primate]. The Statesmen&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis completed after the media release, however, clearly showed the samples were from a [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') and an [[Asiatic black bear]] (''Ursus thibetanus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chandler, H.C.|year=2003|title= Using Ancient DNA to Link Culture and Biology in Human Populations | publisher=Unpublished D.

In 1986, [[South Tyrol]]ean mountaineer [[Reinhold Messner]] claimed to have had a face-to-face encounter with a Yeti. He wrote a book, ''My Quest for the Yeti'', and claims to have killed one. According to Messner, the Yeti is actually the endangered [[Himalayan brown bear]], ''Ursus arctos isabellinus'', or [[Tibetan blue bear]], ''U. a. pruinosus'', which can walk both upright or on all fours.&lt;ref&gt;Trull, D.

The 1983 [[Barun Valley]] discoveries prompted three years of research on the 'tree bear' possibility by Taylor, Fleming, John Craighead and Tirtha Shrestha. From that research the conclusion was that the [[Asiatic black bear]], when about two years old, spends much time in trees to avoid attack by larger male bears on the ground ('ground bears'). During this tree period that may last two years, young bears train their inner claw outward, allowing an opposable grip. The imprint in the snow of a hind paw coming over the front paw that appears to have a hallux, especially when the bear is going slightly uphill so the hind paw print extends the overprint backward makes a hominoid-appearing track, both in that it is elongated like a human foot but with a “thumb” and in that a four-footed animal’s gait now appears bipedal.&lt;ref&gt;Covey, Jacob (2006) ''Beasts: Traditional Hidden Creatures'', Seattle, Washington, Fantagraphic Books/WW Norton, pp. 191–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  This "yeti discovery", in the words of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' editor Bill Garrett, "[by] on-site research sweeps away much of the 'smoke and mirrors' and gives us a believable yeti".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

This fieldwork in Nepal's Barun Valley led directly to initiating in 1984 [[Makalu-Barun National Park]] that protected over half a million acres in 1991, and across the border with China the [[Qomolangma national nature preserve]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] that protected over six million acres. In the words of Honorary President of the [[American Alpine Club]], Robert H. Bates, this yeti discovery "has apparently solved the mystery of the yeti, or at least part of it, and in so doing added to the world’s great wildlife preserves"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis, Wade |title=The Clouded Leopard: A Book of Travels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLIdAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-84511-453-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that the shy animal that lives in trees (and not the high snows), and mysteries and myths of the Himalayas that it represents, can continue within a protected area nearly the size of Switzerland.

In 2003, Japanese researcher and mountaineer Dr. Makoto Nebuka published the results of his twelve-year [[Linguistics|linguistic]] study, postulating that the word "Yeti" is a corruption of the word "meti", a regional dialect term for a "bear". Nebuka claims that ethnic Tibetans fear and worship the bear as a supernatural being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/Tib.htm |title=Tibet: Mystic Trivia |publisher=Iras.ucalgary.ca |date=26 September 1998 |accessdate=27 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113172225/http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/Tib.htm |archive-date=13 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nebuka's claims were subject to almost immediate criticism, and he was accused of linguistic carelessness. Dr. Raj Kumar Pandey, who has researched both Yetis and mountain languages, said "it is not enough to blame tales of the mysterious beast of the Himalayas on words that rhyme but mean different things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lak, Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3143020.stm |title= Yeti's 'non-existence' hard to bear |publisher=BBC News |date=26 September 2003 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speculate these reported creatures could be present-day specimens of the [[extinction|extinct]] giant ape ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Laura Anne (2002) ''Yeti, The Abominable Snowman'', The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc., {{ISBN|0-8239-3565-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmalzer, Sigrid (2008) ''The People's Peking Man: Popular Science and Human Identity in Twentieth-century China'', The University of Chicago Press, p. 220, {{ISBN|978-0-226-73859-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Tej Kumar  (1997) ''Mammals of Nepal'', Nepal: R. K.

In 2013, a call was put out by scientists from the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Lausanne|Lausanne]] for people claiming to have samples from these sorts of creatures. A mitochondrial DNA analysis of the [[MT-RNR1|12S RNA]] gene was undertaken on samples of hair from an unidentified animal from [[Ladakh]] in northern India on the west of the Himalayas, and one from [[Bhutan]]. These samples were compared with those in [[GenBank]], the international repository of gene sequences, and matched a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]], that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=British scientist 'solves' mystery of Himalayan yetis|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24564487|publisher=BBC|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result suggests that, barring hoaxes of planted samples or contamination, bears in these regions may have been taken to be yeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/17/yeti-dna-ancient-polar-bear-scientists |title=Has DNA really solved the mystery of the yeti? |author=Alok Jha |work=Guardian |date= 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of evolutionary genetics at the [[University of Cambridge]] Bill Amos doubted the samples were of polar bears in the Himalayas, but was "90% convinced that there is a bear in these regions that has been mistaken for a yeti". Professor [[Bryan Sykes]] whose team carried out the analysis of the samples at Oxford university has his own theory. He believes that the samples may have come from a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20131017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lawless |first=Jill |title=DNA Links Mysterious Yeti To Ancient Polar Bear |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131017/DA9G5VB01.html |date=17 October 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research of 12S rRNA published in 2015 revealed that the hair samples collected are most likely those of brown bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gutiérrez|first= Eliécer|last2= Pine|first2= Ronald|date= 16 March 2015|title= No need to replace an "anomalous" primate (Primates) with an "anomalous" bear (Carnivora, Ursidae)|journal= ZooKeys|volume= 487|issue= 487|pages= 141–54|doi= 10.3897/zookeys.487.9176|pmc=4366689|pmid=25829853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, a new analysis compared mtDNA sequences of bears from the region with DNA extracted from hair and other samples claimed to have come from yeti. It included hair thought to be from the same preserved specimen as the anomalous Sykes sample, and showed it to have been a Himalayan brown bear, while other purported yeti samples were actually from the Tibetan blue bear, Asiatic black bear and a domestic dog.&lt;ref name="lan"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lan T., Gill S., Bellemain E., Bischof R., Zawaz M.A., Lindqvist C. | year = 2017 | title = Evolutionary history of enigmatic bears in the Tibetan Plateau–Himalaya region and the identity of the yeti | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1868/20171804| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 284 | issue = 1868| page = 20171804 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2017.1804| pmid = 29187630 | pmc = 5740279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Daniel C. Taylor]] published a comprehensive analysis of the century-long Yeti literature, giving added evidence to the (''Ursus thibetanus'') explanation building on the initial Barun Valley discoveries. Importantly, this book under the Oxford University imprint gave a meticulous explanation for the iconic Yeti footprint photographed by [[Eric Shipton]] in 1950, also the 1972 Cronin-McNeely print, as well all other unexplained Yeti footprints. To complete this explanation, Taylor also located a never-before published photograph in the archives of the Royal Geographical Society, taken in 1950 by [[Eric Shipton]], that included scratches that are clearly bear nail marks.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C Taylor, “Yeti: The Ecology of a Mystery,” (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
