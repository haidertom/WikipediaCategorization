The '''1996 Parliament House riot''' (also called the '''Canberra riot''') involved a physical attack on [[Parliament House, Canberra]], Australia, on 19 August 1996, when protesters broke away from the "Cavalcade to Canberra" rally organised by the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU) and sought to force their way into the national [[Parliament of Australia]], causing property damage and attacking police.

==Overview==
[[File:Parliament House Canberra (706422542).jpg|thumb|The entrance to [[Parliament House, Canberra]] - scene of the 1996 riot.]]

The [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] called the "cavalcade to Canberra" rally to protest against the industrial relations reform agenda of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] Coalition [[Howard Government]]. The protest began with senior Australian Trade Union officials including ACTU President [[Jennie George]] and Assistant Secretary [[Greg Combet]], as well as senior members of the [[Australian Labor Party]] rallying demonstrators from a  podium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/jennie-george-bids-farewell-to-politics/1682568.aspx?storypage=2 Jennie George bids farewell to politics - Local News - News - General - Illawarra Mercury]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/nation-today-with-malcolm-farr/story-e6frg15u-1226027256101 |title=The nation today - live with Malcolm Farr &amp;#124; Perth Now |access-date=24 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609143104/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/nation-today-with-malcolm-farr/story-e6frg15u-1226027256101 |archive-date=9 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to then [[President of the Australian Senate|President of the Senate]], [[Margaret Reid (politician)|Margaret Reid]], the initially peaceful protest deteriorated into violent action when a new group of demonstrators arrived in the early afternoon and, joined by people from the main protest, attacked the entrance to Parliament. Around 90 personnel were injured —including lacerations, sprains, and head and eye injuries. Damage to the forecourt and foyer of Parliament was initially estimated at $75,000 and the Parliamentary shop was looted. Nine rioters were arrested and charged with a variety of offences.&lt;ref name="aph1"&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds200896.pdf Hansard of the Australian Senate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216215833/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds200896.pdf |date=16 February 2012 }} 20 Aug 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Before the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 Australian Federal election]], ACTU Secretary, [[Bill Kelty]], had threatened 'industrial war' if a Coalition Government tried to challenge union power.&lt;ref name="anu1"&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/riot.htm The Parliament House riot of 1996] by Luke Deer, published by [[Australian National University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following their 1996 election victory, the [[Howard Government]] proposed to balance the [[Australian federal budget]] by means of extensive budget cuts, and introduced a draft Workplace Relations Amendment Bill which proposed to curtail '[[closed shop|compulsory unionism]]' and to introduce a more decentralised bargaining structure to the Australian work place. Both endeavours were opposed by Trade Unionists who organised a campaign of protest to culminate on the eve of the federal budget, 19 August 1996 with a protest rally on the lawns of the Federal Parliament, called the "Cavalcade to Canberra".&lt;ref name="anu1"/&gt;

==The protest and riot==

On 4 July 1996, the [[A.C.T. Trades and Labour Council]] advised the Speaker and President of the Parliament that a rally would be held at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the Parliament building. The march was approved for between 1.35&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 2.25 p.m, provided adequated marshalling was organised and that the demonstration did not obstruct access to Parliament. Subsequent discussions were also conducted with the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]] and the indigenous representatives and all agreed to these parameters for the demonstration. On the day of 19 August, The protest rally remained peaceful until about 12.20&amp;nbsp;p.m. at which point a separate group of demonstrators entered the parliamentary precinct. The following day, the [[President of the Australian Senate]] outlined to Parliament the events that followed thus:&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt;

{{quote|[T]his group refused to accept police direction, forced a breach in police lines and ran towards the main front entrance of Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was apparent that some of these demonstrators were affected by alcohol. This group was supported by participants from the more general demonstration who were incited to join those involved in riotous conduct by a speaker from the official platform.

Police formed a protective line along the perimeter of the Great Verandah which was subsequently forced back to the main doors. The police line was withdrawn from this area due to the level of violence being experienced by officers and was redeployed to an area inside the front doors in support of parliamentary security personnel. This deployment stabilised the situation for a short period. However, demonstrators using increasing force broke through the first line of doors.

Once inside this area, demonstrators used weapons, including a large hammer, a wheel brace, a steel trolley and a stanchion torn from the external doors to break open the internal doors. Simultaneously, a second group of demonstrators used other weapons to break into the Parliament House shop, but were held at the internal doors. The shop was ransacked by demonstrators and major damage was caused by persons who subsequently occupied the area. After some two hours, the demonstrators were finally repelled from Parliament House and driven back onto the forecourt area and, shortly afterwards, they dispersed.

In addition to the events which took place at the front entrance to the building, incidents also occurred on the Members Terrace, the roof of the Great Verandah and the Queens Terrace. There were 197 Australian Federal Police on duty at the start of the demonstration, in addition to the Australian Protective Service officers and parliamentary security personnel. A further 60 Australian Federal Police reinforcements were called out under established contingency plans.
}}

During the course of the riot, unionist Davie Thomason, of the [[CFMEU]], took the podium at the official rally with a bloodied face and spoke while shaking a police riot shield, saying to cheers from other protesters:&lt;ref name="anu1"/&gt;

{{quote|[T]he CFMEU and other organisations from the construction division, 100 of us have got into our House. And look what we got from the coppers. And we have to remember it's going to be a long haul but these people up here will never defeat us, we have to remember that ... Workers, united, will never be defeated.
}}

Addressing the Senate the following day, Senator [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], leader of the Government in the Senate, described the event as "very sad day in the history of the Australian political process", and his opposition counterpart Senator [[John Faulkner]] condemned the "appalling violence" on behalf of the opposition. Senator [[Cheryl Kernot]] for the [[Australian Democrats]] said she "condemned" the violence and "I deplore the actions of those who, in my opinion, selfishly and deliberately chose to distract from discussion of the issues". Senator [[Dee Margetts]], speaking for the [[Greens Western Australia]] said that "the Greens WA do not associate ourselves with the violent action" but that "there are obviously some in the Greens movement who have differing opinions about that".&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt; In the House of Representatives, Opposition Leader [[Kim Beazley]] called the rioters "lunatics" and "louts" who had distracted from a "peaceful and lawful" protest, while Prime Minister [[John Howard]] described the violence as "thuggery" and said that the ACTU should accept some responsibility for the riot:&lt;ref name="aph1"/&gt;

{{quote|Those who organise demonstrations have a responsibility to stop them getting out of hand, and it is utterly disingenuous of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to pretend that it can accept no responsibility at all for what happened yesterday.

The '''2001 sex strike for running water''' in [[Turkey]] began when women in a Turkish village initiated a nonviolent direct action to persuade the men of the village to fix a broken water system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu Global Nonviolent Action Database] April 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Background==
In 2001, a southern Turkish village near [[Siirt]] suffered from a broken down water supply system. This was not the first time the system had stopped, leaving the 600-person village without running water for months at a time. When the water system breaks down, the women must walk  several miles to a small public [[fountain]] in order to have water for drinking, cooking and bathing.

In mid-July 2001, women in the village began a [[sex strike]] to encourage their husbands to demand that the government repair the water system. The idea of the sex strike came from a Turkish movie from 1983 in which women held a sex strike for better equality between the genders.

The lack of running water prevented women from bathing after sex, which is traditionally required of [[Muslim]] women. This ritual is known as [[Ritual purification#Islam|ritual purification]], which has to do with preparation for prayer that occurs five times a day.

Within one month of the sex strike, the men began asking the Siirt government for assistance to fix the water system. On August 15, the government supplied the village with enough resources to fix the water system themselves.

==Related events==
A film, ''[[The Source (2011 film)|The Source]]'', was created in 2011 capturing a similar story in a [[North Africa]]. The women of the village take part in a sex strike against having to walk to a water source to collect water.

'''Acceptance''' in [[human]] [[psychology]] is a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it or protest it. The concept is close in meaning to ''acquiescence'', derived from the Latin ''acquiēscere'' (to find rest in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acquiesce|title=Acquiesce - Define Acquiesce at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The term ''acceptance'' is a noun with various different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acceptance|title=Acceptance - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the person to whom a proposal is made signifies their assent, it is an "acceptance" of their offer, also called an agreement. For example, if someone gives a gift and another receives it, then they have accepted the gift; therefore, having acceptance. Another definition of acceptance has to do with positive welcome and belonging, favor, and endorsement. For instance, one can like someone and accept them due to their approval of that person. Another description is that acceptance can be an act of believing or assenting. The definition overlaps with ''[[toleration]]'', but acceptance and tolerance are not synonyms.

Acceptance – "An express act or implication by conduct that manifests assent to the terms of an offer in a manner invited or required by the offer so that a [[legally binding|binding]] contract is formed. The exercise of power conferred by an offer by performance of some act. The act of a person to whom something is offered of [[tendered]] by another, whereby the offered demonstrates through an act invited by the offer an intention of retaining the subject of the offer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Concepts and Case Analysis in the Law of Contracts|last=Chirelstein|first=Marvin|publisher=Foundation|year=2001|isbn=1587781972|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eckhart Tolle]], a spiritual teacher who is alive today, defines acceptance as a "this is it" response to anything occurring in any moment of life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} There, strength, peace and serenity are available when one stops struggling to resist, or hang on tightly to what is so in any given moment. What do I have right now?  Now what am I experiencing? The point is, can one be sad when one is sad, afraid when afraid, silly when silly, happy when happy, judgmental when judgmental, overthinking when overthinking, serene when serene, etc. 

To simplify, acceptance means allowing; allowing unwanted private experiences (thoughts, feelings and urges) to come and go without struggling with them.

==Types==
Before any breakdown to types, it should be recognized that ''acceptance'' is treating whatever happens, the actual event which is the outcome of all combined previous events, as overall the best outcome. Acceptance typically contains the concept of approval; the [[Psychology|psycho]]-[[Spirituality|spiritual]] use of the term infers a non-judgmental mindset. Acceptance is contrasted with ''resistance'', a term that has strong political and [[psychoanalytic]] connotations that do not apply in most contexts. Groups and individuals can show acceptance of various events and conditions in the world; individuals may accept elements of their own thoughts, feelings, and personal histories. For example, [[psychotherapeutic]] treatment of a person with [[depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]] can involve fostering acceptance either for whatever personal circumstances may give rise to those feelings or for the feelings themselves. Psychotherapy can also involve lessening an individual's acceptance of various situations.

Notions of acceptance are prominent in many faiths and meditation practices. For example, [[Buddhism]]'s [[Four Noble Truths|first noble truth]], "All life is suffering", invites people to accept that [[suffering]] is a natural part of life. The term "[[Kabbalah]]" literally means acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[minority group|Minority groups]] in society often describe their goal as acceptance, wherein the [[Normative social influence|majority]] will not [[marginalize]] the minority's full participation in society. A majority may be said to [[Toleration|tolerate]] minorities when it confines their participation to certain aspects of society, but not accept them.

Acceptance is the fifth stage of the [[Kübler-Ross model]] (commonly known as the "stages of dying").

''The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous'' describes the importance of acceptance in the treatment of alcoholism. It states that acceptance can be used to resolve situations where a person feels disturbed by a "person, place, thing or situation – some fact of [their] life – [which is] unacceptable to [them]". It claims that an alcoholic person cannot find serenity until they accept that "nothing happens in God's world by mistake" and that the condition of alcoholism must be accepted as a given.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Paul O, "The big book of Alcoholics Anonymous" P449, 3rd ed or P417, 4th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-acceptance===
{{main article|Self-acceptance}}
Self-acceptance is being satisfied with one's current [[self]]. It is an agreement with oneself to appreciate, validate, and support the self as it is, despite deficiencies and negative past behavior. People have trouble accepting themselves because of a lack of [[motivation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Some people have the misconception that if one is happy with themself, they would not change anything about themself. Individuals do not have to be unhappy with themselves to know and can actively change things they don't like.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Social acceptance===
[[File:Percentage Reporting living together as acceptable option.png|thumb|Changes in attitudes toward [[cohabitation]] in the [[United States|US]]]]

Social acceptance affects people of all [[Social group|social]] and age groups. Social acceptance can be defined as tolerating the differences and [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in others because most people attempt to look and act like others do in order to fit in.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Children and teenagers tend to desire to be accepted among friends as part of that group, and act upon that desire through [[peer pressure]]. Peer pressure sometimes determines how people style their hair and clothing to "look cool". A [[Motivation|desire]] to be accepted by those whose friendship one values can [[Social influence|determine their openness]] towards popular behavior smoking, drinking, swearing, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Drinking, smoking causes early heart problems |url=https://www.krem.com/article/news/health/drinking-smoking-causes-early-heart-problems/293-588907864 |website=KREM |publisher=KREM |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People exhibit and avoid certain behaviors out of the desire for the [[Social approval|approval]] of their friends, which may include [[Alcoholic drink|drinking]] or taking [[Narcotic|drugs]].

When it comes to [[Mental disabilites|mental disabilities]], social acceptance plays a big role in [[Recovery model|recovery]]. Many people don't understand mental illness, so they are unsure of how to embrace people who have a disease, leaving these people with feelings of [[Social isolation|isolation]] in friend groups.

===Conditional===
[[File:Infant furniture acceptable gaps.svg|thumb|Standards specify acceptable and hazardous gaps in [[infant bed]]s]]

A type of acceptance that requires modification of the initial conditions before the final acceptance is made, is called conditional acceptance, or qualified acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} For example, a contract that needs to be accepted from two parties may be adjusted or modified so that it fits both parties' satisfactions. A person has been made an offer that they are willing to agree on as long as some changes are made in its terms or that some conditions or event occurs gives conditional acceptance. In a contract that is made from a business to the employer, both parties may change and modify the contract until both parties agree or accept the details in the business contract.

===Expressed===

Expressed acceptance involves making an [[wikt:overt|overt]] and unambiguous acceptance of the set conditions. For example, a person clearly and explicitly agreeing to an offer. They accept the terms without any changes.

===Implied===

Implied acceptance has one's intents to consent to the presented conditions made. Acceptance is implied by demonstrating any act indicating a person's assent to the proposed bargain. If a lady selects an item in a department store and pays the cashier for it, the lady has indicated that she has agreed to the department stores owner's offer to sell the item for the price stated on the price tag.

== Beliefs ==

Acceptance is fundamental to the core beliefs of most [[Abrahamic]] religions: the word "[[Islam]]" can be translated as "acceptance", "surrender" or "voluntary submission",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVyMAvW9slYC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=surrender+to+will+of+God+islam#v=onepage&amp;q=surrender%20to%20will%20of%20God%20islam&amp;f=false|first1=Bernard Ellis|last1=Lewis|first2=Buntzie Ellis|last2=Churchill|title=Islam: The Religion and the People|page=8|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=admin |title=What does ISLAM mean? |url=http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ |work=The Friday Journal |publisher=qaem.org |accessdate=13 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314072458/http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christianity]] is based upon the "acceptance" of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the [[Christ]] and acceptance of God's will. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest a path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and [[Fate|fated]], or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk. Acceptance may imply only a lack of outward, behavioral attempts at possible change, but the word is also used more specifically for a felt or hypothesized [[cognitive]] or [[emotional]] state.

Within [[Christian]] beliefs, acceptance is characterized as embracing the reality of a situation based on one's [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] in God's perfect will and control. In the [[Muslim]] community, acceptance of Allah is similar to people that are considered [[Christian]] and how they accept God as their higher being (Bates, 2002). [[Judaism|Jewish]] people accept the [[Ten Commandments|Commandments]] as a way to live and have a good and fulfilling life (Mcdowell and Stewart, 1983).

[[Belief]]s and acceptance overlap in meaning. The acceptance of one's beliefs is important to show commitment and structure of one's life. Not only is it vital for [[Surviving|survival]], but it is used in everyday relationships.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Being accepted by a friend has shown to positively affect an individual's [[self-esteem]] and [[well-being]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} In fact, without acceptance, it could lead to a host of psychological issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''''Agrippa (A Book of the Dead)''''' is a work of art created by science fiction novelist [[William Gibson]], artist [[Dennis Ashbaugh]] and publisher Kevin Begos Jr. in 1992.&lt;ref name=stg/&gt;&lt;ref name=jonas&gt;{{cite news |first=Gerald |last=Jonas |title= The Disappearing $2,000 Book |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DE1030F93AA1575BC0A965958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=August 29, 1993 |accessdate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work consists of a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem by Gibson, embedded in an [[artist's book]] by Ashbaugh.&lt;ref name=text/&gt; Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title is taken from a photo album). Its principal notoriety arose from the fact that the poem, stored on a 3.5" [[floppy disk]], was programmed to encrypt itself after a single use; similarly, the pages of the artist's book were treated with photosensitive chemicals, effecting the gradual fading of the words and images from the book's first exposure to light.&lt;ref name=text&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kirschenbaum |first = Matthew G. | editor = Burns, Edward | journal = Text: an Interdisciplinary Annual of Textual Studies | publisher = University of Michigan Press | location = Ann Arbor | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-472-11272-4 | title=Textual Studies and First Generation Electronic Objects |pages=15–16 | volume= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and concept==
The impetus for the initiation of the project was Kevin Begos Jr., a publisher of museum-quality manuscripts motivated by disregard for the [[commercialism]] of the art world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barber | first = John | title = New Worlds, New Words | publisher = Hampton Press | location = Cresskill | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-57273-333-0 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested to abstract painter [[Dennis Ashbaugh]] that they "put out an art book on computer that vanishes".&lt;ref name=postapoc&gt;{{cite book | last = Schwenger | first =Peter |editor= Dellamora, Richard | title = Postmodern Apocalypse | chapter=''Agrippa'', or, The Apocalyptic Book |publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | location = Philadelphia | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-8122-1558-3 |pages=277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashbaugh—who despite his "heavy art-world resume" was bored with the [[abstract impressionism|abstract impressionist]] paintings he was doing—took the suggestion seriously, and developed it further.&lt;ref name="postapoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cyberlit&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |url=http://www.textfiles.com/sf/cyberlit.txt |title=Cyber Lit |date=June 1992 |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |issue=134 |accessdate=September 29, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080924005406/http://www.textfiles.com/sf/cyberlit.txt| archivedate= September 24, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years beforehand, Ashbaugh had written a [[fan letter]] to [[cyberpunk]] novelist [[William Gibson]], whose oeuvre he had admired, and the pair had struck up a telephone friendship.&lt;ref name=postapoc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cyberlit/&gt; Shortly after the project had germinated in the minds of Begos and Ashbaugh, they contacted and recruited Gibson.&lt;ref name=jonas/&gt; The project exemplified Gibson's deep ambivalence towards technologically advanced futurity, and as ''[[The New York Times]]'' expressed it, was "designed to challenge conventional notions about books and art while extracting money from collectors of both".&lt;ref name=jonas/&gt;
{{quotation|Some people have said that they think this is a scam or pure hype … [m]aybe fun, maybe interesting, but still a scam. But Gibson thinks of it as becoming a memory, which he believes is more real than anything you can actually see.|Kevin Begos Jr., End Notes|&lt;ref name=fein&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Notes|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD9153DF93BA25752C1A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=October 10, 2008 |first=Esther B. |last=Fein |date=November 18, 1992 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=25%}}
The project manifested as a poem written by Gibson incorporated into an [[artist's book]] created by Ashbaugh; as such it was as much a work of collaborative [[conceptual art]] as poetry.&lt;ref name=tabbi/&gt; Gibson stated that Ashbaugh's design "eventually included a supposedly [[Self-destruct|self-devouring]] floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/source.asp |title=Introduction to Agrippa: A Book of the Dead |last=Gibson |first=William |work=WilliamGibsonBooks.com |year=1992 |accessdate=November 11, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071120193555/http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/source.asp| archivedate= November 20, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashbaugh was gleeful at the dilemma this would pose to librarians: in order to register the copyright of the book, he had to send two copies to the United States [[Library of Congress]], who, in order to classify it had to read it, and in the process, necessarily had to destroy it.&lt;ref name=cyberlit/&gt; The creators had initially intended to infect the disks with a [[computer virus]], but declined to after considering the potential damage to the computer systems of innocents.&lt;ref name=cyberlit/&gt;

Academic researcher Matthew Kirschenbaum has reported that a pirated text of the poem was released the next day on [[MindVox]], "an edgy New York City-based electronic bulletin board".&lt;ref name=kirschenbaum/&gt; Kirschenbaum considers Mindvox, an interface between the [[dark web]] and the global Internet, to have been "an ideal initial host".&lt;ref name=kirschenbaum/&gt; The text spread rapidly from that point on, first on [[FTP]] servers and [[anonymous mailer]]s and later via [[USENET]] and [[listserv]] email. Since Gibson did not use email at the time, fans sent copies of the pirated text to his [[fax machine]].&lt;ref name=tiahe/&gt;

The precise manner in which the text was obtained for MindVox is unclear, although the initial custodian of the text, known only as "Templar" attached to it an introductory note in which he claimed credit.&lt;ref name=kirschenbaum/&gt; Begos claimed that a troupe of [[New York University]] students representing themselves as documentarians attended The Transmission and made a [[videotape]] recording of the screen as it displayed the text as an accompaniment of Jillette's reading. Kirschenbaum speculates that this group included the offline persona of Templar or one of his associates. According to this account, ostensibly endorsed by Templar in a post to [[Slashdot]] in February 2000,&lt;ref name=kirschenbaum/&gt; the students then transcribed the poem from the tape and within hours had uploaded it to MindVox. However, according to a dissenting account by [[hacktivist]] and MindVox co-founder [[Patrick K. Kroupa]], subterfuge prior to The Transmission elicited a betrayal of trust which yielded the uploaders the text. Kirschenbaum declined to elaborate on the specifics of the Kroupa conjecture, which he declared himself "not at liberty to disclose".&lt;ref name=kirschenbaum/&gt;

On December 9, 2008 (the sixteenth anniversary of the original Transmission), "The Agrippa Files", working with a scholarly team at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], released an emulated run of the entire poem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/category/the-book-subcategories/the-poem-running-in-emulation |title=The Agrippa Files " The Poem Running in Emulation |website=Agrippa.english.ucsb.edu |date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (derived from an original diskette loaned by a collector) and an hour's worth of "bootleg" footage shot covertly at the Americas Society (the source of the text that was posted on [[MindVox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bootleg Video of "Transmission" Event at the Americas Society, With Live Run of the Diskette Containing William Gibson's "Agrippa" (9 December 1992) | url=http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/post/documents-subcategories/the-transmission/bootleg-video-of-a-live-run-of-the-diskette-containing-william-gibsons-poem-at-the-americas-society-public-unveiling-of-agrippa-december-9-1992 |accessdate=December 13, 2008 | publisher=The Agrippa Files| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081214075631/http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/post/documents-subcategories/the-transmission/bootleg-video-of-a-live-run-of-the-diskette-containing-william-gibsons-poem-at-the-americas-society-public-unveiling-of-agrippa-december-9-1992| archivedate= December 14, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryptography===
Since its debut in 1992, the mystery of ''Agrippa'' remained hidden for 20 years. Although many had tried to hack the code and decrypt the program, the uncompiled source code was lost long ago. Alan Liu and his team at "The Agrippa Files"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/ |title=The Agrippa Files |website=Agrippa.english.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; created an extensive website with tools and resources to crack the Agrippa Code. They collaborated with Matthew Kirschenbaum at the [[Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities]] and the Digital Forensics Lab, and Quinn DuPont, a PhD student of cryptography from the University of Toronto, in calling for the aid of cryptographers to figure out how the program works by creating "Cracking the Agrippa Code: The Challenge",&lt;ref name=CAG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crackingagrippa.net/ |title=Cracking the Agrippa Code |website=Crackingagrippa.net |date=March 25, 1992 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enlisted participants to solve the intentional scrambling of the poem in exchange for prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Goodin | first = Dan | title = Solve 20-year-old mystery in William Gibson's "Agrippa"; win prizes | url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/william-gibsons-agrippa-mystery-challenge/ | publisher = Ars Technica | date = July 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code was successfully cracked by Robert Xiao in late July 2012.&lt;ref name=CAG /&gt;

There is no encryption algorithm present in the Agrippa binary; consequently, the visual encryption effect that displays when the poem has finished is a ruse. The visual effect is the result of running the decrypted ciphertext (in memory) through the re-purposed bit-scrambling decryption algorithm, and then abandoning the text in memory. Only the fake genetic code is written back to disk.&lt;ref name=CAG /&gt;

The encryption resembles the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-[[byte]] blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position [[Permutation cipher|permutation]], then the bits are split into two 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 bits of the second byte and the 8 bits of the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 bits of the third byte and the 4 high bits of the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, [[Modulo operation|mod]] 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable as part of the program. To shroud the would-be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple [[Lzw]] before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.

In order to prevent a second running of the program it corrupts itself when run. The program simply overwrites itself with a 6000 byte long [[DNA]]-like code at a certain position. Archival documents suggest that the original plan was to use a series of ASCII 1's to corrupt the binary, but at some point in development a change was made to use fake genetic code, in keeping with the visual motifs in the book.&lt;ref name=CAG /&gt; The genetic code has a codon entropy of 5.97 bits/[[DNA codon table|codon]], much higher than any natural DNA sequence known. However, the ciphertext was not overwritten.

====Weakness====
*A memory dump of Mini [[vMac]] can be obtained with Linux ckpt&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~zandy/ckpt/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620201208/http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~zandy/ckpt/ |date=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a similar tool after the Agrippa program has been loaded. The executable code could be reverse engineered.
*The encryption itself due to the block cipher exhibited a regular pattern due to repeated text in the original plaintext.
*The LZW compression itself does not hide the letter frequencies.
*The scramble display has exactly the same letter frequencies as the underlying plaintext.

== Poem ==
[[File:William Gibson 60th birthday portrait.jpg|alt=Head shot of a short haired man wearing rimless glasses. His eyes are in shadow.|thumb|[[William Gibson]], author of the ''Agrippa'' poem, pictured in Paris on his 60th birthday, May 17, 2008.]]
The construction of the book and the subject matter of the poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adrian |last=Dannatt |authorlink=Adrian Dannatt |title=The book that ate itself |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=December 19, 1992&lt;!-- |accessdate=August 3, 2008--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iet/&gt; In this light, critic Peter Schwenger asserts that ''Agrippa'' can be understood as organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself.&lt;ref name=imp&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston | first = John | title = Information Multiplicity | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-8018-5705-8 |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walker | first = Janice | title = The Columbia Guide to Online Style | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-231-10788-9 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme and form===
The poem is a detailed description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, and even their pets.
{{quote|text=It starts around 1919 and moves up to today, or possibly beyond. If it works, it makes the reader uncomfortably aware of how much we tend to accept the contemporary media version of the past. You can see it in Westerns, the way the '[[Mise en scène|mise-en-scene]]' and the collars on cowboys change through time. It's never really the past; it's always a version of your own time.|sign=Gibson|source=as quoted in ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', June 1992.&lt;ref name=cyberlit/&gt;}}
In its original form, the text of the poem was supposed to fade from the page and, in Gibson's own words, "eat itself" off of the diskette enclosed with the book. The reader would, then, be left with only the memory of the text, much like the speaker is left with only the memory of his home town and his family after moving to Canada from [[South Carolina]], in the course of the poem (as Gibson himself did during the [[Vietnam War]]).&lt;ref name="nomaps"&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Mark Neale]] (director), William Gibson (subject) |title=[[No Maps for These Territories]] |publisher=Docurama |medium=Documentary |date =2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The mechanism" ===
The poem contains a [[motif (narrative)|motif]] of "the mechanism", described as "Forever / Dividing that from this",&lt;ref&gt;''Agrippa'', Pt II, L 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; and which can take the form of the camera or of the ancient gun that misfires in the speaker's hands.&lt;ref name=m802&gt;{{Harvnb|Marcus|2004|p=802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m794&gt;{{Harvnb|Marcus|2004|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology, "the mechanism", is the agent of memory,&lt;ref name=m802/&gt; which transforms subjective experience into allegedly objective records (photography). It is also the agent of life and death, one moment dispensing lethal bullets, but also likened to the life-giving qualities of sex. Shooting the gun is "[l]ike the first time you put your mouth / on a woman".&lt;ref&gt;''Agrippa'', Pt II, L 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem is, then, not merely about memory, but how memories are formed from subjective experience, and how those memories compare to mechanically-reproduced recordings. In the poem, "the mechanism" is strongly associated with [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], which can replace [[Qualia|subjective experience]]. Insomuch as memories constitute our [[identity (social science)|identities]], "the mechanism" thus represents the destruction of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] via recordings. Hence both cameras, as devices of recording, and guns, as instruments of destruction, are part of the same mechanism—dividing ''that'' (memory, identity, life) from ''this'' (recordings, anonymity, death).

== Critical reception and influence ==
''Agrippa'' was extremely influential—as a [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]] for the artistic community to appreciate the potential of electronic media—for the extent to which it entered public consciousness.&lt;ref name=iet&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbott | first = Chris | title = Information Communications Technology | publisher = Routledge/Falmer | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-7507-0951-0 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries.&lt;ref name=kilheffer&gt;{{cite news |last=Killheffer |first=Robert |date=September 6, 1993 |title=''Publishers Weekly'' Interviews – William Gibson. |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |url=http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/post/bibliography-subcategories/interviews/killheffer-robert-%E2%80%9Cpublishers-weekly-interviews-%E2%80%94-william-gibson%E2%80%9D |accessdate=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended,&lt;ref name=cyberlit/&gt; raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref name=kilheffer/&gt; ''Agrippa'' was also used as the key of a [[book cipher]] in the [[Cicada 3301]] mystery.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell |first=Chris |title=Cicada 3301 update: the baffling internet mystery is back |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10555088/Cicada-3301-update-the-baffling-internet-mystery-is-back.html |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MRiyOtNI?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10555088/Cicada-3301-update-the-baffling-internet-mystery-is-back.html |archivedate=January 7, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lecture at the exhibition of ''Agrippa'' at the [[Center for Book Arts]] in New York City, semiotician Marshall Blonsky of [[New York University]] drew an allusion between the project and the work of two French literary figures—philosopher [[Maurice Blanchot]] (author of "[[The Absence of the Book]]"), and poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], a 19th-century forerunner of [[semiotics]] and [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref name=jonas/&gt; In response to Blonsky's analysis that "[t]he collaborators in ''Agrippa'' are responding to a historical condition of language, a modern skepticism about it", Gibson disparagingly commented "Honest to God, these academics who think it's all some sort of big-time French philosophy—that's a scam. Those guys worship [[Jerry Lewis]], they get our pop culture all wrong."&lt;ref name=jonas/&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:air_source_heat_pump_principle.jpg|200px|thumb|A visual representation of the air source heat pump principle|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 23 January 2008|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

An '''air source [[heat pump]]''' (ASHP) is a system which transfers heat from outside to inside a building, or vice versa. Under the principles of [[vapor compression refrigeration]], an ASHP uses a [[refrigerant]] system involving a compressor and a condenser to absorb heat at one place and release it at another. They can be used as a space heater or cooler, and are sometimes called "reverse-cycle air conditioners".

In domestic heating use, an ASHP absorbs heat from outside air and releases it inside the building, as hot air, hot water-filled radiators, underfloor heating and/or domestic hot water supply. The same system can often do the reverse in summer, cooling the inside of the house. When correctly specified, an ASHP can offer a full central heating solution and domestic hot water up to 80&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Description==
[[Air]] at any temperature above [[absolute zero]] contains some energy. An air-source heat pump transfers ('pumps') some of this energy as heat from one place to another, for example between the outside and inside of a building. This can provide space heating and/or hot water. A single system can be designed to transfer heat in either direction, to heat or cool the interior of the building in winter and summer respectively. For simplicity, the description below focuses on use for interior heating.

The technology is similar to a refrigerator or freezer or air conditioning unit: the different effect is due to the physical location of the different system components. Just as the pipes on the back of a refrigerator become warm as the interior cools, so an ASHP warms the inside of a building whilst cooling the outside air.

The main components of an air-source heat pump are:
* An outdoor heat exchanger coil, which extracts heat from ambient air
* An indoor heat exchanger coil, which transfers the heat into hot air ducts, an indoor heating system such as water-filled radiators or  underfloor circuits and/or a domestic hot water tank

Air source heat pumps can provide fairly low cost space heating. A high efficiency heat pump can provide up to four times as much heat as an electric heater using the same energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homebuilding.co.uk/2012/05/09/heat-pumps-the-real-cost/ Heat Pumps: The Real Cost]&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison to gas as a primary heat source, however, the lifetime cost of an air source heat pump may be affected by the price of electricity compared to gas (where available). Use of gas may be associated with higher carbon emissions, depending upon how the electricity is generated.

A "standard" domestic air source heat pump can extract useful heat down to about {{convert|-15|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air source heat pumps / Choosing a renewable technology |url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generating-energy/Choosing-a-renewable-technology/Air-source-heat-pumps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}--&gt; At colder outdoor temperatures the heat pump is less efficient; it could be switched off and the premises heated using only supplemental heat (or emergency heat) if the supplemental heating system is large enough. There are specially designed heat pumps that, while giving up some performance in cooling mode, will provide useful heat extraction to even lower outdoor temperatures.

==In cold climates==
An air source heat pump designed specifically for very cold climates can extract useful heat from ambient air as cold −30&amp;nbsp;°C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F). Manufacturers include Mitsubishi and Fujitsu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Air Source Heat Pumps A Threat To Geothermal Heat Pump Suppliers?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2014/01/15/are-air-source-heat-pumps-a-threat-to-geothermal-heat-pump-suppliers/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Mitsubishi model provides heat at −35&amp;nbsp;°C, but the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP) drops to 0.9, indicating that resistance heating would be more efficient at that temperature. At −30&amp;nbsp;°C, the COP is 1.1, according to the manufacturer's data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitsubishi ZUBA Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps |url=http://encore-geothermal.ca/sustainable-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps/ |publisher=Encore Heating and Cooling, Kanata, Ontario |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021195035/http://encore-geothermal.ca/sustainable-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps/ |archivedate=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the manufacturer's marketing literature also claims a minimum COP of 1.4 and performance to −30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zuba-Central|url=http://www.mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac/PDF/zuba-central/Zuba-Central_Catalogue.pdf|publisher=Mitsubishi Electric|accessdate=15 October 2014|page=5|quote=Zuba-Central’s COP ranges from 1.4 to 3.19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731072149/http://mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac/PDF/zuba-central/Zuba-Central_Catalogue.pdf|archivedate=31 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although air source heat pumps are less efficient than well-installed [[ground source heat pump]]s in cold conditions, air source heat pumps have lower initial costs and may be the most economic or practical choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Air Source Heat Pumps A Threat To Geothermal Heat Pump Suppliers?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2014/01/15/are-air-source-heat-pumps-a-threat-to-geothermal-heat-pump-suppliers/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Natural Resources Canada]] found that cold climate air source heat pumps (CC-ASHPs) do work in Canadian winters, based on testing in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] in late December 2012 to early January 2013 using a ducted CC-ASHP. (The report does not explicitly state whether backup heat sources should be considered for temperatures below −30&amp;nbsp;°C. The record low for Ottawa is −36&amp;nbsp;°C.) The CC-ASHP provided 60% energy (though not energy cost) savings compared to natural gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps: Results from Testing at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology |url=http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |ref=NRC |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150417/http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when considering only energy efficiency in the home. When considering energy efficiency in electricity generation however, more energy would be used with the CC-ASHP, relative to natural gas heating, in provinces or territories ([[Alberta]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]) where coal-fired generation was the predominant method of electricity generation. (The energy savings in [[Saskatchewan]] were marginal. Other provinces use primarily hydroelectric and/or nuclear generation.) Despite the significant energy savings relative to gas in provinces not relying primarily on coal, the higher cost of electricity relative to natural gas (using 2012 retail prices in Ottawa, Ontario) made natural gas the less expensive energy source. (The report did not calculate the cost of operation in the province of [[Quebec]], which has lower electricity rates, nor did it show the impact of time of use electricity rates.) The study found that in Ottawa a CC-ASHP cost 124% more to operate than the natural gas system. However, in areas where natural gas is not available to homeowners, 59% energy cost savings can be realized relative to heating with fuel oil. The report noted that about 1 million residences in Canada (8%) are still heated with fuel oil. The report shows 54% energy cost savings for CC-ASHPs relative to electric baseboard resistance heating. Based on these savings, the report showed a five-year payback for converting from either fuel oil or electric baseboard resistance heating to a CC-ASHP. (The report did not specify whether that calculation considered the possible need for an electrical service upgrade in the case of converting from fuel oil. Presumably no electrical service upgrade would be needed if converting from electric resistance heat.) The report did note greater fluctuations in room temperature with the heat pump due to its defrost cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps: Results from Testing at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology |url=http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |ref=NRC |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150417/http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity==
Air source heat pumps can last for over 20 years with low maintenance requirements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- unreliable sources: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions by Danfoss Heat Pumps|url=http://www.ecoheatpumps.co.uk/heat_pump_faq.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How air source heat pumps work from HomeTips.com|url=http://www.hometips.com/heatpumps-airsource.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris. Heat pumps have more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Ground source heat pumps have fewer moving parts than air source heat pumps as they do not need fans or defrosting mechanisms and are located indoors. The ground array for a ground source installation should last for over 100 years.

==Usage==
Air source heat pumps are used to provide interior space heating and cooling even in colder climates, and can be used efficiently for water heating in milder climates. A major advantage of some ASHPs is that the same system may be used for heating in winter and cooling in summer, though it is not true air conditioning without a facility to adjust the humidity of the inside air. Though the [[cost]] of installation is generally high, it is less than the cost of a [[Geothermal heat pump|''ground source'' heat pump]], because a ground source heat pump requires excavation to install its ground loop. The advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it has access to the thermal storage capacity of the ground which allows it to produce more heat for less electricity in cold conditions.

ASHPs are often paired with auxiliary or emergency heat systems to provide backup heat when outside temperatures are too low for the pump to work efficiently, or in the event the pump malfunctions. Since ASHPs have high capital costs, and efficiency drops as temperature decreases, it is generally not cost-effective to size a system for the coldest possible temperature scenario, even if an ASHP could meet the entire heat requirement at the coldest temperatures expected. [[Propane]], natural gas, oil or [[pellet fuel]] furnaces can provide this supplementary heat.

All-electric heat pump systems have an electric furnace or electric resistance heat, or strip heat, which typically consists of rows of electric coils that heat up. A fan blows over the heated coils and circulates warm air throughout the home. This serves as an adequate heating source, but as temperatures go down, electricity costs rise. Electrical service outages pose the same threat as to [[Forced air|central forced-air systems]] and pump-based boilers, but woodstoves and non-electric [[fireplace insert]]s can mitigate this risk. Some ASHPs can be coupled to [[solar panel]]s as primary energy source, with a conventional electric grid as backup source.

Thermal storage solutions incorporating resistance heating can be used in conjunction with ASHPs. Storage may be more cost-effective if time of use electricity rates are available. Heat is stored in high density ceramic bricks contained within a thermally-insulated enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Franklin Energy Services, LLC |title=Air Source Heat Pump Efficiency Gains from  Low Ambient Temperature Operation Using  Supplemental Electric Heating: Thermal Storage Supplemental Heating Systems |url=http://mn.gov/commerce/energy/images/CIP-AirSource-Pump-Report.pdf |publisher=Minnesota Division of Energy Resources; Minnesota Department of Commerce |accessdate=15 October 2014 |page=9 |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611123108/http://mn.gov/commerce/energy/images/CIP-AirSource-Pump-Report.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASHPs may also be paired with passive solar heating. Thermal mass (such as concrete or rocks) heated by passive solar heat can help stabilize indoor temperatures, absorbing heat during the day and releasing heat at night, when outdoor temperatures are colder and heat pump efficiency is lower.

The outdoor section on some units may 'frost up' when there is sufficient moisture in the air and outdoor temperature is  between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 5&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F to 41&amp;nbsp;°F){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. This restricts air flow across the outdoor coil. These units employ a defrost cycle where the system switches temporarily to 'cooling' mode to move heat from the home to the outdoor coil to melt the ice. This requires the supplementary heater (resistance electric or gas) to activate.  The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less.  As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air.

It is difficult to retrofit conventional heating systems that use radiators/radiant panels, hot water baseboard heaters, or even smaller diameter ducting, with ASHP-sourced heat. The lower heat pump output temperatures would mean radiators would have to be increased in size or a low temperature [[underfloor heating]] system be installed instead. Alternatively, a high temperature heat pump can be installed and existing heat emitters can be retained.

==Technology==

[[File:Refrigerator-cycle.svg|thumb|A: indoor compartment, B: outdoor compartment, I: insulation, 1: condenser, 2: expansion valve, 3: evaporator, 4: compressor]]
Heating and cooling is accomplished by pumping a [[refrigerant]] through the heat pump's indoor and outdoor coils. Like in a refrigerator, a [[gas compressor|compressor]], [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], [[expansion valve (steam engine)|expansion valve]] and [[evaporator]] are used to change states of the refrigerant between colder [[liquid]] and hotter [[gas]] states.

When the liquid refrigerant at a low [[temperature]] and low pressure passes through the outdoor heat exchanger coils, ambient heat causes the liquid to boil (change to gas or [[vapor]]): heat energy from the outside air has been absorbed and stored in the refrigerant as [[latent heat]]. The gas is then compressed using an electric pump; the compression increases the temperature of the gas.

Inside the building, the gas passes through a pressure [[valve]] into heat exchanger coils.  There, the hot refrigerant gas condenses back to a liquid and transfers the stored [[latent heat]] to the indoor air, water heating or hot water system. The indoor air or heating water is pumped across the heat exchanger by an electric pump or [[fan (mechanical)|fan]].

The cool liquid refrigerant then re-enter the outdoor heat exchanger coils to begin a new cycle.

Most heat pumps can also operate in a cooling mode where the cold refrigerant is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air.

==Efficiency ratings==
The 'Efficiency' of air source heat pumps is measured by the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP). A COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes. Within temperature ranges of −3&amp;nbsp;°C to 10&amp;nbsp;°C, the COP for many machines is fairly stable at 3–3.5.

In very mild weather, the COP of an air source heat pump can be up to 4. However, on a cold winter day, it takes more work to move the same amount of heat indoors than on a mild day.&lt;ref&gt;Efficiency of heat pumps in changing conditions, http://www.icax.co.uk/Air_Source_Heat_Pumps.html&lt;/ref&gt; The heat pump's performance is limited by the [[Carnot cycle]] and will approach 1.0 as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases, which for most air source heat pumps happens as outdoor temperatures approach −18&amp;nbsp;°C / 0&amp;nbsp;°F. Heat pump construction that enables carbon dioxide as a refrigerant may have a COP of greater than 2 even down to −20&amp;nbsp;°C, pushing the break-even figure downward to −30&amp;nbsp;°C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F). A [[ground source heat pump]] has comparatively less of a change in COP as outdoor temperatures change, because the ground from which they extract heat has a more constant temperature than outdoor air.

The design of a heat pump has a considerable impact on its efficiency. Many air source heat pumps are designed primarily as [[air conditioning unit]]s, mainly for use in summer temperatures. Designing a heat pump specifically for the purpose of heat exchange can attain greater COP ratings and an extended life cycle. The principal changes are in the scale and type of compressor and evaporator.

Seasonally adjusted heating and cooling efficiencies are given by the [[heating seasonal performance factor]] (HSPF) and [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER) respectively.

In units charged with [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]], the COP rating is reduced when heat pumps are used to heat domestic water to over 60&amp;nbsp;°C or to heat conventional [[central heating]] systems that use radiators to distribute heat (instead of an underfloor heating array).

==Risks and precautions==
*Conventional air source heat pumps lose their capacity as the external temperatures fall below 5 degrees Celsius (about 41 degrees Fahrenheit). CC-ASHPs (see above) may operate efficiently in temperatures as low as −30C, although they may not be as efficient in cooling during the summer season as conventional air source heat pumps. If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all.
*An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or [[pellet fuel]] furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures.

==Controversy==

Units charged with [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]] are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, as measured in [[global warming potential]] (GWP) and [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP). Recent government mandates{{where?|date=February 2013}} have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Impact on electric utilities==

While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. Even if there is a non-electric backup system, the fact that efficiencies of ASHPs decrease with outside temperatures is a concern to electric utilities. The drop in efficiency means their electrical load increases steeply as temperatures drop. A study in Canada's [[Yukon Territory]], where [[diesel generator]]s are used for peaking capacity, noted that widespread adoption of air source heat pumps could lead to increased diesel consumption if the increased electrical demand due to ASHP use exceeds available hydroelectric capacity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evaluation of Air Source Heat Pump Technology in Yukon|url=http://www.energy.gov.yk.ca/pdf/air_source_heat_pumps_final_may2013_v04.pdf|publisher=Government of Yukon’s Energy Solution Centre and Yukon Energy, Mines and Resources|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding those concerns, the study did conclude that ASHPs are a cost effective heating alternative for Yukon residents.
As [[wind farm]]s are increasingly used to supply electricity to the grid, the increased winter load matches well with the increased winter generation from [[wind turbine]]s and calmer days result in decreased heating load for most houses even if the air temperature is low.

[[File:Aleph0.svg|thumb|right|150px|Aleph-naught, or aleph-null, the smallest infinite cardinal number]]

In [[mathematics]], and in particular [[set theory]], the '''aleph numbers''' are a sequence of numbers used to represent the [[cardinality]] (or size) of [[infinite set]]s that can be [[well-ordered]]. They are named after the symbol used to denote them, the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letter [[aleph]] (&lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt;) (though in older mathematics books the letter aleph is often printed upside down by accident,&lt;ref&gt;For example, in {{harv|Sierpiński|1958|loc=p.402}} the letter aleph appears both the right way up and upside down&lt;/ref&gt; partly because a [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]] matrix for aleph was mistakenly constructed the wrong way up).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mr=0553111 
|last=Swanson|first= Ellen|first2= Arlene Ann|last2= O'Sean|first3= Antoinette Tingley |last3=Schleyer
|title=Mathematics into type: Copy editing and proofreading of mathematics for editorial assistants and authors|edition= updated|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |place= Providence, R.I.|year=1999|origyear= 1979|isbn=  0-8218-0053-1 |pages= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinality of the [[natural number]]s is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (read ''aleph-naught'' or ''aleph-zero''; the German term ''aleph-null'' is also sometimes used), the next larger cardinality is aleph-one &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_2&lt;/math&gt; and so on. Continuing in this manner, it is possible to define a [[cardinal number]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for every [[ordinal number]] α, as described below.

The concept and notation are due to [[Georg Cantor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/set.html|title=Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic|website=jeff560.tripod.com|access-date=2016-05-05|author=Jeff Miller}}  Miller quotes {{Cite book|title=Georg Cantor:His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|author=Joseph Warren Dauben|date=1990|isbn=9780691024479}} : "His new numbers deserved something unique. ... Not wishing to invent a new symbol himself, he chose the aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet...the aleph could be taken to represent new beginnings..."

&lt;/ref&gt; who defined the notion of cardinality and realized that [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|infinite sets can have different cardinalities]].

The aleph numbers differ from the [[Extended real number line|infinity]] (∞) commonly found in algebra and calculus. Alephs measure the sizes of sets; infinity, on the other hand, is commonly defined as an extreme [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the [[real number line]] (applied to a [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] that "[[divergent series|diverges]] to infinity" or "increases without bound"), or an extreme point of the [[extended real number line]].

=={{anchor|Aleph-null}}Aleph-naught==
&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (aleph-naught, also aleph-zero or the German term Aleph-null) is the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers, and is an [[transfinite number|infinite cardinal]]. The set of all finite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], called '''ω''' or '''ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' (where ω is the lowercase Greek letter [[omega]]), has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. A set has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is [[countably infinite]], that is, there is a [[bijection]] (one-to-one correspondence) between it and the natural numbers. Examples of such sets are

* the set of all [[square number]]s, the set of all [[cubic number]]s, the set of all [[fourth power]]s, ...
* the set of all [[perfect power]]s, the set of all [[prime power]]s, 
* the set of all [[even number]]s, the set of all [[odd number]]s,
* the set of all [[prime number]]s, the set of all [[composite number]]s, 
* the set of all [[integer]]s, 
* the set of all [[rational number]]s, 
* the set of all [[constructible number]]s (in the geometric sense),
* the set of all [[algebraic number]]s, 
* the set of all [[computable number]]s, 
* the set of all [[definable number]]s, 
* the set of all binary [[string (computer science)|string]]s of finite length, and 
* the set of all finite [[subset]]s of any given countably infinite set.

These infinite ordinals: ω, ω+1, ω·2, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] are among the countably infinite sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jech | first1=Thomas | title=Set Theory | publisher= [[Springer-Verlag]]| location=Berlin, New York | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sequence (with [[ordinality]] ω·2) of all positive odd integers followed by all positive even integers

:{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}

is an ordering of the set (with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;) of positive integers.

If the [[axiom of countable choice]] (a weaker version of the [[axiom of choice]]) holds, then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than any other infinite cardinal.

==Aleph-one==
&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of the set of all countable [[ordinal number]]s, called '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' or sometimes '''Ω'''. This '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is itself an ordinal number larger than all countable ones, so it is an [[uncountable set]]. Therefore,  &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is distinct from &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The definition of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; implies (in ZF, [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] ''without'' the axiom of choice) that no cardinal number is between &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. If the [[axiom of choice]] is used, it can be further proved that the class of cardinal numbers is [[totally ordered]], and thus &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is the second-smallest infinite cardinal number. Using the axiom of choice we can show one of the most useful properties of the set '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''': any countable subset of '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' has an upper bound in '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  (This follows from the fact that the union of a countable number of countable sets is itself countable, one of the most common applications of the axiom of choice.)  This fact is analogous to the situation in &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;: every finite set of natural numbers has a maximum which is also a natural number, and [[Union (set theory)#Finite unions|finite unions]] of finite sets are finite.

'''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is actually a useful concept, if somewhat exotic-sounding. An example application is "closing" with respect to countable operations; e.g., trying to explicitly describe the [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] generated by an arbitrary collection of subsets (see e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[Borel hierarchy]]). This is harder than most explicit descriptions of "generation" in algebra ([[vector space]]s, [[group theory|group]]s, etc.) because in those cases we only have to close with respect to finite operations—sums, products, and the like. The process involves defining, for each countable ordinal, via [[transfinite induction]], a set by "throwing in" all possible countable unions and complements, and taking the union of all that over all of '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

Every uncountable [[coanalytic]] subset of a [[Polish space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has
cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Continuum hypothesis==
{{main|Continuum hypothesis}}
{{see also|Beth number}}
The [[cardinality]] of the set of [[real number]]s ([[cardinality of the continuum]]) is &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;. It cannot be determined from ZFC ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]]) where this number fits exactly in the aleph number hierarchy, but it follows from ZFC that the continuum hypothesis, '''CH''', is equivalent to the identity

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuumHypothesis.html |title=Continuum Hypothesis|last=Szudzik |first=Mattew |date=31 July 2018 |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Web Resources |access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The CH states that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers. CH is independent of ZFC: it can be neither proven nor disproven within the context of that axiom system (provided that ZFC is [[consistency|consistent]]). That CH is consistent with ZFC was demonstrated by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1940 when he showed that its negation is not a theorem of ZFC.  That it is independent of ZFC was demonstrated by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] in 1963 when he showed, conversely, that the CH itself is not a theorem of ZFC by the (then novel) method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuumHypothesis.html |title=Continuum Hypothesis|last=Szudzik |first=Mattew |date=31 July 2018 |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Web Resources |access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aleph-ω==
Conventionally the smallest infinite ordinal is denoted ω, and the cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the least upper bound of
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\left\{\,\aleph_n : n\in\left\{\,0,1,2,\dots\,\right\}\,\right\}&lt;/math&gt;}}
among alephs.

Aleph-ω is the first uncountable cardinal number that can be demonstrated within Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ''not'' to be equal to the cardinality of the set of all [[real number]]s; for any positive integer ''n'' we can consistently assume that &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_n&lt;/math&gt;, and moreover it is possible to assume &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; is as large as we like. We are only forced to avoid setting it to certain special cardinals with [[cofinality]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, meaning there is an unbounded function from &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; to it (see [[Easton's theorem]]).

==Aleph-α for general α==
To define &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary ordinal number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we must define the [[successor cardinal|successor cardinal operation]], which assigns to any cardinal number ρ the next larger [[well-order]]ed cardinal ρ{{sup|+}} (if the [[axiom of choice]] holds, this is the next larger cardinal).

We can then define the aleph numbers as follows:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{0} = \omega&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha+1} = \aleph_{\alpha}^+&lt;/math&gt;}}

and for λ, an infinite [[limit ordinal]],

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\lambda} = \bigcup_{\beta &lt; \lambda} \aleph_\beta.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The α-th infinite [[initial ordinal]] is written &lt;math&gt;\omega_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  Its cardinality is written &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
In ZFC, the '''aleph function''' &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection from the ordinals to the infinite cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{PlanetMath | urlname=AlephNumbers | title=aleph numbers | id=5710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed points of omega==
For any ordinal α we have
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\alpha\leq\omega_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;}}

In many cases &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is strictly greater than α. For example, for any successor ordinal α this holds. There are, however, some limit ordinals which are [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of the omega function, because of the [[fixed-point lemma for normal functions]]. The first such is the limit of the sequence

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\omega,\ \omega_\omega,\ \omega_{\omega_\omega},\ \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Any [[inaccessible cardinal|weakly inaccessible cardinal]] is also a fixed point of the aleph function.&lt;ref name="Harris 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kaharris.org/teaching/582/Lectures/lec31.pdf | title=Math 582 Intro to Set Theory, Lecture 31 | publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Michigan | date=April 6, 2009 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Harris, Kenneth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be shown in ZFC as follows. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a weakly inaccessible cardinal. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; were a [[successor ordinal]], then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; would be a [[successor cardinal]] and hence not weakly inaccessible. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; were a [[limit ordinal]] less than &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt;, then its [[cofinality]] (and thus the cofinality of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) would be less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt; would not be regular and thus not weakly inaccessible. Thus &lt;math&gt;\lambda \geq \kappa &lt;/math&gt; and consequently &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \kappa &lt;/math&gt; which makes it a fixed point.

==Role of axiom of choice==

The cardinality of any infinite [[ordinal number]] is an aleph number. Every aleph is the cardinality of some ordinal. The least of these is its [[initial ordinal]]. Any set whose cardinality is an aleph is [[equinumerous]] with an ordinal and is thus [[Well-order|well-orderable]].

Each [[finite set]] is well-orderable, but does not have an aleph as its cardinality.

The assumption that the cardinality of each [[infinite set]] is an aleph number is equivalent over ZF to the existence of a well-ordering of every set, which in turn is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]]. ZFC set theory, which includes the axiom of choice, implies that every infinite set has an aleph number as its cardinality (i.e. is equinumerous with its initial ordinal), and thus the initial ordinals of the aleph numbers serve as a class of representatives for all possible infinite cardinal numbers.

When cardinality is studied in ZF without the axiom of choice, it is no longer possible to prove that each infinite set has some aleph number as its cardinality; the sets whose cardinality is an aleph number are exactly the infinite sets that can be well-ordered. The method of [[Scott's trick]] is sometimes used as an alternative way to construct representatives for cardinal numbers in the setting of ZF. For example, one can define card(''S'') to be the set of sets with the same cardinality as ''S'' of minimum possible rank. This has the property that card(''S'') = card(''T'') if and only if ''S'' and ''T'' have the same cardinality. (The set card(''S'') does not have the same cardinality of ''S'' in general, but all its elements do.)

'''Argument from ignorance''' (from {{lang-la|'''argumentum ad ignorantiam'''}}), also known as '''appeal to ignorance''' (in which ''ignorance'' represents "a lack of contrary evidence") is a [[informal fallacy|fallacy in informal logic]]. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true.  This represents a type of [[false dichotomy]] in that it excludes a third option, which is that there may have been an insufficient investigation, and therefore there is insufficient information to prove the proposition be either true or false.  Nor does it allow the admission that the choices may in fact not be two (true or false), but may be as many as four,
# true
# false
# unknown between true or false
#being unknowable (among the first three).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Argumentum ad Ignorantiam|url= http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignorance.html|work= Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic|publisher= [[Lander University]]|year= 2004|accessdate= 2009-04-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090430170946/http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignorance.html| archivedate= 30 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In debates, appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to shift the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]].

== Overview ==
{{essay|section|date=April 2018}}
===Basic argument===
As described in Schreuder's ''Vision and Visual Perception'':&lt;ref name="Schreuder2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duco A. Schreuder|title=Vision and Visual Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I7a7BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|date=3 December 2014|publisher=Archway Publishing|isbn=978-1-4808-1294-9|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=Arguments that appeal to ignorance rely ''merely'' on the fact that the veracity of the proposition is not disproved to arrive at a definite conclusion. These arguments fail to appreciate that the limits of one's understanding or certainty do not change what is true.  They do not ''inform'' upon reality.  That is, whatever the reality is, it does not "wait" upon human logic or analysis to be formulated.  Reality exists at all times, and it exists ''independently'' of what is in the mind of anyone. And the true thrust of science and rational analysis is to separate preconceived notion(s) of what reality is, and to be open at all times to the observation of nature as it behaves, so as truly to ''discover'' reality. This fallacy can be very convincing and is considered by some to be a special case of a ''false dilemma'' or ''false dichotomy'' in that they both fail to consider alternatives. A false dilemma may take the form:
* If a proposition has not been disproved, then it cannot be considered false and must therefore be considered true.
* If a proposition has not been proven, then it cannot be considered true and must therefore be considered false.

Such arguments attempt to exploit the facts that (a) true things can never be disproved and (b) false things can never be proved. In other words, appeals to ignorance claim that the converse of these facts are also true. Therein lies the fallacy.|multiline=y|author=Duco A. Schreuder|title=''Vision and Visual Perception''}}

To reiterate, these arguments ignore the fact, and difficulty, that some true things may never be proved, and some false things may never be disproved with absolute [[certainty]].
The phrase "''the absence of evidence is not the [[evidence of absence]]''" can be used as a shorthand rebuttal to the second form of the ignorance fallacy (i.e. ''P has never been absolutely proved and is therefore certainly false''). Most often it is directed at any conclusion derived from ''[[Null result|null]]'' results in an experiment or from the non-detection of something. In other words, where one researcher may say their experiment suggests evidence of absence, another researcher might argue that the experiment failed to detect a phenomenon for other reasons.

===Matters of confusion===
{{see also|Evidence of absence}}

Much confusion about arguments from ignorance can be caused when one side of a debate forgets that we often possess [[evidence of absence]] in practice. However, the confusion can be avoided by not partaking in a logical debate.

The ignorance fallacy is sometimes confused (or combined) with logically valid [[contrapositive]] arguments. Contrapositive arguments rightly utilize the [[Transposition (logic)|transposition]] rule of inference in classical logic to conclude something like: To the extent that ''C implies E'' then ''Not-E must also imply Not-C''. In other words, if a cause ''always'' leads to an effect, then absence of the expected effect is evidence of absence of the cause. For example, if the causal proposition that ''If it's raining outside then the streets will be wet'' is assumed, then it can be assumed that ''if the streets are not wet then it is not raining outside''. The inference that it cannot be raining outside because the streets are not getting wet is exactly as true, or perhaps exactly as untrue, as the original proposition. The statements are [[contraposition|logically equivalent]].

[[Carl Sagan]] explains in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'':
{{quote|'''Appeal to ignorance''': the claim that whatever has not been proven false must be true, and vice versa. (e.g., ''There is no compelling evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth; therefore, UFOs exist, and there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.'' Or: ''There may be seventy kazillion other worlds, but not one is known to have the moral advancement of the Earth, so we're still central to the Universe.'') This impatience with ambiguity can be criticized in the phrase: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=[[The Demon-Haunted World]]|chapter=Chapter 12: The Fine Art of Baloney Detection}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For instance, absence of evidence that it rained (i.e. water is the evidence) may be considered positive evidence that it did not rain. Again, in science, such inferences are always made to some limited (sometimes extremely high) degree of [[probability]] and in this case absence of evidence is evidence of absence when the positive evidence should have been there but is not.

Arguments from ignorance can easily find their way into debates over the [[existence of God]]. It is a fallacy to draw conclusions based precisely on ignorance, since this does not satisfactorily address issues of [[philosophic burden of proof]].

==Related terms==

=== Contraposition and transposition ===
[[Contraposition (traditional logic)|Contraposition]] is a logically valid rule of inference that allows the creation of a new proposition from the negation and reordering of an existing one. The method applies to any proposition of the type ''If A then B'' and says that negating all the variables and switching them back to front leads to a new proposition i.e. ''If Not-B then Not-A'' that is just as true as the original one and that the first implies the second and the second implies the first.

[[Transposition (logic)|Transposition]] is exactly the same thing as Contraposition, described in a different language.

=== Absence of evidence ===
''Absence of evidence,'' is the lack of – any kind of evidence – that may show, indicate, suggest, or be used to 1) infer, or 2) deduce the truthfulness of an asserted fact.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Negative evidence ===
''Negative evidence'' is sometimes used as an alternative to ''absence of evidence'' and is often meant to be synonymous with it. On the other hand, the term may also refer to evidence with a ''negative'' value, or ''null'' result equivalent to ''evidence of absence''. It may even refer to positive evidence about something of an unpleasant nature.

=== Evidence of absence ===
{{Main| Evidence of absence}}
Evidence of absence is evidence of any kind that can be used to infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something. For instance, if a doctor does not find any ''malignant cells'' in a patient this [[null result]] (finding nothing) is evidence of absence of cancer, even though the doctor has not actually detected anything per se. Such [[inductive reasoning]] is important to [[empiricism]] and science, but has well established limitations. The challenge thus becomes to try to identify when a researcher has received a null result (found nothing) because the thing does not exist (evidence of absence—objectively negative result), and when one simply lacks proper means of detection (absence of evidence—false negative).
==== Null result ====
''[[Null result]]'' is a term often used in science to indicate ''evidence of absence''. A search for water on the ground may yield a null result (the ground is dry); therefore, it probably did not rain.

==Related arguments==

=== Argument from self-knowing (auto-epistemic) ===
Arguments from self-knowing take the form:

# If P were true then I would know it; in fact I do not know it; therefore P cannot be true.
# If P were false then I would know it; in fact I do not know it; therefore P cannot be false.

In practice these arguments are often fallacious and rely on the veracity of the supporting premise. For example, the argument that ''If I had just sat on a wild [[porcupine]] then I would know it; in fact I do not know it; therefore I did not just sit on a wild porcupine'' is probably not a fallacy and depends entirely on the veracity of the leading proposition that supports it. (See [[Contraposition]] and [[Transposition (logic)|Transposition]] in the ''Related terms'' section in this article.)

== Distinguishing ''absence of evidence'' from ''evidence of absence'' ==
''Absence of evidence'' is a condition in which no valid conclusion can be inferred from the ''mere'' absence of detection, normally due to doubt in the detection method. ''[[Evidence of absence]]'' is the successful variation: a conclusion that relies on specific knowledge in conjunction with negative detection to deduce the absence of something. An example of evidence of absence is checking your pockets for spare change and finding nothing, ''but'' being confident that the search would have found it if it was there.

===Formal argument===
By determining that a given experiment or method of detection is sensitive and reliable enough to detect the presence of X (when X is present) one can confidently exclude the possibility that X may be both undetected and present. This allows one to deduce that X cannot be present if a null result is received.

Thus there are only two possibilities, given a null result:
# Nothing detected, and X is not present.
# Nothing detected, but X ''is'' present (option eliminated by careful research design).

To the extent that option 2 can be eliminated, one can deduce that ''if X is not detected then X is not present'' and therefore the [[null result]] is evidence of absence.

== Examples ==

===  Absence of evidence ===
(These examples contain or represent missing information.)

* Statements that begin with "I can't prove it but&amp;nbsp;..." are often referring to some kind of absence of evidence.
* "There is no evidence of foul play here" is a direct reference to the absence of evidence.
* "There is no evidence of aliens, and therefore, aliens do not exist" appeals to an absence of evidence

=== Negative results ===
* When the doctor says that the test results were negative, it is usually good news.
* Under "Termites" the inspector checked the box that read "no".

=== Evidence of absence ===
(These examples contain definite evidence that can be used to show, indicate, suggest, infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something.)

* A biopsy shows the absence of malignant cells.
* One very carefully inspects the back seat of one's car and finds no adult-sized kangaroos.
* The train schedule does not say that the train stops here at 3:00pm on a Sunday. (It could indeed happen that the train will stop here for another reason than the actual schedule, e. g. due to an incident or technical reasons, but the evidence clearly proves that the train ''schedule'' does not include a halt at this station.)

=== Arguments from ignorance ===
(Draws a conclusion based on lack of knowledge or evidence without accounting for all possibilities)
* "I take the view that this lack (of enemy subversive activity in the west coast) is the most ominous sign in our whole situation. It convinces me more than perhaps any other factor that the sabotage we are to get, the [[Fifth Column]] activities are to get, are timed just like Pearl Harbor&amp;nbsp;... I believe we are just being lulled into a false sense of security." – [[Earl Warren]], then California's Attorney General  (before a congressional hearing in San Francisco on 21 February 1942).
* This example clearly states what appeal to ignorance is: "Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/56/Argument-from-Ignoranc|title=Argument from Ignorance|website=www.logicallyfallacious.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
From ''Fallacies: classical and contemporary readings'' by Hans V. Hansen, Robert C. Pinto:
:"It is generally accepted that the philosopher John Locke introduced the term in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding:"
::"Another way that Men ordinarily use to drive others, and force them to submit their Judgments, and receive the Opinion in debate, is to require the Adversary to admit what they allege as a Proof, or assign a better. And this I call Argumentum ad Ignorantiam" —[[John Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1690|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/439/locke0417.htm|accessdate=12 March 2015|chapter=Book IV, Chapter XVII: Of Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rozeta Paryż notre-dame chalger.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Rayonnant]] [[rose window]] in [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. In [[Gothic architecture]], [[light]] was considered the most beautiful revelation of [[God]], which was heralded in its design.]]

'''Beauty'''  is a property or characteristic of an [[animal]], [[idea]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], person or [[Location (geography)|place]] that provides a [[perception|perceptual]] experience of [[pleasure]] or [[Contentment|satisfaction]]. Beauty is studied as part of [[aesthetics]], [[culture]], [[social psychology]], [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]]. An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.

[[Unattractiveness|Ugliness]] is considered to be the opposite of beauty.

The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and [[harmony]] with [[nature]], which may lead to feelings of [[sexual attraction|attraction]] and [[emotional well-being]]. Because this can be a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] experience, it is often said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."&lt;ref name="phrase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html|title=Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=The Phrase Finder|year=2007|author=Gary Martin| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071130023507/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html| archivedate= November 30, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the empirical observations of things that are considered beautiful often aligning with the aforementioned nature and [[health]] thereof, beauty has been stated to have levels of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] as well.

There is also evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by [[natural selection]]; that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html|title=A Darwinian theory of beauty|author=|date=|website=ted.com|accessdate=May 1, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211012601/http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html|archivedate=February 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek==
The classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words "beauty" or "beautiful" was [[wikt:κάλλος|κάλλος]], ''kallos'', and the adjective was καλός, ''kalos''. However, ''kalos'' may and is also translated as ″good″ or ″of fine quality″ and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, ''kallos'' was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konstan|first1=David|title=Beauty - The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-992726-5|pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Koine Greek]] word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, ''hōraios'',&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 23:27, Acts 3:10, Flavius Josephus, 12.65&lt;/ref&gt; an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, ''hōra'', meaning "hour". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with "being of one's hour".&lt;ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"&gt;Euripides, ''Alcestis'' 515.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, ''hōraios'' had many meanings, including "youthful" and "ripe old age".&lt;ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"/&gt;

The [[Beauty (ancient thought)|earliest Western theory of beauty]] can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the [[pre-Socratic]] period, such as [[Pythagoras]]. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between [[mathematics]] and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the [[golden ratio]] seemed more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Seife, Charles (2000). ''[[Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea]]''. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-029647-6}}. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek architecture]] is based on this view of symmetry and [[ratio|proportion]].

Plato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (''to kalon'') and virtue, arguing that "Virtue aims at the beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philosophy]] and sculptures of men and women produced according to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in [[Renaissance]] Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a "classical ideal". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose [[human physical appearance|appearance]] conforms to these tenets is still called a "classical beauty" or said to possess a "classical beauty", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, [[Renaissance]] and [[Humanism|Humanist]] thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his "Lives of Artists") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of [[Gothic art]] lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.

==Middle Ages==
In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Catholic philosopher|Catholic philosophers]] like [[Thomas Aquinas]] included beauty among the [[Transcendentals|transcendental]] attributes of [[being]].  In his [[Summa Theologica]], Aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as: integritas (Wholeness), consonantia (harmony), claritas (radiance of form)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1039.htm#article8 Summa Theologica, Part 1, Question 39, Article 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gothic Architecture of the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages|Late]] [[Middle Ages]], light was considered the most beautiful revelation of [[God]], which was heralded in design.  Examples are the [[Stained glass#Medieval_glass_in_Europe|stained glass]] of Gothic [[Cathedral|Cathedrals]] including [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Chartes Cathedral]].

==The Age of Reason==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', by [[Sandro Botticelli]]. The goddess Venus is the classical personification of beauty.]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] argued that beauty is "unity in variety and variety in unity".&lt;ref&gt;An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of beauty, with [[John Keats]] arguing in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" that

:  Beauty is truth, truth beauty, —that is all.
:  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

==The Romantic period==
In the Romantic period, [[Edmund Burke]] postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==The 20th century and after==
The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in [[postmodernism]]'s anti-aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;The Will to Power&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher [[Guy Sircello]] proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept.&lt;ref&gt;A New Theory of Beauty. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Love and Beauty.

Beauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of [[experimental aesthetics]] and [[neuroesthetics]] respectively.

==Human beauty==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of ''inner beauty'', which includes psychological factors such as [[Personality type|personality]], [[intelligence]], [[wiktionary:grace|grace]], [[politeness]], [[charisma]], [[integrity]], [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] and [[elegance]], and ''outer beauty'' (i.e. [[physical attractiveness]]) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.

Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.

A strong indicator of physical beauty is "[[averageness]]".&lt;ref name="Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990"&gt;Langlois, J.H., Roggman, L. (1990). "Attractive faces are only average." ''Psychol. Sci.''

This was first noticed in 1883, when [[Francis Galton]] overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.&lt;ref name="Galton, 1878"&gt;Galton, F. (1878).

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a [[waist–hip ratio]] of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with [[Female body shape|hourglass figures]] are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3682657.stm|title=Hourglass figure fertility link|last=|first=|date=4 May 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4953-barbie-shaped-women-more-fertile/|title=Barbie-shaped women more fertile|last=Bhattacharya|first=Shaoni|date=5 May 2004|website=New Scientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal.

Beauty standards are rooted in cultural norms crafted by societies and media over centuries. Globally, it is argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] concept of beauty, breeding cultures that assign inferiority to women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper|first=Kathryn|last2=Choma|first2=Becky L.|date=2018-10-05|title=Internalised White Ideal, Skin Tone Surveillance, and Hair Surveillance Predict Skin and Hair Dissatisfaction and Skin Bleaching among African American and Indian Women|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|journal=Sex Roles|doi=10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, societies and cultures across the globe struggle to diminish the longstanding [[internalized racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weedon|first=Chris|date=December 6, 2007|title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective|url=|journal=Gender Forum Electronic Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[black is beautiful]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;cultural movement sought to dispel this notion in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DoCarmo|first=|date=December 20, 2007|title=Dr. DoCarmo's Notes on the Black Cultural Movement|url=|journal=|publisher=Bucks County Community College|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of beauty in men is known as '[[bishōnen]]' in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly [[Femininity|feminine]] features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Japanese idol|idols]]. A multibillion-dollar industry of [[Japanese Aesthetic Salons]] exists for this reason. However, different nations have varying male beauty ideals; Eurocentric standards for men include tallness, leanness, and muscularity; thus, these features are idolized through American media, such as in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films and magazine covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.doctornerdlove.com/new-impossible-standards-male-beauty/|title=The New (And Impossible) Standards of Male Beauty|last=|first=|date=2015-01-26|work=Paging Dr. NerdLove|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eurocentrism and beauty ===
The prevailing eurocentric concept of beauty has varying effects on different cultures. Primarily, adherence to this standard among African American women has bred a lack of positive reification of African beauty, and philosopher [[Cornel West]] elaborates that, "much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black Americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses, hips, lips, and hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Matters|last=West|first=Cornel|publisher=Vintage|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These insecurities can be traced back to global idealization of women with light skin, green or blue eyes, and long straight or wavy hair in magazines and media that starkly contrast with the natural features of African women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/socabs/docview/233235409/334D89ECD5AB4AF8PQ/1?accountid=11243|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, internalized [[colorism]] is rooted in Indian culture, in which prevailing value placed on fairer skin tones fuels the [[skin whitening]] industry; products like [[Fair &amp; Lovely (cosmetics)|Fair &amp; Lovely]] thrive in India, with endorsement from [[Bollywood]] celebrities, as well as a general idealization of fair women throughout the film, media, and advertising industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shevde|first=Natasha|date=|title=All's Fair in Love and Cream: A Cultural Case Study of Fair &amp; Lovely in India|url=http://www.michelepolak.com/200fall11/Weekly_Schedule_files/Sheyde.pdf|journal=Advertising &amp; Society Review|volume=9|pages=1-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, such Eurocentric beauty standards are maintained through Indian culture, and encourage women to artificially change their appearances to adhere to beauty norms and ideals. Further, a societal divide exists between the northern and southern regions of India, as fairer complexioned North Indians are culturally associated with beauty, intelligence, and wealth, based merely on adherence to Eurocentric beauty ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&amp;t=continent:Asia!Asia/country:India!India&amp;sort=YMD_date:D&amp;maxresults=20&amp;f=advanced&amp;val-base-0=colorism&amp;fld-base-0=alltext&amp;docref=news/165B3F3483519048|title=50 Shades of Colorism in India|last=Youth|first=Awaaz|date=|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals; professor and scholar Stephanie Wong's experimental study concluded that expecting that men in Asian culture didn't like women who look “fragile” impacted the lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices made by Asian American women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Stephanie N.|last2=Keum|first2=Brian TaeHyuk|last3=Caffarel|first3=Daniel|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Ranjana|last5=Morshedian|first5=Negar|last6=Capodilupo|first6=Christina M.|last7=Brewster|first7=Melanie E.|date=December 2017|title=Exploring the conceptualization of body image for Asian American women.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/aap0000077|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=296–307|doi=10.1037/aap0000077|issn=1948-1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/papers/homoegenization-of-asian-beauty/|title=The Homogenization of Asian Beauty - The Society Pages|last=Le|first=C.N|date=June 4, 2014|website=thesocietypages.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the male gaze, media portrayals of Asian women as petite and the portrayal of beautiful women in American media as fair complexioned and slim-figured induce anxiety and depressive symptoms among Asian American women who don't fit either of these beauty ideals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further, the high status associated with fairer skin can be attributed to Asian societal history; upper-class people hired workers to perform outdoor, manual labor, cultivating a visual divide overtime between lighter complexioned, wealthier families and sun tanned, darker laborers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This along with the Eurocentric beauty ideals embedded in Asian culture has made skin lightening creams, [[rhinoplasty]], and [[blepharoplasty]] (an eyelid surgery meant to give Asians a more European, "double-eyelid" appearance) commonplace among Asian women, illuminating the insecurity that results from cultural beauty standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Beauty presents a standard of [[social comparison theory|comparison]], and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the "beauty ideal" may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In ''[[Malèna]]'', a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may "woo" their husbands. The documentary ''[[Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld]]'' explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty.

The '''CarbonFix Standard''' (CFS) is an initiative supported by over 60 organisations promotes the development of [[Afforestation|climate forestation]] projects to sequester [[carbon]] from the [[atmosphere]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The CarbonFix Standard is administered by CarbonFix, a non-profit association based in Germany.

The CarbonFix Standard has been favourably assessed in 2008, by the University of Canterbury, New Zealand and in 2009 by the Imperial College of London.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} CarbonPositive (2009) placed the CarbonFix Standard between the [[Voluntary Carbon Standard]] and the [[Climate, Community &amp; Biodiversity Alliance|CCB Standard]], "aiming for a best of both worlds approach".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==History==
The association CarbonFix was founded in 1999. In 2007, the association developed the first version of the CarbonFix Standard, which was presented at the [[World Climate Conference]] in [[Bali]], in December 2007. Since then, the standard has been revised several times.

==Structure==
The ''Terms'' section defines the technical wording used in the CarbonFix Standard.

The ''Criteria and Methodology'' section lists the criteria a project has to meet to become certified. Tree planting activities must take place on land which contained no forest before. Only projects which require the additional financial means from the sale of {{CO2}} credits will be certified. There must be [[Sustainable forest management|Sustainable Forest Management]]. [[CO2 fixation|{{CO2}}-Fixation]] is verified using  methodology based on the rules of the United Nations Climate Secretariat.

The ''Procedures'' of the CarbonFix Standard describes how to prepare project information and request [[certification]], how to sell  {{CO2}}-certificates, what fees CarbonFix charges and how {{CO2}}-certificates are placed into a carbon registry.

A '''closed system''' is a [[physical system]] that does not allow certain types of transfers (such as [[mass transfer|transfer of mass]] and [[energy transfer]]) in or out of the system. The specification of what types of transfers are excluded varies in the closed systems of [[physics]], [[chemistry]] or [[engineering]].

==In physics==

===In classical mechanics===
In [[Theory of relativity|nonrelativistic]] [[classical mechanics]], a closed system is a [[physical system]] that doesn't exchange any matter with its surroundings, and isn't subject to any net [[force]] whose source is external to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rana|first=N.C.|author2=P.S. Joag|title=Classical Mechanics|date=1991|page=78|isbn=978-0-07-460315-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Landau|first=L.D.|authorlink=Lev Landau|author2=E.M. Lifshitz|title=Mechanics|edition=third|date=1976|page=8|isbn=978-0-7506-2896-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closed system in classical mechanics would be considered an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamics]]. Closed systems are often used to limit the factors that can affect the results of specific problem or experiment.

===In thermodynamics===
{{main article|Thermodynamic system}}
[[File:Diagram Systems.png|thumb|Properties of Isolated, closed, and open systems in exchanging energy and matter.]]
In [[thermodynamics]], a closed system can exchange energy (as [[heat]] or [[mechanical work|work]]) but not [[matter]], with its surroundings.
An [[isolated system]] cannot exchange any heat, work, or matter with the surroundings, while an [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open system]] can exchange energy and matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]], Defay, R.

Alberty|Alberty, R.A.]], Bawendi, M.G. (1955/2005). ''Physical Chemistry'', fourth edition, Wiley, Hoboken NJ, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; (This scheme of definition of terms is not uniformly used, though it is convenient for some purposes. In particular, some writers use 'closed system' where 'isolated system' is used here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985). ''Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics'', (1st edition 1960) 2nd edition 1985, Wiley, New York, {{ISBN|0-471-86256-8}}, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk ter Haar|ter Haar, D.]], [[Harald Wergeland|Wergeland, H.]] (1966). ''Elements of Thermodynamics'', Addison-Wesley Publishing, Reading MA, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;)

For a simple system, with only one type of particle (atom or molecule), a closed system amounts to a constant number of particles. However, for systems which are undergoing a [[chemical equilibrium|chemical reaction]], there may be all sorts of molecules being generated and destroyed by the reaction process. In this case, the fact that the system is closed is expressed by stating that the total number of each elemental atom is conserved, no matter what kind of molecule it may be a part of. Mathematically:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}N_j=b_i&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; is the number of j-type molecules, &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of atoms of element ''i'' in molecule ''j'' and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of atoms of element ''i'' in the system, which remains constant, since the system is closed. There will be one such equation for each different element in the system.

In thermodynamics, a closed system is important for solving complicated thermodynamic problems. It allows the elimination of some external factors that could alter the results of the experiment or problem thus simplifying it. A closed system can also be used in situations where [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] is required to simplify the situation.

===In quantum physics===
{{further|Quantum field theory}}This equation, called [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger's equation]], describes the behavior of an isolated or closed quantum system, that is, by definition, a system which does not interchange information (i.e. energy and/or matter) with another system.

==In chemistry==
In chemistry, a closed system is where no reactants or products can escape, only heat can be exchanged freely (e.g. an ice cooler). A closed system can be used when conducting chemical experiments where temperature is not a factor (i.e. reaching [[thermal equilibrium]]).

==In engineering==
In an [[engineering]] context, a closed system is a bound system, i.e. defined, in which every input is known and every resultant is known (or can be known) within a specific time.

[[File:4-Stroke-Engine.gif|thumb|A four-stroke engine showing the stroke of the piston.]]
The static '''compression ratio''' of an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[external combustion engine]] is a value that represents the [[ratio]] of the volume of its [[combustion chamber]] from its largest capacity to its smallest capacity. It is a fundamental specification for many common combustion engines.

In a piston engine, it is the ratio between the volume of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] and combustion chamber when the [[piston]] is at the [[bottom dead center|bottom of its stroke]], and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the [[top dead center|top of its stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Encyclopædia Britannica
  | title = Compression ratio
  | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130313/compression-ratio
  | accessdate =2009-07-21 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a cylinder and its combustion chamber with the piston at the bottom of its stroke may contain 1000&amp;nbsp;cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). When the piston has moved up to the top of its stroke inside the cylinder, and the remaining volume inside the head or combustion chamber has been reduced to 100&amp;nbsp;cc, then the compression ratio would be proportionally described as 1000:100, or with fractional reduction, a 10:1 compression ratio.

A high compression ratio is desirable because it allows an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of [[air-fuel mixture]] due to its higher [[thermal efficiency]]. This occurs because internal combustion engines are [[heat engine]]s, and higher efficiency is created because higher compression ratios permit the same combustion temperature to be reached with less fuel, while giving a longer expansion cycle, creating more mechanical power output and lowering the exhaust temperature.  It may be more helpful to think of it as an "expansion ratio", since more expansion reduces the temperature of the exhaust gases, and therefore the energy wasted to the atmosphere.  Diesel engines actually have a higher peak combustion temperature than petrol engines, but the greater expansion means they reject less heat in their cooler exhaust.

Higher compression ratios will however make gasoline engines subject to [[engine knocking]] (also known as detonation) if lower octane-rated fuel is used. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if knock sensors are not present to modify the ignition timing.

On the other hand, [[Diesel engines]] operate on the principle of compression ignition, so that a fuel which resists [[autoignition]] will cause late ignition, which will also lead to engine knock.

==Formula==
Static compression ratio (&lt;math&gt;CR&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;{CR} = \frac { V_d + V_c } {V_c}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:
:&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt; = displacement volume. This is the volume inside the cylinder displaced by the piston from the beginning of the compression stroke to the end of the stroke.
:&lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; = clearance volume. This is the volume of the space in the cylinder left at the end of the compression stroke.

&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated by the [[Cylinder#Volume|cylinder volume]] formula

:&lt;math&gt;V_d = \tfrac{\pi} {4} b^2 s&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; = [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[Bore (engine)|bore]] (diameter)
:&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = [[piston]] [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] length

Because of the complex shape of &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; it is usually measured directly. This is often done by filling the cylinder with liquid and then measuring the volume of the used liquid.

==Typical compression ratios==

===Gasoline (petrol) engine===
The compression ratio in a [[gasoline]] (petrol)-powered engine will usually not be much higher than 10:1 due to potential [[engine knocking]] (detonation) and not lower than 6:1. Some production automotive engines built for high performance from 1955–1972, used [[Octane rating|high-octane]] [[Tetraethyllead|leaded gasoline]] or '5 star' to allow compression ratios as high as 13.0:1.

A technique used to prevent the onset of knock is the high "swirl" engine that forces the intake charge to adopt a fast circular rotation in the cylinder during compression that provides quicker and more complete combustion. It is possible to manufacture gasoline engines with compression ratios of over 11:1 that can use 87 (MON + RON)/2 ([[octane rating]]) fuel with the addition of variable valve timing and knock sensors to delay ignition timing. Such engines may not produce their full rated power using 87 octane gasoline under all circumstances, due to the delayed ignition timing. [[Fuel Injection#Direct injection|Direct fuel injection]], which can inject fuel only at the time of fuel ignition (similar to a diesel engine), is another recent development which also allows for higher compression ratios on gasoline engines.

The compression ratio can be as high as 14:1 (2014 [[Ferrari 458 Speciale]]) in engines with a [[Engine knocking|'ping' or 'knock']] [[sensor]] and an [[electronic control unit]]. In 1981, Jaguar released a cylinder head that allowed up to 14:1 compression; but settled for 12.5:1 in production cars. The cylinder head design was known as the "May Fireball" head; it was developed by a Swiss engineer [[Michael May (racing driver)|Michael May]].

In 2012, [[Mazda]] released new petrol engines under the brand name [[SkyActiv]] with a 14:1 compression ratio (U.S. models have a 13:1 compression ratio to allow for 87 AKI octane), to be used in all Mazda vehicles by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=gSiteLife.Recommend("ExternalResource","110429942"); Tweet |url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110422/NEWYORK/110429942 |title=2012 Mazda 3 gets 40-mpg SkyActiv engine option; diesel expected in 2014 |publisher=Autoweek |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20015698-48.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312043501/http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20015698-48.html|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 2010 |first=DAVE |last=VANDERWERP |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/mazda-engine-news-mazda-sky-gas-and-diesel-details-car-and-driver |title=Mazda Engine News: Mazda Sky Gas and Diesel Details |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrol/gasoline engine with pressure-charging===
In a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] or [[Supercharger|supercharged]] gasoline engine, the CR is customarily built at 10.5:1 or lower. This is due to the turbocharger/supercharger already having compressed the air before it enters the cylinders. Port fuel injected engines typically run lower boost than direct fuel injected engines because port [[fuel injection]] allows the air/fuel mixture to be heated together which leads to detonation. Conversely, directly injected engines can run higher boost because heated air will not detonate without a fuel being present. In this instance fuel is injected as late as 60 degrees before [[top dead center]] to avoid heating the mixture to the point of compression ignition.

===Petrol/gasoline engine for racing===
Motorcycle racing engines can use compression ratios as high as 14.7:1, and it is common to find motorcycles with compression ratios above 12.0:1 designed for 86 or 87 octane fuel. F1 engines come closer to 17:1, which is critical for maximizing volumetric/fuel efficiency at around 18,000 RPM.{{citation needed|reason=no source found for quoted compression ratio|date=February 2016}}

===Ethanol and methanol engines===

Ethanol and methanol can take significantly higher compression ratios than gasoline. Racing engines burning [[methanol]] and [[ethanol fuel]] often incorporate a CR of 14.5-16:1.

===Gas-fueled engine===
The CR may be higher in engines running exclusively on [[Autogas|LPG]] or [[compressed natural gas|CNG]], due to the higher octane rating of these fuels.

===Diesel engine===
There is no spark plug in an auto-ignition [[diesel engine]]; the [[heat of compression]] raises the temperature of the air in the cylinder sufficiently to ignite the diesel when this is injected into the cylinder; after the compression stroke. The CR will customarily exceed 14:1 and ratios over 22:1 are common. The appropriate compression ratio depends on the design of the cylinder head. The figure is usually between 14:1 and 23:1 for direct injection engines, and between 18:1 and 23:1 for [[indirect injection]].And also in crdi injection.

===Kerosene engine===
A compression ratio of 6.5 or lower is desired for operation on [[kerosene]]. The [[petrol-paraffin engine]] version of the [[Ferguson TE20]] tractor had a compression ratio of 4.5:1 for operation on [[tractor vaporising oil]] with an [[octane rating]] between 55 and 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tractorbits.com/infofiles/TVO.asp |title=Tractor Vaporising Oil |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-04-18 |accessdate=2014-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012012756/http://tractorbits.com/infofiles/TVO.asp |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fault finding and diagnosis==
Measuring the compression [[pressure]] of an engine, with a [[pressure gauge]] connected to the [[spark plug]] opening, gives an indication of the engine's state and quality. There is, however, no formula to calculate compression ratio based on cylinder pressure.

If the nominal compression ratio of an engine is given, the pre-ignition cylinder pressure can be estimated using the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;p = p_0 \times \text{CR}^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_0\;&lt;/math&gt; is the cylinder pressure at bottom dead center which is usually at 1 atm, &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}&lt;/math&gt; is the compression ratio, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\;&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat ratio]] for the working fluid, which is about 1.4 for air, and 1.3 for methane-air mixture.

For example, if an engine running on gasoline has a compression ratio of 10:1, the cylinder pressure at top dead center is

:&lt;math&gt; p_\text{TDC} = 1 \text{ bar} \times 10^{1.4} = 25.1 \text{ bar}&lt;/math&gt;

This figure, however, will also depend on cam (i.e. valve) timing. Generally, cylinder pressure for common automotive designs should at least equal 10 [[bar (unit)|bar]], or, roughly estimated in [[pounds per square inch]] (psi) as between 15 and 20 times the compression ratio, or in this case between 150 psi and 200 psi, depending on cam timing. Purpose-built racing engines, stationary engines etc. will return figures outside this range.

Factors including late intake valve closure (relatively speaking for camshaft profiles outside of typical production-car range, but not necessarily into the realm of competition engines) can produce a misleadingly low figure from this test. Excessive [[connecting rod]] clearance, combined with extremely high [[oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]] output (rare but not impossible) can sling enough oil to coat the cylinder walls with sufficient oil to facilitate reasonable [[piston ring]] sealing.  In engines with compromised ring seals, this can artificially give a misleadingly high compression figure.

This phenomenon can actually be used to some slight advantage. If a compression test does give a low figure, and it has been determined it is not due to intake valve closure/camshaft characteristics, then one can differentiate between the cause being valve/seat seal issues and ring seal by squirting engine oil into the spark plug orifice, in a quantity sufficient to disperse across the piston crown and the circumference of the top ring land, and thereby affect the mentioned seal. If a second compression test is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the ring seal that is problematic, whereas if the compression test pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or, rarer still, cylinder-wall damage) issue.

If there is a significant (greater than 10%) difference between cylinders, that may be an indication that [[poppet valve|valves]] or [[cylinder head]] [[gasket]]s are leaking, [[piston]] rings are worn, or that the [[cylinder block|block]] is cracked.

If a problem is suspected, then a more comprehensive test using a [[leak-down tester]] can locate the leak.

==Variable Compression Ratio (VCR) engines==
Because cylinder-bore diameter, piston-stroke length and combustion-chamber volume are almost always constant, the compression ratio for a given engine is almost always constant, until engine wear takes its toll.

One exception is the [[experiment]]al [[Saab Variable Compression engine]] (SVC). This engine, designed by [[Saab Automobile]], uses a technique that dynamically alters the volume of the combustion chamber (V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), which, via the above equation, changes the compression ratio (CR).

The [[Atkinson cycle]] engine was one of the first attempts at [[Variable compression ratio|variable compression]].  Since the compression ratio is the ratio between dynamic and static volumes of the combustion chamber, the Atkinson cycle's method of increasing the length of the power stroke compared to the intake stroke ultimately altered the compression ratio at different stages of the cycle.

On August 15, 2016 Nissan Motor Company announced a new variable compression engine that can choose an optimal compression ratio variably between 8:1 and 14:1. That lets the engine adjust moment by moment to torque demands, always maintaining top efficiency. Nissan says that the turbo-charged, 2-liter, four-cylinder VC-T engine averages 27 percent better fuel economy than the 3.5-liter V6 engine it replaces, with comparable power and torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/infiniti-vc-t-variable-compression-ratio-engine/44893/|title=Turbo power meets extreme efficiency: Infiniti unveils world's first production engine with variable compression ratios|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012075110/https://newatlas.com/infiniti-vc-t-variable-compression-ratio-engine/44893/|archive-date=2017-10-12|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamic compression ratio==
The calculated compression ratio, as given above, presumes that the cylinder is sealed at the bottom of the stroke, and that the volume compressed is the actual volume.

However: intake valve closure (sealing the cylinder) always takes place after BDC, which may cause some of the intake charge to be compressed backwards out of the cylinder by the rising piston at very low speeds; only the percentage of the stroke after intake valve closure is compressed. Intake port tuning and scavenging may allow a greater mass of charge (at a higher than atmospheric pressure) to be trapped in the cylinder than the static volume would suggest ( This "corrected" compression ratio is commonly called the "''dynamic compression ratio''".

This ratio is higher with more conservative (i.e., earlier, soon after BDC) intake cam timing, and lower with more radical (i.e., later, long after BDC) intake cam timing, but always lower than the static or "nominal" compression ratio.

The actual position of the piston can be determined by trigonometry, using the stroke length and the [[connecting rod]] length (measured between centers). The absolute cylinder pressure is the result of an exponent of the dynamic compression ratio. This exponent is a polytropic value for the ratio of variable heats for air and similar gases at the temperatures present. This compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression, as well as heat lost to the cylinder. Under ideal (adiabatic) conditions, the exponent would be 1.4, but a lower value, generally between 1.2 and 1.3 is used, since the amount of heat lost will vary among engines based on design, size and materials used, but provides useful results for purposes of comparison. For example, if the static compression ratio is 10:1, and the dynamic compression ratio is 7.5:1, a useful value for cylinder pressure would be (7.5)^1.3 × atmospheric pressure, or 13.7 [[bar (unit)|bar]]. (× 14.7 psi at sea level = 201.8 psi. The pressure shown on a gauge would be the absolute pressure less atmospheric pressure, or 187.1 psi.)

The two corrections for dynamic compression ratio affect cylinder pressure in opposite directions, but not in equal strength. An engine with high static compression ratio and late intake valve closure will have a DCR similar to an engine with lower compression but earlier intake valve closure.

Additionally, the cylinder pressure developed when an engine is running will be higher than that shown in a compression test for several reasons.

*The much higher velocity of a piston when an engine is running versus cranking allows less time for pressure to bleed past the piston rings into the crankcase.
*a running engine is coating the cylinder walls with much more oil than an engine that is being cranked at low RPM, which helps the seal.
*the higher temperature of the cylinder will create higher pressures when running vs. a static test, even a test performed with the engine near [[operating temperature]].
* A running engine does not stop taking air &amp; fuel into the cylinder when the piston reaches BDC; The mixture that is rushing into the cylinder during the downstroke develops momentum and continues briefly after the vacuum ceases (in the same respect that rapidly opening a door will create a draft that continues after movement of the door ceases).  This is called scavenging.  Intake tuning, cylinder head design, valve timing and exhaust tuning determine how effectively an engine scavenges.

==Compression ratio versus overall pressure ratio==
[[File:Compression ratio versus pressure ratio.png|thumb|Compression ratio versus pressure ratio]]

Compression ratio and [[overall pressure ratio]] are interrelated as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Compression ratio
|| 2:1  || 3:1 || 5:1 || 10:1 || 15:1 || 20:1 || 25:1 || 35:1
|-
! Pressure ratio
|| 2.64:1 || 4.66:1 ||9.52:1 || 25.12:1 || 44.31:1 || 66.29:1 || 90.60:1 || 145:1
|}

The reason for this difference is that compression ratio is defined via the volume reduction:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;,
while pressure ratio is defined as the [[pressure]] increase:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{PR}=\frac{P_2}{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
In calculating the pressure ratio, we assume that an [[adiabatic compression]] is carried out (i.e. that no heat energy is supplied to the gas being compressed, and that any temperature rise is solely due to the compression). We also assume that air is a perfect gas. With these two assumptions, we can define the relationship between change of volume and change of pressure as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma \Rightarrow
\frac{P_2}{P_1}= \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ratio of specific heats]] (air: approximately 1.4).
The values in the table above are derived using this formula. Note that in reality the ratio of specific heats changes with temperature and that significant deviations from adiabatic behavior will occur.

{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2014}}

Popularized by the American sociologist [[Barry Glassner]], '''culture of fear''' (or '''climate of fear''') is the concept that people may incite [[fear]] in the general public to achieve political or workplace goals through [[emotional bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaehn|first=Jeffery|title=Filtering the news: essays on Herman and [[Chomsky]]'s propaganda model|year=2005|publisher=[[Black Rose Books]]|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A largely unrelated concept in sociology is the "fear culture" on the [[Guilt-Shame-Fear spectrum of cultures]].

==In the workplace==
{{Main article|Organizational culture|Toxic workplace|Workplace bullying}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]]: leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations'', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Partial or intermittent [[negative reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies are tolerated, a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other.  An [[Authoritarian leadership style|authoritarian style of leadership]] may create a climate of fear, with little or no room for dialogue and with complaining being considered futile.&lt;ref&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying"  in 
Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of [[public-sector union]] members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place.  Rayner explained the figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had been tolerated previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

Individual differences in sensitivity to [[Reward system|reward]], [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] and [[motivation]] have been studied under the premises of [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] and have also been [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory#Workplace performance|applied to workplace performance]].

A culture of fear at the workplace runs contrary to the "key principles" established by [[W. Edwards Deming]] for managers to transform business effectiveness.  One of his [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|fourteen principles]] is to drive out fear in order to allow everyone to work effectively for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points|title=The W. Edwards Deming Institute|last=Acquate|website=deming.org|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
{{main article|Fear mongering|fascism}}
Nazi leader [[Hermann Göring]] explains how people can be made fearful and to support a war they otherwise would oppose:

{{quote|The people don't want [[war]], but they can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  This is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and [[denunciation|denounce]] the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger.  It works the same in every country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave Gilbert]] (1947) ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her book "State and Opposition in Military Brazil," Maria Helena Moreira Alves found a "culture of fear" was implemented as part of [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|political repression since 1964]].  She used the term to describe methods implemented by the [[national security]] apparatus of Brazil in its effort to equate political participation with risk of [[arrest]] and [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alves|first1=Maria|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|date=1985|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Brazil|page=352|accessdate=14 June 2015|ref=Alves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassação (English: cassation) is one such mechanism used to punish members of the military by legally declaring them dead.  This enhanced the potential for political control through intensifying the culture of fear as a deterrent to opposition.&lt;ref name=Alves1&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alves found the changes of the [[National Security Law (Brazil)|National Security Law]] of 1969, as beginning the use of "[[economic exploitation]], physical [[political repression|repression]], political control, and strict [[censorship]]" to establish a "culture of fear" in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Alves2&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three psychological components of the culture of fear included silence through censorship, sense of isolation, and a "generalized belief that all channels of opposition were closed."  A "feeling of complete [[hopelessness]]," prevailed, in addition to  "withdrawal from opposition activity."&lt;ref name=Alves3&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former US National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] argues that the use of the term [[War on Terror]] was intended to generate a culture of fear deliberately because it "obscures reason, intensifies emotions and makes it easier for [[demagogic]] politicians to mobilize the public on behalf of the policies they want to pursue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/23/AR2007032301613.html |title=Terrorized by 'War on Terror' by Brzezinski |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= March 25, 2007|accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsDecC12&gt;{{cite news

[[Frank Furedi]], a former professor of Sociology and writer for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'' magazine, says that today's culture of fear did not begin with the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].  Long before September 11, he argues, public [[panic]]s were widespread – on everything from [[GM crops]] to mobile phones, from [[global warming]] to [[foot-and-mouth disease]].  Like Durodié, Furedi argues that perceptions of risk, ideas about safety and controversies over health, the environment and technology have little to do with science or [[empirical evidence]].  Rather, they are shaped by cultural assumptions about human [[vulnerability]].  Furedi say that "we need a grown-up discussion about our post-September 11 world, based on a reasoned evaluation of all the available evidence rather than on [[irrational]] fears for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank Furedi |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D46C.htm |title=Epidemic of fear |publisher=Spiked-online.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British academics Gabe Mythen and Sandra Walklate argue that following terrorist attacks in New York, the Pentagon, Madrid, and London, government agencies developed a discourse of "new terrorism" in a cultural climate of [[fear, uncertainty and doubt|fear and uncertainty]].  UK researchers argued that these processes reduced notions of [[public safety]] and created the [[simplistic]] image of a non-white "terroristic other" that has negative consequences for ethnic minority groups in the UK.&lt;ref name="Gabe Mythen1 and Sandra Walklate"&gt;[http://cmc.sagepub.com/content/2/2/123.abstract#aff-1 Communicating the terrorist risk: Harnessing a culture of fear?] Gabe Mythen [[Manchester Metropolitan University]], UK, Sandra Walklate [[University of Liverpool]], UK&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 BBC documentary film series, ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', subtitled ''The Rise of the Politics of Fear'', the journalist [[Adam Curtis]] argues that politicians have used our fears to increase their power and control over society.  Though he does not use the term "culture of fear," what Curtis describes in his film is a reflection of this concept.  He looks at the American [[neo-conservative]] movement and its depiction of the [[threat]] first from the [[Soviet Union]] and then from radical [[Islamist]]s.&lt;ref name="bbcpower"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Power of Nightmares: Your comments |newspaper=[[BBC]] |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/4016713.stm |date=August 3, 2005 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis insists there has been a largely illusory fear of terrorism in the west since the [[September 11 attacks]] and that politicians such as [[George W Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] had stumbled on a new force to restore their power and authority; using the fear of an organised "web of evil" from which they could protect their people.&lt;ref name="guardcanned"&gt;{{cite news |title=The film US TV networks dare not show |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/may/12/cannes2005.cannesfilmfestival4 |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Curtis's film castigated the media, security forces and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] for expanding their power in this way.&lt;ref name="guardcanned"/&gt; The film features [[Bill Durodié]], then Director of the International Centre for Security Analysis, and Senior [[Research Fellow]] in the International Policy Institute, [[King's College London]], saying that to call this network an "invention" would be too strong a term, but he asserts that it probably does not exist and is largely a "([[psychological projection|projection]]) of our own worst fears, and that what we see is a fantasy that's been created."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares3.html|title=Exploring The Best Pro hormone Stacks|website=www.daanspeak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the media  ==
The consumption of mass media has had a profound effect on instilling the fear of terrorism in the United States, though acts of terror are a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nellis|first=Ashley Marie|last2=Savage|first2=Joanne|date=2012-09-10|title=Does Watching the News Affect Fear of Terrorism?

According to Gerbner, television and other forms of mass media create a worldview that is reflective of “recurrent media messages”, rather than one that is based on reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callanan|first=Valerie J.|date=2012-03-01|title=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93|journal=Sociological Perspectives|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=93–115|doi=10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Americans are exposed to some form of media on a daily basis, with television and social media platforms being the most used methods to receive both local and international news, and as such this is how most receive news and details that center around violent crime and acts of terror.  With the rise in use of smartphones and social media, people are bombarded with constant news updates, and able to read stories related to terrorism, stories that come from all corners of the globe.  Media fuels fear of terrorism and other threats to national security, all of which have negative psychological effects on the population, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Politicians conduct interviews, televised or otherwise, and utilize their social media platforms immediately after violent crimes and terrorist acts, to further cement the fear of terrorism into the minds of their constituents.

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Dahara-vidya''' or 'the knowledge of Brahman within', is mentioned in the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] and the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]]. In this [[Upasana]] the sadhaka concentrates on [[Brahman]] (the Universal Self) in the cave of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramana Hridayam|url= http://ramanahridayam.blogspot.in/2013/08/brahman-in-heart-dahaya-vidya-of.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the thirty-two ''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidyas]]'' of the [[Upanishads]] taught in [[Vedanta]], in which vidya Brahman is perceived as the imperceptible ether within the heart. This ''vidya'' occurs in the 8th Chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brahma Vidyas of the world|url= http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1053074-the-32-brahma-vidyas-of-the-upanishad/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where it is taught that the abode of Brahman is the small lotus that is here in this city of Brahman, what is there in the small space within the lotus is to be searched out. This ''vidya'' explains the identity of the external and the internal, the objective and the subjective, the macrocosmic and the microcosmic, the universal and the individual, [[Brahman]] and the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vidyas from the Upanishads Item 5|author=Swami Sivananda|publisher=The Divine Life Society|url= http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

In the ''Dahara-vidya'', Brahman is to be conceived as dwelling in the cavity of the heart, and yet as big as the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mystical Philosophies of the Upanishads|author=S.C.Sen|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnhNZQJ07DYC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=Dahara+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jqDYU7LhI8-2uATJ4YCwCQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Dahara%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dahara-vidya'' has for its object the realization of the Atman in the little space (''dahara'' दहरा) the subtle inner sky within oneself in the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystic approach to the Vedas and the Upanishads|author=M.P.Pandit|publisher=Lotus Press|page=114|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8oAI40hi4-oC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Dahara+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jqDYU7LhI8-2uATJ4YCwCQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Dahara%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a classical meditative practice mentioned in the [[Vedas]]. In this ''vidya'' the desires are the auspicious qualities of Brahman which are the objects of desire; the man who knows Brahman obtains, together with Brahman, all qualities of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedanta-Sutras Part-1|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=82|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=itDs5vRKao0C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Dahara+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eKTYU-O5F5aKuASaiILIDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Dahara%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposition== 

''Dahara-vidya'' is described in six brief passages in the Chandogya Upanishad. [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] explains that for persons who have realized the unity of the Self, there is absence of the idea of 'traveler', 'travel' and 'destination', and on the cessation of the causes for continuance of the traces of ignorance etc. they merge in their own self; Brahman who is devoid of direction, location, qualities, movement, and differences of results, appears to people of dull intellect as non-existing, ''Dahara-vidya'' is taught to make them come to the right path. Therefore, the sage of Chandogya Upanishad insists that he (Brahman) who resides in the small space existing within the small lotus-like dwelling that is within the city of Brahman has to be enquired into (with the help of a teacher and other valid means). The space referred to within the heart is as vast as the space outside, within it are included both heaven and earth; whatever one has and whatever one does not have, all that is included in that space as also all beings and all desires. For those who have not realized Brahman the results acquired through actions get exhausted in this world and those acquired through virtues in the next. For those who have realized the Self there is freedom of movement in all the worlds. Then, whatever province he becomes attracted to, whatever objects he desires, that appears by his very desire, and being associated with that he becomes glorified. The sage tells us –

:स वा एष आत्मा हृदि तस्यैतदेव निरुक्तं हृदयमिति तस्मादह्रिदयमहरहर्वा एवंवित्स्वर्गं लोकमेति |

:"This self which is such surely exists in the heart. Of that this is verily the deprivation: It is in the heart; therefore that is called the heart. A man of such knowledge daily reaches the heavenly world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogya Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=571 to 584|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami%20Gambhirananda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David J. Bartholomae''' is an [[United States|American]] scholar in [[composition studies]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Rutgers University]] in 1975 and is currently a Professor of English and former Chair of the English Department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. His primary research interests are in [[composition studies|composition]], [[literacy]], and [[pedagogy]], and his work engages scholarship in [[rhetoric]] and in [[American literature]]/[[American Studies]]. His articles and essays have appeared in publications such as ''PMLA'', ''Critical Quarterly'', and ''College Composition and Communication''.

He is also the co-editor, with Jean Ferguson Carr, of the [[University of Pittsburgh Press]] Series in Composition, Literacy, and Culture, a leading list of monographs in the field. Bartholomae has served on the Executive Council of the [[Modern Language Association]] and as president of the [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] and president of the Association of Departments of English. In 1985, Bartholomae was the Chair of [[Conference on College Composition and Communication|CCCC]], where he gave his [[CCCC Chair's Address]] “Freshman English, Composition, and CCCC.”

==Inventing the University==

One of Bartholomae’s most renowned claims, that the acquisition of academic [[discourse]] should be a primary ingredient of any first-year writing course, is argued in his widely recognized essay, “Inventing the University.” Throughout his essay, known as perhaps one of the most cited and influential in the field of [[composition studies|composition]], Bartholomae (1986) suggests that when college students write, they learn to communicate with academic communities by assembling and mimicking the language found within the scholarly world; that is, students must discover the idiosyncratic ways of knowing, selecting, evaluating, reporting, concluding, and arguing that define the discourse of the post-secondary community (p.&amp;nbsp;403).

Bartholomae (1986), however, admits to the difficulty of such a task; in fact, he states it is difficult for basic writers “to take on the role – the voice, the person – of an authority whose authority is rooted in scholarship, analysis, or research” (p.&amp;nbsp;405). The solution to this problem, Bartholomae (1986) suggests, is for writers to “build bridges” (p.&amp;nbsp;407) between themselves and their target audience. In order to successfully manipulate readers, writers must be able to find common ground with their audience before moving to more controversial arguments; moreover, to better accommodate their audience, advanced writers not only find common ground with their readers, but also understand their position and knowledge.

==The Study of Error==

Throughout "The Study of Error," Bartholomae (1980) expounds upon the idea that basic writers must be able to “transcribe and manipulate the code of written discourse” in order to develop expert abilities (p.&amp;nbsp;268). Bartholomae (1980) begins his argument by citing [[Mina Shaughnessy]]’s claim that if teachers of [[composition (language)|composition]] are to help students develop their writing skills, they must first understand why basic writers make certain mistakes (p. 254). He asserts that the mistakes of basic writers are intentional, catalyzed by a deficient understanding of, and inability to properly identify, how academic language sounds (Bartholomae, 1980, p. 263). Therefore, similar to his claims set forth in “Inventing the University,” Bartholomae again suggests that instead of attempting to fix errors via drills and practice sentences, basic writers must learn to understand the code of written [[discourse]], and mimic the voice of the language found within the academic community.

==Debate with Peter Elbow==

Some of Bartholomae’s claims have created controversy among colleagues. Most notably, Bartholomae engaged [[Peter Elbow]] in a long public debate regarding the role of the university-level student writer. Specifically, at the 1989 and 1991 meetings of the [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]], Bartholomae and Elbow initiated a prominent discussion regarding personal and academic writing, one which spilled over into the pages of academic journals and was taken up by additional scholars in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Various|title=Responses to Bartholomae and Elbow.|journal=College Composition and Communication|date=1995|volume=46|issue=1|pages=84–92|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both Bartholomae and Elbow agree that training for academic writing should be an integral component of any student’s undergraduate journey, they disagree with exactly how the training should be implemented.

As a trailblazing social constructionist, Bartholomae’s scholarship hinges upon the notion of [[discourse communities]] and makes suggestions on how students should enter the academic [[discourse]] community; contrary to Elbow, he claims that teachers play a vital role in student development, as they construct assignments that allow pupils to mimic the voice(s) within academic [[discourse]]. While Bartholomae asserts that writers must first prove their worth by mimicking the language used throughout discourse communities and argues more power should be given to teachers, Elbow claims just the opposite. As evidenced in ''Writing Without Teachers'', Elbow’s scholarship suggests that writing belongs to the writer from the beginning, arguing that students learn by writing without teachers – citing diaries, letters, personal narratives, and poems as examples of his theory (p.&amp;nbsp;145).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elbow|first1=Peter|title=Writing Without Teachers|date=1998|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the two scholars have concluded their debate by essentially agreeing to disagree. In fact, in “Being a Writer vs. Being an Academic: A Conflict in Goals,” an essay published in a 1995 issue of the journal ''College Composition and Communication'', Elbow writes: “this is what we academics do: carry on an unending conversation not just with colleagues but with the dead and unborn” (p.&amp;nbsp;79).

In [[mathematical modeling]], '''deterministic simulations''' contain no [[random variable]]s and no degree of [[randomness]], and consist mostly of equations, for example [[difference equation]]s.  These [[simulation]]s have known inputs and they result in a unique set of outputs. Contrast [[Stochastic simulation|stochastic (probability) simulation]], which includes random variables. 

Deterministic simulation models are usually designed to capture some underlying [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] or natural process. They are different from [[statistical model]]s (for example linear regression) whose aim is to [[empirical]]ly estimate the relationships between [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. The deterministic model is viewed as a useful approximation of reality that is easier to build and interpret than a stochastic model. However, such models can be extremely complicated with large numbers of inputs and outputs, and therefore are often noninvertible; a fixed single set of outputs can be generated by multiple sets of inputs. Thus taking reliable account of parameter and model uncertainty is crucial, perhaps even more so than for standard statistical models, yet this is an area that has received little attention from statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=David|author2=Adrian E. Raftery|title=Inference for Deterministic Simulation Models: The Bayesian Melding Approach|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=December 2000|volume=95|issue=452|pages=1244–1255|doi=10.1080/01621459.2000.10474324|citeseerx=10.1.1.142.8834}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 January 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of simulations==

Mostly are deterministic simulations used in scientific researches, we can found in various studies about populations fields, climate development, pollution, but also in another areas as engineering, chemistry and policy making. Deterministic simulations have received attention in the statistical literature under the general topic of computer experiments. Computer experiments simulate complex system which requires a number of inputs. Use of stochastic system is much cheaper but also inaccurate and simplifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=B.|authorlink=B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson |year=1978 |title=Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by deterministic simulation  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model translation===

It is necessary to translate model into computer recognizable format. Modeler must decide if whether to program the model in a simulation language such as [[GPSS/H]] or to use special purpose simulation software:

'''Arene''' – discrete event simulator has also academic version

'''CSIM''' – CSIM is a re-usable general purpose discrete-event simulation environment for modeling complex systems of interacting elements. It contains hierarchical block diagram tools and extensive model libraries covering several domains. CSIM can be used for modeling: agent-based systems, logistics, wireless networks, computer networks...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to ATL's CSIM Modeling Environment|url=http://www.atl.external.lmco.com/projects/csim/overview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''Dynare''' – when the framework is deterministic, can be used for models with the assumption of perfect foresight. The purpose of the simulation is to describe the reaction in anticipation of, then in reaction to the shock, until the system returns to the old or to a new state of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dynare reference manual|url=http://www.dynare.org/manual/index_22.html|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Janus''' – Janus is an interactive simulation war game portraying realistic events during multi-sided combat. It uses digitized terrain effecting line of sight and movement, depicting contour lines, roads, rivers, vegetation and urban areas. It has the capability to be networked with other systems, in order to simulate a war game with multiple sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Use of the Janus Wargame Simulation to Investigate Naturalistic Decision-Making: A Preliminary Examination|author=Taryn Chapman |author2=Vanessa Mills |author3=Monique Kardos |author4=Christina Stothard |author5=Douglas Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Modsaf''' (Modular Semi-Automated Forces) is a set of software modules and applications used to construct Advanced Distributed Simulation (ADS) and Computer Generated Forces (CGF) applications. ModSAF modules and applications let a single operator create and control large numbers of entities that are used for realistic training, test, and evaluation on the virtual battlefield. ModSAF contains entities that are sufficiently realistic resulting in the user not being aware that the displayed vehicles are being maneuvered by computers, rather than human crews. These entities, which include ground and air vehicles, dismounted infantry (DI), missiles, and dynamic structures, can interact with each other and with manned individual entity simulators to support training, combat development experiments, and test of evaluation studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ModSAF (Modular Semi-Automated Forces)|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~arpi/SUO/MODULES/modsaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Taylor Enterprise Dynamics''' is an objectoriented software system used to model, simulate, visualize, and monitor dynamic-flow process activities and systems. With Taylor ED’s [[open architecture]], software users can access standard libraries of atoms to build models. Atoms are Taylor ED’s smart objects  and model building resources. In addition to Taylor ED’s standard atom libraries, users can create new atoms themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hullinger |first=Roger|title=Taylor Enterprise Dynamics |url=http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc01papers/033.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example of deterministic simulations===

'''Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson Object of the simulation is CPU memory subsystem IBM 360/91.''' 

Simulation is presented as a practical technique for performance evaluation of alternative configurations of highly concurrent computers. A technique is described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation model of a system. In the model a control stream replaces the instruction and data streams of the real system. Simulation of the system model yields the timing and resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation, without the necessity of emulating the system. As a case study, the implementation of a simulator of a model of the CPUmemory subsystem of the IBM 360/91 is described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=B.|authorlink=B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson |year=1978 |title=Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by deterministic simulation  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''A comparison of deterministic vs stochastic simulation models for assessing adaptive information management techniques over disadvantaged tactical communication networks – Dr. Allan Gibb Mr. Jean-Claude St-Jacques'''

Use of a deterministic battlefield model based on a scripted scenario will provide the required
reproducibility and full control over event sequencing. A stochastic battlefield model, as provided in computer simulation applications like JANUS and ModSAF, produces results that can be made strictly reproducible if the same random number seed can be employed. However, such a model will not provide full human control over scenario composition and event sequencing. A deterministic battlefield model offers clear advantages for the test bed studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan |author2=Jean-Claude St-Jacques |author3=Gerard Nourry |author4=Tim Johnson|title=A Comparison of Deterministic vs Stochastic Simulation Models for Assessing Adaptive Information Management Techniques over Disadvantaged Tactical Communication Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deutsch limit''' is an [[aphorism]] about the [[Information design|information density]] of [[visual programming language]]s originated by [[L Peter Deutsch|L. Peter Deutsch]] that states:

:The problem with visual programming is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.&lt;ref name=complangvisualfaq/&gt;

The term was made up by [[Fred Lakin]], after Deutsch made the following comment at a talk on visual programming by [[Scott Kim]] and [[Warren Robinett]]: "Well, this is all fine and well, but the problem with visual programming languages is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time. How are you going to write an operating system?"&lt;ref name=complangvisualfaq&gt;{{cite web | url = ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/visual-lang/faq | title = Comp.Lang.Visual - Frequently-Asked Questions List | date = 10 March 1998 | website = rtfm.mit.edu | format = FTP | postscript = ; }} {{Cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/visual-lang/faq/|title=The comp.lang.visual FAQ|first = David | last = McIntyre | website = www.faqs.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=logoblocks&gt;{{cite paper | url = http://www.msr-waypoint.com/en-us/um/people/abegel/mit/begel-aup.pdf | title = LogoBlocks: A Graphical Programming Language for Interacting with the World | last = Begel | first = A.  | date = 1996 | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = MIT Media Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | url = http://ifets.info/journals/8_4/ets_8_4.pdf#page=16 | title = Animatronics, Children and Computation | first = Andrew | last = Sempere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[language primitive|primitives]] in a visual language are the separate graphical elements used to build a program, and having more of them available at the same time allows the programmer to read more information.

However, criticisms of the limit include that it is not clear whether a similar limit also exists in textual programming languages;&lt;ref name=complangvisualfaq/&gt; and that the limit could be overcome by applying [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] to visual programming as is commonly done in textual programming.

'''Diversification rates''' are the rates at which new species form (the [[Speciation]] rate, λ) and living species go extinct (the [[extinction]] rate, μ). Diversification rates can be estimated from [[fossils]], data on the species diversity of [[clades]] and their ages, or [[phylogenetic trees]]. Diversification rates are typically reported on a per-lineage basis (e.g. speciation rate per lineage per unit of time), and refer to the diversification dynamics expected under a [[birth-death process]].

A broad range of studies have demonstrated that diversification rates can vary tremendously both through time and across the tree of life. Current research efforts are focused on predicting diversification rates based on aspects of species or their environment. Diversification rates are also subject to various survivorship biases such as the [[Push of the past|"Push of the past"]]

== Methods for estimating diversification rates ==

=== Fossil time series ===

Diversification rates can be estimated time-series data on fossil occurrences. With perfect data, this would be an easy task; one could just count the number of speciation and extinction events in a given time interval, and then use these data to calculate per-lineage rates of speciation and extinction per unit time. However, the incomplete nature of the fossil record means that our calculations need to include the possibility that some fossil lineages were not sampled, and that we do not have precise estimates for the times of speciation and extinction of the taxa that are sampled. More sophisticated methods account for the probability of sampling any lineage, which might also depend on some properties of the lineage itself (e.g. whether it has any hard body parts that tend to fossilize) as well as the environment in which it lives.

Many estimates of diversification rates for fossil lineages are for higher-level taxonomic groups like genera or families. Such rates are informative about general patterns and trends of diversification through time and across clades but can be difficult to compare directly to rates of speciation and extinction of individual species.

=== Clade age and diversity ===

Diversification rates can be estimated from data on the ages and diversities of monophyletic clades in the tree of life. For example, if a clade is 100 million years old and includes 1000 species, we can estimate the net diversification rate of that clade by using a formula derived from a birth-death model of diversification:

Equations are also available for estimating speciation and extinction rates separately when one has ages and diversities for multiple clades.

=== Phylogenetic trees ===

Diversification rates can be estimated using the information available in phylogenetic trees. To calculate diversification rates, such phylogenetic trees have to include branch lengths. Various methods are available to estimate speciation and extinction rates from phylogenetic trees using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical approaches. One can also use phylogenetic trees to test for changing rates of speciation and/or extinction, both through time and across clades, and to associate rates of evolution with potential explanatory factors.

The '''Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee''' ({{lang-bn|দুর্বার মহিলা সমন্বয় সমিতি}} ''Durbar Mohila Shômonbôe Shomiti'' "Unstoppable Women's Synthesis Committee") or '''Durbar''', is a collective of 65,000 [[sex worker]]s in [[West Bengal]]. Established on 15 February 1992, in [[Sonagachi]], the largest [[red-light district]] in Kolkata, [[West Bengal]], India with estimated 11,000 sex workers, Durbar has been working on women's rights and [[sex workers' rights]] [[advocacy]], [[anti-human trafficking]] and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention.&lt;ref name=mint2012&gt;{{cite news |title=The new rhythms of Sonagachi: As the city’s sex workers collective turns 20...|url=http://www.livemint.com/2012/02/24202846/The-new-rhythms-of-Sonagachi.html |publisher=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2208/stories/20050422000408100.htm A missionary enterprise] [[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]], Volume 22 - Issue 08, 12 - 25 Mar. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Durbar states that its aims are the challenging and altering of the barriers that form the everyday reality of sex workers' lives as they relate to their poverty or their [[ostracism]]. Durbar runs 51 free clinics for sex workers across West Bengal, with support from organisations such as the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[National AIDS Control Organisation]] (NACO), who also help Durbar in its initiatives like networking, rights protection and creating alternative livelihood for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex workers’ union gives them the power to say no|url=http://www.livemint.com/2009/11/30230829/Sex-workers8217-union-gives.html |publisher=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date=30 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is overtly political in its aims of fighting for the recognition of prostitution as legal work and, of sex workers as workers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1094088 Sex workers demand labour rights on May Day] DNA India - Tuesday, 1 May 2007 17:52 IST&lt;/ref&gt; and, for a secure social existence of sex workers and their children. They work for the legalisation of prostitution and seek to reform laws that restrict [[human rights]] of sex 

==History==
On 15 February 1992, a public health scientist Dr. Smarajit Jana of [[All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health]], Kolkata, visited the red-light area of [[Sonagachi]] for a HIV intervention research study. A [[peer education]] team was formed from amongst the sex workers and provided training. Shortly after, studies revealed larger issues amongst sex workers, such as sex workers rights, education of their children, access to financial services and handling of harassment by police and local thugs, along with promoting the use of condoms. Thus in 1995 he formed 'Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee' (DMSC) with 12 sex workers as stakeholders, by 2012 DMSC had a membership of 65,000 from 48 branches across the state of West Bengal, and continues to be managed by sex workers, their children and government officials as its board members, and has not just female sex workers as its members but also male and [[transgender]] sex workers.&lt;ref name=mint2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.durbar.org/html/history.asp History of Durbar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ba&gt;[[#Ba|Bagchi, p. 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, it has been working as an [[advocacy group]] for sex workers and over the years, it has worked towards sensitizing general public about rights of sex workers, often initiating debate and discussion in public media and press, besides advocating abolition of 'The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956' (PITA), and legalisation of sex work.&lt;ref name=ba/&gt; Many sex workers now have voters identity cards, health insurance and even bank accounts. In 1995, its [[consumer cooperative]] society and [[micro-credit]] programme, 'Usha' (literally meaning light), ensured that the [[Government of West Bengal]] altered the state's cooperative law to register it as a sex workers [[cooperative]], instead of a 'housewives cooperative' under the prevalent state laws. By 2006-2007, small saving of its 5,000 members lead to an annual turnover to {{INRConvert| 9.75|c}}, with loan of  {{INRConvert| 2.12|c}} distributed amongst its members, which also helped break the monopoly of local moneylenders, who would charge interest rates of up to 300%.&lt;ref name=mint2012/&gt; The DMSC hosted India's first national convention of sex workers on 14 November 1997 in Kolkata, titled 'Sex Work is Real Work: We Demand Workers Rights'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nswp.org/rights/dmsc/indiaconf.html Sex work is real work: We demand workers rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212230342/http://www.nswp.org/rights/dmsc/indiaconf.html |date=12 December 2006 }}, announcement of the 1997 sex worker convention&lt;/ref&gt;

DMSC runs 17 non-formal schools for children of sex workers, and two hostels, one at [[Ultadanga]] and the other at [[Baruipur]].  Its cultural wing, 'Komol Gandhar', teaches dance, drama, mime and music to children, who invited regularly for paid shows.

==HIV/AIDS project==

The Durbar runs the STD/HIV Intervention Programme (commonly known as the [[Sonagachi|Sonagachi Project]]) since 1999. The ownership and management of the Sonagachi Project was taken over by DMSC from the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, a central government public health training and research institute based in [[Kolkata]], which had initiated the programme in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngoconnect.org/february2004issue6.htm The Songachi project is 12!] NGO Connect The Shakti Newsletter Issue 18. Jan / Feb 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining control of the STD/HIV Intervention Programme in 1999, DMSC began replicating the Sonagachi model in other [[Red-light district|red light area]]s in West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DEAD ZONES: Fighting Back in India.; Calcutta's Prostitutes Lead the Fight on AIDS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/04/world/dead-zones-fighting-back-in-india-calcutta-s-prostitutes-lead-the-fight-on-aids.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 January 1999  }}&lt;/ref&gt; DMSC also implements STD/HIV intervention Programme among street-based sex workers and their clients, covering a population of over 20,000 sex workers and migrant labourers. DMSC currently implements and runs STD/HIV intervention programmes in 49 sex work sites in West Bengal.

The approach of Durbar's programme is based on the ''3 Rs'' - Respect, Reliance and Recognition. Respect towards sex workers, Reliance on the knowledge and wisdom of the community of sex workers and, Recognition of sex work as an occupation, for protecting their occupational and human rights.

Durbar is active in building broader alliances to promote HIV prevention, care and support for HIV infected and affected individuals and families both at the national and regional levels.

The book ''[[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]]'' reports investigations revealing, who tried to provide, contrary to stated policy, the DMSC allows sex slavery, trafficking, and underage girls in its brothels.&lt;ref&gt;Kristof, Nicholas D.; Sheryl WuDunn. 2009.

'''Endianness''' refers to the sequential order in which [[byte]]s are arranged into larger numerical [[word (data type)|values]] when stored in [[Computer data storage|memory]] or when transmitted over digital links. Endianness is of interest in [[computer science]] because two conflicting and incompatible formats are in common use: [[Word (computer architecture)|words]] may be represented in '''big-endian''' or '''little-endian''' format, depending on whether bits or bytes or other components are ordered from the big end ([[most significant bit]]) or the little end ([[least significant bit]]). 

In big-endian format, whenever addressing memory or sending/storing words bytewise, the most significant byte—the byte containing the [[most significant bit]]—is stored first (has the lowest address) or sent first, then the following bytes are stored or sent in decreasing significance order, with the least significant byte—the one containing the [[least significant bit]]—stored last (having the highest address) or sent last.

Little-endian format reverses this order: the sequence addresses/sends/stores the least significant byte first (lowest address) and the most significant byte last (highest address). Most computer systems prefer a single format for all its data; using the system's native format is automatic. But when reading memory or receiving transmitted data from a different computer system, it is often required to process and translate data between the preferred native endianness format to the opposite format. 

The order of bits within a byte or word can also have endianness (as discussed later); however, a byte is typically handled as a single numerical value or character symbol and so bit sequence order is obviated.

Both big and little forms of endianness are widely used in digital electronics. The choice of endianness for a new design is often arbitrary, but later technology revisions and updates perpetuate the existing endianness and many other design attributes to maintain [[backward compatibility]]. As examples, the IBM [[z/Architecture]] mainframes and the [[Motorola 68000 series]] use big-endian while the Intel [[x86]] processors use little-endian. The designers of [[System/360]], the ancestor of z/Architecture, chose its endianness in the 1960s; the designers of the [[Motorola 68000]] and the [[Intel 8086]], the first members of the 68000 and x86 families, chose their endianness in the 1970s.

Big-endian is the most common format in data networking; fields in the protocols of the [[Internet protocol suite]], such as [[IPv4]], [[IPv6]], [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], are transmitted in big-endian order. For this reason, big-endian byte order is also referred to as '''network byte order'''. Little-endian storage is popular for microprocessors, in part due to significant influence on microprocessor designs by [[Intel]] Corporation. Mixed forms also exist; for instance, in VAX floating point, the ordering of bytes in a 16-bit word differs from the ordering of 16-bit words within a 32-bit word. Such cases are sometimes referred to as '''mixed-endian''' or '''middle-endian'''. There are also some '''[[#Bi-endianness|bi-endian]]''' processors that operate in either little-endian or big-endian mode.

==Illustration==

[[Image:Big-Endian.svg|200px|Big-Endian|right]]
[[Image:Little-Endian.svg|200px|Little-Endian|right]]
The following two descriptive illustrations assume a normal reading and writing convention of ''left to right'', where the left-most digit or character therefore corresponds to data being "sent" (or "received") first, or being in the ''lowest address in memory,'' and the right-most digit or character corresponds to the data being sent or received last, or being in the ''highest'' address in memory.

Big-endianness may be demonstrated by writing a decimal number, say one hundred twenty-three, on paper in the usual [[positional notation]] understood by a numerate reader: ''123''. The digits are written starting from the left and to the right, with the most significant digit, ''1'', written first. This is analogous to the lowest [[memory address|address of memory]] being used first. This is an example of a big-endian convention taken from daily life.

The little-endian way of writing the same number, one hundred twenty-three, would place the hundreds-digit ''1'' in the right-most position: ''321''. A person following conventional big-endian place-value order, who is not aware of this special ordering, would read a different number: three hundred and twenty one. Endianness in computing is similar, but it usually applies to the ordering of bytes, rather than of digits.

The illustrations to the right, where ''a'' is a memory address, show big-endian and little-endian storage in memory.

In this technical and political examination of byte ordering issues, the "endian" names were drawn from  
[[Jonathan Swift]]'s 1726 satire, ''[[Gulliver's Travels#Part I: A Voyage to Lilliput|Gulliver's Travels]]'', in which civil war erupts over whether the big end or the little end of a boiled egg is the proper end to crack open, which is analogous to counting from the end that contains the most significant bit or the least significant bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Hardware==
[[Computer memory]] consists of a sequence of storage cells. Each cell is identified in hardware and software by its [[memory address]]. If the total number of storage cells in memory is ''n'', then addresses are enumerated from ''0'' to ''n-1''. Computer programs often use data structures of [[Field (computer science)|fields]] that may consist of more data than is stored in one memory cell. For the purpose of this article where its use as an operand of an instruction is relevant, a field consists of a consecutive sequence of [[byte]]s and represents a simple data value. In addition to that, it has to be of numeric type in some [[Positional notation|positional number system]] (mostly base-10 or base-2 – or base-256 in case of 8-bit bytes).&lt;ref&gt;When character (text) strings are compared with one another, this is done [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] where a single positional element (character) also has a positional value. Lexicographical comparison means almost everywhere: first character ranks highest – as in the telephone book. This would have the consequence that almost every machine would be big-endian or at least mixed-endian. Therefore, for the criterion below to apply, the data type in question has to be ''numeric''.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a number system the "value" of a digit is determined not only by its value as a single digit, but also by the position it holds in the complete number, its "significance". These positions can be mapped to memory mainly in two ways:&lt;ref name="TanenbaumAustin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew S. Tanenbaum|author2=Todd M.

*increasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as ''little-endian'', and
*decreasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as ''big-endian''&lt;ref&gt;Note that, in these expressions, the term "end" is meant as "extremity", not as "last part"; and that (the extremity with) ''big'' resp. ''little'' significance is written ''first''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

While the little-endian Intel [[microprocessor]] product line became a popular architecture, many historical and extant processors use a big-endian memory representation, commonly referred to as [[Endianness#Networking|network order]], as used in the [[Internet protocol suite]], either exclusively or as a design option; others use yet another scheme called "[[Endianness#Middle|middle-endian]]", "mixed-endian" or "[[PDP-11]]-endian".

The [[IBM System/360]] uses big-endian byte order, as do its successors [[System/370]], [[ESA/390]], and [[z/Architecture]]. The [[PDP-10]] also uses big-endian addressing for byte-oriented instructions.  The [[IBM Series/1]] minicomputer also use big-endian byte order.

Dealing with data of different endianness is sometimes termed the ''NUXI problem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology alludes to the byte order conflicts encountered while [[Porting|adapting]] [[UNIX]], which ran on the mixed-endian PDP-11, to a big-endian IBM Series/1 computer. Unix was one of the first systems to allow the same code to be compiled for platforms with different internal representations. One of the first programs converted was supposed to print out ''Unix'', but on the Series/1 it printed ''nUxi'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jalics|first1=Paul J.|last2=Heines|first2=Thomas S.|title=Transporting a portable operating system: UNIX to an IBM minicomputer|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 December 1983|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1066–1072|doi=10.1145/358476.358504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Datapoint 2200]] uses simple bit-serial logic with little-endian to facilitate [[carry propagation]]. When Intel developed the [[Intel 8008|8008]] microprocessor for Datapoint, they used little-endian for compatibility. However, as Intel was unable to deliver the 8008 in time, Datapoint used a [[medium scale integration]] equivalent, but the little-endianness was retained in most Intel designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=House|first=David|title=Oral History Panel on the Development and Promotion  of the Intel 8008 Microprocessor|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Intel_8008/Intel_8008_1.oral_history.2006.102657982.pdf#page=5|publisher=[[Computer History Museum]]|accessdate=23 April 2014|author2=Faggin, Federico |author3=Feeney, Hal |author4=Gelbach, Ed |author5=Hoff, Ted |author6=Mazor, Stan |author7= Smith, Hank |page=5|date=2006-09-21|quote=Mazor: And lastly, the original design for Datapoint... what they wanted was a [bit] serial machine. And if you think about a  serial machine, you have to process all the addresses and data one-bit at a time, and the rational way to  do that is: low-bit to high-bit because that’s the way that carry would propagate. So it means that [in] the jump instruction itself, the way the 14-bit address would be put in a serial machine is bit-backwards, as  you look at it, because that’s the way you’d want to process it. Well, we were gonna built a byte-parallel  machine, not bit-serial and our compromise (in the spirit of the customer and just for him), we put the  bytes in backwards. We put the low-byte [first] and then the high-byte. This has since been dubbed  “Little Endian” format and it’s sort of contrary to what you’d think would be natural. Well, we did it for  Datapoint. As you’ll see, they never did use the [8008] chip and so it was in some sense “a mistake”, but  that [Little Endian format] has lived on to the 8080 and 8086 and [is] one of the marks of this family.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lunde2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Lunde|title=CJKV Information Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SA92uQqTB-AC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=13 January 2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-0-596-51447-1|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel [[MCS-48]] is also little-endian, as are the well-known [[DEC Alpha]], [[Atmel AVR]], [[VAX]] and many more.

The Motorola [[Motorola 6800|6800]] / 6801, the [[6809]] and the [[68000]] series of processors used the big-endian format, and for this reason, it is also known as the "''Motorola convention''".&lt;ref name="Kueveler-Schwoch_1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kueveler-Schwoch_2007"/&gt;

The Intel [[8051]], contrary to other Intel processors, expects 16-bit addresses for LJMP and LCALL in big-endian format; however, xCALL instructions store the return address onto the stack in little-endian format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/c51/c51_xe.htm|title=Cx51 User's Guide: E. Byte Ordering|website=keil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SPARC]] historically used big-endian until version 9, which is [[#Bi-endianness|bi-endian]]; similarly early IBM POWER processors were big-endian, but now the [[PowerPC]] and [[Power Architecture]] descendants are bi-endian. The [[ARM architecture]] was little-endian before version 3 when it became [[#Bi-endianness|bi-endian]].

Other well-known little-endian processor architectures include [[MOS Technology 6502]] (including [[Western Design Center]] [[65802]] and [[65C816]]), Zilog [[Z80]] (including [[Z180]] and [[eZ80]]) and [[Altera]] [[Nios II]].

===Current architectures===
The Intel [[x86]] and also AMD64 / [[x86-64]] series of processors use the '''little-endian''' format, and for this reason, it is also known in the industry as the "''Intel convention''".&lt;ref name="Kueveler-Schwoch_1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Arbeitsbuch Informatik - eine praxisorientierte Einführung in die Datenverarbeitung mit Projektaufgabe|language=German|first1=Gerd|last1=Küveler|first2=Dietrich|last2=Schwoch|date=2013|orig-year=1996|publisher=Vieweg-Verlag, reprint: Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-528-04952-2|id=9783322929075|doi=10.1007/978-3-322-92907-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8-dBgAAQBAJ|accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kueveler-Schwoch_2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Informatik für Ingenieure und Naturwissenschaftler: PC- und Mikrocomputertechnik, Rechnernetze|language=German|first1=Gerd|last1=Küveler|first2=Dietrich|last2=Schwoch|date=2007-10-04|publisher=Vieweg, reprint: Springer-Verlag|edition=5|volume=2|isbn=3834891916|id=9783834891914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQbvPYxceY0C|accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some current '''big-endian''' architectures include the IBM [[z/Architecture]], [[Freescale ColdFire]] (which is [[Motorola 68000 series]]-based), Xilinx [[MicroBlaze]], Atmel [[AVR32]].

As a consequence of its original implementation on the Intel 8080 platform, the operating system-independent [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system is defined to use little-endian byte ordering, even on platforms using other endiannesses natively.

{{anchor|Bi-endian hardware}}

===Bi-endianness===
&lt;!-- Yes, that's bi, not big. "Bi" here means "both of them", i.e. switchable between big- &amp; little-endianness. --&gt;
Some architectures (including [[ARM architecture|ARM]] versions 3 and above, [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[SPARC]] V9, [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PA-RISC]], [[SuperH|SuperH SH-4]] and [[IA-64]]) feature a setting which allows for switchable endianness in data fetches and stores, instruction fetches, or both. This feature can improve performance or simplify the logic of networking devices and software. The word ''bi-endian'', when said of hardware, denotes the capability of the machine to compute or pass data in either endian format.

Many of these architectures can be switched via software to default to a specific endian format (usually done when the computer starts up); however, on some systems the default endianness is selected by hardware on the motherboard and cannot be changed via software (e.g. the Alpha, which runs only in big-endian mode on the [[Cray T3E]]).

Note that the term "bi-endian" refers primarily to how a processor treats ''data'' accesses. ''Instruction'' accesses (fetches of instruction words) on a given processor may still assume a fixed endianness, even if ''data'' accesses are fully bi-endian, though this is not always the case, such as on Intel's [[IA-64]]-based Itanium CPU, which allows both.

Note, too, that some nominally bi-endian CPUs require motherboard help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented [[PowerPC]] processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian from the point of view of the executing programs, but they require the motherboard to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of things will apply to [[Input/Output|I/O]] devices. In the absence of this unusual motherboard hardware, device driver software must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.

Some CPUs, such as many PowerPC processors intended for embedded use and almost all SPARC processors, allow per-page choice of endianness.

SPARC processors since the late 1990s ("SPARC v9" compliant processors) allow data endianness to be chosen with each individual instruction that loads from or stores to memory.

Many processors have instructions to convert a word in a register to the opposite endianness, that is, they swap the order of the bytes in a 16-, 32- or 64-bit word. All the individual bits are not reversed though.

Recent Intel x86 and x86-64 architecture CPUs have a MOVBE instruction ([[Intel Core]] since generation 4, after [[Intel Atom|Atom]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to detect New Instruction support in the 4th generation Intel® Core™ processor family|url=https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/405250/how-to-detect-new-instruction-support-in-the-4th-generation-intel-core-processor-family.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fetches a big-endian format word from memory or writes a word into memory in big-endian format. These processors are otherwise thoroughly little-endian. They also already had a range of swap instructions to reverse the byte order of the contents of registers, such as when words have already been fetched from memory locations where they were in the 'wrong' endianness.

[[ZFS]]/[[OpenZFS]] combined [[file system]] and [[Logical volume management|logical volume manager]] is known to provide adaptive endianness and to work with both big-endian and little-endian systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Documentation/Read_Write_Lecture |title=FreeBSD Kernel Internals: An Intensive Code Walkthrough |author=Matt Ahrens |year=2016 |publisher=OpenZFS Documentation/Read Write Lecture }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floating point===
&lt;!-- This section is transcluded on the [[Double-precision floating point]] article --&gt;
&lt;section begin="Floating-point" /&gt;
Although the ubiquitous x86 processors of today use little-endian storage for all types of data (integer, floating point, [[binary coded decimal|BCD]]), there are a number of hardware architectures where [[floating-point]] numbers are represented in big-endian form while integers are represented in little-endian form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Floating-Point Formats |author-first=John J. G. |author-last=Savard |date=2018 |orig-year=2005 |work=quadibloc |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/cp0201.htm |access-date=2018-07-16 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703001709/http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/cp0201.htm |archive-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors that have half little-endian, half big-endian floating-point representation for double-precision numbers: both 32-bit words are stored in little-endian like integer registers, but the most significant one first. Because there have been many floating-point formats with no "[[Computer network|network]]" standard representation for them, the [[External Data Representation|XDR]] standard uses big-endian IEEE 754 as its representation. It may therefore appear strange that the widespread [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard does not specify endianness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pack – convert a list into a binary representation |url=http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlfunc/pack.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, this means that even standard IEEE floating-point data written by one machine might not be readable by another. However, on modern standard computers (i.e., implementing IEEE 754), one may in practice safely assume that the endianness is the same for floating-point numbers as for integers, making the conversion straightforward regardless of data type. (Small [[embedded system]]s using special floating-point formats may be another matter however.)&lt;section end="Floating-point" /&gt;

===Optimization===
The little-endian system has the property that the same value can be read from memory at different lengths without using different addresses (even when [[byte alignment|alignment]] restrictions are imposed). For example, a 32-bit memory location with content 4A 00 00 00 can be read at the same address as either [[8-bit]] (value = 4A), [[16-bit]] (004A), [[24-bit]] (00004A), or [[32-bit]] (0000004A), all of which retain the same numeric value. Although this little-endian property is rarely used directly by high-level programmers, it is often employed by code optimizers as well as by [[assembly language]] programmers.
In more concrete terms, such optimizations are the equivalent of the following C code returning true on most little-endian systems:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
union u_t {
  uint8_t u8; uint16_t u16; uint32_t u32; uint64_t u64;
} u = { .u64 = 0x4A };
puts(u.u8 == u.u16 &amp;&amp; u.u8 == u.u32 &amp;&amp; u.u8 == u.u64 ? "true" : "false");
&lt;/source&gt;

While not allowed by C++, such [[Type punning]] code is allowed as "implementation-defined" by the C11 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=C11 standard |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57853.html |publisher=ISO |accessdate=15 August 2018 |page=Section 6.5.2.3 "Structure and Union members", §3 and footnote 95 |quote=95) If the member used to read the contents of a union object is not the same as the member last used to store a value in the object, the appropriate part of the object representation of the value is reinterpreted as an object representation in the new type as described in 6.2.6 (a process sometimes called ‘‘type punning’’).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3.10 Options That Control Optimization: -fstrict-aliasing |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Type-punning |website=GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in code interacting with hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |first=Linus |last=Torvalds |title=[GIT PULL] Device properties framework update for v4.18-rc1 |url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/5/769 |mailing-list=Linux Kernel|accessdate=15 August 2018 | date=5 Jun 2018 |quote=The fact is, using a union to do type punning is the traditional AND STANDARD way to do type punning in gcc. In fact, it is the *documented* way to do it for gcc, when you are a f*cking moron and use "-fstrict-aliasing" ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in some situations it may be useful to obtain an approximation of a multi-byte or multi-word value by reading only its most significant portion instead of the complete representation; a big-endian processor may read such an approximation using the same base-address that would be used for the full value.

===Calculation order===
Little-endian representation simplifies hardware in processors that add multi-byte integral values a byte at a time, such as small-scale byte-addressable processors and [[microcontroller]]s. As carry propagation must start at the least significant bit (and thus byte), multi-byte addition can then be carried out with a monotonically-incrementing address sequence, a simple operation already present in hardware. On a big-endian processor, its addressing unit has to be told how big the addition is going to be so that it can hop forward to the least significant byte, then count back down towards the most significant byte (MSB). On the other hand, arithmetic division is done starting from the MSB, so it is more natural for big-endian processors. However, high-performance processors usually fetch typical multi-byte operands from memory in the same amount of time they would have fetched a single byte, so the complexity of the hardware is not affected by the byte ordering.

|colspan="14" | &lt;small&gt;A simple way to remember is "In {{em|L}}ittle Endian, the {{em|L}}east significant byte goes into the {{em|L}}owest-addressed slot".&lt;br /&gt;So in the example in the table, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, the least significant byte, in a Little-Endian system goes into slot +0.&lt;/small&gt;
|}

We can assume that as we write text ''left to right'', we are increasing the 'address' on paper, as a processor would write bytes with increasing memory addresses &amp;mdash; as in the adjacent table. On paper, the hex value 0a0b0c0d (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in '''''de'''creasing'' significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes from ''left to right'' in '''''de'''creasing'' significance: &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +0, &lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +1, &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +2, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +3.

On a little-endian system, the bytes are written from ''left to right'' in '''''in'''creasing'' significance, starting with the one's byte: &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +0, &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +1, &lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +2, &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at +3. Writing a 32-bit binary value to a memory location on a little-endian system and outputting the memory location (with growing addresses from left to right) shows that the order is ''reversed'' (byte-swapped) compared to usual big-endian notation. This is the way a [[hexdump]] is displayed: because the dumping program is unable to know what kind of data it is dumping, the only orientation it can observe is monotonically increasing addresses. The human reader, however, who knows that they are reading a hexdump of a little-endian system and who knows what kind of data they are reading, reads the byte sequence &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; as the 32-bit binary value 168496141, or 0x0a0b0c0d in hexadecimal notation. (Of course, this is ''not'' the same as the number &lt;tt&gt;0D0C0B0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = 0x0d0c0b0a = 218893066.)

==Examples==
This section provides example layouts of the 32-bit number 0A0B0C0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; in the most common variants of endianness. There exist several digital processors that use other formats. That is true for typical [[embedded system]]s as well as for general computer CPUs. Most processors used in non CPU roles in typical computers (in storage units, peripherals etc.) also use one of these two basic formats, although not always 32-bit.

The examples refer to the storage in memory of the value. It uses [[hexadecimal]] notation.

====When organized by byte addresses====
; Byte addresses increasing from right to left
Visualising memory addresses from left to right makes little-endian values appear backwards. If the addresses are written increasing ''towards'' the left instead, each individual little-endian value will appear forwards. However strings of values or characters appear reversed instead.

With 8-bit atomic elements:

{| cellpadding="4" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;"
|-
| colspan="6" |←&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''increasing addresses''
|-
|style="border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;"  | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The [[least significant byte]] (LSB) value, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, is at the lowest address. The other bytes follow in increasing order of significance.

With 16-bit atomic elements:

{| cellpadding="4" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;"
|-
| colspan="6" |←&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''increasing addresses''
|-
|style="border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;"  | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0A0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;0C0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The least significant 16-bit unit stores the value &lt;tt&gt;0C0D&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, immediately followed by &lt;tt&gt;0A0B&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

The display of text is reversed from the normal display of languages such as English that read from left to right. For example, the word "XRAY" displayed in this manner, with each character stored in an 8-bit atomic element:

{| cellpadding="4" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;"
|-
| colspan="6" |←&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''increasing addresses''
|-
|style="border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;"  | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"Y"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"A"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"R"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"X"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

If pairs of characters are stored in 16-bit atomic elements (using 8 bits per character), it could look even stranger:

{| cellpadding="4" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;"
|-
| colspan="4" |←&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''increasing addresses''
|-
|style="border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;"  | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"AY"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid;"                       | &lt;tt&gt;"XR"&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

This conflict between the memory arrangements of binary data and text is intrinsic to the nature of the little-endian convention, but is a conflict only for languages written left-to-right, such as English. For right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], there is no conflict of text with binary, and the preferred display in both cases would be with addresses increasing to the left. (On the other hand, right-to-left languages have a complementary intrinsic conflict in the big-endian system.)

==={{anchor|Middle|Mixed|Medium}}Middle-endian===
Numerous other orderings, generically called ''middle-endian'' or ''mixed-endian'', are possible. On the [[PDP-11]] (16-bit little-endian), for example, the instructions to convert between floating-point and integer values in the optional floating-point processor on the PDP-11/45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/handbooks/PDP1145_Handbook_1973.pdf|title=PDP-11/45 Processor Handbook|page=165|year=1973|publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PDP-11/70, and in some later processors, stored 32-bit "double precision integer long" values  with the 16-bit halves swapped from the expected little-endian order, and the [[UNIX]] [[C (programming language)|C]] compiler used the same format for 32-bit long integers. This ordering is known as ''PDP-endian''.

|style="border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;" | &lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The [[ARM architecture]] can also produce this format when writing a 32-bit word to an address 2 bytes from a 32-bit word [[data structure alignment|alignment]].

[[Segment descriptors]] on [[Intel 80386]] and compatible processors keep a 32-bit base address of the segment stored in little-endian order, but in four nonconsecutive bytes, at relative positions 2, 3, 4 and 7 of the descriptor start.

==Files and byte swap==
Endianness is a problem when a binary file created on a computer is read on another computer with different endianness. Some [[CPU]] instruction sets provide native support for endian byte swapping, such as ''bswap''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 2 (2A, 2B &amp; 2C): Instruction Set Reference, A-Z|at=p. 3–112|publisher=Intel|date=September 2016|accessdate=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[x86]] - [[Intel 80486|486]] and later), and ''rev''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0487a.k_10775/index.html|title=ARMv8-A Reference Manual|publisher=[[ARM Holdings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[ARM architecture|ARMv6]] and later).

Some [[compiler]]s have built-in facilities to deal with data written in other formats. For example, the [[Intel]] [[Fortran]] compiler supports the non-standard &lt;code&gt;CONVERT&lt;/code&gt; specifier, so a file can be opened as
:&lt;code&gt;OPEN(unit,CONVERT='BIG_ENDIAN',...)&lt;/code&gt;
or
:&lt;code&gt;OPEN(unit,CONVERT='LITTLE_ENDIAN',...)&lt;/code&gt;
Some compilers have options to generate code that globally enables the conversion for all file IO operations. This allows programmers to reuse code on a system with the opposite endianness without having to modify the code itself. If the compiler does not support such conversion, the programmer needs to swap the bytes via ad hoc code.

Fortran sequential unformatted files created with one endianness usually cannot be read on a system using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a [[storage record|record]] (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal to the number of bytes in the data. An attempt to read such file on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out sequential binary files as opposed to sequential unformatted.

[[Unicode]] text can optionally start with a [[byte order mark]] (BOM) to signal the endianness of the file or stream. Its code point is U+FEFF. In [[UTF-32]] for example, a big-endian file should start with &lt;code&gt;00 00 FE FF&lt;/code&gt;; a little-endian should start with &lt;code&gt;FF FE 00 00&lt;/code&gt;.

Application binary data formats, such as for example [[MATLAB]] .mat files, or the .BIL data format, used in topography, are usually endianness-independent. This is achieved by:
# storing the data always in one fixed endianness, or 
# carrying with the data a switch to indicate which endianness the data was written with. 
When reading the file, the application converts the endianness, invisibly from the user. 
An example of the first case is the binary [[XLS file]] format that is portable between Windows and Mac systems and always little endian, leaving the Mac application to swap the bytes on load and save when running on a big-endian Motorola 68K or PowerPC processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat(xls)Specification.xps |title=Microsoft Office Excel 97 - 2007 Binary File Format Specification (*.xls 97-2007 format) |year=2007 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TIFF]] image files are an example of the second strategy, whose header instructs the application about endianness of their internal binary integers. If a file starts with the signature "&lt;code&gt;MM&lt;/code&gt;" it means that integers are represented as big-endian, while "&lt;code&gt;II&lt;/code&gt;" means little-endian. Those signatures need a single 16-bit word each, and they are [[palindrome]]s (that is, they read the same forwards and backwards), so they are endianness independent. "&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;" stands for [[Intel]] and "&lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;" stands for [[Motorola]], the respective [[CPU]] providers of the [[IBM PC]] compatibles (Intel) and [[Apple Macintosh]] platforms (Motorola) in the 1980s. Intel CPUs are little-endian, while Motorola 680x0 CPUs are big-endian. This explicit signature allows a TIFF reader program to swap bytes if necessary when a given file was generated by a TIFF writer program running on a computer with a different endianness.

Since the required byte swap depends on the size of the numbers stored in the file (two 2-byte integers require a different swap than one 4-byte integer), the file format must be known to perform endianness conversion.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
/* C function to change endianness for byte swap in an unsigned 32-bit integer */

uint32_t ChangeEndianness(uint32_t value)
{
    uint32_t result = 0;
    result |= (value &amp; 0x000000FF) &lt;&lt; 24;
    result |= (value &amp; 0x0000FF00) &lt;&lt; 8;
    result |= (value &amp; 0x00FF0000) &gt;&gt; 8;
    result |= (value &amp; 0xFF000000) &gt;&gt; 24;
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Networking==
Many [[IETF RFC]]s use the term ''network order'', meaning the order of transmission for bits and bytes ''over the wire'' in [[network protocols]]. Among others, the historic RFC 1700 (also known as [[Internet standard]] STD 2) has defined the network order for protocols in the [[Internet protocol suite]] to be [[#Big-endian|big-endian]], hence the use of the term "network byte order" for big-endian byte order; however, not all protocols use big-endian byte order as the network order.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berkeley sockets]] [[application programming interface|API]] defines a set of functions to convert 16-bit and 32-bit integers to and from network byte order: the &lt;tt&gt;htons&lt;/tt&gt; (host-to-network-short) and &lt;tt&gt;htonl&lt;/tt&gt; (host-to-network-long) functions convert 16-bit and 32-bit values respectively from machine (''host'') to network order; the &lt;tt&gt;ntohs&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ntohl&lt;/tt&gt; functions convert from network to host order. These functions may be a [[no-op]] on a big-endian system.

In [[CANopen]], multi-byte parameters are always sent [[least significant byte]] first (little endian). The same is true for [[Ethernet Powerlink]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethernet POWERLINK Standardisation Group (2012), ''EPSG Working Draft Proposal 301: Ethernet POWERLINK Communication Profile Specification Version 1.1.4'', chapter 6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the high-level network protocols usually consider the byte (mostly meant as ''[[octet (computing)|octet]]'') as their atomic unit, the lowest network protocols may deal with ordering of bits within a byte.

==Bit endianness==
[[Bit numbering]] is a concept similar to endianness, but on a level of bits, not bytes. ''Bit endianness'' or ''bit-level endianness'' refers to the transmission order of bits over a serial medium. The bit-level analogue of little-endian (least significant bit goes first) is used in [[RS-232]], [[HDLC]], [[Ethernet]], and [[USB]]. Some protocols use the opposite ordering (e.g. [[Teletext]], [[I²C]], [[SMBus]], [[PMBus]], and [[synchronous optical networking|SONET and SDH]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Sec. 2.1 Bit Transmission of [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 "Applicability Statement for PPP over SONET/SDH"]&lt;/ref&gt;). Usually, there exists a consistent view to the bits irrespective of their order in the byte, such that the latter becomes relevant only on a very low level. One exception is caused by the feature of some [[cyclic redundancy check]]s to detect ''all'' [[burst error]]s up to a known length, which would be spoiled if the bit order is different from the byte order on serial transmission.

Apart from serialization, the terms ''bit endianness'' and ''bit-level endianness'' are seldom used, as computer architectures where each individual bit has a unique address are rare. Individual bits or [[bit field]]s are accessed via their numerical value or, in high-level programming languages, assigned names, the effects of which, however, may be machine dependent or lack [[software portability]]. The natural numbering is that the [[arithmetic left shift]] 1&lt;&lt;''n'' yields a mask for the bit of position ''n'', a rule which exhibits the machine's (byte) endianness at least if {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 8,}} e.g. if used for indexing a sufficiently large bit array. Other numberings do occur in various documentations.

The '''first-sale doctrine''' is a legal concept playing an important role in U.S. [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] law by limiting certain rights of a copyright or trademark owner. The doctrine enables the distribution chain of copyrighted products, library lending, giving, video rentals and secondary markets for copyrighted works (for example, enabling individuals to sell their legally purchased books or CDs to others). In trademark law, this same doctrine enables reselling of trademarked products after the trademark holder put the products on the market. The doctrine is also referred to as the "right of first sale," "first sale rule," or "exhaustion rule."

The first-sale doctrine is one of the [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]].

Copyright law grants a copyright owner an exclusive right "to distribute copies or [[phonorecord]]s of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 17 U.S.C. 106(3)]. This is called a "distribution right" and differs from the copyright owner's "reproduction right" which involves making copies of the copyrighted works. Rather than the right to copy, the distribution right involves the right to transfer physical copies or phonorecords (i.e., recorded music) of the copyrighted work. For example, the distribution right could be infringed when a retailer acquires and sells to the public unlawfully made audio or video tapes. Although the retailer may not have copied the work in any way and may not have known that the tapes were made unlawfully, he nevertheless infringes the distribution right by the sale. The distribution right allows the copyright owner to seek redress from any member in the chain of distribution.

The first-sale doctrine creates a basic exception to the copyright holder's distribution right. Once the work is lawfully sold or even transferred gratuitously, the copyright owner's interest in the material object in which the copyrighted work is embodied is exhausted. The owner of the material object can then dispose of it as he sees fit. Thus, one who buys a copy of a book is entitled to resell it, rent it, give it away, or destroy it. However, the owner of the copy of the book will not be able to make new copies of the book because the first-sale doctrine does not limit copyright owner's reproduction right. The rationale of the doctrine is to prevent the copyright owner from restraining the free [[Alienation (property law)|alienability of goods]]. Without the doctrine, a possessor of a copy of a copyrighted work would have to negotiate with the copyright owner every time he wished to dispose of his copy. After the initial transfer of ownership of a legal copy of a copyrighted work, the first-sale doctrine exhausts copyright holder's right to control how ownership of that copy can be disposed of. For this reason, this doctrine is also referred to as the "exhaustion rule."

The doctrine was first recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1908 (see ''[[Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus]]'') and subsequently codified in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109 17 U.S.C. § 109]. In the ''Bobbs-Merrill'' case, the publisher, Bobbs-Merrill, had inserted a notice in its books that any retail sale at a price under $1.00 would constitute an infringement of its copyright. The defendants, who owned [[Macy's]] department store, disregarded the notice and sold the books at a lower price without Bobbs-Merrill's consent. The Supreme Court held that the exclusive statutory right to "vend" applied only to the first sale of the copyrighted work.

Section 109(a) provides:
"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 (3), the owner of a particular copy or [[phonorecord]] lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord." The elements of the first sale doctrine can be summarized as follows: (1) the copy was lawfully made with the authorization of the copyright owner; (2) ownership of the copy was initially transferred under the copyright owner's authority; (3) the defendant is a lawful owner of the copy in question; and (4) the defendant's use implicates the distribution right only; not the reproduction or some other right given to the copyright owner.

===Application to public display right===
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109 17 U.S.C. §109(c)] creates a limited exception to a copyright owner's public display right. Owners of a lawful copy of a copyrighted work can, without permission from the copyright owner, display that copy to viewers present at the place where the copy is located. {{cn span|text=For example, an owner of copy of a computer program (and ''only'' a computer program under §109(c)) cannot display the copy publicly on a website under this provision.|date=December 2013}}

An [[amicus brief]] in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' argued that Section 109 was a key provision for US art museums:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most U.S. art museums have permanent collections that were acquired through purchases, gifts, and bequests, and on which they draw for exhibitions to the public. Museums also present special exhibitions, largely made up of works not in their collections, through loans from private collectors, galleries, and other institutions. For all these activities museums depend on the protections afforded by Section 109. Section 109(c) provides that the owner of a particular copy "lawfully made under this title" is entitled to display that copy publicly without the copyright owner's permission. Section 109(a) similarly allows museums to buy, borrow, loan, and sell such "lawfully made" artworks.&lt;ref&gt;No. 11-697, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs/11-697_petitioneramcuassnofartmuseumdirectorsetal.authcheckdam.pdf BRIEF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ART MUSEUM DIRECTORS, THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO, THE J. PAUL GETTY TRUST, MUSEUM ASSOCIATES DBA LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART, THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, THE SAN FRANCISCO MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, THE SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM FOUNDATION, THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART, ET AL. AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER], p2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Limitations ==
The first sale doctrine only limits the distribution rights of copyright holders. This principle sometimes clashes with the holder's other rights, such as the right of reproduction &amp; derivative work rights. For example, in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7811317241368435030 ''Lee v. A.R.T. Co.''], the defendant bought plaintiff's artworks in the form of notecards and then mounted them on ceramic tiles, covering the artworks with transparent epoxy resin. Despite plaintiff's assertion of violation of his right to prepare derivative works, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit]] held that the derivative work right was not violated and that defendant's sale of the tiles was protected under the first sale doctrine. However, based on very similar facts, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit]] in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1465323101896646559 ''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Company''] held that plaintiff's right to prepare derivative works was infringed and that the first sale doctrine did not protect the defendant under such circumstances.

===Application to digital copies===
The first-sale doctrine does not neatly fit transfers of copies of digital works because an actual transfer does not actually happen – instead, the recipient receives a new copy of the work while, at the same time, the sender has the original copy (unless that copy is deleted, either automatically or manually). For example, this exact issue played out in [[Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc.]], a case involving online marketplace for pre-owned digital music.

E-books have the same issue. Because the first sale doctrine does not apply to electronic books, libraries cannot freely lend e-books indefinitely after purchase. Instead, electronic book publishers came up with business models to sell the subscriptions to the license of the text. This results in e-book publishers placing restrictions on the number of times an e-book can circulate and/or the amount of time a book is within a collection before a library's license expires, then the book no longer belongs to them.&lt;ref&gt;Chiarizio, M. (2013). An American Tragedy: E-Books, Licenses, and the End of Public Lending Libraries?  Vanderbilt Law Review, 66(2), 615-644.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question is whether the first-sale doctrine should be retooled to reflect the realities of the digital age. Physical copies degrade over time, whereas digital information may not. Works in digital format can be reproduced without any flaws and can be disseminated worldwide without much difficulty. Thus, applying the first sale doctrine to digital copies affects the market for the original to a greater degree than transfers of physical copies. The [[United States Copyright Office|U.S. Copyright Office]] stated that "[t]he tangible nature of a copy is a defining element of the first sale doctrine and critical to its rationale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary Digital Millennium Copyright Act Section 104 Report |url=http://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/dmca_executive.html|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled, on July 3, 2012, that it is indeed permissible to resell software licenses even if the digital good has been downloaded directly from the Internet, and that the first sale doctrine applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited amount of time, as such sale involves a transfer of ownership, thus prohibiting any software maker from preventing the resale of their software by any of their legitimate owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,16069323,00.html|title=Oracle loses court fight over software resale rules|quote=''A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet.

===Ownership requirement===
For the first sale doctrine to apply, lawful "ownership" of the copy or phonorecord is required. As [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109 §109(d)] prescribes, first sale doctrine does not apply if the possession of the copy is "by rental, lease, loan, or otherwise without acquiring ownership of it."

Some software and digital content publishers claim in their [[end-user license agreement]]s (EULA) that their software or content is licensed, not sold, and thus the first sale doctrine does not apply to their works. These publishers have had some success in contracting around first sale doctrine through various [[clickwrap]], [[shrink wrap]], and other license agreements. For example, if someone buys [[MP3]] songs from Amazon.com, the MP3 files are merely licensed to them and hence they may not be able to resell those MP3 files. However, MP3 songs bought through [[iTunes Store]] may be characterized as "sales" because of Apple's language in its EULA and hence they may be resell-able, if other requirements of first sale doctrine are met.

Courts have struggled and taken dramatically different approaches to sort out when only a license was granted to the end user as compared to ownership. Most of these cases involved software-licensing agreements. In general, courts look beneath the surface of the agreements to conclude whether the agreements create a licensing relationship or if they amount to, in substance, sales subject to first sale doctrine under §109(a). Thus, specifying that the agreement grants only a "license" is necessary to create the licensing relationship, but not sufficient. Other terms of the agreement should be consistent with such a licensing relationship.

In ''[[Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.]]'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit]] created a three-factor test to decide whether a particular software licensing agreement is successful in creating a licensing relationship with the end user. The factors include: 1) whether a copyright owner specifies that a user is granted a license; 2) whether the copyright owner significantly restricts the user's ability to transfer the software to others; and 3) whether the copyright owner imposes notable use restrictions on the software. In ''Vernor'', [[Autodesk]]'s license agreement specified that it retains title to the software and the user is only granted a non-exclusive license. The agreement also had restrictions against modifying, translating, or reverse-engineering the software, or removing any proprietary marks from the software packaging or documentation. The agreement also specified that software could not be transferred or leased without Autodesk's written consent, and could not be transferred outside the Western Hemisphere. Based on these facts, the 9th Circuit held that the user is only a licensee of Autodesk's software, not an owner and hence the user could not resell the software on eBay without Autodesk's permission.

However, the same 9th Circuit panel that decided ''Vernor v. Autodesk'', refused to apply ''Vernor's'' three-factor test in ''[[UMG v. Augusto]]'' to a purported licensing agreement created when UMG sent unsolicited promotional CDs to music critics. The promotional CDs' packaging contained the language: "This CD is the property of the record company and is licensed to the intended recipient for personal use only. Acceptance of this CD shall constitute an agreement to comply with the terms of the license. Resale or transfer of possession is not allowed and may be punishable under federal and state laws." Augusto tried to sell these CDs on eBay and UMG argued that first sale doctrine did not apply since the CDs were not sold and only a licensing relationship was created. However the court held that first sale doctrine applies when a copy is given away and that recipients of the promotional CDs did not accept the terms of the license agreement by merely not sending back the unsolicited CDs.

In the case ''[[UsedSoft]] v Oracle'', the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that the sale of a software product, either through a physical support or download, constituted a transfer of ownership in EU law, thus the first sale doctrine applies; the ruling thereby breaks the "licensed, not sold" legal theory, but leaves open numerous questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerlaw.co.uk/2012/the-legality-of-second-hand-software-sales-in-the-eu/|title=The legality of second hand software sales in the EU|author=Jas Purewal|publisher=gamerlaw.co.uk}} (mirror [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/173538/ here])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importation of copies===
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/602 Section 602(a)(1)] of the Copyright statute states that "importation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or [[phonorecord]]s of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords." This provision provides copyright owner an opportunity to stop goods from entering the United States market altogether.

Application of this provision created difficult legal issues in the context of [[gray market]] products. Gray market dealers buy the genuine goods in foreign countries at a significant discount from U.S. prices. They then import these genuine goods into the U.S. and sell them at discount prices, undercutting the authorized U.S. dealers. The gray market exists where the price for goods outside the US is lower than the price inside.

On the surface, §602(a), barring unauthorized importation, would seem to clash with the first-sale doctrine, which permits the resale of lawfully made copies. The issue comes down to whether §602(a) creates an affirmative right to bar all unauthorized importation, or does the first-sale doctrine limit the reach of §602(a), thus permitting the resale of at least some lawfully made imported copies.

In 1998, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Quality King Distributors Inc., v. L'anza Research International Inc.|Quality King v. L'Anza]]'' found that first-sale doctrine applied to imported goods at least where the imported goods are first lawfully made in the United States, shipped abroad for resale, and later reenter the United States. That case involved importation of hair care products bearing copyrighted labels. A unanimous Supreme Court found that the first-sale doctrine does apply to importation into the US of copyrighted works (the labels), which were made in the US and then exported.

However, the Supreme Court did not decide the issue where gray-market products are initially manufactured abroad and then imported into the US. The Court indicated that importation of goods made outside the US could perhaps be barred under §602(a), since such goods would not be "lawfully made under this title." Such products might be lawfully made, either by the copyright owner or a licensee, but they would not be lawfully made under US copyright law. Rather, they would be lawfully made under the copyright laws of the other country; and the first-sale doctrine would therefore not limit the §602 importation restriction.

The 2008 ''[[Omega S.A. v. Costco Wholesale Corp.|Omega v. Costco]]'' case involved this exact unresolved issue, where the defendant [[Costco]] obtained authentic Omega watches, which feature a copyrighted design on the back of the watches, through the gray market and resold them in its stores in the US. Omega manufactured these watches outside the US and did not authorize their importation into the US. Based on the ''Quality King'' case, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit]] held that "application of first-sale doctrine to foreign-made copies would impermissibly apply" the Copyright Act extraterritorially. However, the court stated that first-sale doctrine might still apply to a foreign manufactured copy if it was imported "with the authority of the U.S. copyright owner." The Supreme Court granted certiorari to ''Omega v. Costco'', and affirmed 4-4.  However, as an evenly split decision, it set precedent only in the 9th Circuit, not nationwide.&lt;ref name="libraryjournal omega"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/communityacademiclibraries/889113-419/in_wake_of_costco_v..csp | title=In Wake of Costco v. Omega, Libraries Can Proceed with "Fair Degree of Confidence" | publisher=Library Journal | date=February 3, 2011 | accessdate=November 28, 2012 | author=Hadro, Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url= https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6-3 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US.  The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to charge vastly different prices in different markets due to ease of [[arbitrage]]. The decision removes the incentive to US manufacturers of shifting manufacturing abroad purely in an attempt to circumvent the first-sale doctrine.

==Exceptions==

===Record rentals===
The Record Rental Amendment of 1984, codified in 17 USC §109(b) prohibits an owner of a phonorecord that embodies a sound recording or musical work from renting it to the public for direct or indirect commercial advantage. This exception was designed to prevent music stores from renting records and thereby facilitating home copying.

Section 109(b) is an exception to the first sale doctrine, but it is limited in several ways. It applies only to rentals, and not to resale or other transfers.  It is also limited to a subset of sound recordings—only those sound recordings that contain only a musical work.  It does not apply to sound recordings that contain other content, such as commentaries or dialog soundtrack, or to non-musical sound recordings, for example [[audiobook]]s. Lastly, libraries and educational institutions are exempt from this restriction, and may rent or loan musical sound recordings.

===Software rentals===
The Copyright Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990 amended §109(b) further to prohibit rentals of computer software for direct or indirect commercial advantage. The exception does not apply to lending of a copy by a nonprofit library for nonprofit purposes, provided the library affixes an appropriate warning. The amendment also specifically excluded:
* A computer program which is embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of the machine or product; or
* A computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with a [[Video game console|limited purpose computer that is designed for playing video games]] and may be designed for other purposes.

==Application in trademark law==
With reference to trade in tangible merchandise, such as the retailing of goods bearing a trademark, the first sale doctrine serves to immunize a reseller from infringement liability. Such protection to the reseller extends to the point where said goods have not been altered so as to be materially different from those originating from the trademark owner.

The first block is a unit block and the dashed line represents the [[#Infinite geometric series|infinite sum]] of the sequence, a number that it will forever approach but never touch: 2, 3/2, and 4/3 respectively.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''geometric progression''', also known as a '''geometric sequence''', is a [[sequence]] of [[number]]s where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the ''common ratio''. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.

Examples of a geometric sequence are [[exponentiation|powers]] ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of a fixed number ''r'', such as [[power of two|2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;]] and 3&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. The general form of a geometric sequence is

:&lt;math&gt;a,\ ar,\ ar^2,\ ar^3,\ ar^4,\ \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' ≠ 0 is the common ratio and ''a'' is a [[scale factor]], equal to the sequence's start value.

==Elementary properties==
The ''n''-th term of a geometric sequence with initial value ''a'' and common ratio ''r'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = a\,r^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Such a geometric sequence also follows the [[recursive relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = r\,a_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; for every integer &lt;math&gt;n\geq 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, to check whether a given sequence is geometric, one simply checks whether successive entries in the sequence all have the same ratio.

The common ratio of a geometric sequence may be negative, resulting in an alternating sequence, with numbers switching from positive to negative and back. For instance
:1, −3, 9, −27, 81, −243, ...
is a geometric sequence with common ratio −3.

The behaviour of a geometric sequence depends on the value of the common ratio.&lt;br /&gt;
If the common ratio is:
* Positive, the terms will all be the same sign as the initial term.
* Negative, the terms will alternate between positive and negative.
* Greater than 1, there will be [[exponential growth]] towards [[extended real number line|positive or negative infinity]] (depending on the sign of the initial term).
* 1, the progression is a [[constant function|constant]] sequence.
* Between −1 and 1 but not zero, there will be [[exponential decay]] towards zero.
* −1, the progression is an alternating sequence
* Less than −1, for the absolute values there is exponential growth towards [[point at infinity|(unsigned) infinity]], due to the alternating sign.

Geometric sequences (with common ratio not equal to −1, 1 or 0) show exponential growth or exponential decay, as opposed to the [[linear function (calculus)|linear]] growth (or decline) of an [[arithmetic progression]] such as 4, 15, 26, 37, 48, … (with common ''difference'' 11). This result was taken by [[Thomas Robert Malthus|T.R. Malthus]] as the mathematical foundation of his ''Principle of Population''.
Note that the two kinds of progression are related: exponentiating each term of an arithmetic progression yields a geometric progression, while taking the [[logarithm]] of each term in a geometric progression with a positive common ratio yields an arithmetic progression.

An interesting result of the definition of a geometric progression is that for any value of the common ratio, any three consecutive terms ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' will satisfy the following equation:

::&lt;math&gt;b^2=ac&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is considered to be the ''geometric mean'' between ''a'' and ''c''.

Computation of the sum 2 + 10 + 50 + 250. The sequence is multiplied term by term by 5, and then subtracted from the original sequence. Two terms remain: the first term, ''a'', and the term one beyond the last, or ''ar''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. The desired result, 312, is found by subtracting these two terms and dividing by 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
A '''geometric series''' is the [[Summation|sum]] of the numbers in a geometric progression. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;2 + 10 + 50 + 250 = 2 + 2 \times 5 + 2 \times 5^2 + 2 \times 5^3. &lt;/math&gt;

Letting ''a'' be the first term (here 2), n be the number of terms (here 4), and ''r'' be the constant that each term is multiplied by to get the next term (here 5), the sum is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;

In the example above, this gives:

:&lt;math&gt;2 + 10 + 50 + 250 = \frac{2(1-5^4)}{1-5} = \frac{-1248}{-4} = 312.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula works for any real numbers ''a'' and ''r'' (except ''r'' = 1, which results in a division by zero). For example:
:&lt;math&gt;-2\pi + 4\pi^2 - 8\pi^3 = -2\pi + (-2\pi)^2 + (-2\pi)^3 = \frac{-2\pi(1 - (-2\pi)^3)}{1-(-2\pi)} = \frac{-2\pi(1 + 8\pi^3)}{1+2\pi} \approx -214.855. &lt;/math&gt;
Since the derivation (below) does not depend on ''a'' and ''r'' being real, it holds for complex numbers as well.

===Derivation===

To derive this formula, first write a general geometric series as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n} ar^{k-1} = ar^0+ar^1+ar^2+ar^3+\cdots+ar^{n-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

We can find a simpler formula for this sum by multiplying both sides
of the above equation by 1 − ''r'', and we'll see that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(1-r) \sum_{k=1}^{n} ar^{k-1} &amp; = (1-r)(ar^0 + ar^1+ar^2+ar^3+\cdots+ar^{n-1}) \\
 &amp; = ar^0 + ar^1+ar^2+ar^3+\cdots+ar^{n-1} - ar^1-ar^2-ar^3-\cdots-ar^{n-1} - ar^n \\
 &amp; = a - ar^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

since all the other terms cancel. If ''r'' ≠ 1, we can rearrange the above to get the convenient formula for a geometric series that computes the sum of n terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n} ar^{k-1} = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Related formulas===

If one were to begin the sum not from k=1, but from a different value, say ''m'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=m}^n ar^k=\frac{a(r^m-r^{n+1})}{1-r},&lt;/math&gt;
provided &lt;math&gt;r \neq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a(n-m+1)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[derivative|Differentiating]] this formula with respect to ''r'' allows us to arrive at formulae for sums of the form

:&lt;math&gt;G_s(n, r) := \sum_{k=0}^n k^s r^k.&lt;/math&gt;

For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\sum_{k=0}^nr^k = \sum_{k=1}^n kr^{k-1}=
\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{(1-r)^2}-\frac{(n+1)r^n}{1-r}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a geometric series containing only even powers of ''r'' multiply by &amp;nbsp;1 &amp;minus; ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; :

:&lt;math&gt;(1-r^2) \sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^{2k} = a-ar^{2n+2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^{2k} = \frac{a(1-r^{2n+2})}{1-r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, take &amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; as the common ratio and use the standard formulation.

For a series with only odd powers of ''r''

:&lt;math&gt;(1-r^2) \sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^{2k+1} = ar-ar^{2n+3}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^{2k+1} = \frac{ar(1-r^{2n+2})}{1-r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

An exact formula for the generalized sum &lt;math&gt;G_s(n, r)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;s \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is expanded by the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]] as &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set Partitions: Stirling Numbers|url=https://dlmf.nist.gov/26.8|website=Digital Library of Mathematical Functions|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_s(n, r) = \sum_{j=0}^s \left\lbrace{s \atop j}\right\rbrace x^j \frac{d^j}{dx^j}\left[\frac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

===Infinite geometric series===
{{offtopic|Geometric series|discuss=Talk:Geometric progression#Merger proposal|date=February 2014}}
{{main|Geometric series}}
An '''infinite geometric series''' is an [[infinite series]] whose successive terms have a common ratio. Such a series converges [[if and only if]] the [[absolute value]] of the common ratio is less than one ({{abs|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1). Its value can then be computed from the finite sum formula

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^k = \lim_{n\to\infty}{\sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^k} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a(1-r^{n+1})}{1-r}= \frac{a}{1-r} - \lim_{n\to\infty}{\frac{ar^{n+1}}{1-r}} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Geometric progression.gif|thumb|350px|Animation, showing convergence of partial sums of geometric progression &lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n}q^k&lt;/math&gt; (red line) to its sum &lt;math&gt;{1\over 1-q}&lt;/math&gt; (blue line) for &lt;math&gt;|q|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[Image:Geometric progression convergence diagram.svg|thumb|350px|Diagram showing the geometric series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ⋯ which converges to 2.]]

Since:
:&lt;math&gt; r^{n+1} \to 0 \mbox{ as } n \to \infty \mbox{ when } |r| &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^k = \frac{a}{1-r} - 0 = \frac{a}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;

For a series containing only even powers of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^{2k} = \frac{a}{1-r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and for odd powers only,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^{2k+1} = \frac{ar}{1-r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In cases where the sum does not start at ''k'' = 0,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=m}^\infty ar^k=\frac{ar^m}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;
The formulae given above are valid only for {{abs|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. The latter formula is valid in every [[Banach algebra]], as long as the norm of ''r'' is less than one, and also in the field of [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic numbers]] if {{abs|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. As in the case for a finite sum, we can differentiate to calculate formulae for related sums.
For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = \sum_{k=1}^\infty kr^{k-1}=
\frac{1}{(1-r)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This formula only works for {{abs|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 as well. From this, it follows that, for {{abs|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k r^k = \frac{r}{\left(1-r\right)^2} \,;\, \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k^2 r^k = \frac{r \left( 1+r \right)}{\left(1-r\right)^3} \, ; \, \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k^3 r^k = \frac{r \left( 1+4 r + r^2\right)}{\left( 1-r\right)^4}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the infinite series [[1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ⋯]] is an elementary example of a series that [[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]].

It is a [[geometric series]] whose first term is 1/2 and whose common ratio is 1/2, so its sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots=\frac{1/2}{1-(+1/2)} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of the above series is [[1/2 − 1/4 + 1/8 − 1/16 + ⋯]] is a simple example of an [[alternating series]] that converges absolutely.

It is a [[geometric series]] whose first term is 1/2 and whose common ratio is −1/2, so its sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac12-\frac14+\frac18-\frac{1}{16}+\cdots=\frac{1/2}{1-(-1/2)} = \frac13.&lt;/math&gt;

===Complex numbers===
The summation formula for geometric series remains valid even when the common ratio is a [[complex number]]. In this case the condition that the absolute value of ''r'' be less than 1 becomes that the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|modulus]] of ''r'' be less than 1. It is possible to calculate the sums of some non-obvious geometric series. For example, consider the proposition

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(kx)}{r^k} = \frac{r \sin(x)}{1 + r^2 - 2 r \cos(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

The proof of this comes from the fact that
: &lt;math&gt;\sin(kx) = \frac{e^{ikx} - e^{-ikx}}{2i} , &lt;/math&gt;
which is a consequence of [[Euler's formula]]. Substituting this into the original series gives
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(kx)}{r^k} = \frac{1}{2 i} \left[ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{e^{ix}}{r} \right)^k - \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{e^{-ix}}{r}\right)^k\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

This is the difference of two geometric series, and so it is a straightforward application of the formula for infinite geometric series that completes the proof.

==Product==
The product of a geometric progression is the product of all terms. If all terms are positive, then it can be quickly computed by taking the [[geometric mean]] of the progression's first and last term, and raising that mean to the power given by the number of terms. (This is very similar to the formula for the sum of terms of an [[arithmetic sequence]]: take the [[arithmetic mean]] of the first and last term and multiply with the number of terms.)

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=0}^{n} ar^i = \left( \sqrt{a_0 \cdot a_{n}}\right)^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;a,r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;).

Proof:

Let the product be represented by P:

:&lt;math&gt;P=a \cdot ar \cdot ar^2 \cdots ar^{n-1} \cdot ar^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, carrying out the multiplications, we conclude that

:&lt;math&gt;P=a^{n+1} r^{1+2+3+ \cdots +(n-1)+(n)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Applying the sum of [[arithmetic series]], the expression will yield

:&lt;math&gt;P=a^{n+1} r^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;P=(ar^{\frac{n}{2}})^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

We raise both sides to the second power:

:&lt;math&gt;P^2=(a^2 r^{n})^{n+1}=(a\cdot ar^n)^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;P^2=(a_0 \cdot a_{n})^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;P=(a_0 \cdot a_{n})^{\frac{n+1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;,

which concludes the proof.

M. (1980). Attributional bias among aggressive boys to interpret unambiguous social stimuli as displays of hostility.

''Child Development'', 162-170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dodge, K. A. (2006). Translational science in action: Hostile attributional style and the development of aggressive behavior problems. ''Development and Psychopathology'', ''18''(03), 791-814.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person with high levels of hostile attribution bias might see two people laughing and immediately interpret this behavior as two people laughing about him/her, even though the behavior was ambiguous and may have been benign.

The term "hostile attribution bias" was first coined in 1980 by Nasby, Hayden, and DePaulo who noticed, along with several other key pioneers in this research area (e.g., [[Kenneth A. Dodge]]), that a subgroup of children tend to attribute hostile intent to ambiguous social situations more often than other children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since then, hostile attribution bias has been conceptualized as a bias of [[Social information processing (cognition)|social information processing]] (similar to other [[attribution bias]]es), including the way individuals perceive, interpret, and select responses to situations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dodge, K. A. (1986). A social information processing model of social competence in children. In M. Perlmutter (Ed.), ''The Minnesota Symposium on Child Psychology: Vol. 18.'' Cognitive perspectives on children's social and behavioral development (pp. 77-125). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1994). A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment.''Psychological Bulletin'', ''115''(1), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; While occasional hostile attribution bias is normative (particularly for younger children), researchers have found that individuals who exhibit consistent and high levels of hostile attribution bias across development are much more likely to engage in aggressive behavior (e.g., hitting/fighting, reacting violently, verbal or [[relational aggression]]) toward others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;De Castro, B. O., Veerman, J. W., Koops, W., Bosch, J. D., &amp; Monshouwer, H. J. (2002). Hostile attribution of intent and aggressive behavior: A meta-analysis. ''Child Development'', 916-934.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, hostile attribution bias is hypothesized to be one important pathway through which other risk factors, such as peer rejection or harsh parenting behavior, lead to [[aggression]]. For example, children exposed to peer teasing at school or child abuse at home are much more likely to develop high levels of hostile attribution bias, which then lead them to behave aggressively at school and/or at home. Thus, in addition to partially explaining one way aggression develops, hostile attribution bias also represents a target for the intervention and prevention of aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
The term hostile attribution bias first emerged in 1980 when researchers began noticing that some children, particularly aggressive and/or rejected children, tended to interpret social situations differently compared to other children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, Nasby and colleagues presented photographs of people to a group of aggressive adolescent boys (aged 10–16) and observed that a subgroup of these youth exhibited a consistent tendency to attribute hostile intent to the photographs, even when the cues were ambiguous or benign.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, [[Kenneth A. Dodge]] and colleagues conducted a study on a sample of school-aged children between 3rd–5th grade and found that children who were rejected were much more likely than other children to exhibit hostile attributions of intent to ambiguous social situations (e.g., when a behavior could have been either accidental or intentional).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, Dodge and colleagues found that children with high hostile attribution bias then went on to exhibit the most aggressive behaviors later on.

Early studies investigating links between hostile attribution bias and aggression were somewhat mixed, with some studies reporting no significant effects&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, K. A., Lochman, J. E., Harnish, J. D., Bates, J. E., &amp; Pettit, G. S. (1997). Reactive and proactive aggression in school children and psychiatrically impaired chronically assaultive youth. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', ''106''(1), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthys, W., Cuperus, J. M., &amp; Van Engeland, H. (1999). Deficient social problem-solving in boys with ODD/CD, with ADHD, and with both disorders.''Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry'', ''38''(3), 311-321.&lt;/ref&gt; or small effects&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and other studies reporting large effects.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S., Hudley, C., &amp; Williams, E. (1992). Attributional and emotional determinants of aggression among African-American and Latino young adolescents. ''Developmental Psychology'', ''28''(4), 731.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, I. D. (1996). Aggressive boys' hostile perceptual and response biases: The role of attention and impulsivity. ''Child Development'', ''67''(3), 1015-1033.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, over 100 studies and a [[meta-analysis]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; have documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior across various samples ranging in age, gender, race, countries, and clinical populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Theoretical formulation ==
Hostile attribution bias is typically conceptualized within a [[Social information processing (cognition)|social information processing]] framework, in which social information (e.g., during an interaction) is processed in a series of steps that leads to a behavioral reaction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Accurate social information processing requires a person to engage in six steps that occur in order.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrov, J. M., &amp; Godleski, S. A. (2010). Toward an integrated gender-linked model of aggression subtypes in early and middle childhood. ''Psychological Review'', ''117''(1), 233.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Step 1'': Accurately encode information in the brain and store it in short term memory. During this step, an individual will pay attention to and code specific stimuli/cues in their environment, including external factors (e.g., someone bumping into you; other people's reactions to the situation) and internal factors (e.g., your affective reaction to the situation). 
* ''Step 2'': Accurately interpret or give meaning to encoded information. During this step, an individual may decide if a behavior or situation was meant to be hostile or benign. 
* ''Step 3'': Decide a goal for the interaction
* ''Step 4'': Generate potential responses
* ''Step 5'': Evaluate potential responses and select the "optimal" response
* ''Step 6'': Enact chosen response
Hostile attribution bias is theorized to result from deviations in any of these steps,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; including paying attention to and encoding biased information (e.g., only paying attention to cues suggestive of hostility), biases toward negative interpretations of social interactions (e.g., more likely to interpret situation as hostile), limited ability to generate a broad range of potential responses, and difficulty appropriately evaluating responses and selecting an optimal response. Furthermore, biases in any of the steps affect the rest of the steps.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hostile attribution bias has been particularly linked to step 2 of social information processing (i.e., interpretation of information), but is linked to impairments in other steps as well, including inaccurate perception/encoding of social situations and problems with generating a broad range of potential behavioral responses.  For example, a child with high levels of hostile attribution bias may generate fewer potential responses than other children, and these responses may be limited to hostile or ineffective responses to a situation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, B. A., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1982). Social maladjustment and problem solving in school-aged children. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'',''50''(2), 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge theorized that hostile attribution bias arises from an individual's hostile [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] about the world that are formed through an interaction between a child's neural dispositions and his/her early exposures to hostile socialization experiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These experiences may include disrupted parental [[Attachment theory|attachment]], [[child abuse]], exposure to family violence, peer rejection or victimization, and community violence.

== Measurement ==

In research settings, hostile attribution bias is typically measured with a laboratory task, in which participants are presented with staged interaction (live actors), video, picture, audio, or written presentations of ambiguous social situations. For example, an ambiguous social situation presented might be a video of a child opening a door, causing the door to knock over a tower of toys that another child was building. After the stimulus is presented, participants would be asked to make attributions about the intent of the actor (i.e., hostile vs. benign). (For example: "''Do you think the girl who opened the door was trying to be mean, nice, or could have been mean or nice?''"). Multiple trials are administered with various ambiguous scenarios, and these attributions are then used by the researchers to determine the level of the child's hostile attribution bias. Careful selection of stimuli and comparison of stimuli across mediums is helpful for accurately assessing an individual's level of hostile attribution bias. A [[meta-analysis]] investigating the link between hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior found that the strongest effect sizes were linked with actual staging of social interactions, followed by audio presentation of stimuli, then video and picture presentation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Implications ==
===Aggression===

Substantial literature has documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and [[aggression]] in youth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Hostile attribution bias is traditionally associated with overt physical aggression (e.g., hitting, fighting), such that higher levels of hostile attribution bias predict more aggressive behavior. In particular, much evidence suggests that hostile attribution bias is especially linked to "reactive aggression" (i.e., impulsive and "hot-blooded" aggression that reflects an angry retaliation to perceived provocation) rather than "proactive aggression" (i.e., unprovoked, planned/instrumental, or "cold-blooded" aggression).&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1996). Social information‐processing mechanisms in reactive and proactive aggression. ''Child Development'', ''67''(3), 993-1002.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond physical aggression, elevated hostile attribution bias is also associated with increased use of [[relational aggression]] (e.g., gossip, spreading rumors, social exclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R. (1996). The role of overt aggression, relational aggression, and prosocial behavior in the prediction of children's future social adjustment. ''Child Development'', ''67''(5), 2317-2327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., Grotpeter, J. K., &amp; Bigbee, M. A. (2002). Relationally and physically aggressive children's intent attributions and feelings of distress for relational and instrumental peer provocations. ''Child Development'', ''73''(4), 1134-1142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Werner, N. E. (1998). Response decision processes in relational and overt aggression. ''Child Development'', 1630-1639.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, N. E. (2012). Do hostile attribution biases in children and parents predict relationally aggressive behavior?. ''The Journal of Genetic Psychology'',''173''(3), 221-245.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly the case when youth attribute hostile intent to ambiguous relational situations (e.g., not receiving an invitation to a party or not receiving a response to a text).&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, C. A., &amp; Ostrov, J. M. (2008). Differentiating forms and functions of aggression in emerging adults: Associations with hostile attribution biases and normative beliefs. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence'', ''37''(6), 713-722.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative adult outcomes===

Hostile attribution bias has also been documented in adult populations, and adults with high levels of hostile attribution bias are over 4 times more likely to die by the age of 50 than adults with low levels of hostile attribution bias.&lt;ref&gt;Barefoot, J. C., Dodge, K. A., Peterson, B. L., Dahlstrom, W. G., &amp; Williams Jr, R. B. (1989). The Cook-Medley hostility scale: item content and ability to predict survival. ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', ''51''(1), 46-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Hostile attribution bias is particularly linked to relational problems in adulthood, including marital conflict/violence&lt;ref&gt;Holtzworth-Munroe, A., &amp; Hutchinson, G. (1993). Attributing negative intent to wife behavior: the attributions of maritally violent versus nonviolent men.''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', ''102''(2), 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and marital/relationship dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, T. N., &amp; Fincham, F. D. (1990). Attributions in marriage: review and critique. ''Psychological Bulletin'', ''107''(1), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, parents with high levels of hostile attribution bias are also much more likely to use harsh discipline and aggressive parenting,&lt;ref&gt;MacBrayer, E. K., Milich, R., &amp; Hundley, M. (2003). Attributional biases in aggressive children and their mothers. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', ''112''(4), 698.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nix, R. L., Pinderhughes, E. E., Dodge, K. A., Bates, J. E., Pettit, G. S., &amp; McFadyen-Ketchum, S. A. (1999). The relation between mothers' hostile attribution tendencies and children's externalizing behavior problems: The mediating role of mothers' harsh discipline practices. ''Child Development'', 896-909.&lt;/ref&gt; which may further contribute to the intergenerational continuity in hostile attribution bias and aggression across time.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, L. J., Appleyard, K., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (2011). Intergenerational continuity in child maltreatment: Mediating mechanisms and implications for prevention.''Child Development'', ''82''(1), 162-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical implications for intervention===

Hostile attribution bias has been tested as a malleable target for intervention for aggressive behaviors in youth, including in [[Cognitive restructuring|cognitive interventions]] designed to increase accurate identification of others intentions and attribution of benign intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Guerra, N. G., &amp; Slaby, R. G. (1990). Cognitive mediators of aggression in adolescent offenders: II. Intervention. ''Developmental Psychology'', ''26''(2), 269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudley, C., &amp; Graham, S. (1993). An attributional intervention to reduce peer‐directed aggression among African‐American boys. ''Child Development'', ''64''(1), 124-138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukhodolsky, D. G., Golub, A., Stone, E. C., &amp; Orban, L. (2006). Dismantling anger control training for children: A randomized pilot study of social problem-solving versus social skills training components. ''Behavior Therapy'', ''36''(1), 15-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Relative success has been documented from these interventions in changing levels of hostile attribution bias, although actual enduring changes in aggressive behavior have been modest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Kortunefookie receipt.jpg|thumb|Printed receipt obtained from the kortunefookie]]
'''Kortunefookie''' is an interactive [[public art]] project, a large scale {{convert|4|ft|0|sing=on}} high [[fortune cookie]] made of red cedar, which grants users a printed fortune with a simple touch of a button; Kortunefookie’s social network creates the fortunes via the project's Web site. Inspired by the idea of the fortune cookie, the project was created to permit different users to share their thoughts and create a new kind of social ties. It is an [[interactive kiosk]] that issues short texts written by anonymous users on the Kortunefookie website that resemble the messages found in the [[fortune cookies]], but each fortune from the Kortunefookie is different, unlike mass-produced fortunes in regular fortune cookies. Kortunefookie's Web site suggest users to send an innermost secret, a smarmiest wisecrack, a private prayer, or an outlandish prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnightpoutine.ca/arts/2009/07/kortunefookie-_get_your_fix/ |title=Kortunefookie- get your fix |publisher=Midnightpoutine.ca |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kortunefookie has two parts: one that utilizes the [[Web 2.0]] to gather the texts from the public, and the other that consists of an interactive [[installation art|sculptural installation]] (the interactive kiosk). The fortunes are submitted by the public via the project’s website then stored into an [[XML]] database. Once moderated, these texts are uploaded on the computer's custom application housed inside the interactive wooden kiosk. This sculptural kiosk is weather proof and designed to be installed just about anywhere outdoors. Anyone visiting the on-site interactive sculpture can push a button and receive a small paper that contains a printed original message. These fortunes are printed using a thermal [[receipt printer]], a type of paper that resembles a retail [[receipt]].

== History ==
Created in 2008 as part of a research creation project funded by the [[Université du Québec en Outaouais|University of Quebec in Outaouais]], the creative team included professor Jean-François Lacombe from the Multidisciplinary Image School and Christian Desjardins, his research assistant and student at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jflacombe.com/ |title=Site de Jean-François Lacombe_auteur, créateur multidisciplinaire et designer graphique qui s'intéresse aux lieux du projet ainsi qu'aux nouvelles formes de communications génératrices de liens sociaux. &amp;#124; S27 |publisher=Jflacombe.com |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project's ambition was to allow different users to interact and post messages on the public realm. From the beginning, the endeavour intended to be a [[multidisciplinary]] creation that would act both as an art installation and as an interactive medium to communicate. A challenge for the team was to render the complex technology used invisible, letting the experience generated by the device dominate (as describe by [[John Maeda]], in his book The Laws of Simplicity, MIT Press, 2006). As the team wanted a seamless operation and to facilitate the use of the interactive sculpture, a familiar image had to be associated to the new device. After a period of research and development, the team came up with the idea to utilize the image of the fortune cookies.

=== Construction and programming ===
[[File:Kortunefookie open.jpg|thumb|right|Insides of the interactive kiosk.]]
[[File:Kortunefookie team.gif|thumb|right|Kortunefookie's founding team at work]]
Shortly after finalizing the usage design, the construction of the interactive kiosk prototype and then development of the application began simultaneously. The prototype was made with slabs of pink [[Styrofoam]] that measured one and a half inches thick. Once the desired form and scale had been achieved, the model was dismantled so that each Styrofoam layer could be reproduced in wood in the same dimensions. It was then just a matter of assembling all the layers of wood to form the hollow sculpture. Francis Boivin, then a visual arts student at the University of Quebec in Outaouais, greatly contributed to the making of the wooden sculpture. The final fortune cookie sculpture is made entirely from salvaged [[Thuja plicata|Western red cedar]] logs that were once telephone poles. 
[[File:Kortunefookie decoupe.jpg|thumb|Kortunefookie's styrofoam prototype]]
The customized application that prints the fortune was built on a [[Mac Mini]] (1.83&amp;nbsp;GHz Core 2 Duo/1GB/80GB/Combo) with the programming interface [[Cocoa (API)]] and development tools [[Apple Xcode]] and Interface Builder. It was mainly programmed by Justin McKillican. Lastly, speakers were installed inside the fortune cookie so that a 10-second synthesized melody could be heard each time the button was pressed. This also allowed to manage the intervals between each text so that it was impossible for a continuous cascade of paper to be printed.

Finally, using the [[Content management system|CMS]] [[SPIP]], the Web site was conceived to act both as a promotional tool as well as the text collecting interface. In this project, the Web was the obvious “drop point” for messages as it allowed anyone anywhere to participate in the creation of the fortunes. It also permits for the sent messages to be filtered out. Specifically those that were distasteful, promotional, or aimed at specific individuals.

Statistics for the texts so far are:
*French texts received: 641+
*English texts received: 1,312+
*Texts printed: 22,000+

=== Etymology ===
[[File:Kortunefookie toronto.jpg|thumb|Exhibit at La Scotiabank Nuit Blanche, Toronto 2010.]]
For its first showing at the Arts Under The Bridge Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://dumboartsfestival.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Dumbo Arts Festival |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City (organized by [[Brooklyn]] artist-run centre DAC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dumboartscenter.org/&lt;/ref&gt;), the project was entitled SensGoodKarma. However, this title restricted the editorial line as well as the public’s scope for intervention. Several brainstorming sessions to find a new name proved fruitless until, one evening in 2009, Chris Zeke Hand exclaimed,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeke.com/tag/kortunefookie/ |title=KortuneFookie |publisher=zeke.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; “''Kortunefookie!''”, inspiring the permanent name of the project.

=== Credits and funding ===
Main collaborators for the project include Christian Desjardins, Justin McKillican and Francis Boivin. Funding provided by the institutional fund for research creation development (FIRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uqo.ca/recherche/fonds-fir.asp |title=Erreur 404 - Page non trouvée |date=2007-09-21 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book about the project, called ''Kortunefookie, tale of an interactive cookie'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librairieartactuel.org/product_info.php?products_id=870&amp;osCsid=03bd2d7faa15cc3f084d59303d7d1ba4 |title=Librairie Formats: KortuneFookie.com |publisher=Librairieartactuel.org |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been published in summer 2011. Limited to 100 numbered editions, this publication includes texts, photographs, and illustrations by Jean-François Lacombe, François Chalifour, Christian Desjardins, Mamoru Kobayakawa, and Marie-Hélène Leblanc.&lt;ref&gt;''KortuneFookie.com: tale of an interactive cookie'' by Jean-François Lacombe, François Chalifour, 2011. {{ISBN|978-2-9812661-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives and critical perspective ==
The objective of the project, as stated by its creator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jflacombe.com/?p=1526 |title=Quelle image les gens se font-ils de la ville? &amp;#124; S27 |publisher=Jflacombe.com |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the establishment of a communication tool that would act as an ''intermediary'' between the public’s imagination and that of its users. Kortunefookie was a kind of a contemporary [[divination]] device, allowing thousands of users to share and come in contact with an intimate thought of someone else. This necessity for communication, or the intimacy of communication as proposed by Kortunefookie,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; is reiterated by François Chalifour :&lt;br /&gt;
«Isolation is unattractive, it bothers us. It holds up traffic. To correct the situation, we must fill the space that separates things, beings. Communication, for as long as it has existed, has proved to be a privileged means of closing this chasm: attract attention, open the channels of communication, exchange the message. In all sorts of ways, Lacombe’s odd-looking box, lying by the side of the road outside an art gallery, speaks to us of a trend whose results remain, to this day, ambiguous. Have we bridged the gap, have we filled the void, have we crossed the gulf that separates us? Jean-François Lacombe is working on it.»

'''Kristján Guðmundsson''' (born 1941, [[Snæfellsnes]], [[Iceland]]) is a contemporary [[Iceland]]ic conceptual artist.&lt;ref&gt;Galerie Anhava, Kristján Guðmundsson, [http://www.anhava.com/ CV], retrieved July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career as an artist in the 1960s as a member of ''SÚM'' - a group of young artists influenced by then-new currents in conceptual and installation art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.artnews.is/artnews_article.php?no=23_11&amp;is=23|title=Kristján Guðmundsson Makes More with Less|accessdate = 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived in the [[Netherlands]] in the 1970s where he received a Dutch stipend. There he came into more direct contact with the international avant-garde. In 1977, he was one of four Icelanders invited to exhibit in the new-opened [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, France. He moved back to Iceland in 1979.

Kristján's art reflects both prevailing traditions in late 20th century western art in general, and the dominance of [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art]] in the post-war [[art of Iceland]] in particular. He has said, "I am trying to work within the field of tension that exists between nothing and something".

In 1982 he represented Iceland at the [[Venice Biennale]]. 1993 he was one of three winners of the [[Prince Eugen Medal]] conferred by the King of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalcourt.se/download/18.30963a1811be3fda3ab80008195/Prins+Eugen-medaljen+1945-2010.pdf| title= Prins Eugan Medaljen|accessdate = 14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he was the first Icelandic winner who got the Swedish [[Carnegie Art Award]], worth [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 1,000,000.

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

The '''live streaming of crimes''' is a phenomenon arising in the 2010s in which criminals deliberately commit crimes while [[live stream]]ing the act on [[social media]]. Due to the act being published to social media for others to see, it is often impossible to protect the privacy of the victims of these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Live-streaming crime How will Facebook Live and Periscope challenge US privacy law? |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160803140150.htm |access-date=27 January 2017 |work=[[Science Daily]] |date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

In April 2016, Marina Lonina (18) and Raymond Gates (29) were arrested in Ohio on charges that Gates raped an underage friend of Marina's while Lonina [[live-streamed]] the crime on [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]].&lt;ref name="McPhteLive"&gt;{{cite news

By May ''[[The New York Times]]'' was including the Ohio Periscope rape as one of a series of recent cases in which crimes were live streamed, including one in which a young woman in [[Égly]], France speaks via Periscope about her distress and suicidal thoughts and is apparently encouraged by viewers to kill herself, which she does by throwing herself under a train, and the case of two teenagers who live stream themselves bragging and laughing as they beat up a drunken man in a bar in [[Bordeaux, France]].&lt;ref name="Blaise"&gt;{{cite news

{{Global surveillance}}

'''Mass surveillance''' is the intricate [[surveillance]] of an entire or a substantial fraction of a population in order to monitor that group of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mass Surveillance |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/52 |publisher=Privacy International |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surveillance is often carried out by [[Convenience store|local]] and federal governments or [[intelligence agency|governmental organisations]], such as organizations like the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], but it may also be carried out by corporations (either on behalf of governments or at their own initiative). Depending on each nation's laws and judicial systems, the legality of and the permission required to engage in mass surveillance varies. It is the single most indicative distinguishing trait of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]]. It is also often distinguished from [[targeted surveillance]].

Mass surveillance has often been cited as necessary to fight [[terrorism]], prevent [[crime]] and [[social unrest]], protect [[national security]], and control the population. Conversely, mass surveillance has equally often been criticized for violating [[privacy]] rights, limiting [[Civil and political rights|civil and political rights and freedoms]], and being illegal under some legal or constitutional systems. Another criticism is that increasing mass surveillance could lead to the development of a [[#Surveillance state|surveillance state]] or an [[#Electronic police state|electronic police state]] where civil liberties are infringed or political dissent is undermined by [[COINTELPRO]]-like programs. Such a state could be referred to as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]].

In 2013, the practice of mass surveillance by world&lt;ref&gt;

==By country==
[[Privacy International]]'s 2007 survey, covering 47 countries, indicated that there had been an increase in surveillance and a decline in the performance of privacy safeguards, compared to the previous year. Balancing these factors, eight countries were rated as being 'endemic surveillance societies'. Of these eight, [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Russia]] scored lowest, followed jointly by [[Singapore]] and the [[United Kingdom]], then jointly by [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]]. The best ranking was given to [[Greece]], which was judged to have 'adequate safeguards against abuse'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/reports/surveillance-monitor-2007-international-country-rankings |title=Surveillance Monitor 2007 - International country rankings |publisher=[[Privacy International]] |date=28 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries throughout the world have already been adding thousands of surveillance cameras to their urban, suburban and even rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=9662 |title=Police Surveillance: Go Snoop, Yourself |author=Tom Steinert-Threlkeld |publisher=ZDNet |date=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yougov1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yougov.co.uk/extranets/ygarchives/content/pdf/TEL060101024_3.pdf |title=YouGov / Daily Telegraph Survey Results |year=2006 |publisher=YouGov |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in September 2007 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) stated that we are "in danger of tipping into a genuine surveillance society completely alien to American values" with "the potential for a dark future where our every move, our every transaction, our every communication is recorded, compiled, and stored away, ready to be examined and used against us by the authorities whenever they want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/why-surveillance-society-clock |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |title= Why a Surveillance Society Clock? |date=4 September 2007 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2013, [[Reporters Without Borders]] published a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''. The report included a list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Five countries were placed on the initial list: [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831072750/http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ |date=31 August 2013 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahrain===
[[Bahrain]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. The level of Internet filtering and surveillance in Bahrain is one of the highest in the world. The royal family is represented in all areas of Internet management and has sophisticated tools at its disposal for spying on its subjects. The online activities of dissidents and news providers are closely monitored and the surveillance is increasing.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

{{Main article|Mass surveillance in China}}
[[China]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. All Internet access in China is owned or controlled by the state or the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]. Many foreign journalists in China have said that they take for granted that their telephones are tapped and their email is monitored.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The tools put in place to filter and monitor the Internet are collectively known as the [[Great Firewall of China]]. Besides the usual routing regulations that allow access to an IP address or a particular domain name to be blocked, the Great Firewall makes large-scale use of [[Deep Packet Inspection]] (DPI) technology to monitor and block access based on keyword detection. The Great Firewall has the ability to dynamically block encrypted connections. One of the country's main ISPs, [[China Unicom]], automatically cuts a connection as soon as it is used to transmit encrypted content.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The monitoring system developed by China is not confined to the Great Firewall, monitoring is also built into social networks, chat services and VoIP. Private companies are directly responsible to the Chinese authorities for surveillance of their networks to ensure banned messages are not circulated. The QQ application, owned by the firm Tencent, allows the authorities to monitor in detail exchanges between Internet users by seeking certain keywords and expressions. The author of each message can be identified by his or her user number. The QQ application is effectively a giant Trojan horse. And since March 2012, new legislation requires all new users of micro-blogging sites to register using their own name and telephone number.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

[[Skype]], one of the world's most popular Internet telephone platforms, is closely monitored. Skype services in China are available through a local partner, the TOM media group. The Chinese-language version of Skype, known as [[TOM-Skype]], is slightly different from the downloadable versions in other countries. A report by [[OpenNet Initiative|OpenNet Initiative Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oni-asia.net/ ONI Asia], web site, OpenNet Initiative, retrieved 15 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; says everyday conversations are captured on servers. Interception and storage of a conversation may be triggered by a sender's or recipient's name or by keywords that occur in the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/breachingtrust.pdf "Breaching Trust: An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China's TOM-Skype platform"], Nart Villeneuve, Information Warfare Monitor and ONI Asia, 1 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that it had been the target of attacks by the Chinese government. The first breach took place on 13 September 2012 when the newspaper was preparing to publish an article about the fortune amassed by the family of outgoing Prime Minister [[Wen Jiabao]]. The newspaper said the purpose of attacks was to identify the sources that supplied the newspaper with information about corruption among the prime minister's entourage. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[CNN]]'' also said they had been the targets of cyber attacks from China. In February, [[Twitter]] disclosed that the accounts of some 250,000 subscribers had been the victims of attacks from China similar to those carried out on the ''New York Times''. Mandiant, the company engaged by the NYT to secure its network, identified the source of the attacks as a group of hackers it called Advanced Persistent Threat 1, a unit of the People's Liberation Army operating from a 12-story building in the suburbs of Shanghai that had hundreds, possibly thousands, of staff and the direct support of the Chinese government.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

===East Germany===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in East Germany}}
Before the Digital Revolution, one of the world's biggest mass surveillance operations was carried out by the [[Stasi]], the [[secret police]] of the former [[East Germany]]. By the time the state collapsed in 1989, the Stasi had built up an estimated civilian network of 300,000 informants (approximately one in fifty of the population), who monitored even minute hints of political dissent among other citizens. Many [[West Germany|West Germans]] visiting friends and family in East Germany were also subject to Stasi spying, as well as many high-ranking West German politicians and persons in the public eye.

Most East German citizens were well aware that their government was spying on them, which led to a culture of mistrust: touchy political issues were only discussed in the comfort of their own four walls and only with the closest of friends and family members, while widely maintaining a façade of unquestioning followership in public.

===European Union===
The right to [[privacy]] is a highly developed area of law in Europe. The [[Data Protection Directive]] regulates the processing of personal data within the [[European Union]]. For comparison, the US has no data protection law that is comparable to this; instead, the US regulates data protection on a sectoral basis.&lt;ref&gt;See Julia M. Fromholz, The European Union Data Privacy Directive, 15 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 471, 472 (2000); Dean William Harvey &amp; Amy White, The Impact of Computer Security Regulation on American Companies, 8 Tex. Wesleyan L. Rev. 505 (2002); Kamaal Zaidi, Harmonizing U.S.-EU Online Privacy Law: Toward a U.S. Comprehensive Regime For the Protection of Personal Data, 12 Mich.St. J. Int’l L. 169 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early 2012, the European Union has been working on a [[General Data Protection Regulation]] to replace the [[Data Protection Directive]] and harmonise data protection and privacy law. On 20 October 2013, a committee at the [[European Parliament]] backed the measure, which, if it is enacted, could require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|revelations about a far-reaching spying program]] by the [[U.S. National Security Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/international/eu-panel-backs-plan-to-shield-online-data.html "Rules Shielding Online Data From N.S.A. and Other Prying Eyes Advance in Europe"], James Kanter and Mike Scott, ''New York Times'', 21 October 2013. Retrieved 22 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; European Union justice and rights commissioner Viviane Reding said "The question has arisen whether the large-scale collection and processing of personal information under US surveillance programmes is necessary and proportionate to meet the interests of national security." The EU is also asking the US for changes to US legislation to match the legal redress offered in Europe; American citizens in Europe can go to the courts if they feel their rights are infringed but Europeans without right of residence in America cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Traynor|first=Ian|title=NSA surveillance: Europe threatens to freeze US data-sharing arrangements|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/nsa-surveillance-europe-threatens-freeze-us-data-sharing|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the EU / US arrangement to implement [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] were struck down by the European Court of Justice, a new framework for transatlantic data flows, called the "EU-US Privacy Shield", was adopted in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=EU Commission and United States agree on new framework for transatlantic data flows: EU-US Privacy Shield|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-216_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=2 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite press release|title=Restoring trust in transatlantic data flows through strong safeguards: European Commission presents EU-U.S. Privacy Shield|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-433_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 March 2016|date=29 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite press release|title=European Commission launches EU-U.S. Privacy Shield: stronger protection for transatlantic data flows|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2461_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 July 2016|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. and Europe in ‘Safe Harbor’ Data Deal, but Legal Fight May Await|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/technology/us-europe-safe-harbor-data-deal.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=New York Times|date=2 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Privacy Shield deal lets US tech firms transfer European customers' data again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/08/privacy-shield-data-transfer-us-european-union|accessdate=8 July 2016|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Privacy Shield forced US to be ‘transparent’ about intelligence agencies|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/privacy-shield-forced-us-to-be-transparent-about-intelligence-agencies/|work=EurActiv|accessdate=16 July 2016|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
[[Iran]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in naturally active efforts to news providers . The government runs or controls almost all of the country's institutions for regulating, managing or legislating on telecommunications. The Supreme Council for Cyberspace, which was headed by [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|President Ahmadinejad]], was established in March 2012 and now determines digital policy. The construction of a parallel "Iranian Internet", with a high connection speed but fully monitored and censored, is almost complete.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The tools used by the Iranian authorities to monitor and control the Internet include data interception tools capable of [[Deep Packet Inspection]]. Interception products from leading Chinese companies such as [[ZTE]] and [[Huawei]] are in use. The products provided by Huawei to [[Mobin Net]], the leading national provider of mobile broadband, can be used to analyze email content, track browsing history and block access to sites. The products that ZTA sold to the [[Telecommunication Company of Iran]] (TCI) offer similar services plus the possibility of monitoring the mobile network. European companies are the source of other spying and data analysis tools. Products designed by [[Ericsson]] and [[Nokia Solutions and Networks|Nokia Siemens Networks]] (later Trovicor) are in use. These companies sold [[Short Message Service|SMS]] interception and user location products to Mobile Communication Company of Iran and [[Irancell]], Iran's two biggest mobile phone companies, in 2009 and they were used to identify Iranian citizens during the [[2009–10 Iranian election protests|post-election uprising]] in 2009. The use of Israeli surveillance devices has also been detected in Iran. The network traffic management and surveillance device NetEnforcer was provided by Israel to Denmark and then resold to Iran. Similarly, US equipment has found its way to Iran via the Chinese company ZTE.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

===Mexico===
After struggling with drug trafficking and criminal groups for decades Mexico has been strengthening their military mass surveillance.

Mexico: Internal security, surveillance, and authoritarianism. Surveillance &amp; Society 15(3/4): 491-495.&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of these political beliefs may make it easier for mass surveillance to take spread within the country. "This does not necessarily mean the end of democratic institutions as a whole—such as free elections or the permanence of critical mass media—but it means strengthening the mechanisms for exercising power that exclude dialogue, transparency and social agreement."&lt;ref&gt;Arteaga, Nelson. 2017.

===North Korea===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in North Korea}}
Having attained the nickname ‘surveillance state’, North Korea's government has complete control over all forms of telecommunications and Internet.  It is routine to be sent to a prison camp for communicating with the outside world. The government enforces restrictions around the types of appliances North Koreans may own in their home, in case radio or TV sets pick up signals from nearby South Korea, China and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org.uk/north-korea-surveillance-state-prison-camp-internet-phone-technology&lt;/ref&gt; There is no attempt to mask the way this government actively spies on their citizens. In North Korea, an increasing number of citizens do have smartphones. However, these devices are heavily controlled and are being used to censor and observe everything North Koreans do on their phones. Reuters reported in 2015 that Koryolink, North Korea's official mobile phone network, has around 3 million subscribers in a country of 24 million. Obviously, in order to have digital data to draw from, the citizens must have access to phones and other things online.

===Russia===

[[Singapore]] is known as a city of sensors. Singapore's surveillance structure spreads widely from [[Closed-circuit television]] in public areas even around the neighbourhood, internet monitoring/ traffic monitoring and to the use of surveillance [[metadata]] for government initiatives. In [[Singapore]], SIM card registration is mandatory even for prepaid card. Singapore's government have the rights to access communication data. Singapore's largest telecompany, [[Singtel]], has close relations to the government and Singapore's laws are broadly phrased to allow the government to obtain sensitive data such as text-messages, email, call logs and web surfing history from its people without the need for court permission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-advanced-surveillance-state-citizens-mind&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation of mass surveillance cameras in [[Singapore]] is an effort to act as a deterrence not only for terror attacks&lt;ref name="more-surveillance"&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-surveillance-cameras-as-deterrent&lt;/ref&gt; but also for public security such as loan sharks, illegal parking and more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/network-of-cctv-cameras-proving-effective&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Singapore's [[Smart Nation]] initiative to build a network of sensors to collect and connect data from city life (including the citizen's movement), the Singapore government rolled out 1000 sensors ranging from computer chips to surveillance cameras,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/04/singapore-city-of-sensors/523392/&lt;/ref&gt; to track almost everything in Singapore from air quality to public safety in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/1000-sensors-to-be-rolled-out-in-singapore-as-part-of-smart-nation-plan&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, in a bid to increase security, the [[Singapore Police Force]] installed 62,000 police cameras in 10,000 [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) blocks covering the lifts and multi-storey car parks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/installation-of-62000-police-cameras-in-10000-hdb-blocks-multi-storey-carparks-complete&lt;/ref&gt; With rising security concerns, the number of CCTV cameras in public areas such as monitoring of the public transport system and commercial/ government buildings in [[Singapore]] is set to increase.&lt;ref name="more-surveillance"/&gt;

In 2018, the [[Singapore]] government would be rolling out new and more advanced surveillance systems. Starting with Singapore's maritime borders, new panoramic electro-optic sensors will be put in place on the north and south coasts, monitoring a 360-degree view of the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/bevy-of-cameras-high-tech-sensors-to-secure-shoreline&lt;/ref&gt; A tethered [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) will also be operational, which can be used during search and rescue operations including hostage situations and public order incidents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-drones-command-vehicles-to-help-police-fight-crime-better-9819786&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2017 report by [[Privacy International]], Spain may be part of a group of 21 European countries that is withholding information, also known as data retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://privacyinternational.org/advocacy-briefing/735/report-national-data-retention-laws-cjeus-tele-2watson-judgment|title=Report On The National Data Retention Laws Since The CJEU’s Tele-2/Watson Judgment|last=|first=|date=September 1, 2017|website=Privacy International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, many defense lawyers tried to overturn multiple cases that used mass storage as their evidence to convict, according to the [[European Agency for Fundamental Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/theme/information-society-privacy-and-data-protection/data-retention#Slovenia|title=Data retention across the EU|date=2015-12-16|work=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Prior to 2009, the [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|National Defence Radio Establishment]] (FRA) was limited to wireless [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT), although it was left largely unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOU 2003:30|page=154|quote=Det har således i svensk rätt bedömts att det inte finns något rättsligt skydd för den enskildes integritet mot avlyssning eller inhämtning av signaltrafik som befordras trådlöst}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, new legislation went into effect, allowing the FRA to monitor cable bound signals passing the Swedish border.&lt;ref name=turerna&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernadi|first=Alexandra|title=I morgon börjar FRA-lagen gälla|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/i-morgon-borjar-fra-lagen-galla_3868431.svd|publisher=[[SvD]]|accessdate=10 March 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications service providers are legally required, under confidentiality, to transfer cable communications crossing Swedish borders to specific "interaction points", where data may be accessed after a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prop. 2006/07:63 |url=http://www.regeringen.se/download/2ee1ba0a.pdf?major=1&amp;minor=78367&amp;cn=attachme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
[[Syria]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Syria has stepped up its web censorship and cyber-monitoring as the [[Syrian civil war|country's civil war]] has intensified. At least 13 [[Blue Coat Systems|Blue Coat proxy servers]] are in use, [[Skype]] calls are intercepted, and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering techniques]], [[phishing]], and [[malware]] attacks are all in use.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

===Turkey===
The failed coup attempt June 15, 2016 led to an authoritarian shift that uses mass surveillance to suppress opposite views. Digital surveillance is part of everyday life due to the box the government puts the Turkish citizens in. It is increasingly difficult to release any academic knowledge beyond what the Turkish government wants to be released. They have a digital and physical strong hold over any knowledge that goes against their regime. Today, the surveillance of academicians goes along with the state's oppression in Turkey. It is hard to say what will happen in the next few years in Turkey as they become increasingly more authoritarian. The centralization of state power along with digitalization expands the scope of the state surveillance. The digitalization and the centralization of state power are closely related to the regime of power that becomes prominent in this conjuncture.&lt;ref name="State vs. Academy 550-556"&gt;2017. State vs. Academy in Turkey: Academy Under Surveillance. Surveillance &amp; Society 15(3/4): 550-556.&lt;/ref&gt;  National security and terrorism are Turkey's main explanations to the world on this topic, although there is clearly more happening there. According to the report of Human Rights Joint Platform published on February 23, 2017, during the nine months period of the state of emergency, the number of dismissed academicians reached 4,811, increasing to 7,619 with the addition of academicians who were working in the universities closed after the failed coup attempt.&lt;ref name="State vs. Academy 550-556"/&gt; The extended surveillance in Turkey helped them to control the population at a massive scale.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article |Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom}}

State surveillance in the [[United Kingdom]] has formed part of the public consciousness since the 19th century. The postal espionage crisis of 1844 sparked the first panic over the privacy of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/surveillance-privacy-and-history|title=Surveillance, privacy and history|last=Vincent|first=David|date=1 October 2013|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 20th century, electronic surveillance capabilities grew out of wartime [[signal intelligence]] and pioneering [[code breaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the British and Americans started listening in|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35491822|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=BBC|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) was formed. The United Kingdom and the United States signed the bilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]] in 1948. It was later broadened to include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as cooperation with several "third-party" nations. This became the cornerstone of Western intelligence gathering and the "[[Special Relationship]]" between the UK and the USA.&lt;ref name="timecoldwar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adam White|title=How a Secret Spy Pact Helped Win the Cold War|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2000262,00.html|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the growth of the Internet and development of the [[World Wide Web]], a series of [[2013 Global surveillance disclosure|media reports in 2013]] revealed more recent programs and techniques involving GCHQ, such as [[Tempora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US and Britain team up on mass surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/nsa-leaks-britain-us-surveillance|accessdate=13 May 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of these capabilities is controlled by laws made in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. In particular, access to the content of private messages (that is, interception of a communication) must be authorized by a warrant signed by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Andrew Marr Show Interview: Theresa May, MP Home Secretary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/2311201402.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2014|publisher=BBC|date=23 November 2014|quote=Well I guess what he’s talking about is the fact that for certain aspects and certain of the more intrusive measures that our security service and police have available to them – i.e. Intercept, intercepting people’s telephones and some other intrusive measures – the decision is taken by the Secretary of State, predominantly me. A significant part of my job is looking at these warrants and signing these warrants. I think it’s ... Some people argue that should be to judges....I think it’s very important that actually those decisions are being taken by somebody who is democratically accountable to the public.

In its December 2014 ruling, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal found that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance.&lt;ref name=BBC20141206 /&gt;&lt;ref name=IPT20141205 /&gt;&lt;ref name=refIPTList /&gt; A report on Privacy and Security published by the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]] also came to this view, although it found past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK surveillance 'lacks transparency', ISC report says|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31845338|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISC2015March&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Security: A modern and transparent legal framework|url=http://isc.independent.gov.uk/news-archive/12march2015|publisher=Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Intelligence and security committee report: the key findings|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/intelligence-security-committee-report-key-findings|accessdate=14 March 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by independent reports from the [[Interception of Communications Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by the Interception of Communications Commissioner’s Office (IOCCO) on the publication of the Interception of Communications Commissioner’s Report 2014|url=http://www.iocco-uk.info/docs/2015%20Press%20Release%20Final.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=12 March 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Report of the Interception of Communications Commissioner|url=http://www.iocco-uk.info/docs/IOCCO%20Report%20March%202015%20(Web).pdf|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, notable civil liberties groups continue to express strong views to the contrary and plan to appeal the ruling to the [[European Court of Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK surveillance laws need total overhaul, says landmark report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/12/uk-surveillance-laws-need-total-overhaul-says-landmark-report-edward-snowden|accessdate=14 March 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have criticised these viewpoints in turn.&lt;ref name=refTimes20150313&gt;{{cite news|title=Civil liberty campaigners attacked for saying terror attack is "price worth paying" to prevent mass snooping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11468060/Civil-liberty-campaigners-attacked-for-saying-terror-attack-is-price-worth-paying-to-prevent-mass-snooping.html|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=12 March 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=GCHQ doesn’t need any lectures from Liberty|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/thunderer/article4380539.ece|publisher=The Times|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported by all three major political parties, the UK Parliament passed the [[Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014|Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act]] in July 2014 to ensure police and security services retain existing powers to access phone and Internet records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emergency data law clears Commons|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/house-of-commons-28320473|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=BBC|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Data Retention Bill set to become law|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/house-of-lords-28349828|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=BBC|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This was superseded by the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]], a comprehensive statute which made public a number of previously secret powers (equipment interference, bulk retention of metadata, intelligence agency use of bulk personal datasets), and enables the Government to require internet service providers and mobile phone companies to maintain records of (but not the content of) customers' Internet connections for 12 months.

{{NSA surveillance}}

Historically, mass surveillance was used as part of wartime censorship to control communications that could damage the war effort and aid the enemy. For example, during the world wars, every international telegram from or to the United States sent through companies such as [[Western Union]] was reviewed by the US military. After the wars were over, surveillance continued in programs such as the [[Black Chamber]] following World War I and [[Project SHAMROCK|project Shamrock]] following World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bamford]] (2008), ''[[The Shadow Factory]]'', Doubleday, {{ISBN|0-385-52132-4}}, Chapter 'Shamrock', especially pg. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[COINTELPRO]] projects conducted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) between 1956 and 1971 targeted various "subversive" organizations, including peaceful anti-war and racial equality activists such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr]].

Billions of dollars per year are spent, by agencies such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]], [[Echelon (signals intelligence)|ECHELON]], and [[NarusInsight]] to intercept and analyze the immense amount of data that traverses the Internet and telephone system every day.&lt;ref name="zdnet-fbi"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059  |title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |date=30 January 2007 |work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], a vast domestic intelligence apparatus has been built to collect information using the NSA, FBI, local police, state homeland security offices and military criminal investigators. The intelligence apparatus collects, analyzes and stores information about millions of (if not all) American citizens, many of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/monitoring-america/ |work=Top Secret America, A Washington Post Investigation |title=Monitoring America |author=Data Priest and William M.

The NSA has been gathering information on financial records, Internet surfing habits, and monitoring e-mails. They have also performed extensive analysis of [[social network analysis|social networks]] such as [[Myspace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120720043006/http://news.com.com/2061-10789_3-6082047.html "Is the NSA reading your MySpace profile?"], Dawn Kawamoto, ''CNET News'', 9 June 2006.

The [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] special source operation system legally immunized private companies that cooperate voluntarily with U.S. intelligence collection. According to ''The Register'', the [[FISA Amendments Act of 2008]] "specifically authorizes intelligence agencies to monitor the phone, email, and other communications of U.S. citizens for up to a week without obtaining a warrant" when one of the parties is outside the U.S.&lt;ref name=guardian6&gt;{{cite web

In early 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that several major telephone companies were providing the telephone call records of U.S. citizens to the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which is storing them in a large database known as the [[NSA call database]]. This report came on the heels of allegations that the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] had been conducting electronic surveillance of domestic telephone calls without warrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm |title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls |work=USA Today |first=Leslie |last=Cauley |date=11 May 2006 |accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the existence of the [[Hemisphere Project]], through which AT&amp;T provides telephone call data to federal agencies, became publicly known.

Modern surveillance in the United States was thought of more of a wartime effort before Snowden disclosed in depth information about the National Security Agency in June 2013.&lt;ref name="van der Vlist 137-157"&gt;van der Vlist, Fernando N. 2017. Counter-Mapping Surveillance: A Critical Cartography of Mass Surveillance Technology After Snowden. Surveillance &amp; Society 15(1): 137-157.&lt;/ref&gt; The constant development and improvements of the Internet and technology has made it easier for mass surveillance to take hold. Such revelations allow critical commentators to raise questions and scrutinize the implementation, use, and abuse of networking technologies, devices, and software systems that partake in a “global surveillant assemblage” (Bogard 2006; Collier and Ong 2004; Haggerty and Ericson 2000; Murakami Wood 2013).&lt;ref name="van der Vlist 137-157"/&gt;  The NSA collected millions of Verizon user's telephone records in between 2013-2014. The NSA also collected data through Google and Facebook with a program called 'Prism'. Journalists through Snowden published nearly 7,000 top-secret documents since then, yet the information disclosed seems to be less than 1% of the entire information. Having access to every individual's private records seems to directly contradict the fourth amendment. 

===Vietnam===
[[Vietnam]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Most of the country's 16 service providers are directly or indirectly controlled by the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]]. The industry leader, [[Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group]], which controls 74 per cent of the market, is state-owned. So is [[Viettel Mobile|Viettel]], an enterprise of the [[Ministry of Defence (Vietnam)|Vietnamese armed forces]]. FPT Telecom is a private firm, but is accountable to the Party and depends on the market leaders for bandwidth.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

Service providers are the major instruments of control and surveillance. Bloggers monitored by the government frequently undergo [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s. These are designed to intercept data meant to be sent to secure (https) sites, allowing passwords and other communication to be intercepted.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt; According to a July 2012 [[Freedom House]] report, 91 percent of survey respondents connected to the Internet on their mobile devices and the government monitors conversations and tracks the calls of "activists" or "reactionaries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Safety%20on%20the%20Line%20vFINAL.pdf "Country Report: Socialist Republic of Vietnam"], ''Safety on the Line'', Cormac Callanan and Hein Dries-Ziekenheiner, Freedom House, July 2012. Retrieved 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial mass surveillance==
{{Further information|Mass surveillance industry}}
As a result of the [[digital revolution]], many aspects of life are now captured and stored in digital form. Concern has been expressed that governments may use this information to conduct mass surveillance on their populations. Commercial mass surveillance often makes use of [[copyright]] laws and "[[Clickwrap|user agreements]]" to obtain (typically uninformed) 'consent' to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials. This allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed by government agencies. This data is then often shared with government agencies - thereby - in practice - defeating the purpose of such privacy protections.

One of the most common forms of mass surveillance is carried out by commercial organizations. Many people are willing to join supermarket and grocery [[loyalty card]] programs, trading their personal information and surveillance of their shopping habits in exchange for a discount on their groceries, although base prices might be increased to encourage participation in the program.

Through programs like [[Google]]'s [[AdSense]], [[OpenSocial]] and their increasing pool of so-called "web gadgets", "social gadgets" and other Google-hosted services many web sites on the Internet are effectively feeding user information about sites visited by the users, and now also their social connections, to Google. [[Facebook]] also keep this information, although its acquisition is limited to page views within Facebook. This data is valuable for authorities, advertisers and others interested in profiling users, trends and web site marketing performance. Google, Facebook and others are increasingly becoming more guarded about this data as their reach increases and the data becomes more all inclusive, making it more valuable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/05/15/he-said-she-said-in-google-v-facebook/ |title=He Said, She Said In Google v. Facebook |accessdate=14 August 2009 |last=Arrington |first=Michael |date=15 May 2008 |publisher=TechCrunch |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New features like [[geolocation]] give an even increased admission of monitoring capabilities to large service providers like Google, where they also are enabled to track one's physical movements while users are using mobile devices, especially those which are syncing without any user interaction. Google's [[Gmail]] service is increasingly employing features to work as a stand-alone application which also might activate while a web browser is not even active for synchronizing; a feature mentioned on the [[Google I/O]] 2009 developer conference while showing the upcoming [[HTML5]] features which Google and others are actively defining and promoting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title="Google's HTML 5 Work: What's Next?"

In 2008 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], Google CEO Eric Schmidt, said: "The arrival of a truly mobile Web, offering a new generation of location-based advertising, is set to unleash a 'huge revolution'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2563364020080125 |title=Google CEO bullish on mobile Web advertising |accessdate=28 February 2010 |date=25 January 2008 |agency=Reuters |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on 16 February 2010, Google presented their vision of a new business model for mobile operators and trying to convince mobile operators to embrace [[location-based service]]s and advertising. With Google as the advertising provider, it would mean that every mobile operator using their location-based advertising service would be revealing the location of their mobile customers to Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Keynote speech (video) |work=2010 Mobile World Congress Barcelona |date=16 February 2010 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqiE2lukDM |accessdate=28 February 2010 |first=Eric |last=Schmidt |publisher=YouTube |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveillance state==
A surveillance state is a country where the government engages in pervasive surveillance of large numbers of its citizens and visitors. Such widespread surveillance is usually justified as being necessary for [[national security]], such as to prevent crime or acts of terrorism, but may also be used to stifle criticism of and opposition to the government.

===Smart cities===
{{Main article|Smart city}}

The development of smart cities has seen the increased adoption of surveillance technologies by governments, although the primary purpose of surveillance in such cities is to [[Smart city#Characteristics|use information and communication technologies]] to improve the urban environment. The implementation of such technology by [[Smart city#Flagship cases|a number of cities]] has resulted in increased efficiencies in urban infrastructure as well as improved community participation. Sensors and systems monitor a smart city's infrastructure, operations and activities and aim to help it run more efficiently. For example, the city could use less electricity; its traffic run more smoothly with fewer delays; its citizens use the city with more safety; hazards can be dealt with faster; citizen infractions of rules can be prevented, and the city's infrastructure; power distribution and roads with traffic lights for example, dynamically adjusted to respond to differing circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/07/smart_cities_are_surveillance_cities/&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of smart city technology has also led to an increase in potential unwarranted [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Privacy and autonomy|intrusions into privacy and restrictions upon autonomy]]. The widespread incorporation of information and communication technologies within the daily life of urban residents results in increases in the [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Panopticism|surveillance capacity of states]] - to the extent that individuals may be unaware of what information is being accessed, when the access occurs and for what purpose. It is possible that such conditions could give rise to the [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Police state|development of an electronic police state]]. Shanghai, Amsterdam, San Jose, Dubai, Barcelona, Madrid, Stockholm, and New York are all cities that use various techniques from smart city technology.

An electronic [[police state]] is a [[State (polity)|state]] in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, collect, store, organize, analyze, search, and distribute information about its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The first use of the term "electronic police state" was likely in a posting by Jim Davis {{cite journal |date=11 August 1994 |url=http://cu-digest.org/CUDS6/cud6.72 |title=Police Checkpoints on the Information Highway |journal=Computer underground Digest |volume=6 |issue=72 |issn=1066-632X |quote=The so-called 'electronic frontier' is quickly turning into an electronic police state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPS-2008NationalRankings&gt;The term "electronic police state" became more widely known with the publication of [https://secure.cryptohippie.com/pubs/EPS-2008.pdf ''The Electronic Police State: 2008 National Rankings''], by Jonathan Logan, Cryptohippie USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic police states also engage in mass government surveillance of [[landline]] and [[cellular phone|cellular]] telephone traffic, mail, email, web surfing, Internet searches, radio, and other forms of electronic communication as well as widespread use of video surveillance. The information is usually collected in secret.

The crucial elements are not politically based, so long as the government can afford the technology and the populace will permit it to be used, an electronic police state can form. The continual use of electronic mass surveillance can result in constant low-level fear within the population, which can lead to [[self-censorship]] and exerts a powerful coercive force upon the populace.&lt;ref name="Applications of Social Control Theory: Criminality and Governmentality"&gt;Kingsley Ufuoma OMOYIBO, Ogaga Ayemo OBARO (2012), [http://www.pdoaj.com/pdf-files/ijass,%20pp.1026-1032.pdf "Applications of Social Control Theory: Criminality and Governmentality"], ''International Journal of Asian Social Science'', Vol. 2, No. 7, pp.1026-1032.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen factors for judging the development of an electronic police state were suggested in ''The Electronic Police State: 2008 National Rankings'':&lt;ref name=EPS-2008NationalRankings/&gt;
* '''Daily documents''': Requirement for the use and tracking of state-issued [[identity document]]s and registration.
* '''Border and travel control''': Inspections at borders, searching computers and cell phones, demanding decryption of data, and tracking travel within as well as to and from a country.
* '''Financial tracking''': A state's ability to record and search [[financial transaction]]s: checks, credit cards, wires, etc.

==In popular culture==
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in popular culture}}
The concept of being monitored by our government collects a large audience of curious citizens. Mass surveillance has been prominently featured in a wide array of books, films, and other media. Advances in technology over the last century have led to possible social control through the Internet and the conditions of late capitalism. Many directors and writers have been enthralled with the potential stories that could come from mass surveillance. Perhaps the most iconic example of fictional mass surveillance is [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which depicts a [[dystopia]]n surveillance state. 

Here are a few other works that focus on mass surveillance:
* ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' , a 1920 novel by Russian author [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] , that predates ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and was read by its author [[George Orwell]].
* ''[[Little Brother (Doctorow novel)|Little Brother]]'' is a novel by [[Cory Doctorow]], and is set in San Francisco after a major terrorist attack. The DHS uses technologies such as RFIDs and surveillance cameras to create a totalitarian system of control.
* ''[[The Lives of Others]]'', is a 2006 German drama film, which movingly conveys the impact that relentless surveillance has on the emotional well-being and the outcome of individuals subjected to it.
* ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' by [[Suzanne Collins]] is a trilogy in which ‘the capital’ has totalitarian surveillance &amp; control over all aspects of the other ‘districts’.
* ''[[Digital Fortress]]'', novel by [[Dan Brown]], involving an NSA code breaking machine called 'TRANSLTR'. The machine read and decrypted email messages, with which the NSA used to foil terrorist attacks and mass murders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33278">'''Normality''' is a [[behavior]] that can be normal for an individual (intrapersonal normality) when it is consistent with the most common behaviour for that person. Normal is also used to describe individual behaviour that conforms to the most common behaviour in society (known as [[conformity]]). Definitions of normality vary by person, time, place, and situation – it changes along with changing societal standards and [[Norm (social)|norms]]. Normal behavior is often only recognized in contrast to [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormality]].  In its simplest form, normality is seen as good while abnormality is seen as bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven James|title=Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health|year=2011|publisher=Praeger|location=New York|isbn=9780313399312|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=otwxtVaj_O0C&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=Normality+does+not+equal+mental+health:+The+need+to+look+elsewhere+for+standards+of+good+psychological+health.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone being seen as normal or not normal can have social ramifications, such as being [[Inclusion (value and practice)|included]], excluded or [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] by larger society.

== Definitions ==
Normality has been functionally and differentially defined by a vast number of disciplines, so there is not one single definition.

===Statistics===
In general, 'normal' refers to a lack of significant deviation from the average.  The word normal is used in a more narrow sense in mathematics, where a [[normal distribution]] describes a population whose characteristics centers around the average or the norm.  When looking at a specific behaviour, such as the frequency of lying, a researcher may use a Gaussian bell curve to plot all reactions, and a normal reaction would be within one standard deviation, or the most average 68.3%.  However, this mathematical model only holds for one particular trait at a time, since, for example,  the probability of a single individual being within one standard deviation for 36 independent variables would be one in a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Modis|first=Theodore|title=The normal, the natural, and the harmonic|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|date=March 2007|volume=74|issue=3|pages=391–398|url=http://growth-dynamics.com/articles/Normal.htm|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2006.07.003|access-date=2012-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085907/http://growth-dynamics.com/articles/Normal.htm|archive-date=2012-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In statistics, normal is often arbitrarily considered anything that falls within about 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, or the most average 95% (see [[1.96]]). The probability of an individual being within 1.96 standard deviations for 269 independent variables is approximately one in a million.&lt;ref&gt;Figured mathematically 0.95^269 is approximately 0.000001&lt;/ref&gt;  For only 59 independent variables, the probability is just under 5%.&lt;ref&gt;Figured mathematically 0.95^59 is approximately 0.048&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this definition of normal, it is abnormal to be normal for 59 independent variables.{{clarify|what is the relevance of this?  For instance, is this bounding what it means to be socially normal to 59 traits, or is it simply saying nothing can be technically "normal" when 60 variables are in play?--the latter statement seems much more concise than what is currently stated in the article.|date=August 2018}}

===Durkheim===
The French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] indicated in his ''Rules of the Sociological Method'' that it was necessary for the sociological method to offer parameters to distinguish normality from pathology or abnormality.  He suggested that behaviors or "social facts" which are present in the majority of cases are normal, and exceptions to that behavior indicate pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Émile|title=Rules of Sociological Method|year=1982|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-907940-9|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Durkheim's model of normality further explained that the most frequent or general behaviors, and thus the most normal behaviors, will persist through transition periods in society. Crime, for instance, exists under every society through every time period, and so should be considered normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Robert Alun|title=mile Durkheim: An Introduction to Four Major Works|year=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=60–81|url=http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/rules.html#pgfId=2822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a two-fold version of normality; behaviors considered normal on a societal level may still be considered pathological on an individual level. On the individual level, people who violate social norms, such as  [[criminals]], will invite a punishment from others in the society.

===Influence of social norms===
Individuals' behaviours are guided by what they perceive to be society's expectations and their peers' norms. People measure the appropriateness of their actions by how far away they are from those [[norm (social)|social norms]]. However, what is perceived as the norm may or may not actually be the most common behaviour. In some cases of [[pluralistic ignorance]], most people falsely believe the social norm is one thing, but in fact very few people hold that view.

When people are made more aware of a social norm, particularly a [[descriptive norm]] (a norm describing what is done), their behaviour changes to become closer to that norm.  The power of these norms can be harnessed by [[Social norms approach|social norms marketing]], where the social norm is advertised to people in an attempt to stop extreme behaviour, such as binge drinking.  However, people at the other extreme (very little alcohol consumption) are equally likely to change their behaviour to become closer to the norm, in this case by increasing alcohol consumption.  Instead of using descriptive norms, more effective social norms marketing may use  [[injunctive norms]].  Instead of describing what behaviour is most commonly done, an injunctive norm is what is approved or disapproved of by society.  When individuals become aware of the injunctive norm, only the extremes will change their behaviour (by decreasing alcohol consumption) without the boomerang effect of under-indulgers increasing their drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=P. Wesley|author2=Jessica M. Nola |author3=Robert B. Cialdini |author4=Noah J. Goldstein |author5=Vladas Griskevicius |title=The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms|journal=Psychological Science|date=May 2007|volume=18 | issue = 5|pages=429–434|url=https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/118375.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x |pmid=17576283|hdl=10211.3/199684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social norms that guide people are not always normal for everyone.  Behaviours that are abnormal for most people may be considered normal for a subgroup or [[subculture]].  For example, normal college student behaviour may be to party and drink alcohol, but for a subculture of religious students, normal behaviour may be to go to church and pursue religion related activities.  Subcultures may actively reject "normal" behaviour, instead replacing society norms with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magolda|first=Peter|author2=Kelsey Ebben |title=Students Serving Christ: Understanding the Role of Student Subcultures on a College Campus|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=January 2008|volume=32|issue=2|pages=138–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===
A disharmony exists between a virtual identity of the self and a real social identity, whether it be in the form of a trait or attribute. If a person does not have this disharmony, then he or she is described as normal. A virtual identity can take many definitions, but in this case a virtual identity is the identity that persons mentally create that conforms to societal standards and norms, it may not represent how they actually are, but it represents what they believe is the typical "normal" person. A real social identity is the identity that persons actually have in their society or is perceived, by themselves or others, to have. If these two identities have differences between each other, there is said to be disharmony.  Individuals may monitor and adapt their behaviour in terms of others' expected perceptions of the individual, which is described by the social psychology theory of [[self-presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=PRESENTATION OF SELF IN EVERYDAY LIFE|year=1959|publisher=DOUBLEDAY &amp; COMPANY INC|location=NY|url=http://www.clockwatching.net/~jimmy/eng101/articles/goffman_intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, normality exists based on societal norms, and whether someone is normal is entirely up to how he or she views him- or herself in contrast to how society views him or her. While trying to define and quantify normality is a good start, all definitions confront the problem of whether we are even describing an idea that even exists since there are so many different ways of viewing the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skopalová|first=Jitka|title=Social eviations, Labelling, and Normality|journal=Human Affairs|year=2010|volume=20|issue=4|pages=327–337|doi=10.2478/v10023-010-0034-8|url=http://versita.metapress.com/content/a17053485p84802w/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==
Many difficulties arise in measuring normal behaviors – biologists come across parallel issues when defining normality.  One complication which arises regards whether 'normality' is used correctly in everyday language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wachbroit|first=Robert|title=Normality as a Biological Concept|year=1994|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=61|issue=4|pages=579–591 |doi=10.1086/289823}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People say "This heart is abnormal" if only a portion of it is not working correctly, yet it may be inaccurate to include the entirety of the heart under the abnormal description.  There can be a difference between the normality of the structure and function of a body part.  Similarly, a behavioural pattern may not conform to social norms, but still be effective and non-problematic for that individual.  Where there is a dichotomy between appearance and function of a behaviour, it may be difficult to measure its normality.  This is applicable when trying to diagnose a pathology and is addressed in the DSM.

== Social Norms ==
What is viewed as normal can change dependent on both timeframe and environment. Normality can be viewed as "an endless process of man's self-creation and his reshaping of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Syristová|first=Eva|title=A Contribution to Phenomenology of the Human Normality in the Modern Time|year=2010| publisher=Dordrecht: Springer Science + Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this idea, it is possible to surmise that normality is not an all-encompassing term, but simply a relative term based around a current trend in time. With statistics, this is likened to the thought that if the data gathered provides a mean and standard deviation, over time these data that predict "normalness" start to predict or dictate it less and less since the social idea of normality is dynamic. This is shown in studies done on behavior in psychology and sociology where behavior in mating rituals or religious rituals can change within a century in humans, showing that the "normal" way that these rituals are performed shift and a new procedure becomes the normal one.

As another example, understandings of what is normal sexual behaviour varies greatly across time and place.  In many countries, perceptions on [[human sexuality|sexuality]] are largely becoming more liberal, especially views on the normality of masturbation and homosexuality.  Social understanding on normal sexual behaviour also varies greatly country by country – countries can be divided into categories of how they approach sexual normality, as conservative, homosexual-permissive, or liberal.  The United States, Ireland, and Poland have more conservative social understanding of sexuality among university students, while Scandinavian students consider a wider variety of sexual acts as normal.  Although some attempts have been made to define sexual acts as normal, abnormal, or indeterminate, these definitions are time-sensitive.  [[Gayle Rubin]]'s 1980s model of sexual 'normality' was comprehensive at the time but has since become outdated as society has liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Todd G.|author2=Travis A. Ryan |author3=Lisa Fox |author4=Daragh T. McDermott |author5=Melanie A. Morrison |title=Canadian university students' perceptions of the practices that constitute "normal" sexuality for men and women|journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|year=2008|volume=17 | issue = 4|pages=161–171|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_4_17/ai_n31903471/?tag=content;col1|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since normality shifts in time and environment, the mean and standard deviation are only useful for describing normality from the environment from which they are collected.

{{anchor|interpersonal}}

==Intrapersonal==
Most definitions of normality consider interpersonal normality, the comparison between many different individual's behaviours to distinguish normality from abnormality.  Intrapersonal normality looks at what is normal behaviour for one particular person (consistency within a person) and would be expected to vary person-to-person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hur|first=Taekyun |author2=Neal J. Roese |author3=Jae-Eun Namkoong|title=Regrets in the East and West: Role of intrapersonal versus interpersonal norms|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=June 2009|volume=12|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.1111/j.1467-839X.2009.01275.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A mathematical model of normality could still be used for intrapersonal normality, by taking a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of many different occurrences of behaviour from one person over time.  Also like interpersonal normality, intrapersonal normality may change over time, due to changes in the individual as they age and due to changes in society (since society's view of normality influences individual peoples' behaviour).

It is most comfortable for people to engage in behaviour which conforms to their own personal habitual norms.  When things go wrong, people are more likely to attribute the negative outcome on any abnormal behaviour leading up to the mishap.  After a car crash, people may say "if only I didn't leave work early", blaming the crash on their actions which were not normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catellani|first=Patrizia|author2=Augusta I. Albertici |author3=Patrizia Milesi |title=Counterfactual thinking and stereotypes: The nonconformity effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=34|issue=4|pages=421–436|doi=10.1002/ejsp.206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[counterfactual thinking]] particularly associates abnormal behaviour with negative outcomes.

== Medicine ==
In [[medicine]], behavioral normality pertains to a patient's mental condition aligning with that of a model, [[health]]y patient.  A person without any [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] is considered a normal patient, whereas a person with a mental disability or illness is viewed as abnormal. These normals and abnormals in the context of mental health subsequently create negative stigmatic perceptions towards individuals with mental illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Mental Illness|url = https://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|website = Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation (Formerly NARSAD)|accessdate = 2015-12-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135329/https://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|archive-date = 2015-12-22|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation stated that "an estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older – about 1 in 4 adults – suffer from one or more of (several) disorders in a given year".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the population of American individuals living with mental illness is not as small of a minority as commonly perceived, it is considered abnormal nonetheless, therefore the subject of discrimination and abuse such as violent therapies, punishments, or labeling for life by the normal, healthy majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top 10 Forms of Psychiatric Institution Abuse {{!}} CCHR International|url = http://www.cchrint.org/2014/11/13/top-10-forms-of-psychiatric-institution-abuse/|accessdate = 2015-12-10|date = 2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC reported that "cluster[s] of negative attitudes and beliefs motivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illnesses".  In continuum, the resources available to those who suffer from such illness are limited, and government support is constantly being cut from programs that help individuals living with mental illness live more comfortable, accommodative, happier lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Neglect of Mental Illness Exacts a Huge Toll, Human and Economic|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-neglect-of-mental-illness/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuronal and synaptic ==
Hebbian associative learning and memory maintenance depends on synaptic normalization mechanisms to prevent [[synaptic runaway]].&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbib|first=M. A.|title=The handbook of brain theory and neural networks|year=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where synaptic runaway describes overcrowding of [[dendrite|dendritic]] associations, which reduce sensory or behavioural acuteness proportional to the level of synaptic runaway. Synaptic/neuronal normalization refers to synaptic competition, where the prosper of one synapse may weakening the efficacy of other nearby surrounding synapses with redundant neurotransmission.

Animal dendritic density greatly increases throughout waking hours despite intrinsic normalization mechanisms as described as above. The growth rate of synaptic density is not sustained in a cumulative fashion. Without a pruning state, the signal to noise ratio of CNS mechanism would not be able to operate with maximum effectiveness, and learning would be detrimental to animal survival. Neuronal and synaptic normalization mechanisms must operate so positive association feedback loops to not become rampant while constantly processing new environmental information.&lt;ref name="Arbib"/&gt;

Some researchers speculate that the slow oscillation (nREM) cycles of animal sleep constitute an essential 're-normalization' phase. The re-normalization occurs from cortical large amplitude brain rhythm, in the low delta range (0.5–2&amp;nbsp;Hz), synaptically downscaling the associations from the wakeful learning state.&lt;ref name="Tononi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tononi|first=Giulio|title=Giulio Tononi: 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science Symposium|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEbyITI13zg|work=In search of sleep function|publisher=Allan Institute for Brain Science|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the strongest associations survive the pruning from this phase. This allows retention of salient information coding from the previous day, but also allows more cortical space and energy distribution to continue effective learning subsequently after a slow-wave oscillation episode of sleep.&lt;ref name="Tononi"/&gt;

Also, organisms tend to have a normal biological developmental pathway as a central nervous system ages and/or learns. Deviations for a species' normal development frequently will result in behaviour dysfunction, or death, of that organism.

==Effects of labeling==
When people do not conform to the normal standard, they are often labelled as sick, disabled, abnormal, or unusual, which can lead to marginalization or [[social stigma|stigmatization]].  Most people want to be normal and strive to be perceived as such, so that they can relate to society at large.  Without having things in common with the general population, people may feel isolated among society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridgens|first=Ruth|title=Disability and Being 'Normal': A Response to McLaughlin and Goodley: Response|journal=Sociology|date=5 August 2009|volume=43|pages=753–761|doi=10.1177/0038038509105419|url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/43/4/753|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abnormal person feels like they have less in common with the normal population, and others have difficulty relating to things that they have not experienced themselves.  Additionally, abnormality may make others uncomfortable, further separating the abnormally labelled individual.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Since being normal is generally considered an ideal, there is often pressure from external sources to [[conformity|conform]] to normality, as well as pressure from people's intrinsic desire to feel included.  For example, families and the medical community will try to help [[disability|disabled]] people live a normal life.  However, the pressure to appear normal, while actually having some deviation, creates a conflict – sometimes someone will appear normal, while actually experiencing the world differently or struggling.  When abnormality makes society feel uncomfortable, it is the exceptional person themselves who will laugh it off to relieve social tension.  A disabled person is given normal freedoms, but may not be able to show negative emotions. Lastly, society's rejection of deviance and the pressure to normalize may cause shame in some individuals.  Abnormalities may not be included in an individual's sense of [[identity (social science)|identity]], especially if they are unwelcome abnormalities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When an individual's abnormality is labelled as a [[pathology]], it is possible for that person to take on both elements of the [[sick role]] or the stigmatization that follows some illnesses.  Mental illness, in particular, is largely misunderstood by the population and often overwhelms others' impression of the patient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Clinical ==
Applying normality clinically depends on the field and situation a practitioner is in. In the broadest sense, clinical normality is the idea of uniformity of physical and psychological functioning across individuals. Normality, and abnormality, can be characterized statistically.
Related to the previous definition, statistically normality is usually defined it in terms of a normal distribution curve, with the so-called 'normal zone' commonly accounting for 95.45%  percent of all the data. The remaining 4.55% will lie split outside of two standard deviations from the mean. Thus any variable case that lies outside of two deviations from the mean would be considered abnormal. However, the critical value of such statistical judgments may be subjectively altered to a less conservative estimate. It is in fact normal for a population to have a proportion of abnormals. The presence of abnormals is important because it is necessary to define what 'normal' is, as normality is a relative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thibaut|first=John W.|title=The concept of normality in clinical psychology|journal=Psychological Review|year=1943|volume=50|issue=3|pages=4–7|doi=10.1037/h0062556}}&lt;/ref&gt; So at a group, or macro level, of analysis; abnormalities are normal given a demographic survey, but at an individual level abnormal individuals are seen as being deviant in someway that needs to be corrected.
Statistical normality is important in determining demographic pathologies. When a variable rate, such as virus spread within a human population, exceeds its normal infection rate then preventative or emergency measures can be introduced. 
It is often impractical to apply statistical normality to diagnose individuals. Symptom normality is the current, and assumed most effective, way to assess patient pathology. Psychiatric normality, in a broad sense, states that psychopathology are disorders that are deviations from normality.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

=== DSM ===
Normality, as a relative concept, is intrinsically involved with contextual elements. As a result, clinical disorder classification has particular challenges in discretely diagnosing 'normal' constitutions from  true disorders. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) is the psychiatric profession's official classification manual of mental disorders since its first published version DSM-I in by the APA,{{clarify|date=February 2015}} 1952. As the DSM evolved into its current version, DSM-5 in late 2013, there have been numerous conflicts in proposed classification between [[mental illness]] and normal mentality. Dr. Allen Frances, who chaired the task force for content in the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR even wrote a scathing indictment of the pressures incumbent on the definition of "normal" relative to psychological constructs and mental illness in his book, ''Saving Normal''.

Most of this difficulty stems from the DSM's ambiguity of natural contextual stressor reactions versus individual dysfunction. There are some key progressions along the DSM history that have attempted to integrate some aspects of normality into proper diagnosis classification. As a diagnostic manual for classification of abnormalities, all DSMs have been biased towards classifying symptoms as disorders by emphasizing symptomatic singularity. The result is an encompassing misdiagnosis of  possible normal [[symptom]]s, appropriate as contextually derived.&lt;ref name="Allan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horwitz|first=Allan V.|title=Transforming Normality into Pathology: The DSM and the Outcomes of Stressful Social Arrangements|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behaviour|year=2007|volume=48|issue=3|pages=211–222|doi=10.1177/002214650704800301|pmid=17982864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-II ===

The second edition of the DSM, DSM-II, could not be effectively applied because of its vague descriptive nature. [[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamic]] etiology was a strong theme in classifying mental illnesses. The applied definitions became idiosyncratic, stressing individual unconscious roots. This made applying the DSM unreliable across [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]].&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt; No distinction between abnormal to normal was established.

Evidence of the classification ambiguity were punctated by the [[Rosenhan experiment]] of 1972. This experiment demonstrated that the methodology of psychiatric diagnosis could not effectively distinguish normal from disordered mentalities. DSM-II labelled 'excessive' behavioral and emotional response as an index of abnormal mental wellness to diagnose some particular disorders.&lt;ref name="DSMII"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, Second edition|year=1968|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Excessiveness' of a reaction implied alternative normal behaviour which would have to include a situational factor in evaluation. As an example; a year of intense grief from the death of a spouse may be a normal appropriate response. To have intense [[grief]] for twenty years would be indicative of a mental disorder. As well, to grieve intensely over the loss of a sock would also not be considered normal responsiveness and indicate a mental disorder. The consideration of proportionality to stimuli was a perceived strength in psychiatric diagnosis for the DSM-II.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

Another characteristic of the DSM-II systemization was that it classified [[homosexuality]] as a mental disorder. Thus, homosexuality was psychiatrically defined a pathological deviation from 'normal' sexual development. Homosexuality was later replaced in the 7th printing of DSM-II, instead categorized as a 'Sexual orientation disturbance'. The intent was to have a label that applied only to those homosexual individuals who were bothered by their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homosexuality: Proposed Change in DSM-11|journal=The American Psychiatric Association|year=1973|volume=6th Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner homosexuality would not be viewed as an atypical illness.&lt;ref name="change"/&gt; Only if it was distressing would homosexuality be classified as a mental illness.&lt;ref name="DSMII"/&gt; However, the DMS-II did not explicitly state that any homosexuality was normal either.  This stigma lasted into DSM-III until it was reformed entirely from DSM classifications in 1987.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSMII"/&gt;

=== DSM-III ===

DSM-III was a best attempt to credit psychiatry as a scientific discipline, from the opprobrium resulting from DSM-II.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven|title=Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction in the psychodynamic etiologies of DSM-II spilled over into a reduction symptom etiology altogether. Thus, DSM-III was a specific set of definitions for mental illnesses, and entities more suited to diagnostic psychiatry, but which annexed response proportionality as a classification factor. The product was that  all symptoms, whether normal proportional response or inappropriate pathological tendencies, could both be treated as potential signs of mental illness.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

=== DSM-IV ===

[[DSM-IV#DSM-IV .281994.29|DSM-IV]] explicitly distinguishes mental disorders and non-disordered conditions. A non-disordered condition results from, and is perpetuated by, social stressors.  Included in DSM-IV's classification is that  a mental disorder  "must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual" (American Psychiatric Association 2000:xxxi)
This had supposedly injected normality consideration back into the DSM, from its removal from DSM-II. However, it has been speculated that DSM-IV still does not escape the problems DSM-III faced, where psychiatric diagnoses still include symptoms of expectable responses to stressful circumstances to be signs of disorders, along with symptoms that are individual dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt; The example set by DSM-III, for principally symptom-based disorder classification, has been integrated as the norm of mental diagnostic practice.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

=== DSM-5 ===
The DSM-5 was released in the second half of 2013.  It has significant differences from DSM IV-TR, including the removal of the multi-axial classifications and reconfiguring the [[Asperger's]]/[[autistic spectrum]] classifications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Criticisms of diagnostics ===
Since the advent of DSM-III, the subsequent editions of the DSM have all included a heavy symptom based pathology diagnosis system. Although there have been some attempts to incorporate environmental factors into mental and behavioural diagnostics, many practitioners and scientists believe that the most recent DSM's are misused. The symptom bias makes diagnosing quick and easier allowing for practitioners to increase their clientele because symptoms can be easier to classify and deal with than dealing with life or event histories which have evoked what may be a temporary and normal mental state in reaction to a patients environmental circumstances. 
The easy-to-use manual not only has increased the perceived need for more mental health care, stimulating funding for mental health care facilities, but also has had a global impact on marketing strategies. Many pharmaceutical commercial ads list symptoms such as fatigue, depression, or anxiety. However, such symptoms are not necessarily abnormal, and are appropriate responses to such occurrences as the loss of a loved one. The targets of such ads in such cases do not need medication, and can naturally overcome their grief, but with such an advertising strategy pharmaceutical companies can greatly expand their marketing.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

{{Jewish outreach}}

'''Orthodox Jewish outreach''', often referred to as '''Kiruv''' or '''Keruv''' ({{lang-he-n|קירוב , קֵרוּב}} "bringing close"), is the collective work or movement of [[Orthodox Judaism]] that reaches out to non-Orthodox Jews to encourage belief in [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] and living according to Orthodox [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The process of a Jew becoming more observant of Orthodox Judaism is called ''teshuva'' ("return" in Hebrew) making the "returnee" a ''[[baal teshuva]]'' ("master of return"). Orthodox Jewish outreach has worked to enhance the rise of the [[baal teshuva movement]].

==Varieties==

===Haredi===
{{Main|Aish HaTorah | Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem | Machon Shlomo | Kiruv Organisation}}
The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the founding of the non-Hasidic, Haredi institutions that eventually became the [[Aish HaTorah]], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]], and Machon Shlomo yeshivas.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Rabbi Noah Weinberg]] was one of the pioneers of this movement with Aish HaTorah.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Ohr Somayach has also played a major role in the baal teshuva movement through its education of generations of students.{{Citation needed|date = October 2017}}

The world's first baal teshuva yeshiva for men was [[Hadar Hatorah]] which opened in New York in 1962 under Rabbi Yisroel Jacobson, and continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadar Hatorah Celebrates Golden Jubilee • CrownHeights.info - Chabad News, Crown Heights News, Lubavitch NewsCrownHeights.info – Chabad News, Crown Heights News, Lubavitch News|url=http://crownheights.info/chabad-news/44507/hadar-hatorah-celebrates-golden-jubilee|website=crownheights.info|accessdate=2017-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other baal teshuva yeshivas include the Diaspora Yeshiva, founded by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein in Jerusalem's Old City in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbDQpgZILuwC&amp;pg=PA330 |title=Judaism and Crisis: Crisis as a catalyst in Jewish cultural history|first1=Armin |last1=Lange|first2=K.

Baal teshuva yeshivas for women include Neve Yerushalayim, founded in 1970, and [[EYAHT]], affiliated with Aish HaTorah and founded in 1982.

Concurrent with the opening of baal teshuva learning programs in Israel in the 1970s, a small number of Orthodox outreach workers began approaching English-speaking, college-age students visiting the [[Western Wall]] and inviting them to experience a [[Shabbat]] meal with a host family or to check out one of the baal teshuva yeshivas. These outreach workers included Rabbi Meir Schuster, Baruch Levine, and, beginning in 1982, [[Jeff Seidel]].&lt;ref name=jweek&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/2519/-hunter-at-kotel-seeks-shabbat-dinner-guests/|title='Hunter' at Kotel Seeks Shabbat Dinner Guests|first=Todd|last=Winer|work=Chicago Jewish News|date=9 February 1996|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zhdp9btWGWQC&amp;pg=PA537 |title= Where Heaven Touches Earth: Jewish Life in Jerusalem from Medieval Times to the Present|first=Dovid|last=Rossoff|page=537|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|year=2001|isbn= 0873068793|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bjl&gt;{{cite web |url= http://baltimorejewishlife.com/news/news-detail.php?SECTION_ID=37&amp;ARTICLE_ID=55720|title=BJL Exclusive: Jeff Seidel and Yohanan Danziger Miraculously Escape Jerusalem Arab Stoning Unharmed|first=Margie|last=Pensak|work=Baltimore Jewish Life|date=27 December 2014|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chabad===
{{Main|Chabad outreach}}
Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], 6th leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch branch of [[Hasidic Judaism]], and then his successor, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] were responsible for turning Chabad's activities toward outreach.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Each in turn sent out rabbinic emissaries, known as "[[Shaliach (Chabad)|Shluchim]]", and their wives to settle in places across the world solely for the purpose of teaching those who did not receive a Jewish education or to inspire those who did. The vehicle chosen for this was termed a "[[Chabad house]]."

[[Chabad]] has been active in reaching out to Jews through its synagogues and communal institutions, as well as more direct outreach efforts, such as its [[Mitzvah tank]]s. The organization has been recognized as using free holiday services to reach out across denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Fishkoff, Sue. [http://www.texasjewishpost.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=&amp;mad=&amp;sdetail=2635&amp;wpage=1&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=1128&amp;hn=texasjewishpost&amp;he=.com "‘Praying without paying’ becoming a more popular option among shuls"], ''Texas Jewish Post''.

It is an American Orthodox organization which has opened hundreds of day schools and provides resources to many different Orthodox Jewish day schools. It has an outreach effort called Partners In Torah whereby volunteer Orthodox men and women learn on the phone for an hour a week with a non-Orthodox study-partner. A similar program run by Chabad is called Jnet. Torah Umesorah also sponsors the SEED Program whereby young Yeshiva students spend a few weeks during their summers teaching, this is similar to the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] "peace corps" which are Yeshiva-student pairs that visit remote Jewish communities over the summers to help develop Jewish communities by teaching.

[[Chief rabbi]] of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and also regarded symbolically by the latter [[State of Israel]] as its first chief rabbi as well. He was steeped in [[Kabbalah]], [[Talmud]], and [[philosophy]]. He was regarded as a guide to the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] movement, and an advocate of urgent Jewish emigration (''[[aliyah]]''), to then Palestine before [[the Holocaust]]. He won much trust of the secular Jewish leadership in London, Europe, and Palestine, and argued that a warm and positive outlook to the secular pioneers (''halutzim'') would win loyalty and greater respect for Orthodox Judaism.

A '''persuasive definition''' is a form of [[stipulative definition]] which purports to describe the 'true' or 'commonly accepted' meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an uncommon or altered use, usually to support an argument for some view, or to create or alter rights, duties or crimes.&lt;ref name=BDWP-per&gt;
{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679517_ss1-72 |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |title=Persuasive definition  |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas |first2=Jiyuan|last2= Yu |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0679-5 |accessdate=2012-10-21}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms thus defined will often involve emotionally charged but imprecise notions, such as "freedom", "terrorism", "democracy", etc. In [[argumentation]] the use of a persuasive definition is sometimes called ''definist [[fallacy]]''. (The latter sometimes more broadly refers to a fallacy of a definition based on improper identification of two distinct properties.)&lt;ref name=BDWP-deff&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdbxabeToQYC&amp;pg=PA165|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99721-5|page=165|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |title=Definist fallacy |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas  |first2=Jiyuan|last2= Yu |accessdate=2014-10-15}}

&lt;!--- sources do not agree they are the same, some say there are several kinds of definist fallacies---&gt;

Examples of persuasive definitions (definist fallacies) include: 
* Democrat &amp;ndash; "a leftist who desires to overtax the corporations and abolish freedom in the economic sphere".&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt;
*"Let's define 'atheist' as someone who doesn't yet realize that God exists."&lt;ref name="IEP2"/&gt;

Persuasive definitions commonly appear in controversial topics such as [[politics]], [[sex]], and [[religion]], as participants in emotionally charged exchanges will sometimes become more concerned about swaying people to one side or another than expressing the unbiased facts. A persuasive definition of a term is favorable to one argument or unfavorable to the other argument, but is presented as if it were neutral and well-accepted, and the listener is expected to accept such a definition without question.&lt;ref name=BDWP-per /&gt;

The term "persuasive definition" was introduced by philosopher [[Charles Stevenson|C.L. Stevenson]] as part of his emotive theory of meaning.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=82}}

==Overview and example==
Language can simultaneously communicate information (informative) and feelings (expressive).{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=67, 137}} Unlike other common types of definitions in logic, persuasive definitions focus on the expressive use of language to affect the feelings of readers and listeners ultimately with an aim to change their behavior.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=137}} With this fundamentally different purpose, persuasive definitions are evaluated not on their truth or falsehood but rather on their effectiveness as a persuasive device.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}} 
Stevenson{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|}} showed how these two dimensions are combined when he investigated the terms he called "ethical" or emotive.{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}} He noted that some words, such as 'peace' or 'war', are not simply used to describe reality by modifying the cognitive response of the interlocutor. They have also the power of directing the interlocutor's attitudes and suggesting a course of action. For this reason, they evoke a different kind of reaction, emotive in nature. As Stevenson{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|p=18-19}} put it "Instead of merely describing people's interests, they change and intensify them. They recommend an interest in an object, rather than state that the interest already exists." These words have the tendency to encourage future actions, to lead the hearer towards a decision by affecting his or her system of interests.{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=210}} Stevenson distinguished between the use of a word (a stimulus) and its possible psychological effects on the addressee's cognitive and the emotive reactions by labeling them as "descriptive meaning" and "emotive meaning".{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=54}} Applying this distinction reveals how the redefinition of an ethical word is transformed into an instrument of persuasion, a tool for redirecting preferences and emotions:{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=210}}

::Ethical definitions involve a wedding of descriptive and emotive meaning, and accordingly have a frequent use in redirecting and intensifying attitudes. To choose a definition is to plead a cause, so long as the word defined is strongly emotive.

In persuasive definitions the evaluative component associated with a concept is left unaltered while the descriptive meaning is modified. In this fashion, imprisonment can become "true freedom",{{sfn|Huxley|1936|p=122}} and massacres "pacification".{{sfn|Orwell|1946|}} Persuasive definitions can change or distort the meaning while keeping the original evaluations that the use of a word evokes. Quasi-definitions consist in the modification of the emotive meaning of a word without altering the descriptive one. The speaker can quasi-define a word by qualifying the ''definiendum'' without setting forth what the term actually means. For instance, we can consider the following quasi-definition taken from Casanova's Fuga dai Piombi. In this example (1), the speaker, Mr. Soradaci, tries to convince his interlocutor (Casanova) that being a "sneak" is an honorable behavior:{{sfn|Casanova|1911|p=112}}

::I have always despised the prejudice that attaches to the name "spy" a hateful meaning: this name sounds bad only to the ears of who hates the Government. A sneak is just a friend of the good of the State, the plague of the crooks, the faithful servant of his Prince.

This quasi-definition employed in case 1 underscores a fundamental dimension of the "emotive" meaning of a word, namely its relationship with the shared values, which are attacked as "prejudices." This account given by the spy shows how describing the referent based on a different hierarchy of values can modify emotive meaning. The value of trust is not denied, but is placed in a hierarchy where the highest worth is given to the State.{{sfn|Walton &amp; Macagno|2015|}}&lt;p role="presentation"&gt;Stevenson provides us with two definitions of the word culture in order to illustrate what a persuasive definition can accomplish:

*The original definition: "widely read and acquainted with arts"
*The persuasive definition: "imaginative sensitivity"
Both carry with them the positive emotive meaning of culture; it is still a good thing to be cultured no matter which definition is used. What they change is what exactly it means to be called "cultured." Because being cultured is a positive trait, the society views being well read and acquainted with the arts as positive traits to have. By promoting a persuasive definition of "imaginative sensitivity" the society begins to views those qualities positively because they are attached to a word with a positive emotive meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Charles Leslie|date=1938-01-01|title=Persuasive Definitions|jstor=2250337|journal=Mind|volume=47|issue=187|pages=331–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unclear, [[figurative language]] is often used in persuasive definitions.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=154}} Although several techniques can be used to form such a definition,{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}} the [[genus–differentia definition|genus and difference]] technique is the usual one applied.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=103}} Both definitions in the taxation example above agree that the genus is a procedure relating to governance but disagree on the difference. Persuasive definitions combine elements of [[stipulative definition]]s, [[lexical definition]]s, and sometimes [[theoretical definition]]s.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}}

Persuasive definitions commonly appear in political speeches, [[editorial]]s and other situations where the power to influence is most in demand.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}} They have been dismissed as serving only to confuse readers and listeners without legitimate purpose.&lt;ref name="Kemerling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e05.htm |title=Definition and Meaning |first=Garth |last=Kemerling |date=2001-10-27 |work=Philosophy Pages |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical scrutiny is often necessary to identify persuasive definitions in an argument as they are meant to appear as honest definitions.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}}{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|pp=137–138}}{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28630">A '''planet symbol''' (or ''planetary symbol'') is a graphical symbol used in [[astrological symbol|astrology]] and [[astronomical symbol|astronomy]] to represent a [[classical planet]] (including the Sun and the Moon) or one of the eight modern planets. The symbols are also used in [[alchemy]] to represent the metals that are [[Classical planets in Western alchemy|associated]] with the planets. The use of these symbols is based in ancient [[Greco-Roman astronomy]], although their current shapes are a development of the 16th century.

The classical planets with their symbols and associated metals are: 
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=wikitable
|-
|planet || Moon || Mercury || Venus  || Sun || Mars || Jupiter || Saturn 
|-
|symbol || {{resize|150%|☾}}  || {{resize|150%|☿}} || {{resize|150%|♀}} || {{resize|150%|☉}} || {{resize|150%|♂}} || {{resize|150%|♃}} || {{resize|150%|♄}} 
|-
|metal || silver || mercury || copper || gold || iron || tin || lead
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[International Astronomical Union]] discourages the use of these symbols in modern journal articles, and their style manual proposes one- and two-letter abbreviations for the names of the planets for cases where planetary symbols might be used, such as in the headings of tables.&lt;ref name=iau-style-manual &gt;{{cite book

The modern planets with their symbols and abbreviations recommended by the IAU: 
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=wikitable
|-

|-
|IAU || Me || V || E || Ma || J || S || U || N
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The symbols of Venus and Mars are also used to represent [[female]] and [[male]] in biology and botany, following a convention introduced by [[Linnaeus]] in the 1750s.

==History==
===Classical planets===
The written symbols for Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn have been traced to forms found in late Greek papyri.&lt;ref name=jones-1999&gt;{{cite book

| last = Jones
| first = Alexander
| date = 1999

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early forms are also found in medieval Byzantine codices which preserve ancient horoscopes.&lt;ref name=neugebauer-1975&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 0-387-06995-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Antecedents of the planetary symbols are attested in the attributes given to classical deities, represented in simplified pictographic form in the Roman era. ''Bianchini's [[planisphere]]'' (2nd century, [[Louvre]] inv. Ma 540)&lt;ref name=imss&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/galileopalazzostrozzi/object/BianchinisPlanisphere.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the seven planets represented by portraits of the seven corresponding gods, each with a simple representation of an attribute, as follows: Mercury has a [[caduceus]]; Venus has a cord attached to her necklace which is connected to another necklace; Mars has a spear; Jupiter has a staff; Saturn has a scythe; the Sun has a circlet with rays emanating from it; and the Moon has a headdress with a crescent attached.&lt;ref name=maunder&gt;Maunder (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;

A diagram in the astronomical compendium by Johannes Kamateros (12th century) shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray, Jupiter by the letter ''zeta'' (the initial of [[Zeus]], Jupiter's counterpart in Greek mythology), Mars by a shield crossed by a spear, and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones, without the cross-mark seen in modern versions of the symbols. These cross-marks first appear in the late 15th or early 16th century. According to Maunder, the addition of crosses appears to be "an attempt to give a savour of Christianity to the symbols of the old pagan gods."&lt;ref name=maunder /&gt;

The modern symbols for the seven classical planets are found in a woodcut of the seven planets in a Latin translation of [[Abu Ma'shar]]'s ''De Magnis Coniunctionibus'' printed at Venice in 1506, represented as the corresponding gods riding chariots.&lt;ref name=maunder239&gt;Maunder (1934:239)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earth]] is not one of the  classical planets (the word "planet" by definition describing "wandering stars" as seen from Earth's surface). 
Its status as planet is a consequence of the development of [[heliocentrism]].
Nevertheless, there are ancient symbols for Earth, notably a [[cross]] representing the four [[cardinal direction]]s, as a cross in a circle also interpreted as a  globe with [[equator]] and a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]];&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia&gt;{{cite book

Alternatively, there is the [[globus cruciger]] [[File:Earth symbol alternate.svg|16x25px|Earth]] (U+2641 {{resize|150%|♁}}),  now most commonly used as planetary symbol.
The "globus cruciger" symbol is also used as an alchemical symbol of [[antimony]].

===Modern discoveries===

The symbols for [[Uranus]] were created shortly after its discovery in 1781. One symbol, [[File:Uranus symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], invented by [[Johann Gottfried Koehler|J. G. Köhler]] and refined by [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]], was intended to represent the newly discovered metal [[platinum]]; since platinum, commonly called white gold, was found by chemists mixed with iron, the symbol for platinum combines the alchemical symbols for [[iron]], ♂, and [[gold]], ☉.&lt;ref name=bode-uranus&gt;{{cite book

Another symbol, [[File:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as "un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom" ("a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name").&lt;ref name=Francisca&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The meaning of the symbol H+o for the planet Uranus |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1917Obs....40..306H&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high= |author=Francisca Herschel|date=August 1917|work=The Observatory |bibcode=1917Obs....40..306H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pluto]] was also considered a planet from its discovery in 1930 until its re-classification as a "[[dwarf planet]]" in 2006. The symbol used for Pluto was a ligature of the letters P and L (Unicode U+2647 {{resize|150%|♇}}).

In the 19th century, symbols for the major [[asteroid]]s were also in use, including 
[[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (an altar with fire on it; {{resize|150%|⚶}}	U+26B6), [[3 Juno|Juno]] (a sceptre; {{resize|150%|⚵}} U+26B5), [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (a reaper's scythe; {{resize|150%|⚳}} U+26B3),&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia /&gt; [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] ({{resize|150%|⚴}} U+26B4);

{{commonscat|Luna symbols}}
{{commonscat|Crescent moon symbols}}
The [[crescent]] shape has been used to represent the Moon since earliest times. In classical anqituity, it is worn by lunar deities ([[Selene|Selene/Luna]], [[Artemis|Artemis/Diana]], [[Men (deity)|Men]], etc.) either on the head or behind the shoulders, with its horns pointing upward. 
Its representation with the horns pointing sideways (as a heraldic ''crescent increscent'' or ''crescent decrescent'') is early modern.

The same symbol can be used in a different context not for the Moon itself but for a [[lunar phase]], as part of a sequence of four symbols
for "new moon" (U+1F311 &amp;#x1F311;), "waxing" (U+263D &amp;#x263D;), "full moon" (U+1F315 &amp;#x1F315;) and "waning" (U+263E &amp;#x263E;).

===Venus===
[[File:Venus symbol.svg|thumb|150px]]
{{commons category|Venus symbols}}
The '''Venus symbol''' (♀) consists of a circle with a small [[Cross (symbol)|cross]] below it. 
It originates in [[Late Antiquity]] as an [[astrological symbol]] for the [[classical planet|planet]] [[Venus]] (associated with the [[Venus (mythology)|goddess Venus]]), and hence as [[alchemy|alchemical]] symbol for [[copper]]. In modern times, it is still used as the [[astronomical symbol]] for Venus, although its use is discouraged
by the [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;ref name=iau-style-manual &gt;{{cite book

In  [[zoology]] and [[botany]], it is used to represent the female sex (alongside the astrological symbol for [[Mars]] representing the male sex), following a convention introduced by [[Linnaeus]] in the 1750s.&lt;ref name="Stearn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stearn|first=William T.|title=The Origin of the Male and Female Symbols of Biology|journal=Taxon|date=May 1962|volume=11|issue=4|pages=109–113|jstor=1217734|doi=10.2307/1217734}} "In his Systema Naturae (Leyden, 1735) he [Linnaeus] used them with their traditional associations for metals. Their first biological use is in the Linnaean dissertation ''Plantae hybridae xxx sistit J. J. Haartman'' (1751) where in discussing hybrid plants Linnaeus denoted the supposed female parent species by the sign ♀, the male parent by the sign ♂, the hybrid by ☿ 'matrem signo ♀, patrem ♂ &amp; plantam hybridam ☿ designavero'. In subsequent publications he retained the signs ♀ and ♂ for male and female individuals but discarded ☿ for hybrids; the last are now indicated by the multiplication sign ×. Linnaeus's first general use of the signs of ♀ and ♂ was in his ''Species Plantarum'' (1753) written between 1746 and 1752 and surveying concisely the whole plant kingdom as then known." (p. 110)&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the biological convention, the symbol in the 20th century{{year needed|date=September 2016}} also came to be used in sociological contexts to represent [[women]] or [[femininity]].

The symbol appears without the cross-mark (⚲) in Johannes Kamateros (12th century). In the  ''Bianchini's planisphere'' (2nd century), Venus is represented by a necklace.&lt;ref name=imss/&gt; 
The idea that the symbol represents the goddess' [[hand mirror]] dates to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;see 
Hiram Mattison, ''A high-school astronomy'' (1857), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HocEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern astronomical symbol for the Sun ([[circled dot]], Unicode U+2609 ☉) was first used in the Renaissance.

===Mars===
[[Image:Mars symbol.svg|150px|thumb]]
{{commons category|Mars symbols}}
The '''Mars symbol''' (♂) is a depiction of a circle with an arrow emerging from it, pointing at an angle to the upper right. As astrological symbol it represents the planet [[Mars]] (connected to the [[Mars (deity)|god Mars (Ares)]]) and hence iron in alchemy. In  zoology and botany, it is used to represent the male sex (alongside the astrological symbol for Venus representing the female sex), following a convention introduced by [[Linnaeus]] in the 1750s.&lt;ref name="Stearn"/&gt;

The symbol in its current form represents spear and shield and dates to the early 16th century. It is derived from a medieval form where the spear was drawn across the shield, which in turn was based on a convention used in antiquity (''Bianchini's planisphere'') which represented Mars by a spear.&lt;ref name=imss&gt;{{cite web

===Jupiter===
[[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|thumb|150px]]
{{commons category|Jupiter symbols}}
The origin of the symbol for  [[Jupiter]]  [[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|x25px|Jupiter]] (U+2643 {{resize|150%|♃}}) is not entirely clear.
[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'s attribute is a sceptre  (as [[king of the gods]]), but Kamateros (12th century) represents Jupiter simply by the letter ''[[zeta]]'' ζ (for ''[[Zeus]]''). The modern symbol as used from the 16th century is apparently based on a majuscule zeta Ζ with the addition of a vertical stroke to form the Christian cross.&lt;ref name=maunder244&gt;Maunder (1934), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The less-than-intuitive symbol gave rise to various ad hoc interpretations by modern commentators; thus, the editors of the ''Penny cyclopedia'' (1842) thought might "supposed to be a symbol of the thunder (arm and hand holding thunder?)"&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia/&gt; and more recently the sign has been reported as based on the "Egyptian hieroglyph for the eagle".&lt;ref&gt;Pat Ward, Barbara Ward, ''Space Frontiers, Grades 4 - 8: EXPLORING Astronomy'',  Carson-Dellosa Publishing, 22 Oct 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=I0zbfXcwTQ8C&amp;pg=PA42 p. 42] (without further reference).&lt;!--yeah, they took this from Wikipedia, where it was based on a 2008 web page from NASA https://web.archive.org/web/20100317223147/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=167
there doesn't seem to be a real reference for this, but it's made it into print now anyway. There is no Egyptian "eagle" hieroglyph, unless you count G1 (Egyptian vulture) which looks like -- an actual vulture/eagle. --&gt;

===Saturn===
[[File:Saturn symbol.svg|thumb|150px]]
{{commons category|Saturn symbols}}
[[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] is usually depicted with a [[scythe]] or [[sickle]], and the planetary symbol has apparently evolved from a picture of this attribute, in Kamateros (12th century) shown in a shape similar to the letter ''[[eta]]'' η, with the horizontal stroke added along with the "Christianization" of the other symbols in the early 16th century, [[File:Saturn symbol.svg|x25px|Saturn]] (U+2644 {{resize|150%|♄}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6647">The term "'''Polish Border Strip'''" ({{lang-de|Polnischer Grenzstreifen}}; {{lang-pl|polski pas graniczny}}) or "'''Polish Frontier Strip'''" refers to those territories which the [[German Empire]] wanted to annex from [[Congress Poland]] after [[World War I]]. It appeared in plans proposed by German officials as a territory to be annexed by [[German Empire]] after an expected German and [[Central Powers]] victory. German planners also envisioned forced expulsion and resettlement of the [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Jewish people|Jewish]] population which would be replaced by [[Germans|German]] colonists.&lt;ref name="border strip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goemans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legacies of Violence: Eastern Europe’s First World War  Jochen Böhler, Wlodzimierz Borodziej, Joachim von Puttkamer page 119  Germans in the East 1914-1918:Fantasies of Forced Movement&lt;/ref&gt;The proposed area of the Border Strip comprised up to 30,000 km² (approximately the size of Belgium), and up to 3 million people were to be ethnicly cleansed by the German Empire to make room for Germans.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elusive Alliance: The German Occupation of Poland in World War I  Jesse Kauffman - 2015 ''The ethnic cleansing foreseen by the border strip's champions''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Empires in World War I: Shifting Frontiers and Imperial Dynamics in a Global ConflictRichard Fogarty, Andrew Jarboe
I.B.Tauris, 2014 ''this idea developed into one of annexing a Polish border strip, or frontier strip ... by ethnically cleansing the area of nationalist Poles and colonising the region with Germans from das Altreich''&lt;/ref&gt; The strip was also intended to separate the Polish inhabitants of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]]-held [[Greater Poland]] from those in Congress Poland.

&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 1917 the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German supreme command]] under [[Erich Ludendorff|General Ludendorff]], as part of the debate and planning regarding the cession of the "border strip" to Germany, specified its own designs in a memorandum.&lt;ref name="border strip"&gt;Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey J.

The German minority living in Congress Poland, which had earlier suggested the annexation of all territory up to [[Łódź]] in a letter to the German government, also supported such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;
Aleksander Kraushar, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060928034304/http://www.biblioteka.warszawa1939.pl/books/book/okupacja/53.jpg Warszawa podczas okupacji niemieckiej 1915-1918]'', Lwów (1921), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The German government developed and agreed to these plans in March 1918, and in April gained support in the [[Prussian House of Lords]]; the plans for this were debated and developed across a wide spectrum of political parties and interested groups such as [[Political science|political scientists]], industrialists, and nationalist organisations like the [[Pan-German League]].&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

[[Friedrich von Schwerin]], head of administration in Frankfurt/Oder and chairman of the Society for Inner Colonization stated "The German people, the greatest colonizing people on earth, have again been given a great colonizing task. The current world war provides the opportunity for Germany to resume in a resolute way its colonizing mission in the East''.
For admnistrators like Schwerin the plan was to be accompanied by massive expulsion of Poles as in his words""new land can usually only be won at the expense of those who own the land"&lt;ref&gt;Shatterzone of Empires: Coexistence and Violence in the German, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman Borderlands, Indiana University Press 2013, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;. The German nobility in certain versions of the plan were to become "colonial administration"&lt;ref&gt;Germany Turns Eastwards: A Study of Ostforschung in the Third Reich, 1991 Michael Burleigh, page 21
&lt;/ref&gt;
The plan has been described by historian Hajo Holborn as the first instance in modern European history of planning the removal of whole populations as a solution to national conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840-1945''. Princeton University Press (1982), p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the Polish population all resistance to Germanization of Polish territories would be bypassed&lt;ref&gt;hatterzone of Empires Coexistence and Violence in the German, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman Borderlands Edited by Omer Bartov and Eric D Weitz 2013 page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postdigital,''' in artistic practice, is an attitude that is more concerned with being human, than with being digital. Postdigital is concerned with our rapidly changed and changing relationships with digital technologies and art forms. If one examines the textual paradigm of consensus, one is faced with a choice: either the "postdigital" society has intrinsic meaning, or it is contextualised into a paradigm of consensus that includes art as a totality. 

== Theory ==


[[Giorgio Agamben]] (2002) describes paradigms as things what we think with, rather than things we think about. Like the computer age, the postdigital is also a paradigm, but as with post-humanism for example, an understanding of postdigital does not aim to describe a life ''after'' digital, but rather attempts to describe the present-day opportunity to explore the consequences of the digital and of the computer age. While the computer age has enhanced human capacity with inviting and uncanny prosthetics, the postdigital may provide a paradigm with which it is possible to examine and understand this enhancement.

In ''The Future of Art in a Postdigital Age'' [[Mel Alexenberg]] defines "postdigital art" as artworks that address the humanization of digital technologies through interplay between digital, biological, cultural, and spiritual systems, between cyberspace and real space, between embodied media and mixed reality in social and physical communication, between high tech and high touch experiences, between visual, haptic, auditory, and kinesthetic media experiences, between virtual and augmented reality, between roots and globalization, between autoethnography and community narrative, and between web-enabled peer-produced wikiart and artworks created with alternative media through participation, interaction, and collaboration in which the role of the artist is redefined.

In addition to the wide scope of artistic discourse, the notion of postdigital is emerging as a term that describes the exploration of our relationship to the computer age as a dominant paradigm in a time of global mixing, intertwined economies, population certainty and planetary limits, for example in the work of Berry (2014).

[[Roy Ascott]] has  demonstrated that the distinction between the digital and the "postdigital" is part of the economy of reality.

== Music ==

[[Kim Cascone]] uses the term in his article ''The Aesthetics of Failure: "Post-digital" Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music.''&lt;ref name=Cascone1&gt;{{cite web|title=THE AESTHETICS OF FAILURE 'Post-Digital' Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/COMJ/CMJ24_4Cascone.pdf|work=''Computer Music Journal,'' 24:4 Winter 2002 (MIT Press)|first=Kim |last=Cascone |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He begins the article with a quotation from MIT Media Lab cyberpundit [[Nicholas Negroponte]]: "The [[digital revolution]] is over." Cascone goes on to describe what he sees as a 'post-digital' line of flight in the music also commonly known as glitch or microsound music, observing that 'with [[electronic commerce]] now a natural part of the business fabric of the Western world and Hollywood cranking out digital fluff by the gigabyte, the medium of digital technology holds less fascination for composers in and of itself.'

In ''Art after Technology'' [[Maurice Benayoun]] lists possible tracks for "postdigital" art considering that the digital flooding has altered the entire social, economical, artistic landscape and the artist posture will move in ways that try to escape the technological realm without being able to completely discard it. From lowtech to biotech and ''critical fusion'' - critical intrusion of fiction inside reality – new forms of art emerge from the digital era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">In [[type theory]], a [[type system]] is said to have the '''principal type''' property if, given a term and an environment, there exists a '''principal type''' for this term in this environment, i.e. a type such that all other types for this term in this environment are an [[instance (type theory)|instance]] of the principal type.

The principal type property is a desirable one for a type system, as it provides a way to type expressions in a given environment with a type which encompasses all of the expressions' possible types, instead of having several incomparable possible types. [[Type inference]] for systems with the principal type property will usually attempt to infer the principal type.

For instance, the [[ML (programming language)|ML]] system has the principal type property and principal types for an expression can be computed by [[Robinson's unification algorithm]], which is used by the [[Hindley&amp;ndash;Milner type inference]] algorithm. However, many extensions to the type system of ML, such as [[polymorphic recursion]], can make the inference of the principal type undecidable. Other extensions, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s [[generalized algebraic data type]]s, destroy the principal type property of the language, requiring the use of [[type annotation]]s or the compiler to "guess" the intended type from among several options.

The principal type property should not be confused with the '''principal typing''' property which requires that, given a term, there exist a typing (i.e. a pair with a context and a type) which is an instance of all possible typings of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trevorjim.com/papers/principal-typings.ps.gz  Trevor Jim (1995), "Principal typings" MIT memorandum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RETScreen Clean Energy Management Software''' (usually shortened to '''RETScreen''') is a software package developed by the Government of Canada. RETScreen Expert was highlighted at the 2016 [[Clean Energy Ministerial]] held in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?crtr.sj1D=&amp;crtr.mnthndVl=9&amp;mthd=advSrch&amp;crtr.dpt1D=6683&amp;nid=1079429&amp;crtr.lc1D=&amp;crtr.tp1D=&amp;crtr.yrStrtVl=2014&amp;crtr.kw=&amp;crtr.dyStrtVl=1&amp;crtr.aud1D=&amp;crtr.mnthStrtVl=1&amp;crtr.page=3&amp;crtr.yrndVl=2020&amp;crtr.dyndVl=4 |title=Canada, Mexico and the United States Show Progress on North American Energy Collaboration |website=News.gc.ca |date=2016-06-03 |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RETScreen Expert''' is the current version of the software and was released to the public on September 19, 2016. The software allows for the comprehensive identification, assessment and optimization of the technical and financial viability of potential renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; as well as the measurement and verification of the actual performance of facilities and the identification of energy savings/production opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX8JN0xkq5A |format=Video |author=Clean Energy Solutions Center |title=Financial Analysis with RETScreen |website=Youtube.com |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Viewer mode" in RETScreen Expert is free and permits access to all of the functionality of the software. Unlike past versions of RETScreen, however, a new "Professional mode" (which allows users to save, print, etc.) is now available on an annual subscription basis. 

RETScreen Suite, comprising RETScreen 4 and RETScreen Plus, is the previous version of the RETScreen software. RETScreen Suite includes cogeneration and off-grid analysis capabilities.

Unlike RETScreen Suite, RETScreen Expert is one integrated software platform; utilizes detailed and comprehensive archetypes for assessing projects; and includes portfolio analysis capability. RETScreen Expert integrates a number of databases to assist the user, including a global database of climatic conditions obtained from 6,700 ground-based stations and NASA satellite data; benchmark database; cost database; project database; hydrology database and product database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

[[File:7sigma RainGarden 66.JPG|thumb|300px|Business parking lot that drains to a rain garden. The curb retains the asphalt pavement, yet lets water flow off the edges.]]

One of the wide variety of soil-absorption/filter systems, a '''rain garden''', also called a '''stormwater garden''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Landscape Planning: Environmental Application 5th Edition|last=William|first=Marsh|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a designed depression storage or a planted hole that allows [[rainwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from [[Impervious surface|impervious]] [[urban area]]s, like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and compacted lawn areas, the opportunity to be absorbed. The primary purpose of a rain garden is to improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and to ensure that rainwater becomes available for plants as [[groundwater]] rather than being sent through [[stormwater]] drains straight out to sea. In fact, it can actually reduce rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into the ground (as opposed to flowing into [[storm drain]]s and [[surface water]]s which causes [[erosion]], [[water pollution]], [[flooding]], and diminished groundwater)&lt;ref name=uri&gt;

The plants—a selection of [[wetland]] edge vegetation, such as [[wildflower]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[fern]]s, [[shrub]]s and small [[tree]]s—take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for stormwater to filter into the ground. Root systems enhance [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in [[Biofilter|biofiltration]].&lt;ref name=wolverton&gt;B.C.

Vol. XXXI, pp. 79-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial populations feed off plant root secretions and break down carbon (such as in mulch or desiccated plant roots) to aggregate soil particles which increases infiltration rates. Also, through the process of [[transpiration]], rain garden plants return [[water vapor]] to the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=dussaillant&gt;A. Dussaillant, Ph.D., et al.

Vol. 5, pp. 173-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more wide-ranging definition covers all the possible elements that can be used to capture, channel, divert, and make the most of the natural rain and snow that falls on a property. Thus, the whole garden can become a rain garden, and each component of the whole can become a small-scale rain garden in itself.

==Restoring the water cycle and mitigating urbanization==
{{see|Urbanization}}
In developed areas, natural [[Depression (geology)|depressions]] where [[storm water]] would pool are filled in. The surface of the ground is often [[Regrading|leveled]] or paved. Storm water is directed into [[storm drain]]s which often may cause overflows of [[combined sewer]] systems or poisoning, erosion or flooding of waterways receiving the storm water runoff.&lt;ref name=Kuichling&gt;Kuichling, E. 1889. "The relation between the rainfall and the discharge of sewers in populous districts." ''Trans. Am. Soc. Civ. Eng.'' 20, 1–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Leopold &gt;Leopold, L. B. 1968.

Morgan (eds), ''Effects of Watershed Changes on Streamflow.'' University of Texas Press, Austin and London.&lt;/ref&gt; Redirected storm water is often warmer than the [[groundwater]] normally feeding a stream, and has been linked to upset in some aquatic ecosystems primarily through the reduction of [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] (DO). Storm water runoff is also a source of a wide variety of pollutants washed off hard or compacted surfaces during rain events. These pollutants include [[volatile organic compounds]], [[pesticides]], [[herbicides]], [[hydrocarbons]] and [[trace metals]]&lt;ref name= Novotny&gt;Novotny, V. and Olem, H. 1994. "Water Quality: Prevention, Identification, and Management of Diffuse Pollution." Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Rain gardens are designed to capture the initial flow of storm water and reduce the accumulation of toxins flowing directly into natural waterways through ground filtration. They also reduce energy consumption. For example, "the cumulative storage capacity of these rain gardens exceeds a conventional stormwater's system's by 10 times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassberg |first=Valerie |author2=Brad Lancaster |title=Fighting water with water: Behavioral change versus climate change |journal=American Water Works Association |date=June 2011 |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=59 |url=http://www.harvestingrainwater.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/Strassberg-Lancaster-AWWA-June-2011.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and a number of research institutions are presently studying the impact of augmenting rain gardens with materials capable of capture or [[chemical reduction]] of the pollutants to benign compounds.

[[File:SUNY-ESF-rain-garden-2014-b.jpg|thumb|left|Rain garden, [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry]], Syracuse, New York]]
Rain gardens are often located near a building's roof drainpipe (with or without [[rainwater tank]]s). Most rain gardens are designed to be an endpoint of drainage with a capacity to percolate all incoming water through a series of soil or gravel layers beneath the surface plantings. A [[French drain]] may be used to direct a portion of the rainwater to an overflow location for heavier rain events. By reducing peak stormwater discharge, rain gardens extend hydraulic lag time and somewhat mimic the natural [[water cycle]] displaced by [[urban development]] and allow for [[groundwater]] recharge. While rain gardens always allow for restored groundwater recharge, and reduced stormwater volumes, they may also increase [[Water pollution|pollution]] unless [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] materials are included in the design of the filtration layers.&lt;ref name= Dietz&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11270-005-8266-8 | last1 =  Dietz | first1 = Michael E. | first2 = John C. | last2 = Clausen | year = 2005 | title = A Field Evaluation of Raingarden Flow and Pollutant Treatment | journal = Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution | volume = 167 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 123–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary challenge of rain garden design centers on calculating the types of pollutants and the acceptable loads of pollutants the rain garden's filtration system can handle during storm-water events. This challenge is specifically acute when a rain event occurs after a longer dry period. The initial storm water is often highly contaminated with the accumulated pollutants from dry periods. Rain garden designers have previously focused on finding robust [[native plants]] and encouraging adequate biofiltration, but recently have begun augmenting filtration layers with media specifically suited to chemically reduce [[redox]] of incoming pollutant streams.

Rain gardens are beneficial for many reasons: improve water quality by filtering runoff, provide localized [[flood control]], are aesthetically pleasing, and provide interesting planting opportunities. They also encourage wildlife and [[biodiversity]], tie together buildings and their surrounding environments in attractive and environmentally advantageous ways, and provide significant partial solutions to important environmental problems that affect us all.

A rain garden provides a way to use and optimize any rain that falls, reducing or avoiding the need for [[irrigation]]. They allow a household or building to deal with excessive rainwater runoff without burdening the public storm water systems. Rain gardens differ from retention basins, in that the water will infiltrate the ground within a day or two. This creates the advantage that the rain garden does not allow [[mosquito]]es to breed. Compost, rather than soil, has better effects on filtering groundwater and rainwater. Compact lawn soil cannot harbor groundwater nearly as well, because the water simply flows off.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==
The first rain gardens were created to mimic the natural water retention areas that occurred before development of an area. The rain gardens for residential use were developed in 1990 in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], when Dick Brinker, a developer building a new housing [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] had the idea to replace the traditional [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMP) pond with a [[bioretention]] area. He approached Larry Coffman, an environmental engineer and the county's Associate Director for Programs and Planning in the Department of Environmental Resources, with the idea.&lt;ref name=urbrun&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Urban Runoff |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/archives/upload/42issue.pdf |magazine=Nonpoint Source News-Notes |issue=42 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |date=August 1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707213649/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/archives/upload/42issue.pdf |archive-date=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the extensive use of rain gardens in Somerset, a residential subdivision which has a {{convert|300|–|400|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} rain garden on each house's property.&lt;ref name="marcom"&gt;''Wisconsin Natural Resources'' (magazine). [http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/html/supps/2003/feb03/run.htm#one “Rain Gardens Made One Maryland Community Famous.”] February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This system proved to be highly cost-effective. Instead of a system of [[Curb (road)|curbs]], [[sidewalk]]s, and [[Street gutter|gutters]], which would have cost nearly $400,000, the planted drainage swales cost $100,000 to install.&lt;ref name=urbrun/&gt; This was also much more cost effective than building BMP ponds that could handle 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events.&lt;ref name=urbrun/&gt; Flow monitoring done in later years showed that the rain gardens have resulted in a 75–80% reduction in stormwater runoff during a regular rainfall event.&lt;ref name=marcom/&gt;

This is also referred to as [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]] (WSUD) in Australia, [[Sustainable drainage system|Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems or SUDS]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] (LID) in the United States, and is cited by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/soakuptherain/rain-gardens |title=Rain Gardens |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-04-28 |website=Soak Up the Rain |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ''de facto'' rain gardens predate their recognition by professionals as a significant LID tool. Any shallow garden depression implemented to capture and retain rain water within the garden so as to drain adjacent land without running off a property is at conception a rain garden—particularly if vegetation is maintained with recognition of its role in this function. Vegetated roadside [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]], now promoted as “[[bioswale]]s”, remain the conventional drainage system in many parts of the world from long before extensive networks of concrete sewers became the conventional engineering practice in the industrialized world.

What is new about such technology is the emerging rigor of increasingly quantitative understanding of how such tools may make [[sustainable development]] possible. This is as true for wealthy developed communities retrofitting [[bioretention]] into built stormwater management systems, as for developing communities seeking a faster and more sustainable development path.

==Characteristics==
[[File:2006NeighborsNewRG2.JPG|thumb|A home rain garden recently planted]]
A rain garden requires an area where water can collect and [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]], and plants to maintain infiltration rates, diverse microbe communities, and water holding capacity. This way the rain garden may contribute to urban habitats for native [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[Bird|birds]], and beneficial [[Insect|insects]]. [[Transpiration]] by growing plants accelerates soil drying between storms. This includes any plant extending roots to the garden area.

Simply adjusting the landscape so that downspouts and paved surfaces drain into existing gardens may be all that is needed because the soil has been well loosened and plants are well established. However, many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and often more water runs off one's roof than people realize. Thus, rain garden plants are then selected to match the situation after the required location and storage capacity of the garden area are determined.

===Soil and drainage===
When an area's soils are not [[Permeability (fluid)|permeable]] enough to allow water to drain and filter properly, the soil should be replaced and an underdrain installed. This bioretention mixture should typically contain 60% [[sand]], 20% [[compost]], and 20% [[topsoil]], and there is a current trend to replace compost with [[biochar]]. The former non-permeable soil needs to be removed and replaced. The sandy soil (bioretention) mixture cannot be combined with a surrounding soil that does not have high sand content because the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance, according to a 1983 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hriresearch.org/Docs/Publications/JEH/JEH_1983/JEH_1983_1_3/JEH%201-3-77-80.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212091532/http://www.hriresearch.org/Docs/Publications/JEH/JEH_1983/JEH_1983_1_3/JEH%201-3-77-80.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year study by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix. But, it also indicates that pre-installation infiltration rates should be at least .25 in/hour. Type D soils will require an underdrain paired with the sandy soil mix in order to drain properly.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable City Network, Dubuque, IA (2011-02-21).[http://www.sustainablecitynetwork.com/topic_channels/water/article_b65fe518-3de0-11e0-82aa-00127992bc8b.html "USGS: Rain Gardens Work Regardless of Soil Conditions."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a [[drywell]] with a series of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the rain garden will help facilitate percolation. However, a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an [[infiltration basin]] defeating its purpose. [[Depression-focused recharge]] of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high [[water table]]. In some cases lined [[bioretention]] cells with [[subsurface drainage]] are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.

Rain gardens are at times confused with [[bioswale]]s. [[Swale (geographical feature)|Swales]] slope to a destination, while rain gardens do not; however, a bioswale may end with a rain garden. Drainage ditches may be handled like bioswales and even include rain gardens in series, saving time and money on maintenance. Part of a garden that nearly always has standing water is a [[water garden]], [[wetland]], or pond, and not a rain garden. Using the proper terminology ensures that the proper methods are used to achieve the desired results.

===Plants===
Although specific plants are selected and designed for respective soils and climates,&lt;ref name="dussa"&gt;Dussaillant et al. [http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?140904] Journal of Hydrologic Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; plants that can tolerate both saturated and dry soil are typically used for the rain garden. They need to have minimal maintenance to survive, and be compatible with adjacent land use.

Native and adapted plants are the examples of such plants that are generally used. They are more tolerant of the local climate, soil, and water conditions; have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance; habitat value and diversity for local ecological communities; and overall sustainability once established. There can be trade-offs associated with using native plants, including lack of availability for some species, late spring emergence, short blooming season, and relatively slow establishment.

Trees under power lines, or that up-heave sidewalks when soils become moist, or whose roots seek out and clog drainage tiles can cause expensive damage. Trees generally contribute most when located close enough to tap moisture in the rain garden depression, yet do not excessively shade the garden. That said, shading open surface waters can reduce excessive heating of habitat. Plants tolerate inundation by warm water for less time because heat drives out [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], thus a plant tolerant of early spring flooding may not survive summer inundation.

Bamboo is another plant that works particularly well since it can clean water 27.6% better than domestic plants like grass or clovers. Rice, although it is hard to grow and maintain, works even better.

* [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]], [[Minnesota]] has implemented a policy of encouraging residents to install rain gardens. Many neighborhoods had swales added to each property, but installation of a garden at the swale was voluntary. The project was a partnership between the City of Maplewood, [[University of Minnesota]] Department of Landscape Architecture, and the Ramsey Washington Metro Watershed District. A focus group was held with residents and published so that other communities could use it as a resource when planning their own rain garden projects.&lt;!-- City of Maplewood - broken link reference --&gt;
* In [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], a prototype project, used to develop a plan for the entire city, was constructed in 2003. Called ''SEA Street,'' for Street Edge Alternatives, it was a drastic facelift of a residential street. The street was changed from a typical linear path to a gentle curve, narrowed, with large rain gardens placed along most of the length of the street. The street has 11% less impervious surface than a regular street. There are 100 evergreen trees and 1100 shrubs along this 3-block stretch of road, and a 2-year study found that the amount of stormwater which leaves the street has been reduced by 99%.&lt;ref&gt;City of Seattle, Washington.

'''Sadistic personality disorder''' is a [[personality disorder]] involving [[:wikt:sadism|sadism]] which appeared in an appendix of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-III-R]]).&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;Hucker, Stephen J. [https://archive.is/20130101004151/http://www.forensicpsychiatry.ca/paraphilia/sadPD.htm Sadistic Personality Disorder]&lt;/ref&gt; The later versions of the DSM ([[DSM-IV]], [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[DSM-5]]) do not include it.

The words ''sadism'' and ''sadist'' are derived from [[Marquis de Sade]].

== Definition ==
Sadism involves deriving pleasure through themselves or others undergoing discomfort or pain. The [[opponent-process theory]] explains the way in which individuals not only display, but also enjoy committing sadistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reidy D.E. |author2=Zeichner A. |author3=Seibert L.A. | year = 2011 | title = Unprovoked aggression: Effects of psychopathic traits and sadism | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 75–100 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=please explain how the opponent process theory explains this. |date=May 2013 }} Individuals possessing sadistic personalities tend to display recurrent aggression and cruel behavior.&lt;ref name="j.paid.2009.06.020"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020 |title=Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency | volume=47 | journal=Personality and Individual Differences |pages=734–739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Buckels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buckels|first=E.

== Comorbidity with other personality disorders ==
Sadistic personality disorder has been found to occur frequently in unison with other personality disorders. Studies have also found that sadistic personality disorder is the personality disorder with the highest level of [[comorbidity]] to other types of psychopathological disorders.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt; In contrast, sadism has also been found in patients who do not display any or other forms of [[psychopath]]ic disorders.&lt;ref name="j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00691.x | volume=79 | title=Unprovoked Aggression: Effects of Psychopathic Traits and Sadism | journal=Journal of Personality | pages=75–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One personality disorder that is often found to occur alongside sadistic personality disorder is [[conduct disorder]], not an adult disorder but one of childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt;  Studies have found other types of illnesses, such as [[alcoholism]], to have a high rate of comorbidity with sadistic personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016517819390077T|title= Prevalence and characteristics of sadistic personality disorder in an outpatient veterans population| doi=10.1016/0165-1781(93)90077-T | volume=48|journal=Psychiatry Research|pages=267–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have had some level of difficulty distinguishing sadistic personality disorder from other forms of personality disorders due to its high level of comorbidity with other disorders.&lt;ref name="jaapl1"/&gt;

==Removal from the DSM==
Numerous theorists and clinicians introduced sadistic personality disorder to the DSM in 1987 and it was placed in the DSM-III-R as a way to facilitate further systematic clinical study and research. It was proposed to be included because of adults who possessed sadistic personality traits but were not being labeled, even though their victims were being labeled with a [[self-defeating personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology"&gt;Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology, p. 744&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists like Theodore Millon wanted to generate further study on SPD, and so proposed it to the DSM-IV Personality Disorder Work Group, who rejected it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV and Beyond, p. 482&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-clinical sadism in personality psychology ==

There is renewed interest in studying sadism as a [[personality trait]].&lt;ref name = "Buckels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Meara|first=A|author2=Davies, J |author3= Hammond, S. |title=The psychometric properties and utility of the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale (SSIS)|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=523–531|doi=10.1037/a0022400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadism joins with subclinical psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism to form the so-called "[[dark tetrad]]" of personality.&lt;ref name = "Buckels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chabrol H.|author2=Van Leeuwen, N.|author3=Rodgers, R.|author4=Sejourne, N.|year=2009|title=Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=47|issue=7|pages=734–739|lastauthoramp=y|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223672152_Contributions_of_psychopathic_narcissistic_Machiavellian_and_sadistic_personality_traits_to_juvenile_delinquency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samavasarana.jpg|thumb|Samavasarana of Tirthankara]]
{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''Samavasarana''' or '''Samosharana''' ("Refuge to All") is the divine preaching hall of the [[Tirthankara]]. The word ''samavasarana'' is derived from two words, ''sama'', meaning general and ''avasara'', meaning opportunity. It is a place where all have an opportunity to acquire wisdom.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=97}} The divine pavilion is built by heavenly beings (''[[Deva (Jainism)|devas]]'') after the ''tirthankara'' attain omniscience (''[[Kevala Jnana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/jainism/jains.html Jains&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of Samavasaranas has been popular in [[Jain art]].{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|p=184}}

== Hall ==
[[File:Lord Risbabhdev in Samosharan on Mount Kailash.jpg|thumb|right|Samosharana of Tirthankara [[Rishabha]] ([[Ajmer Jain temple]])]]
In samavasarana, the ''tirthankara'' sits on a throne without touching it (about two inches above it).{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=95}} Around the tirthankara sit the ''[[ganadhara]]s'' (chief disciples). Living beings sit in the following order:{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=96}}
*In the first hall, [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]]
*In the second hall, one class of [[Deva (Jainism)|deva]] ladies
*In the third hall, ''[[aryika]]s'' (nuns) and laywomen
*In the next three halls, three other classes of deva ladies
*In the next four halls, the four classes of devas (heavenly beings)
*Men, in the eleventh hall
*Animals, in the last hall

According to Jain texts, there would be four wide roads with four huge columns, [[Manasthamba]] (literally, pride pillar), one in each side.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=93}} The total size of the hall varies depending upon the height of the people in that era. The size of [[Rishabha]]deva's samavasarana was {{convert|12|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainworld.com/JWFrench/jainworld/jainbooks/tirthankar/apendex-14.htm|title=APPENDIX 14|work=jainworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
[[File:Tirthankara Samosharan.jpg|thumb|Samavasarana]]
In samavasarana, a tirthankara sits facing the east, but appears to be looking in all directions.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=96}} Tirthankara sits on a soft cushion while preaching the [[Jain philosophy]] in plain terms.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=98}} All [[human]]s and [[animal]]s can understand the discourse. Jain scriptures say that all creatures who listen would become [[Ahimsa in Jainism|less violent]] and [[Aparigraha|less greedy]].{{sfn|Pramansagar|2008|p = 39-43}} The speech of the tirthankara is distinctly heard by every one present.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=96}}

The '''Shanti Sena''' or "Peace army" was made up of [[Gandhi]]'s [[non-violence|non-violent]] followers in India.&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;Thomas Weber: Gandhi's Peace Army: The Shanti Sena and Unarmed Peacekeeping, Syracuse Univ Pr.1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Other movements have developed, inspired by this one, sometimes also using the name used by Gandhi's group.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt; These may include [[World Peace Brigade]], [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]], [[Swaraj Peeth]], the organisation [[Peace Brigades International]] and participants in the [[Rainbow Gathering]], and have served as a basis for the practice of [[Third Party Non-violent Intervention]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

"Shanti Sena" is a term first coined by Gandhi when he conceptualized a nonviolent volunteer peacekeeping program dedicated to minimizing communal violence within the Indian populace. The words "Shanti" and "Sena" both come from [[Sanskrit]]. Shanti means peace and Sena means army, or a drilled band of men. The word "Sena" has been criticized for its connection to militarism, but for Gandhi, it had strong metaphorical and spiritual qualities connected to its use in the Hindu [[vedas]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In the aftermath of the Gandhian era, Shanti Sena has appeared in various incarnations. Two Gandhian followers developed separate groups based on their interpretations of it: [[Vinoba Bhave]] established a Shanti Sena that prioritized Gandhi's spiritual approach towards the program, while JP established a program that focused more on the political motivations of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weber: The Shanti Sena: Philosophy, History and Action, Orient Blackswan, New Delhi 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Shanti Sena program also became institutionalized into India's [[Gandhigram Rural University]], where it was incorporated into the university's constitution. Currently Shanti Sena is also very active in Sri Lanka as a part of the organization [[Sarvodaya]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

The '''Singapore Kindness Movement''' is a non-profit organization that executes public education programs aimed at cultivating kindness and graciousness in [[Singapore]]an society. It was officially launched in 1997. The movement serves as the successor to the Singapore Courtesy Council that oversaw the [[National Courtesy Campaign (Singapore)]] from the 1980s through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_162_2004-12-30.html | title=Courtesy Campaign | accessdate=2011-01-11 | author=Lim, Siew Yeen | publisher=National Library Board Singapore | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820041841/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_162_2004-12-30.html | archivedate=2011-08-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) was initiated in response to Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]]’s call to Singaporeans to develop into a more caring and gracious society in the new century.

In his 1996 New Year’s address, stated "We have become a [[Developed country|developed economy]] because we put our minds to it and strive hard to reach our goals. Let us now complement our economic achievements with social, cultural, and spiritual development. Then by the 21st century, Singapore will be a truly successful, mature country, with a developed economy and a gracious society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Social behaviour must match prosperity, says PM | date=1 January 1996 | publisher=The Straits Times | pages=Page 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PM Goh announced the SKM pilot project in July 1996, when he launched the Singapore Courtesy Campaign.Some 2,000 students from the uniformed groups in 20 secondary schools participated in the pilot project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Always In Season, A Harvest of Kindness Stories | author=Dr Lee Tzu Pheng | year=2000 | publisher=MITA:Singapore Kindness Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Movement was launched in January 1997, to over 80,000 secondary school students. SKM officially registered as a non-profit society on 31 January 1997. In March 2001, the National Courtesy Campaign was subsumed by the Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Soon, courtesy will be part of kindness. | date=January 13, 2001 | publisher=The Straits Times | pages=Home, p. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore Kindness Movement held the secretariat of the [[World Kindness Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldkindness.org.sg/about.html | title=World Kindness Movement- About Us | accessdate=2011-01-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117105010/http://www.worldkindness.org.sg/about.html | archivedate=2009-11-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2003-2012.

== Organizational goals ==
The mission statement of the SKM is to inspire graciousness through spontaneous acts of kindness, making life more pleasant for everyone.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.kindness.sg/about/about-skm |title=Singapore Kindness Movement |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505210220/http://kindness.sg/about/about-skm |archivedate=2010-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main objectives are:
To encourage all Singaporeans to be more kind and considerate.
To enhance public awareness of acts of kindness.
To influence and raise the standards of social behaviour in our society.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout" /&gt;

== Structure ==
The SKM organisational structure consists of two main parts: The SKM Council (SKMC) and the SKM Secretariat. The SKM Council comprises members from the private and 19 public sectors.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout" /&gt; In March 2001, the Singapore Courtesy Council integrated with the SKMC.

The Movement is supported by the [[Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth]] and funded by a government grant. SKM also secures funds through its membership subscriptions and sponsorships.

The patron of the Movement is Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and the current Chairman is Koh Poh Tiong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mica-nrd/press_release/P-20080626-1.print.html?AuthKey= | title=Changing of guard at SKM | accessdate=2011-01-11 | author=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718072207/http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mica-nrd/press_release/P-20080626-1.print.html?AuthKey= | archivedate=2011-07-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red symbolises love for your fellow man and green represents caring for the environment, tolerance, creativity, and consideration.

Singa the Lion had been the official mascot of the Singapore Kindness Movement until May, 2013. On 15 May 2013, Singa the Lion was retired from the campaign through an open "resignation letter" posted on the movement's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kindness.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/singaletter2.jpg | title=Subject : Open Letter to Singapore - I Quit | publisher=Singapore Kindness Movement. | work=Singa resigns | accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singa the Courtesy Lion: I quit|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130515-422664.html|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=Asiaone|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychology sidebar}}
'''Situational strength''' is defined as cues provided by environmental forces regarding the desirability of potential behaviors.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; Situational strength is said to result in psychological pressure on the individual to engage in and/or refrain from particular behaviors. A consequence of this psychological pressure to act in a certain way is the likelihood that despite an individual's [[Personality type|personality]], they will act in a certain manner. As such, when strong situations (situations where situational strength is high) exist, the relationship between personality variables (for example, [[extraversion]], risk-taking behaviors, etc...) and behaviors is reduced, because no matter what the personality of the individual is, they will act in a way dictated by the situation. When weak situations exist, there is less structure and more ambiguity with respect to what behaviors to perform.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; In sum, situations have the ability to restrict the expression of [[individual differences]] in terms of actual behaviors.

==Contrasting strong and weak situations==
An example of a strong situation is a red traffic light. Traffic rules dictate how people are supposed to act when they see a red light, and this influence often prevents people from engaging in behaviors that are consistent with their personality. For example, most people, no matter whether they are daring or cautious, will stop in front of a red traffic light. Therefore, one could not reasonably predict how a person would behave with personality in this situation.

In contrast, an example of a weak situation is a yellow traffic light because the most appropriate course of action is not especially well defined and norms are inconsistent. Thus, individuals who are more daring are likely to speed through the intersection on a yellow light, whereas cautious individuals are likely to stop.

==Origins and history==
Although it is difficult to formally express when situations restricting individual differences in personality began in [[psychology]], work conducted by [[Carl Rogers]] suggested that certain individual differences are mostly likely to manifest themselves in situations where there is psychological freedom and safety, compared to situations where psychological freedom and safety do not exist.&lt;ref name="rogers-1954"/&gt; Additionally, [[Stanley Milgram]] argued that psychological forces of conflict may not be brought into play under diluted conditions.&lt;ref name="milgram-1965"/&gt; However, recent conceptualization and study of situational strength can be traced back to the work of [[Walter Mischel]]. In 1968, Mischel published his classic book, ''Personality and Assessment'', where he argued that personality cannot be studied in a vacuum; instead, the complexity of human behavior and its determinants must be studied from a perspective that accounts for the simultaneous and interactive impact of individual differences and situational characteristics.&lt;ref name="mischel-1968"/&gt; It is important to note that Mischel did not imply that people show no consistencies in behavior, or that individual differences are unimportant. The major theme was rather that the trait approach to personality was not as sensitive to the influence of situations as it should have been.&lt;ref name="mischel-1999"/&gt;

In books and articles on the topic, Mischel stressed the importance of better understanding how, when, and why individual differences are most likely to be important predictors of behavior, and when they are more likely to be nullified by situational influences. Specifically, Mischel began laying the foundation for subsequent thought in this area by arguing that psychological "situations" and "treatments" are powerful to the degree that they lead all persons to construe the particular events the same way, induce uniform expectancies regarding the most appropriate response pattern, provide adequate incentives for the performance of that response pattern, and instill the skills necessary for its satisfactory construction and execution (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; He further argued that individual differences are most likely to directly affect behavior "when the situation is ambiguously structured... so that subjects are uncertain about how to categorize it and have no clear expectations about the behaviors most likely to be appropriate (normative, reinforced) in that situation" (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; Thus, he helped to lay the foundation for the general idea underlying what is now typically referred to as "situational strength" (or "situation strength").

Mischel's work led to an important shift in social scientists' thinking about the behavioral expression of personality. But, as some have recently argued, situational strength is too often viewed as being true without treating situational strength as a theoretical construct in need of conceptual development and empirical verification.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt;

==Modern conceptualization and empirical verification==
Meyer, Dalal, and Hermida argue that for theoretical understanding and practical application of situational strength to be advanced, at least three important issues must be addressed:&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Examining the nature of the situational strength. Specifically, examining if there are unique facets in situational strength.
# Examining whether these facets affect all non-ability individual differences uniformly, or if some facets affect the expression of some traits more so than others.
# If facets do in fact have differential effects on the expression of various behaviors and predictor-outcome relationships, it will be necessary to develop theory regarding the specific mechanisms through which these facet-based effects occur.

Four facets of situational strength have been identified:
# Clarity: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are available and easy to understand.
# Consistency: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are compatible with each other.
# Constraints: The extent to which an individual's freedom of decision and action is limited by forces outside his or her control.
# Consequences: The extent to which decisions or actions have important positive or negative implications for any relevant person or entity.

In an empirical study, which incorporated vote-counting [[meta-analysis]], it has been found that conceptualizations of situational strength that currently exist in psychological literature form an interaction with non-ability individual differences. Additionally, the [[effect size]] of the interaction effect was reasonably large.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;

==Implications==
Perhaps the most important implication of situational strength is that it is commonly believed to explain cross-situational variability in the criterion-related validity of non-cognitive individual differences.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mischel-1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullins-cummings-1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weiss-adler-1984"/&gt; This suggests that psychology should not focus on whether personality constructs predict job performance but rather about the conditions under which they predict job performance. This also shows great practical implications for personnel selection because the criterion-related validity of individual differences may vary across different occupations. For instance, Meyer, Dalal, and Bonaccio found that occupation-level situational strength moderates the conscientiousness–performance relationship, such that conscientiousness better predicts performance in characteristically weak occupations than in characteristically strong occupations.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-bonaccio-2009"/&gt;

Another important implication revolves around the idea of [[person-environment fit]]. One of the core ideas expressed in the fit literature is that a mismatch between individuals' needs and environmental supplies can have deleterious effects on performance, attitudes, and health.&lt;ref name="kristofbrown-zimmerman-johnson-2005"/&gt; Within the context of situational strength, some employees may view highly constraining environments as stifling and frustrating, whereas others may find the regimented and predictable nature of constraining environments to be comforting and relaxing. If these differences do in fact exist, this would suggest that employees' psychological reactions are partially a function of their individual differences profile and partially a function of the nature of the situation they are experiencing.

==Future directions==
Two critical aspects of situational strength can be fruitful for future study:
# It is possible that more or fewer categories of operationalizations exist. Thus, researchers should be encouraged to continue theoretical development and empirical tests of alternative structures of situational strength that might also serve to move our understanding of this phenomenon forward. Although the structure outlined by research carried out by Meyer, Dalal, &amp; Hermida was derived by attempting to find common themes among extant operationalizations, the approach assumed that the existing corpus of studies is a representative sample of situational strength's theoretical construct space. Thus, inductive theorizing that focuses on additional (or alternative) categories of operationalizations might be fruitful. Ultimately, however, direct empirical tests of any proposed conceptualization will need to be conducted—a task that is made more meaningful by the presence of a standardized instrument.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Once the dimensional structure of situational strength has been determined, it will be possible to develop a standardized measure for use alongside traditional job analytic tools, in order "to analyze the context within which the job is embedded" (page 349).&lt;ref name="murphy-dzieweczynski-2005"/&gt; There are many potential benefits of such an instrument. First, it would allow researchers interested in examining the effects of situational strength on relevant trait-outcome relationships to do so in a way that is not only consistent across studies (which is not the case at present, as evidenced by our review of the empirical literature), but that also helps to develop a general situational strength literature—the absence of which has been noted.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt; Second, it would allow for an assessment of the relative importance of the dimensions of situational strength, helping researchers to determine which dimensions are necessary and/or sufficient to adequately understand a given interactional question.&lt;ref name="azen-budescu-2003"/&gt; Third, it would help researchers determine whether the situational strength dimensions [[interaction|interact]] with each other—and, if they do, whether these interactions are synergistic or antagonistic. Fourth, it would allow for large-scale analyses of the relative levels of situational strength that exist in diverse situations, the results of which could then be compiled into centralized databases that could help inform future practice and research.

There are a number of '''Spanish units of measurement''' of [[length]] or [[area]] that are now virtually obsolete (due to [[metrication]]).  They include the '''vara''', the '''cordel''', the '''league''' and the '''labor'''. The units of area used to express the area of land are still encountered in some transactions in land today. For example, the 'vara' is still used in Costa Rica when ordering lumber.

==Vara (unit of length)==
[[File:50 Vara Plot in San Francisco CA.jpg|thumb|This street block is made up of six (2 X 3) 50 vara plots.  The California vara is 33 inches, so 50 vara results in 137.6 foot plots. Subplots are within the original boundary lines.  San Francisco business district was originally called 50 Vara District.  This example is bounded by Union, Kearny, Filbert and Montgomery streets.]]
A '''vara''' (meaning "rod" or "pole", abbreviation: '''var''') is an old [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[length]].  Varas are a [[surveying]] unit that appear in many deeds in the southern [[United States]], and varas were also used in many parts of [[Latin America]].  It varied in size at various times and places; the Spanish unit was set at about {{convert|835.905|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in 1801. In Argentina, the vara measured about {{convert|866|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and typical urban lots are {{convert|8.66|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} wide (10 Argentine varas). At some time a value of {{convert|33|in|mm|1}} was adopted in California.
[[File:Thomas Bros. logo on San Francisco map.jpg|thumb|]]
In [[Texas]], a vara was defined as {{convert|33+1/3|in|mm|2}}, or 1 yard&amp;nbsp;= 1.08 vara.  The vara and the corresponding unit of [[area]], the square vara, were introduced in the 19th century to measure Spanish land grants. In [[Texas]], [[Stephen F. Austin]]'s early surveying contracts required that he use the vara as a standard unit. The vara can be seen in many deeds as late as the mid to late 1900s. {{convert|1|acre|ha|3|lk=on}} is equivalent to 5,645.376 Texan square varas.  A league is equivalent to 5,000 varas squared or {{convert|4428.4|acre|ha|2}}.

To convert varas to feet, take the varas and divide by 0.36.

Standardization of measurement in [[Texas]] came with the introduction of varas, cordels, and leagues.

A measure of 100 varas by 100 varas (Spanish) is almost 7000 square meters, and is known traditionally throughout Latin America as a ''manzana'' (''i.e.'', a "city block"). As well, lumber is still measured in Costa Rica using a system based on 4 vara, or 11 feet, for both round and square wood. With square wood, using inches, the width is multiplied by the depth to get a measurement which they call ''pulgadas'', or inches. The lumber is charged 'per inch', which is a measurement 11/12 of a [[board foot]].

==Labor (unit of area)==
A '''labor''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|b|ɔr}} in West [[Texas]]) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[area]], used to express the area of land, that is equal to 1 million square varas.  A labor is equivalent to about {{convert|177.1|acre|ha|2|lk=on}}. It was used in the archaic system of old Spanish land grants affecting Texas and parts of adjoining states.  The labor is often used as an approximate equivalent to a ''quarter-section'' (that is, one quarter of a [[square mile]] of land). It is still encountered in modern real estate transactions.

==League (unit of area)==
A '''[[League (unit)#Spain|league]]''' can also be a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[area]], used to express the area of land, that is equal to 25 million square varas. A (square) league is equivalent to about {{convert|4428.4|acre|ha|2|lk=on}}. It was used in the archaic system of old Spanish land grants affecting [[Texas]] and parts of adjoining states and this use of league is used throughout the [[Texas Constitution]].

A common Texas land grant size, discussed in [[James A. Michener]]'s ''[[Texas (novel)|Texas]]'', was a "labor and a league:" a labor of good [[riparian]] land and a (square) league of land away from the river.

The (square) league is still encountered in modern real estate transactions.

==Palmo and coto (unit of length)==
The ''palmo'' ("palm") measured the distance between the tip of the thumb and the tip of the pinky finger with all fingers splayed. Its standardized value is {{convert|20.873|cm|in|4|abbr=on|lk=on}} (9 ''pulgadas''). Half of a palmo in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] was called the ''coto'', described as six fingers and defined as {{convert|10.4365|cm|in|5|abbr=on}}. The [[Roman foot|ancient Romans]] had a similar, smaller unit called the ''palmus'', which was {{convert|7.3925|cm|in|5|abbr=on}}.

== Local units ==
Although some standardisation was achieved with the law of 1801, particularly in defining the league as 6666⅔ ''varas'' long, varying measures continued to be used in various cities and regions.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed tables in: Instituto Geográfico y Estadístico; [http://www.saber.es/web/biblioteca/libros/pesas-medidas-legales-sistema-metrico-decimal/pesas-medidas-legales-sistema-metrico-decimal.pdf ''Equivalencias entre las pesas y medidas usadas antiguamente en las diversas provincias de España y las legales del Sistema Métrico Decimal'']; Madrid; 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swishing''' refers to swapping an item or items of [[clothing]] or [[shoe]]s or an [[fashion accessory|accessory]] with friends or acquaintances. Parties must willingly give an item to participate in the transaction, once they have given an item they are free to choose something of interest from what others have offered. Value does not come into the equation, as swappers do not necessarily get an item of equal value and are free to choose anything that the other person if offering (without having to pay). Swishing is now being more widely practiced throughout the world and has evolved to include other items such as books and furniture. Not only do people hold 'swishing parties' either as a charity event or simply for the enjoyment of it (while recycling and saving money at the same time), but there are several websites where online swishes take place.

==History==
Swishing (deriving from the dictionary definition of 'to rustle, as silk' - which in the eyes of the Swishing team means 'to rustle from friends') began in 2000 when Lucy Shea, founder of green PR firm Futerra and her colleagues  wanted to come up with a way to combine a love of retail shopping without contributing to increased consumption. It has since been imbursed by fashion model [[Twiggy]] in Twiggy's frock exchange, and as a result has become one of the most popular ways of swapping clothes.

==Practice==
A Swishing Party usually has a Swishing Host who lays out guests' items at the venue after the guests have arrived. The Host sends one group of guests to look at the items while other groups wait or do an activity. When an allocated amount of time has passed, the groups rotate. When all guests have seen the items, the Host places everyone's name into a hat or bowl and draws them one at a time; when a guest's name is called, he or she claims an item. The Host waits for only a few seconds before calling out the next name. The remainder of the items are them donated to charity by the Host.

There are several types of variations.  If the Swish is for charity, attendees have their names placed into the bowl along with an extra amount for a donation; Swishes can be focused on specific items like clothes, crockery, shoes, handbags, and accessories; they can be held for family, friends, or workmates; they can be less orderly, as a free-for-all instead of a drawing by name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1245">In [[category theory]], a branch of abstract mathematics, a '''tower''' is defined as follows.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal I&lt;/math&gt; be the poset

:&lt;math&gt;\cdots\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

of whole numbers in reverse order, regarded as a category. A '''(countable) tower of objects in a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;''' is a [[functor]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal I&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, a tower (of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;) is a family of objects &lt;math&gt;\{A_i\}_{i\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; where there exists a map
:&lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow A_j&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;i&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;
and the composition
:&lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow A_j\rightarrow A_k&lt;/math&gt;
is the map &lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow A_k&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==

Let &lt;math&gt;M_i=M&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;M_i\rightarrow M_j&lt;/math&gt; be the identity map for &lt;math&gt;i&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\{M_i\}&lt;/math&gt; forms a tower of modules.

'''''Twentysix Gasoline Stations''''' is the first [[artist's book]] by the American [[Pop art|pop]] artist [[Ed Ruscha]]. Published in April 1963&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Edward Ruscha Editions, Engberg, Phillpot, Walker Art Center, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; on his own imprint National Excelsior Press,&lt;ref name="Edward Ruscha Editions p60"&gt;Edward Ruscha Editions, Engberg, Phillpot, Walker Art Center, 1999 Vol2 p60&lt;/ref&gt; it is often considered to be the first modern artist's book,&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary, 2004 p11&lt;/ref&gt; and has become famous as a precursor and a major influence on the emerging artist's book culture, especially in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/recs.cfm?list_id=224 Printed Matter website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928165456/http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/recs.cfm?list_id=224 |date=2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book delivers exactly what its title promises, reproducing 26 photographs of gasoline stations next to captions indicating their brand and location. From the first service station, 'Bob's Service' in [[Los Angeles]] where Ruscha lived, the book follows a journey back to [[Oklahoma City]] where he had grown up and where his mother still lived. The last image is of a [[Petrofina|Fina]] gasoline station in [[Groom, Texas|Groom]], [[Texas]], which Ruscha has suggested should be seen as the beginning of the return journey, 'like a coda'.&lt;ref&gt;'It was like going out in a certain direction and then backtracking...I wanted something to appear kind of awkward there, almost like a coda' Ruscha, 1963, quoted in ''Edward Ruscha Editions 1959-1999'', Walker Art Center, Vol 2 1999 p63&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally printed in a numbered edition of 400, a second edition of 500 was published in 1967 and a third of 3000 in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentysix Gasoline Stations'', Ed Ruscha, 3rd Edition, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these later editions was numbered. It has been suggested that these reprints were a deliberate attempt to flood the market in order to maintain the book's status as a cheap, mass-produced commodity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/recs.cfm?list_id=224 Cara Marsh Sheffler, The Late Edition: Twenty Years of Dissemination at Printed Matter (2005) essay reproduced on Printed Matter Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928165456/http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/recs.cfm?list_id=224 |date=2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book originally sold for $3.50.&lt;ref name="Edward Ruscha Editions p60"/&gt; Of the work, [[Johanna Drucker]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ruscha's books combined the literalness of early California pop art with a flat-footed photographic aesthetic informed by minimalist notions of repetitive sequence and seriality....Thirty years later, with a quarter of a century of mainstream artworld activity between, the aspect of shock-effect and humor has diminished somewhat. But in 1962 (sic) this work read against the photographic landscape of highly aestheticized image-making.&lt;ref&gt;''The Century of Artist's Books'', Drucker, Granary, 2004 p76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins of ''Twentysix Gasoline Stations''==
Ruscha would drive home  to visit his parents in Oklahoma four or five times a year&lt;ref&gt;[http://thispublicaddress.com/tPA4/archives/2006/07/twentysix_gasoline_stations.html]&lt;/ref&gt; after leaving home at 18; many of the journeys were taken with his friend and fellow artist [[Joe Goode]]. Ruscha has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wasn't coming out here [California] to do anything in particular, or to be anything in particular except...except out of Oklahoma...a long way from Oklahoma, that's what I wanted to be, and everything it stood for. And away from the catholic church too, and Sister Daniella who beat my knuckles with a pencil the one year I was in parochial school.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Ruscha quoted in I Dont Want No Retro Spective, Hickey &amp; Plagens, Hudson Hills Press 1982, p26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruscha had visited Europe in 1961, and been particularly taken by the books he saw for sale "on the street, in those little bookstalls," and been impressed by the "non-commercial look... a strange kind of sober design including the typography and the binding and everything."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Ruscha Editions, Engberg, Phillpot, Walker Art Center, 1999 p59&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Los Angeles, he conceived the idea initially as a play on words, deciding upon the title first, then working on the typography and design before taking the photographs.&lt;ref name="Artforum"&gt;Interview with Ed Ruscha, Artforum, Feb 1965, reprinted in ''Leave Any Information at the Signal'', Schwartz, October Books, 2002, p24-25&lt;/ref&gt; He took about 60 photographs, and edited them down to 26 by removing any that he felt were too interesting.

===The Book===
[[Image:26GasStations-needles.jpg|thumb|340px|left|''Union, Needles, California'', one of the double-page spreads in the book]]
Dated 1962 in the foreword and dedicated to Patty Callahan, the book comprises twenty-six photographs of various dimensions and proportions; most are laid out on a single page with the text facing the image; some go across the double spread, a few are placed next to each other. Three images are taken at night, including one of [[Tucumcari, New Mexico]], that appears to have been taken from a moving car. But for three people walking across the forecourt on the [[Sunset Strip]], a man getting out of his car at [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] and a man looking under his hood at [[Lipton]], [[Arizona]], there are no people present. There are no cars visible in some of the photographs and almost all are taken from the other side of the highway.

All of the gasoline stations are on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]], a road that had already been mythologized by the TV series [[Route 66 (TV series)|''Route 66'']] and in [[John Steinbeck|Steinbeck's]] ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', and later reappeared as a motif in [[Dennis Hopper|Dennis Hopper's]] ''[[Easy Rider]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The order that the stations appear is almost the same as their position on the route west-east, with five stations moved out of order.&lt;ref&gt;If each station is assigned a letter, the order is ABECDIGHJKLFMNOPQSTUWRXYZV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Ruscha Editions, Engberg, Phillpot, Walker Art Center, 1999 p63&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the last station in Groom, Texas, the relevant states listed are all in order.

The first edition was numbered and occasionally signed, which Ruscha later admitted was a "mistake".&lt;ref name="Artforum"/&gt; Apart from this detail, the books are defined by their "professional polish, a clear-cut machine finish."&lt;ref name="Artforum"/&gt; Ruscha has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have eliminated all text from my books- I want absolutely neutral material. My pictures are not that interesting, nor the subject matter. They are simply a collection of 'facts', my book is more like a collection of [[readymade]]s.....It is almost worth the money to have the thrill of 400 exactly identical books stacked in front of you.&lt;ref name="Artforum"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, in an interview in the ''[[National Observer (USA)|National Observer]]'', Ruscha declared "I want to be the [[Henry Ford]] of book making."&lt;ref&gt;Ed Ruscha, Interview in the ''[[National Observer (USA)|National Observer]]'', July 28, 1969, reprinted ''Leave Any Information at the Signal'', Schwartz, October Books, 2002, p28&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is printed in black offset on white paper. It measures 17.9 x 14 x 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm (closed). It has 26 photographs on 48 pages. The title appears in red lettering on the cover and spine. First edition: 400 numbered copies; second edition, 1967: 500 copies, third edition, 1969: 3000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Ruscha, exhibition catalog, eds. Neal Benezra and Kerry Brougher, Zürich, a.o. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is covered with a semi-transparent [[glassine]] dust jacket for protection. About fifty copies of the first edition came in a black cardboard slipcase. Apart from this, the numbering on the last page of the first edition and the details of each edition at the beginning of the book, the three are indistinguishable.

===Possible meanings===
A lot of critics have assigned a religious sub-text to the work, seeing a correlation between the gasoline stations and the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]], traditionally the staging posts between Pilate's condemnation and the burial of Christ after his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] on [[Calvary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_n5_v35/ai_19225277 Artforum Jan 1997, essay by Dave Hickey, reproduced at BNet UK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kukje.org/old_eng/artists_view.php?ex_no=42 Kukje Gallery Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Ruscha, a lapsed catholic, has gone some way to supporting this view in interviews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a connection between my work and my experience with religious icons, and the stations of the cross and the Church generally, but it's in one of method, you know; I do have some flavors that come over, like the incense... we all go through stages... the attitude comes out of a whole style of living and then coming up with statements.&lt;ref&gt;Ruscha quoted in ''I Dont Want No Retro Spective'', Hickey &amp; Plagens, Hudson Hills Press, 1982, p19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book has also been cited as an artist's book equivalent of a road movie,&lt;ref name="Retro"&gt;''I Dont Want No Retro Spective'', Hickey &amp; Plagens, Hudson Hills Press, 1982, foreword.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a pop version of [[Walker Evans]]' photographs of America, such as his deserted gasoline station in 'Highway Corner Reedsville West Virginia, 1935'. Although Ruscha has admitted knowledge of Evans' work, he has dismissed it as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ed Ruscha'', R Marshall, Phaidon, 2003, p58&lt;/ref&gt; The last image, of a Fina station, has been interpreted as a [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchampian]] pun on ''Fin'' (end).&lt;ref name="Retro"/&gt;

Originally, the book was received poorly; despite being published the same year as Ruscha's first exhibition at the [[Ferus Gallery]], Los Angeles-which also represented [[Andy Warhol]]- the book was rejected by the Library of Congress for its 'unorthodox form and supposed lack of information'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franklinbooks.com/servlet/the-749/Twentysix-Gasoline-Stations-by/Detail |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711022726/http://www.franklinbooks.com/servlet/the-749/Twentysix-Gasoline-Stations-by/Detail |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book gradually acquired cult status through the 1960s, and by the 1980s was often hailed as the first modern artist's book&lt;ref name="Drucker"/&gt; although in fact [[Dieter Roth|Dieter Roth's]] artist's books share the same mass-produced aesthetic and investigate the nature of books with at least as much formal vigour, and predate Ruscha's first publication by seven years.&lt;ref name="Drucker"/&gt; Additionally, [[Warja Honegger-Lavater|Warja Lavater's]] first book, ''William Tell'' (New York: Junior Council, [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1962 (OCLC {{OCLC search link|10911288}}), an accordion folded book written using symbols only, preceded Ruscha's ''Twentysix Gasoline Stations''.

Copies of the book are kept in public collections across the world, including [[MOMA]], [[V&amp;A]], [[Tate]], and the [[National Gallery of Australia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2810">In [[type theory]], a '''type rule''' is an [[inference rule]] that describes how a [[type system]] assigns a type to a syntactic construction. These rules may be applied by the type system to determine if a [[Computer program|program]] is well typed and what type [[Expression (computer science)|expression]]s have.  A prototypical example of the use of type rules is in defining [[type inference]] in the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], which is the [[internal language]] of [[Cartesian closed categories]].

== Notation ==
 &lt;!-- historical reference (what it the paper by Luca Cardelli that introduce this notation?) --&gt;
An expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;e\!:\!\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[typing environment]] is written as &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The notation for inference is the usual one for [[sequent]]s and [[inference rule]]s, and has the following general form

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma_1 \vdash e_1\!:\!\tau_1 \quad \cdots \quad \Gamma_n \vdash e_n\!:\!\tau_n}{\Gamma \vdash e\!:\!\tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

The sequents above the line are the premises that must be fulfilled for the rule to be applied, yielding the conclusion: the sequents below the line. This can be read as: ''if expression &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; in [[Typing environment|environment]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;i=1..n&lt;/math&gt;, then the expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; will have an environment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;''.

For example, a simple language to perform arithmetic calculations on real numbers may have the following rules

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma \vdash e_1\!:\!real \quad \Gamma \vdash e_2\!:\!real}{\Gamma \vdash e_1+e_2\!:\!real}
\qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash e_1\!:\!integer \quad \Gamma \vdash e_2 : integer}{\Gamma \vdash e_1+e_2\!:\!integer} \qquad \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

A type rule may have no premises, and usually the line is omitted in these cases. A type rule may also change an environment by adding new variables to a previous environment; for example, a declaration may have the following type rule, where a new variable &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;,
with type &lt;math&gt;\tau'&lt;/math&gt;, is added to &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma \vdash e'\!:\!\tau' \quad \Gamma, id\!:\!\tau' \vdash e\!:\!\tau}{\Gamma \vdash \text{let id = } e' \text{ in } e \text{ end} :\!\tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the syntax of the let expression is that of [[Standard ML]]. Thus type rules can be used to derive the types of composed expressions, much like in [[natural deduction]].

'''Verbal self-defense''', also known as '''verbal judo''' or '''verbal aikido''', is defined as using one's words to prevent, [[De-escalation|de-escalate]], or end an attempted assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mattingly, Katy | title= Self-Defense: Steps to Survival |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwOxP18guFgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Self+Defense%22+define&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XpHw1X4Pkb&amp;sig=XLk0_MI60hCx443y8n-P1YjW9eE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rhloTOjbB9uUOJHS8LkF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a way of using words to maintain mental and emotional safety. This kind of "conflict management" involves using posture and body language, tone of voice, and choice of words as a means for calming a potentially volatile situation before it can manifest into physical violence. This often involves techniques such as taking a [[Child time-out|time-out]], deflecting the conversation to less argumentative topics, and/or redirecting the conversation to other individuals in the group who are less passionately involved.

==Overview==
Verbal self-defense experts have widely varying definitions of what it is and how it is applied. These include everything from a person simply saying no to someone else or repeatedly refusing a request to telling someone who has violated a personal boundary what he/she ought to know. It could even entail a more complicated scenario in which a person is called on to refuse to engage verbally with someone [[psychological manipulation|manipulative]], to set limits, and to end the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mattingly, Katy | title= Self-Defense: Steps to Survival |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwOxP18guFgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Self+Defense%22+define&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XpHw1X4Pkb&amp;sig=XLk0_MI60hCx443y8n-P1YjW9eE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rhloTOjbB9uUOJHS8LkF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any definition it is always agreed that verbal self-defense is necessary as a means of enforcing [[personal boundaries]] and limits. Part of learning these skills includes learning how to identify communication triggers which cause a person to experience negative feelings and, in some cases, what those triggers represent with regards to what personal values the other person are violating.

The abusive types of communication that verbal self-defense is designed to acknowledge and deal with also vary greatly. This includes indirect forms of [[abuse]] such as  backhanded comments, and backstabbing or two-faced behaviors. As well, verbal self-defense is meant to address more commonly recognized forms of abuse such as yelling, belittling, and name calling. Going beyond verbal attacks, abusive behaviors also recognized in the field of verbal self-defense are aggressive posturing (taking a threatening posture or making a threatening gesture), physically interfering with personal belongings, and inappropriately intruding on one's personal space..

==Key components==
Most experts who write and publish articles and books on the subject of verbal self-defense identify several key elements to strong verbal self-defense skills.

* Being able to identify people, situations, and/or behaviors that induce hurtful feelings {{spaced ndash}}such as fear, inadequacy, and shame{{spaced ndash}}is important in order to know when a person needs to apply verbal tactics of defense.
* Controlling how a person responds to conflict, both mentally and emotionally, is key to applying verbal defense skills efficiently and appropriately.
* Having a general knowledge of what to say in advance offers a significant advantage for anyone using verbal self-defense. Some authors have even gone so far as to provide actual statements for people to use as a way to deal with verbally aggressive communicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Luke A|title=Verbal Aikido - Green Belt|year=2013|publisher=Createspace|location=USA|isbn=9781478198079|pages=101–106|url=http://www.verbal-aikido.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Authors and professional instructors offering seminars and workshops have differing views with regard to whether or not verbal self-defense is a form of "[[persuasion]]" and if "consequences" for the attacker should be considered a key component.

===Persuasion vs. self-defense===
In the field of verbal self-defense, the one element not entirely agreed upon is the concept that verbal defense tactics include the art of persuasion. Several authors clearly proclaim that verbal self-defense is designed as a means for persuading others; however, more recent books on the subject have denounced this commonly accepted fact.

The newer definition of verbal self-defense divides persuasion into a category of its own and states that verbal defense tactics should be more in line with the concept of physical self-defense. This idea, taken from ideologies of martial arts, puts forth the belief that verbal self-defense should only be used with respect to maintaining one's mental and emotional well-being. The position regarding self-protection in a verbal conflict and the further intention to protect the verbal assailant is posited in [[Verbal Aikido]], which aims at proposing a balanced or collaborative result wherein the attacker may save face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Verbal Aikido: The art of directing verbal attacks to a balanced outcome |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=h20TmwEACAAJ&amp;dq=1478198079 |accessdate=2013-06-11 |isbn=978-1-47819-807-9 |author1=Archer, Luke A. |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as a martial artist would not use skills against someone who was not threatening them, verbal self-defense artists should not consider their skills as a means of influencing others. The concern is that verbal self defense and "verbal manipulation" are not one and the same. Proponents of verbal self-defense as a way to influence and guide others, however, argue that skills of persuasion can be used as a way to ensure one's mental and emotional safety.

===Consequences===
The requirement for having a means to enforce "consequences" on people as a pre-requisite for effective verbal self-defense still remains questionable. Almost every author on the subject includes ways of handling non-physical aggression without having any repercussions for the attacker in the event the conflict is not solved amicably.

With specific regard to verbal self-defense in schools the concept of having consequences for bullying is considered by some to be key, where others are less focused on punishment and choose, instead, to put more emphasis on dealing with the aggressor in more positive ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marcia Frid: I Like You, I Like Me, Too! |url=http://www.marciafrid.com/ |accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this topic has only recently begun being addressed by experts in this field it remains to be seen to what degree the importance of consequences will have in handling interpersonal conflicts using verbal self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Verbal Defense Tactics: Cyber-Bullies Are Above the Law |url=http://verbaldefensetactics.com/2010/08/cyber-bullies-are-above-the-law/ |accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common approaches==
Leading authors in the area of verbal self-defense and defensive communication styles offer several different techniques for defusing potentially volatile and/or abusive situations of conflict.

===Avoidance===
Being aware of situations that will likely lead to verbal conflict or abuse and making an effort to avoid them.

===Withdrawing===
Once engaged in an argument, situation of conflict, or when being verbally attacked, making an excuse and exiting the area.

===Deflecting===
Changing topic or focus on the interaction as a means of avoiding any disagreement or negative reaction on the part of the aggressor.

===Compromise===
Openly offering ideas and seeking ways to placate the attacker and/or their reasons for the abusive communication.

===Verbal Aikido===
A means of communication that is based on the aikido philosophy and martial way, created and propagated by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] during the 20th century. It is a style of [[conflict management]] and resolution that involves treating the 'attacker' as a partner rather than an adversary. The techniques practised by Aikidoists aim at restoring a balanced [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal dynamic]] and/or reaching a positive emotional result in an [[Conversation|exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Pace &amp; Kyeli Smith [http://usualerror.com/e-book/verbal-aikido/] ''The usual error'' Ch.28 - Verbal Aikido (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a common teaching of this communication style, developed by Luke Archer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbal-aikido.com Verbal Aikdio website]&lt;/ref&gt; the approach is simplified into three steps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbal-aikido.com/articles-and-exercises/managing-conflict-with-the-three-steps/ Managing conflict with the Three Steps]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Receiving the attack with an 'Inner Smile'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbal-aikido.com/articles-and-exercises/so-whats-this-inner-smile-about-anyway/ What's this Inner Smile about anyway?]&lt;/ref&gt; (a serene inner-confidence)
# Accompanying the attacker with verbal ''[[Irimi]]'' until destabilization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Luke A.|title=Verbal Aikido - The art of directing verbal attacks to a balanced outcome|year=2013|publisher=Createspace|location=USA|isbn=9781478198079|pages=35–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Proposing ''Ai-ki'' (an energy balance)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Luke A.|title=Verbal Aikido - The art of directing verbal attacks to a balanced outcome|year=2013|publisher=Createspace|location=USA|isbn=9781478198079|pages=53–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the methods and exercises taught in Verbal Aikido training, the practitioner works on developing a sense of [[self-control]], an [[assertive]] style of communication, and the practice of deliberate intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Luke A.|title=Verbal Aikido - The art of directing attacks to a balanced outcome (Green Belt)|year=2013|publisher=Createspace|location=USA|isbn=9781478198079|pages=3–4, 63–65|url=http://www.verbal-aikido.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Websites and news stories stating the rise in bullying in the workplace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NoBullying: What is Workplace Bullying? |url=http://www.nobullying.com/what-is-workplace-bullying/| accessdate= April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the playground&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NoBullying: Bullying Statistics |url=http://www.nobullying.com/bullying-statistics/|accessdate= April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to a recent increase in awareness of the art of verbal self-defense. Considered a form of communication, verbal self-defense has become a sought after skill in schools and workplaces around the world as a way to counter this unhealthy trend.

Incidents of school and workplace shootings have put strong emphasis on being more aware of bullying, and consequently the need for a means to respond to such events have led to a growth in the field of verbal self-defense. Today, more and more individuals are presenting themselves as verbal self-defense experts and offering individual and corporate training, both on and off line, as a way to battle bullying at school, in the workplace and on the Internet.

===Workplace bullying===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
With the increased awareness of bullying in the workplace, it has become necessary for companies and organizations to ensure they meet the requirements of due diligence with regard to maintaining a safe work environment. U.S. and international laws have even gone so far as to recognize workplace bullying as its own form of harassment. Today, it is becoming common for businesses in almost every industry around the world to start providing their staff and employees with training designed to address and minimize the effects from incidents of workplace bullying.

===School bullying===
{{Main|School bullying}}
Since the school-shooting incident in Columbine there has been greater emphasis on stopping acts of school-yard bullying. Many educational institutions around the world have implemented anti-bullying campaigns with great success. In each of these campaigns it is common to find at least one of the anti-bullying tactics specifically addressing the need for victims of bullying to say something as a way to verbally defend themselves.

===Cyberbullying===
{{Main|Cyberbullying}}
In written form, verbal self-defense is meant to address concepts such as cyberbullying. This includes addressing hostile and hurtful messages posted on social networks such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]], as well as in online forums and chat rooms. With ongoing investigations into teen [[bullycide]]s (a suicide caused as the result of depression from bullying, especially children) finding more than ever before the link directly to cyberbullying by classmates, the need of verbal self-defense skills for teens has led to a number of new books specifically addressing this subject.

==Influential contributors==
Several people are considered to be significant contributors to the field of verbal self-defense. These include people who were early pioneers to advocate for the importance of verbal defense skills, developers of new techniques for verbally defensive tactics, and internationally recognized and known trainers.

* [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] (1936–2015), the author of ''The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense'', was one of the earliest writers to use the term. She states that verbal self-defense defends against the eight most common types of verbal violence, and redirect and defuse potential verbal confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqgT2Be70JwC&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Self+Defense%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wFbvfJPrXj&amp;sig=gSxpvuqUwfQJb3otRlKz6khYHnM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DCZoTOKVEo_LONyizLgF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAzgK | publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* George Thompson (1941–2011), author of ''Verbal Judo'', advanced the field of verbal self-defense by breaking down how to apply the techniques for de-escalation and defusing used by professionally trained police officers. He was one of the leading experts in verbal self-defense tactics and trained law-enforcement agencies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Verbal Judo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jJemY_31AYC&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Judo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Gl1tTIi8A4P0tgPLwbCkCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA | publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Daniel Scott, author of ''Verbal Self Defense for The Workplace'', more recently combined self-defense concepts with the language patterns of neuro linguistic programming in order to develop a new form of verbal self-defense. His new six-step model for verbal self-defense includes all the main components necessary for people to defend themselves against bullies and aggressive people in the work place and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Verbal Self Defense for the Workplace |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=128qQwAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Dr+Daniel+Scott%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OHhoTOLIMt_U4wbh9KmZBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA | publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's work''' or '''woman's work''' is [[Manual labour|work]] believed to be exclusively the domain of women and associates particular tasks with the [[female]] gender. It is particularly used with regard to work that a mother or wife will perform within a family and household. (See [[Division_of_labour#Gendered_division_of_labour|gendered division of labour]].)
Related concepts include [[gender role]], [[wage labour]] and [[employment]], female [[workforce]], and [[women's rights]] (cf. [[Gender role#Gender roles and feminism|Gender roles and feminism]]). The term may be [[pejorative]], when applied to [[men]] performing roles which are largely designated for women. 

The term "women's work" may indicate a role with children as defined by [[nature]] in that only women are biologically capable of performing them: [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and [[breastfeeding]]. It may also refer to professions that involve these functions: [[midwife]] and [[wet nurse]]. "Women's work" may also refer to roles in [[raising children]] particularly within the home: [[diaper]] changing and related [[hygiene]], [[toilet training]], [[bathing]], clothing, feeding, monitoring, and education with regard to [[personal care]]. It may also refer to professions that include these functions such as that of: [[teacher]] (up to the age of puberty), [[governess]], [[nanny]], [[day care]] worker, and [[au pair]]. "Women's work" may also refer to roles related to [[housekeeping]] such as: [[cooking]], [[sewing]], [[ironing]], and '''cleaning'''.  It may also refer to professions that include these functions such as: [[maid]] and [[cook (domestic worker)|cook]]. Though much of "women's work" is indoors, some is outdoors such as: fetching water, [[grocery]] shopping or food [[foraging]], and [[gardening]]. 

By contrast, "men's work" involves the usage of [[Physical strength|strength]] or work outdoors, also considered macro power which is defined as public sphere power; mechanical, electrical or electronic knowledge and skill; employment ("bread-winning", "bringing home the bacon"); most dealings with money; or higher reasoning to perform tasks. The term micro power refers to men having greater power in the home; which means that it is easier for men to avoid house work and care labor. Micro power may also be a tool men use to prevent women from entering the workforce. When women are kept in the private sphere, men remain the sole provider financially, which provides headway in American society. Among some people, men's work is considered to be the opposite of "women's work" and thus does not include activities within the home or with children, though "men's work" traditionally includes work that involves both (such as repairing appliances and disciplining children).
