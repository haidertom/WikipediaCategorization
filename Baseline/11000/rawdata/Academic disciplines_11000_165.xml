'''BHDL''' is method of correct design of digital circuit. It combines the advantages of [[VHDL]], the well-known language of circuit design, with the power of [[B method]] that guarantees the correct design (w.r.t. a [[formal specification]]). This allows avoiding the design test since it is ”correct by proven construction”.
==Relation between VHDL and B method==
The relation between the abstract machine and the refinement in [[B method]] in a B project seems like the Entity-Architecture relation in a [[VHDL]] project. In BHDL, from an enriched [[VHDL]] notation, the main structure is captured and communicated to the main formal model in order to prove the consistency of the structure and the coherence in relation to the abstract architecture and with the other components of the system.
From the graphical tool, VGUI, the main structure of the system is created. Then, two different notations are generated [[VHDL]] and B. The produced [[B method]] code contains the main features of [[VHDL]] one. After that, design may be separated in relation to the techno-logic choices. For more flexibility, designer may write directly the enriched [[VHDL]] notation.

'''Baldwin Wallace University''' is a four-year private, [[coeducational]], [[liberal arts college]] in [[Berea, Ohio]], United States. The school was founded in 1845 as [[Baldwin Institute]] by [[Methodism|Methodist]] settlers. Eventually the school merged with nearby German Wallace College in 1913 to become Baldwin–Wallace College. {{as of|2012|July|1|df=US}} the school became Baldwin Wallace University.&lt;ref name="BW University"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berger DuMound,|first=Joanne|title=Berea's Baldwin-Wallace College will become Baldwin Wallace University|url=http://www.cleveland.com/berea/index.ssf/2012/02/baldwin-wallace_college_will_b.html|accessdate=February 11, 2012|date=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution offers a number of undergraduate and several graduate programs. Baldwin Wallace University is often referred to as simply "BW".

Both the university and the town of [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] were founded by [[Methodism|Methodist]] settlers from [[Connecticut]]. These settlers moved west after their homes were burned by the British in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The region in Northern [[Ohio]] became known as the [[Western Reserve]] (a part of which was designated the [[Firelands]], as the state of [[Connecticut]] gave land grants to these fire victims). Among early settlers of this area was [[John Baldwin (educator)|John Baldwin]]. Baldwin enjoyed early success in the [[sandstone]] [[quarry]] industry. He eventually founded Baldwin Institute in 1845. Baldwin Institute became [[Baldwin University]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gesink|first1=Indira Falk|title=Barefoot Millionaire:  John Baldwin and the Founding Values of Baldwin Wallace University|date=2013|publisher=Baldwin Wallace University|location=Berea, Ohio|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin's sense of equality led to the school accepting any student regardless of race or gender,&lt;ref name=bwhis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bw.edu/quickfacts/history|title=B-W: History of Baldwin Wallace University|accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first in the nation to do so. Moreover, Baldwin University's courses were not segregated. The surge of German workers in Baldwin's sandstone quarries led to the establishment of a German department at the Institute.

The Reverend Jacob Rothweiler, a professor at Baldwin University, named his project after [[James Wallace (benefactor)|James Wallace]], and [[German Wallace College]] was founded in 1855. Students at both institutions were free to enroll in courses at Baldwin or German Wallace. Baldwin and Wallace were the primary benefactors to the two Berea colleges. After their deaths, and the decline of the quarry industry in Ohio, Baldwin University came close to financial ruin. Options were thin, and the [[United Methodist Church]] considered merging the schools with the more successful [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1874, to form the University of Cleveland. The University of Cleveland concept was abandoned for a more elegant solution. Baldwin University and German Wallace College merged in 1913 to form Baldwin–Wallace College.

The college's present day campus can be much accredited to the leadership of [[Alfred Bryan Bonds]]; through much of the mid-20th century, Baldwin Wallace grew to be a large and well respected suburban institution. Bonds oversaw the construction of fifteen buildings on campus during his 26-year tenure. [[Neal Malicky]]'s tenure as college president stabilized the college's finances and endowment, finally placing Baldwin Wallace in financial security after years of financial struggle. Following Malicky's presidency, Mark Collier served as president for seven years, overseeing a campus master plan that has led to many major renovations on campus. In recent years the college has expanded and renovated residence halls and academic buildings. In addition, the college has purchased existing buildings in the [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] community for academic and student residential use.

In the fall of 2011, a task force was developed by BW President Dick Durst. On February 11, 2012, it was announced that Baldwin–Wallace College would become Baldwin Wallace University after approval by the BW Board of Trustees. The name would become effective on July 1 of 2012, with complete implementation by the end of 2012. In addition to the new university designation, seal, and logo, "B-W" would drop the hyphen in its name.&lt;ref name="BW University"/&gt;

In recent years, BW has been a stopping point for political candidates.  During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential campaign]], BW hosted eventual President [[Barack Obama]] and 2008 Presidential candidate [[John McCain]].

[[File:Wheeler Hall Baldwin Wallace University.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Wheeler Hall is one of several buildings part of the North Campus Historic District]]
The campus is located in [[Berea, Ohio]], a suburb of [[Cleveland]], Ohio. The campus is built around land that originally was two separate schools that combined in 1913. The campus itself is located next to [[Berea High School]] and is integrated into the neighborhoods of Berea.  The majority of the Campus that exists today was expanded in the 1960s and 1970s. BW prides itself on its many green spaces around campus, such as the North Quad where residence halls, Ritter Library, and academic buildings surround a large field with sidewalks. Buildings that surround the quad include Malicky Center, Wheeler Hall, The Life &amp; Earth Science building, the Center for Innovation and Growth, the Observatory, the President's house, several residence halls and the Alumni Wall. During the presidency of Alfred Bryan Bonds, the Alumni Wall (located behind North Hall) was created to recognize alumni who have contributed to the development of the campus. The North Quad is also home to a diverse tree collection, a Greenhouse, a native Ohio plants garden and a commons area (located behind Lang Hall). In 2009, BW opened the Thomas Family Center for Science and Innovation. The project connected the Life &amp; Earth Science building and Wilker Hall.

Lou Higgins Center is home to the physical education department, athletics, and recreational sports and services. The Lou Higgins Center was renovated and expanded in 2005. Beyond Varsity Athletics, Baldwin Wallace offers club sports, Intramurals, Aerobic Classes, a Fitness Center and Weight Room. Higgins Center is home to many of the athletic offices, along with Bagley Hall. Bagley Hall was originally owned by the [[Cleveland Browns]] and was used as the team's summer training facility. After the Browns left for Baltimore, the university converted the facility into a residence hall.  In 2012, Bagley Hall was converted into athletic offices.

Baldwin Wallace's [[College football|football]] team was coached by [[Lee Tressel]], who led the team to an undefeated record in 1978, and subsequently the [[NCAA Division III Football Championship|NCAA Division III Championship]]. In 2008, the [[artificial turf|athletic turf]] on George Finnie Stadium was renovated and named "[[Tressel Field]]" in honor of the [[Jim Tressel|Tressel Family]].

Perhaps the most notable BW athlete from the 20th century was [[Harrison Dillard]], the only male so far to win Olympic titles in both [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]] and [[hurdling]] events, in the [[1948 Summer Olympics]]. The teams of the [[Sidney High School (Ohio)|Sidney High School]] Yellow Jackets were named after Baldwin Wallace graduate Granville Robinson became Head Coach at Sidney High School.

In 2009, after almost 20 years of use, BW adopted a new logo and modified the mascot for the athletic teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bw.edu/news/newstinger/ B-W: Stinger Has a new Look] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112095639/http://www.bw.edu/news/newstinger/ |date=January 12, 2010 }}.

[[File:Ballpits530.jpg|thumb|right|A child playing in a ball pit]] 
A '''ball pit''' (originally called "'''ball crawl'''" and also known as a '''ball pool''' or '''ball pond''') is a padded box or pool filled with small colorful hollow plastic balls generally no larger than {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter. Instead of balls, other spherical objects can be used, such as balloons. It is typically employed as a recreation and exercise for children.

[[File:Bollhav.jpg|thumb|A ball pit as part of a larger play area]]
Ball pits are often found at nurseries, [[carnival]]s, [[amusement park]]s, [[Family fun center|fun center]]s, [[fast-food restaurants]], and large [[video arcade]]s.  [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] and (now defunct) [[Discovery Zone]] formerly had ball pits and they were frequently incorporated into larger play structures, such as [[maze]]s, [[Playground slide|slide]]s, and [[jungle gym]]s.

Ball pits may be rented for [[party|parties]], and smaller versions are sold for use in the home. While ball pits are traditionally intended for children, some are large enough to accommodate [[adult]]s.

Ball pits may be used together with a [[trampoline]], or combining the two by filling a closed trampoline with the balls.

==Urban legends==
Beginning in the late 1990s, a number of [[urban legend]]s arose about children being severely injured or even killed due to ball-pit encounters with venomous [[snake]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blsnakes.htm|title=Snakes in the Ball Pit - Urban Legends|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[hypodermic needle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blneedle.htm|title=Needles Hidden Under Gas Pump Handles Are an Urban Legend|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no truth to these stories,&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20010831/bounce-carefully-in-ball-pit#1|title=Bounce Carefully in the Ball Pit|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers have reported finding dirty diapers, half-eaten food and syringes in ball pits.&lt;ref name="webmd"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the ''[[Rugrats]]'' episode, "Piggy's Pizza Palace", the Rugrats jump on a costumed pig named Piggy as an act of revenge to get Angelica's tickets back. Thus, it caused the ball pit structure to split right open and all of the balls fall out all over the restaurant. 

In season 3 episode 14, ("The Einstein Approximation") of the TV series ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', Sheldon seeks inspiration in a ball pit at a [[shopping mall|mall]], and then hides from Leonard, who becomes frustrated as he spends a good amount of time and effort trying to retrieve Sheldon from the ball pit, but Sheldon keeps saying "Bazinga".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=VanDerWerff|first1=Todd|title=The Big Bang Theory: “The Einstein Approximation”|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/the-big-bang-theory-the-einstein-approximation-37774|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Potts|first1=Kimberly|title=Every Inside Joke on The Big Bang Theory, Alphabetized|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/big-bang-theory-inside-jokes-alphabetized.html|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a [[YouTube]] vlogger under the name ''[[Roman Atwood]]'' made a video of transforming the living room of his home into a massive ball pit, intended as a prank for his girlfriend who has returned from a trip. He later collaborates with another vlogger,  [[Freddie Wong]], to create a comedy video involving giant ball pit and "ball monster" prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waxman|first1=Olivia B.|title=Watch a Guy Surprise His Girlfriend by Turning Their House into a Giant Ball Pit|url=http://time.com/3674421/house-ball-pit-prank/|accessdate=August 25, 2016|work=TIME.com|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a pop-up "ball pit bar" opened in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/san-francisco-ball-pit-bar-is-latest-in-line-of-th.html|title=San Francisco "Ball Pit Bar" Is the Latest Crazy Themed Bar|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Staatliches Bauhaus''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtaːtlɪçəs ˈbaʊˌhaʊs|lang|Staatliches Bauhaus.oga|listen}}), commonly known as the '''Bauhaus''', was a [[Germany|German]] [[art school]] operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught.&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, pp. 64-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bauhaus was founded by [[Walter Gropius]] in [[Weimar]]. The German term ''[[wikt:Bauhaus#German|Bauhaus]]''—literally "building house"—was understood as meaning "School of Building", but in spite of its name and the fact that its founder was an [[architect]], the Bauhaus did not have an [[architecture]] department during its first years of existence. Nonetheless, it was founded with the idea of creating a "total" work of art ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) in which all arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, [[Modern architecture|Modernist architecture]] and art, design and architectural education.&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=James Stevens Curl |editor=Pevsner, Nikolaus |others=Fleming, John; Honour, Hugh |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=1999 |type=Paperback |edition=5th |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=0-14-051323-X |pages=880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, [[industrial design]], and [[typography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bauhaus Movemen |url=http://www.bauhaus-movement.com/en/ |website=Rethinking the world Art and Technology – A new Unity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school existed in three German cities: [[Weimar]] from 1919 to 1925, [[Dessau]] from 1925 to 1932, and [[Berlin]] from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: [[Walter Gropius]] from 1919 to 1928, [[Hannes Meyer]] from 1928 to 1930, and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=...] |first=[contributors Rachel Barnes |title=The 20th-Century art book. |year=2001 |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0714835420 |edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school, and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it.

==Bauhaus and German modernism==
[[File:מוזיאון הבאוהאוס1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Bauhaus Museum, Tel Aviv]]]]
{{details|New Objectivity (architecture)}}
Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], the fall of the [[House of Hohenzollern|German monarchy]] and the abolition of censorship under the new, liberal [[Weimar Republic]] allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the [[Russian Revolution]], such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''The Coming of the Third Reich'', p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Just as important was the influence of the 19th century English designer [[William Morris]], who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function.&lt;ref&gt;''Funk and Wagnall's New Encyclopaedia'', Vol 5, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.

However, the most important influence on Bauhaus was [[modernism]], a cultural movement whose origins lay as early as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus—the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that [[mass production]] was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit—were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers' organization [[Deutscher Werkbund]] was formed in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]] to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany's economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).

[[File:Bauhaus Chemnitz hb.JPG|right|thumb|Bauhaus building in [[Chemnitz]]]]
The entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neues Bauen]]. Beginning in June 1907, [[Peter Behrens]]' pioneering [[industrial design]] work for the German electrical company [[AEG]] successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark [[AEG Turbine Factory]], and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] worked for him in this period.

The Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German [[zeitgeist]] had turned from emotional [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]] to the matter-of-fact [[New Objectivity]]. An entire group of working architects, including [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], turned away from fanciful experimentation, and turned toward rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise of a "minimal dwelling" written into the new [[Weimar Constitution]]. [[Ernst May]], Bruno Taut and [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]], among others, built large housing blocks in [[Frankfurt]] and Berlin. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the [[Weissenhof Estate]], films, and sometimes fierce public debate.

===Bauhaus and Vkhutemas===
{{Main article|Vkhutemas}}
The Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in [[Moscow]], has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;{{ru icon}} ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia; Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya'', [https://archive.is/20050503051137/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/304.htm ''Вхутемас'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a basic course in aesthetic principles, courses in [[color theory]], industrial design, and architecture.&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt; Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Paul (1999) ''The Challenge of the Avant-Garde''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]] {{ISBN|0-300-07762-9}}, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; but it was less publicised outside the [[Soviet Union]] and consequently, is less familiar in [[Western culture|the West]].&lt;ref name="Fry1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tony Fry |title=A New Design Philosophy: An Introduction to Defuturing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEc7UGv2xQEC |accessdate=15 May 2011 |date=October 1999 |publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=978-0-86840-753-1 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Colton, Timothy J. (1995) ''Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press {{ISBN|0-674-58749-9}}; p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, [[El Lissitzky]]'s book ''Russia: an Architecture for World Revolution'' published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects there.

==History of the Bauhaus==
===Weimar===
The school was founded by Walter Gropius in [[Weimar]] in 1919, as a merger of the [[Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School]] and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art. Its roots lay in the arts and crafts school founded by the [[William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in 1906, and directed by Belgian [[Art Nouveau]] architect [[Henry van de Velde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=James Stevens Curl |editor=Pevsner, Nikolaus |others=Fleming, John; Honour, Hugh |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=1999 |type=Paperback |edition=5th |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius, [[Hermann Obrist]] and [[August Endell]] as possible successors. In 1919, after delays caused by the destruction of [[World War I]] and a lengthy debate over who should head the institution and the socio-economic meanings of a reconciliation of the [[fine art]]s and the [[applied art]]s (an issue which remained a defining one throughout the school's existence), Gropius was made the director of a new institution integrating the two called the Bauhaus.&lt;ref name="Frampton 1992 124"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frampton |first=Kenneth |title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History |year=1992 |edition=3rd ed. rev. |publisher=Thames and Hudson, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-500-20257-5 |page=124 |chapter=The Bauhaus: Evolution of an Idea 1919–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled ''Exhibition of Unknown Architects'', Gropius proclaimed his goal as being "to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist." Gropius' [[neologism]] ''Bauhaus'' references both building and the Bauhütte, a [[premodern]] [[guild]] of stonemasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Whitford, Frank |title=The Bauhaus: Masters &amp; Students by Themselves |year=1992 |publisher=Conran Octopus |location=London |isbn=1-85029-415-1 |page=32 |quote=He invented the name 'Bauhaus' not only because it specifically referred to bauen ('building', 'construction')—but also because of its similarity to the word Bauhütte, the medieval guild of builders and stonemasons out of which Freemasonry sprang. The Bauhaus was to be a kind of modern Bauhütte, therefore, in which craftsmen would work on common projects together, the greatest of which would be buildings in which the arts and crafts would be combined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early intention was for the Bauhaus to be a combined architecture school, crafts school, and academy of the arts. Swiss painter [[Johannes Itten]], German-American painter [[Lyonel Feininger]], and German sculptor [[Gerhard Marcks]], along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1919. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor and designer [[Oskar Schlemmer]] who headed the theater workshop, and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]], joined in 1922 by Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter [[Theo van Doesburg]] to Weimar to promote ''[[De Stijl]]'' ("The Style"), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect [[El Lissitzky]].&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hal Foster |others=Rosalind Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, Benjamin Buchloh |title=Art Since 1900: Volume 1—1900 to 1944|year=2004 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-500-28534-9 |pages=185–189 |chapter=1923: The Bauhaus … holds its first public exhibition in Weimar, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bauhaus weimar.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the [[Bauhaus-University Weimar]] (built 1904–1911; designed by [[Henry van de Velde]] to house the sculptors’ studio at the Grand Ducal Saxon Art School; designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996)]]
[[File:Weimarbauhaus6.jpg|thumb|Foyer of the Bauhaus-University Weimar, with [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] staircase]]
From 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of [[Johannes Itten]], who taught the ''Vorkurs'' or "preliminary course" that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus.&lt;ref name="Frampton 1992 124" /&gt; Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of [[Franz Cižek]] and [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]]. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in [[Munich]], as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]]. The influence of German [[Expressionism]] favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of [[Der Blaue Reiter]] founding member [[Wassily Kandinsky]] to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1922. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer [[László Moholy-Nagy]], who rewrote the ''Vorkurs'' with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favored by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907, when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while [[Hermann Muthesius]] had begun implementing industrial prototypes.&lt;ref name="foster" /&gt;

Gropius was not necessarily against [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this "new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery", described "painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future." By 1923, however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture#Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics|Romanesque cathedrals]] and the craft-driven aesthetic of the "[[Völkisch movement]]", instead declaring "we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=1987 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-586694-4 |pages=309–316 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called ''Bauhaus'' and a series of books called "Bauhausbücher". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bauhaus, 1919–1933 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm |website=The MET |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bauhaus |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Bauhaus |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weimar was in the German state of [[Thuringia]], and the Bauhaus school received state support from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]]-controlled Thuringian state government. The school in Weimar experienced political pressure from conservative circles in Thuringian politics, increasingly so after 1923 as political tension rose. One condition placed on the Bauhaus in this new political environment was the exhibition of work undertaken at the school. This condition was met in 1923 with the Bauhaus' exhibition of the experimental [[Haus am Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackermann et al., Bauhaus (Cologne: Könemann, 1999), 406.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school's funding in half. The Bauhaus issued a press release on 26 December 1924, setting the closure of the school for the end of March 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Baumgartner and Josef Helfenstein [http://www.paulkleezentrum.ch/ww/en/pub/web_root/act/wissenschaftliches_archiv/werkphasen/am_bauhaus_in_weimar_1921_1924.cfm At the Bauhaus in Weimar, 1921–1924] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929012710/http://www.paulkleezentrum.ch/ww/en/pub/web_root/act/wissenschaftliches_archiv/werkphasen/am_bauhaus_in_weimar_1921_1924.cfm |date=29 September 2009}}, at Zentrum Paul Klee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Droste (2002) [1990] [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXB8rX5AsgUC ''Bauhaus, 1919–1933''] p.113&lt;/ref&gt; At this point it had already been looking for alternative sources of funding. After the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, a school of industrial design with teachers and staff less antagonistic to the conservative political regime remained in Weimar. This school was eventually known as the Technical University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and in 1996 changed its name to [[Bauhaus-University Weimar]].

===Dessau===
Gropius's design for the [[Dessau]] facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] lines of the [[Fagus Factory]] than the stripped down [[Neoclassical architecture#Regional trends|Neo-classical]] of the Werkbund pavilion or the ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' Sommerfeld House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=2000 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-586694-4 |page=120 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Dessau years, there was a remarkable change in direction for the school. According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect [[Mart Stam]] to run the newly founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam's friend and colleague in the ABC group, Hannes Meyer.

Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928,&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"/&gt; and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.

But Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program, and forced the resignations of [[Herbert Bayer]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn't want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard A. Etlin |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTYQuQ2g36MC |accessdate=15 May 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-22086-4 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dessau city council attempted to convince Gropius to return as head of the school, but Gropius instead suggested [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Mies was appointed in 1930, and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. He halted the school's manufacture of goods so that the school could focus on teaching, and appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant [[Lilly Reich]]. By 1931, the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]]  (Nazi Party) was becoming more influential in German politics. When it gained control of the Dessau city council, it moved to close the school.&lt;ref name="Mies"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Spaeth |title=Ludwig Mies van der Rohe |year=1985 |publisher=Rizzoli New York |isbn=0-8478-0563-8 |pages=87–93}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 June 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin===
In late 1932, Mies rented a derelict factory in Berlin (Birkbusch Street 49) to use as the new Bauhaus with his own money. The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the [[Gestapo]] closed down the Berlin school. Mies protested the decision, eventually speaking to the head of the Gestapo, who agreed to allow the school to re-open. However, shortly after receiving a letter permitting the opening of the Bauhaus, Mies and the other faculty agreed to voluntarily shut down the school {{when|date=July 2017}}.&lt;ref name="Mies"/&gt;

Although neither the Nazi Party nor [[Adolf Hitler]] had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like [[Wilhelm Frick]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] had already labeled the Bauhaus "un-German" and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, a number of communist students loyal to Meyer moved to the [[Soviet Union]] when he was fired in 1930.

Even before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its "[[degenerate art]]", and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish influences of "cosmopolitan modernism".&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"/&gt; Despite Gropius's protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933. Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the "New Bauhaus" of Chicago:&lt;ref&gt;Jardi, Enric (1991) ''Paul Klee''. Rizzoli Intl Pubns, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Mies decided to emigrate to the United States for the directorship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]) in Chicago and to seek building commissions.{{Ref label|fn_1|a|a}} The simple engineering-oriented functionalism of stripped-down modernism, however, did lead to some Bauhaus influences living on in [[Nazi Germany]]. When Hitler's chief engineer, [[Fritz Todt]], began opening the new [[autobahn]] (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were "bold examples of modernism"—among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'', 325&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural output==
The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bauhausmanifesto.com |title= Manifesto of the Staatliches Bauhaus |author=Gropius, Walter |date=April 1919 |work=BauhausManifesto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), he and his partner [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in [[Jena]], and the competition design for the [[Chicago Tribune Tower]], which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 [[Haus am Horn]], student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.

In the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed "Laubenganghäuser" (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer's approach was to research users' needs and scientifically develop the design solution.

[[Mies van der Rohe]] repudiated Meyer's politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius's "study of essentials", and Meyer's research into user requirements, Mies advocated a "spatial implementation of intellectual decisions", which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither Mies van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.

The popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]] and particularly [[Ernst May]], as the city architects of Berlin, [[Dresden]] and [[Frankfurt]] respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in [[Weimar Germany]]. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop [[Onkel Toms Hütte (Berlin U-Bahn)|Onkel Toms Hütte]], is still occupied.

==Impact==
[[File:Olivetti-schawinsky-bauhaus-typewriter.jpg|thumb|Typewriter ''Olivetti Studio 42'' designed by the Bauhaus-alumnus [[Xanti Schawinsky]] in 1936]]
The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, the United States, Canada and [[Israel]] in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by, the Nazi regime. Tel Aviv in 2004 was named to the list of [[world heritage]] sites by the UN due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3777385.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Unesco celebrates Tel Aviv |date=8 June 2004 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1096 |title=White City of Tel-Aviv -- the Modern Movement |first=UNESCO World Heritage |last=Centre |website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had some 4,000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 onwards.

In 1928, the Hungarian painter Alexander Bortnyik founded a school of design in [[Budapest]] called Miihely (also "Muhely"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Late Modern: The Visual Arts Since 1945'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1976, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Mugely"&lt;ref&gt;William Chapin Seitz, Marla Price, ''Art in the Age of Aquarius'', Smithsonian Inst Press, 1992, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;), which means "the studio".&lt;ref name="Gaston Diehl 1972, p. 12"&gt;Gaston Diehl, ''Vasarely'', New York: Crown, 1972, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the seventh floor of a house on Nagymezo Street,&lt;ref name="Gaston Diehl 1972, p. 12"/&gt; it was meant to be the Hungarian equivalent to the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, ''History of Abstract Painting'', Paris: Hazan, 1989, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The literature sometimes refers to it—in an oversimplified manner—as "the Budapest Bauhaus".&lt;ref&gt;See: William Chapin Seitz, Marla Price, ''Art in the Age of Aquarius'', Smithsonian Inst Press, 1992, p. 92; Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Late Modern: The Visual Arts Since 1945'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1976, p. 164; Jean Louis Ferrier, Yann Le Pichon, Art of our century: the story of western art, 1900 to the present 1990, London : Longman, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Bortnyik was a great admirer of [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and had met Walter Gropius in Weimar between 1923 and 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Guitemie Maldonaldo, "Une réception différée et relayée. L'Atelier d'art abstrait et le "modèle-Bauhaus", 1950–1953", in: Martin Schieder, Isabelle Ewig, ''In die Freiheit geworfen: Positionen zur deutsch-französischen Kunstgeschichte nach 1945'', Oldenbourg Verlag, 22 Nov 2006, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Moholy-Nagy himself taught at the Miihely. [[Victor Vasarely]], a pioneer of [[Op Art]], studied at this school before establishing in Paris in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Louis Ferrier, Yann Le Pichon, ''Art of Our Century: The Story of Western Art, 1900 to the Present'', 1990, London: Longman, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Gropius, [[Marcel Breuer]], and Moholy-Nagy re-assembled in Britain during the mid 1930s to live and work in the [[Isokon]] project before the war caught up with them. Gropius and Breuer went to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced The Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the [[Alan I W Frank House]] in Pittsburgh, among other projects. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as [[Philip Johnson]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Lawrence Halprin]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], among many others.

In the late 1930s, [[Mies van der Rohe]] re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential [[Philip Johnson]], and became one of the pre-eminent architects in the world. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the [[New Bauhaus]] school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist [[Walter Paepcke]]. This school became the [[Institute of Design IIT|Institute of Design]], part of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. Printmaker and painter [[Werner Drewes]] was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both [[Columbia University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. [[Herbert Bayer]], sponsored by Paepcke, moved to [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], Colorado in support of Paepcke's Aspen projects at the [[Aspen Institute]]. In 1953, [[Max Bill]], together with [[Inge Scholl|Inge Aicher-Scholl]] and [[Otl Aicher]], founded the [[Ulm School of Design]] (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung—HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of [[semiotics]] as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the "Ulm Model" concept continues to influence international design education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/|title=HfG-Archiv Ulm - The HfG Ulm|first=Ulmer Museum/HfG-Archiv|last=Ulm|website=www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus ''Vorkurs'' (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, H., Gropius, W., &amp; Gropius, I. (Eds.). (1975). ''Bauhaus 1919–1928''. London: Secker&amp; Warburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Itten 1963"&gt;Itten, J. (1963). ''Design and Form: The Basic Course at the Bauhaus and Later'' (Revised edition, 1975). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the ''Vorkurs'' and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that "A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, can design anything from a dress to a kitchen stove".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2013). "The Shillito Design School: Australia's link with the Bauhaus". ''The International Journal of Design in Society'', 6(3), 149–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of [[modern furniture]] design. The ubiquitous [[Cantilever chair]] and the [[Wassily Chair]] designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer [[Mart Stam]] over the rights to the cantilever chair patent. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, thus leading to the patent dispute.) The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.

The physical plant at Dessau survived [[World War II]] and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of ''Bauhausbühne'' ("Bauhaus Stage"). After [[German reunification]], a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/en/|title=Bauhaus Dessau|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.

Later evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of "… the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature…Home hygiene without home atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;Schjeldahl, Peter, "Bauhaus Rules," ''The New Yorker'', November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===The White City===
The [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]] ({{lang-he|העיר הלבנה}}, ''Ha-Ir HaLevana'') refers to a collection of over 4,000 Bauhaus or [[International style (architecture)|International style]] buildings built in [[Tel Aviv]] from the 1930s by [[German Jewish]] architects who emigrated to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] after the rise of the [[Nazis]]. Tel Aviv has the largest number of buildings in this style of any city in the world. In 2003, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) proclaimed Tel Aviv's ''White City'' a [[World Heritage Site|World Cultural Heritage site]], as "an outstanding example of new town planning and architecture in the early 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], [http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/718 ''Decision Text''], World Heritage Centre, retrieved 14 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2000, [[Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv]] is an organization dedicated to the ongoing documentation of the architectural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/965644.html "The Bauhaus Center"], ''Haaretz'', 18 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it hosted an exhibition on preservation of the architecture that showcased 25 buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Zandberg, [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/objects/pages/PrintArticle.jhtml?itemNo=350188 ''Exhibition on Preservation of Bauhaus in Tel Aviv''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605095415/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/objects/pages/PrintArticle.jhtml?itemNo=350188 |date=5 June 2011 }}, Haaretz, 15 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; To further the architectural culture in the city, a small [[Bauhaus Museum]] opened in Tel Aviv in 2008, designed by Israeli architect [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]].&lt;ref&gt;Esther Hecht, [http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/080421bauhaus.asp "Bauhaus Museum Opens in Tel Aviv's White City"], ''Architectural Record'', 21 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bachar, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/949759.html "Surroundings / Daniella Luxembourg's Bauhaus kiosk"], ''Haaretz'', 1 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Building design''' refers to the broadly based [[architecture|architectural]], [[Architectural engineering|engineering]] and [[Technology|technical]] applications to the [[design]] of [[building]]s. All building projects require the services of a building designer, typically a licensed [[architect]] or [[structural engineer]]. Smaller, less complicated projects often do not require a licensed professional, and the design of such projects is often undertaken by building designers, draftspersons, [[interior designers]] (for interior fit-outs or renovations), or [[General contractor|contractor]]s. Larger, more complex building projects require the services of many professionals trained in specialist disciplines, usually coordinated by an architect.

== Occupations ==

===Architect===
{{main|Architect}}
An architect is a person trained in the planning, design and supervision of the construction of buildings. Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. In most of the world's jurisdictions, the professional and commercial use of the term "architect" is legally protected.

===Building engineers===
{{main|Building engineering}}
[[Building engineering]] typically includes the services of [[Electrical engineers|electrical]], [[Mechanical engineers|mechanical]] and [[Structural engineers]].

===Draftsperson (Draughtsman)===
A [[technical drawing|draftsperson]] or [[Documentation|documenter]] is someone who has attained a certificate or [[diploma]] in architectural drafting (or equivalent training), and provides services relating to the preparation of [[Technical drawing|construction documents]] rather than building design. Some draftspersons are employed by architectural design firms and building contractors, while others are self-employed.

===Building designer===
In many places, [[building code]]s and legislation of professions allow persons to design single family residential buildings and in some cases light commercial buildings without an architectural license. As such, "Building designer" is a common designation in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and elsewhere for someone who offers building design services but is not a licensed architect or engineer.

Anyone may use the title of "building designer" in the broadest sense. In many places, a building designer may achieve certification demonstrating a higher level of training. In the U.S., the ''National Council of Building Designer Certification'' (NCBDC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbdc.com/about.htm National Council of Building Designer Certification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520084800/http://www.ncbdc.com/about.htm |date=2008-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an offshoot of the ''American Institute of Building Design'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibd.org/professional_certification.html American Institute of Building Design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518104652/http://www.aibd.org/professional_certification.html |date=May 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; administers a program leading to the title of ''Certified Professional Building Designer'' (CPBD). In most cases, building designers are trained as [[architectural technologist]]s or draftspersons; they may also be architecture school graduates that have not completed licensing requirements.

Many building designers are known as "residential" or "home designers", since they focus mainly on residential design and remodeling. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]], "Residential Designer" is a regulated term for those who are registered as such under Nevada State Board of Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design, and one may not legally represent oneself in a professional capacity without being currently registered.

In [[Australia]] where use of the term architect and some derivatives is highly restricted but the architectural design of buildings has very few restrictions in place, the term building designer is used extensively by people or design practices who are not registered by the relevant State Board of Architects. In [[Queensland]] the term building design is used in legislation which licences practitioners as part of a broader building industry licensing system. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] there is a registration process for building designers and in other States there is currently no regulation of the profession. A Building Designers Association operates in each state to represent the interests of building designers.

===Building Surveyor (UK)===
[[Chartered Building Surveyor|Building surveyors]] are technically minded general practitioners in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?idno=121&amp;state=showocc |title=Building surveyor: Job description |publisher=Prospects.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; trained much like [[architectural technologist]]s. In the UK, the knowledge and expertise of the building surveyor is applied to various tasks in the property and construction markets, including building design for smaller residential and light commercial projects. This aspect of the practice is similar to other European occupations, most notably the ''geometra'' in [[Italy]], but also the ''géomètre'' in [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]].
the building surveyors are also capable on establishment of bills of quantities for the new works and renovation or maintenance or rehabilitation works.

The profession of Building Surveyor does not exist in the US. The title ''Surveyor'' refers almost exclusively to [[Surveying|Land surveyors]]. [[Architect]]s, Building Designers, Residential Designers, Construction Managers, and [[Home Inspector]]s perform some or all of the work of the U.K. Building Surveyor.

[[File:Building performance simulation.png|thumb|Building performance simulation model with input and some resulting output|348x348px]]
'''Building performance simulation''' (BPS) (''formerly known as '''building energy simulation''' or '''building energy modeling''''') is the use of software to predict performance aspects of a building. The objective is to create a virtual model that is sufficiently accurate to form a useful representation of the actual building. BPS forecasts the various energy and mass flows within a building, in order to evaluate one or several performance aspects using computer simulation.

== Introduction ==
From a physical point of view, a building is a very complex system, influenced by a wide range of parameters. A [[Simulation modeling|simulation model]] is an abstraction of the real building which allows to consider the influences on high level of detail and to analyze key performance indicators without cost-intensive measurements. BPS is a technology of considerable potential that provides the ability to quantify and compare the relative cost and performance attributes of a proposed design in a realistic manner and at relatively low effort and cost. Energy demand, indoor environmental quality (incl. [[Thermal comfort|thermal]] and visual comfort, [[indoor air quality]] and moisture phenomena), [[HVAC]] and renewable system performance, urban level modeling, [[building automation]], and operational optimization are important aspects of BPS.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46693334|title=Energy simulation in building design|last=Clarke|first=J.

Over the last six decades, numerous BPS computer programs have been developed. The most comprehensive listing of BPS software can be found in the BEST directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com/|title=Best Directory {{!}} Building Energy Software Tools|website=www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them only cover certain parts of BPS (e.g. climate analysis, thermal comfort, energy calculations, plant modeling, daylight simulation etc.). The core tools in the field of BPS are multi-domain, dynamic, whole-building simulation tools, which provide users with key indicators such as heating and cooling load, energy demand, temperature trends, humidity, thermal and visual comfort indicators, air pollutants, ecological impact and costs.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawley|first=Drury B.|last2=Hand|first2=Jon W.|last3=Kummert|first3=Michaël|last4=Griffith|first4=Brent T.|date=2008-04-01|title=Contrasting the capabilities of building energy performance simulation programs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132306003234|journal=Building and Environment|series=Part Special: Building Performance Simulation|volume=43|issue=4|pages=661–673|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.10.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical building simulation model has inputs for local weather; building geometry; [[building envelope]] characteristics; internal heat gains from [[lighting]], occupants and [[Plug load|equipment loads]]; heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) system specifications; operation schedules and control strategies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ease of input and accessibility of output data varies widely between BPS tools. Advanced whole-building simulation tools are able to consider almost all of the following in some way with different approaches.

Necessary input data for a whole-building simulation:
* '''Climate:''' ambient air temperature, [[relative humidity]], direct and diffuse [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]], wind speed and direction
* '''Site:''' location and orientation of the building, shading by topography and surrounding buildings, ground properties
* '''Geometry:''' building shape and zone geometry
* '''Envelope:''' materials and constructions, windows and shading, thermal bridges, infiltration and openings
* '''Internal gains:''' lights, equipment and occupants including schedules for operation/occupancy
* '''Ventilation system:''' transport and conditioning (heating, cooling, humidification) of air
* '''Room units:''' local units for heating, cooling and ventilation
* '''Plant:''' Central units for transformation, storage and delivery of energy to the building
* '''Controls:''' for window opening, shading devices, ventilation systems, room units, plant components
Some examples for key performance indicators:
* '''Temperature trends:''' in zones, on surfaces, in construction layers, for hot or cold water supply or in double glass facades
* '''Comfort indicators:''' like [[Predicted Mean Vote|PMV]] and [[Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied|PPD]], radiant temperature asymmetry, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration, relative humidity
* '''Heat balances:''' for zones, the whole building or single plant components
* '''Load profiles:''' for heating and cooling demand, electricity profile for equipment and lighting
* '''Energy demand:''' for heating, cooling, ventilation, light, equipment, auxiliary systems (e.g. pumps, fans, elevators)
* '''Daylight availability:''' in certain zone areas, at different time points with variable outside conditions
Other use of BPS software
* '''System sizing:''' for HVAC components like air handling units, heat exchanger, boiler, chiller, water storage tanks, heat pumps and renewable energy systems.
* '''Optimizing control strategies:''' Controller setup for shading, window opening, heating, cooling and ventilation for increased operation performance.

== History ==
The history of BPS is approximately as long as that of [[computer]]s. The very early developments in this direction started in the late 50's and early 60's in the United States and Sweden. During this period, several methods had been introduced for analyzing single system components (e.g. gas boiler) using steady state calculations.The very first reported simulation tool for buildings was '''BRIS''', introduced in 1963 by the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Gösta|title=The BRIS simulation program for thermal design of buildings and their services|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=January 1990|volume=14|issue=4|pages=385–400|doi=10.1016/0378-7788(90)90100-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 60's, several models with hourly resolution had been developed focusing on energy assessments and heating/cooling load calculations. This effort resulted in more powerful simulation engines released in the early 70's, among those were BLAST, DOE-2, [[ESP-r]], HVACSIM+ and [[TRNSYS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibpsa.org/%5Cproceedings%5CBS1999%5CBS99_P-01.pdf|title=Early history and future prospects of building system simulation|last=Kusuda|first=T.|date=1999|website=IBPSA Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[1970s energy crisis|1970's energy crisis]] intensified these efforts, as reducing the energy consumption of buildings became an urgent domestic policy interest. The energy crisis also initiated development of U.S. building energy standards, beginning with [[ASHRAE 90.1#Standard 90-1975|ASHRAE 90-75]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sukjoon|first=Oh,|date=2013-08-19|title=Origins of Analysis Methods in Energy Simulation Programs Used for High Performance Commercial Buildings|url=http://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/151151|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of building simulation represents a combined effort between academia, governmental institutions, industry, and professional organizations. Over the past decades the building simulation discipline has matured into a field that offers unique expertise, methods and tools for [[building performance]] evaluation. Several review papers and state of the art analysis were carried out during that time giving an overview about the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Augenbroe|first=Godfried|last2=Hensen|first2=Jan|date=2004-08-01|title=Simulation for better building design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013230400085X|journal=Building and Environment|series=Building Simulation for Better Building Design|volume=39|issue=8|pages=875–877|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2004.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hensen, J.

In the 1980s, a discussion about future directions for BPS among a group of leading building simulation specialists started. There was a consensus that most of the tools, that had been developed until then, were too rigid in their structure to be able to accommodate the improvements and flexibility that would be called for in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J.A.; Sowell, E.F.; the Simulation Research Group (1985): ''A Proposal to Develop a Kernel System for the Next Generation of Building Energy Simulation Software'', Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, Nov. 4, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the very first equation-based building simulation environment '''ENET'''&lt;ref&gt;Low, D. and Sowell, E.F. (1982): ''ENET, a PC-based building energy simulation system,'' Energy Programs Conference, IBM Real Estate and Construction Division, Austin, Texas (1982), pp. 2-7&lt;/ref&gt; was developed, which provided the foundation of '''SPARK'''. In 1989, Sahlin and Sowell presented a '''[[Neutral Model Format]]''' (NMF) for building simulation models, which is used today in the commercial software [[IDA Indoor Climate and Energy|IDA ICE]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahlin, P. and Sowell, E.F. (1989). A neutral format for building simulation models, Proceedings of the Second International IBPSA Conference, Vancouver, BC, Canada, pp. 147-154, http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS1989/BS89_147_154.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, Klein introduced the '''[[Engineering Equation Solver]]''' (EES)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=S. A.|date=1993-01-01|title=Development and integration of an equation-solving program for engineering thermodynamics courses|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cae.6180010310/abstract|journal=Computer Applications in Engineering Education|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=265–275|doi=10.1002/cae.6180010310|issn=1099-0542}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1997, Mattsson and Elmqvist reported on an international effort to design '''[[Modelica]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattsson|first=Sven Erik|last2=Elmqvist|first2=Hilding|date=April 1997|title=Modelica - An International Effort to Design the Next Generation Modeling Language|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017436287|journal=IFAC Proceedings Volumes|series=7th IFAC Symposium on Computer Aided Control Systems Design (CACSD '97), Gent, Belgium, 28–30 April|volume=30|issue=4|pages=151–155|doi=10.1016/S1474-6670(17)43628-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPS still presents challenges relating to problem representation, support for performance appraisal, enabling operational application, and delivering user education, training, and accreditation. Clarke (2015) describes a future vision of BPS with the following, most important tasks which should be addressed by the global BPS community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Joe|date=2015-03-04|title=A vision for building performance simulation: a position paper prepared on behalf of the IBPSA Board|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19401493.2015.1007699|journal=Journal of Building Performance Simulation|volume=8|issue=2|pages=39–43|doi=10.1080/19401493.2015.1007699|issn=1940-1493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Better concept promotion
* Standardization of input data and accessibility of model libraries
* Standard performance assessment procedures
* Better embedding of BPS in practice
* Operational support and fault diagnosis with BPS
* Education, training, and user accreditation

== Accuracy ==

In the context of building simulation models, error refers to the discrepancy between simulation results and the actual measured performance of the building. There are normally occurring [[uncertainties in building design and building energy assessment|uncertainties in building design and building assessment]], which generally stem from approximations in model inputs, such as occupancy behavior. Calibration refers to the process of "tuning" or adjusting assumed simulation model inputs to match observed data from the utilities or [[Building Management System]] (BMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raftery|first=Paul|last2=Keane|first2=Marcus|last3=Costa|first3=Andrea|date=2011-12-01|title=Calibrating whole building energy models: Detailed case study using hourly measured data|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778811004415|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=43|issue=12|pages=3666–3679|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.09.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=T.

ASHRAE recommends a R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; greater than 0.75 for calibrated models. The criteria for NMBE and CV RMSE depends on if measured data is available at a monthly or hourly timescale.

== Technological aspects ==
Given the complexity of building energy and mass flows, it is generally not possible to find an [[Closed-form expression|analytical solution]], so the simulation software employs other techniques, such as response function methods, or [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]] in [[finite difference]]s or [[Finite volume method|finite volume]], as an approximation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of today's whole building simulation programs formulate models using [[imperative programming]] languages. These languages assign values to variables, declare the sequence of execution of these assignments and change the state of the program, as is done for example in [[Compatibility of C and C++|C/C++]], [[Fortran]] or [[MATLAB]]/[[Simulink]]. In such programs, model equations are tightly connected to the solution methods, often by making the solution procedure part of the actual model equations.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wetter|first=Michael|last2=Bonvini|first2=Marco|last3=Nouidui|first3=Thierry S.|date=2016-04-01|title=Equation-based languages – A new paradigm for building energy modeling, simulation and optimization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778815303315|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=117|pages=290–300|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of imperative programming languages limits the applicability and extensibility of models. More flexibility offer simulation engines using symbolic [[Differential-algebraic system of equations|Differential Algebraic Equations]] (DAEs) with general purpose solvers that increase model reuse, transparency and accuracy. Since some of these engines have been developed for more than 20 years (e.g. IDA ICE) and due to the key advantages of equation-based modeling, these simulation engines can be considered as [[State of the art|state of the art technology.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahlin|first=Per|last2=Eriksson|first2=Lars|last3=Grozman|first3=Pavel|last4=Johnsson|first4=Hans|last5=Shapovalov|first5=Alexander|last6=Vuolle|first6=Mika|date=2004-08-01|title=Whole-building simulation with symbolic DAE equations and general purpose solvers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132304000307|journal=Building and Environment|series=Building Simulation for Better Building Design|volume=39|issue=8|pages=949–958|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2004.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahlin|first=Per|last2=Eriksson|first2=Lars|last3=Grozman|first3=Pavel|last4=Johnsson|first4=Hans|last5=Shapovalov|first5=Alexander|last6=Vuolle|first6=Mika|date=August 2003|title=Will equation-based building simulation make it?-experiences from the introduction of IDA Indoor Climate And Energy|url=https://www.academia.edu/16918862/Will_equation-based_building_simulation_make_it_-experiences_from_the_introduction_of_IDA_Indoor_Climate_And_Energy|journal=Proceedings of Building …|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Building simulation models may be developed for both new or existing buildings. Major use categories of building performance simulation include:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* '''Architectural Design''': quantitatively compare design or [[Retrofitting|retrofit]] options in order to inform a more [[energy-efficient building design]]
* '''HVAC Design:''' calculate thermal loads for sizing of mechanical equipment and help design and test system control strategies
* '''Building Performance Rating:''' demonstrate [[Building performance simulation#Performance-Based Compliance|performance-based compliance]] with energy codes, green certification, and financial incentives
* '''Building Stock Analysis:''' support development of energy codes and standards and plan large scale energy efficiency programs
* '''CFD in buildings:''' simulation of boundary conditions like surface heat fluxes and surface temperatures for a following [[CFD in buildings|CFD]] study of the situation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tian|first=Wei|last2=Han|first2=Xu|last3=Zuo|first3=Wangda|last4=Sohn|first4=Michael D.|title=Building energy simulation coupled with CFD for indoor environment: A critical review and recent applications|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.046|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=165|pages=184–199|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software tools ==
There are hundreds of software tools available for simulating the performance of buildings and building subsystems, which range in capability from whole-building simulations to model input calibration to building auditing. Among whole-building simulation software tools, it is important to draw a distinction between the '''''simulation engine''''', which dynamically solves equations rooted in [[thermodynamics]] and [[building science]], and the '''''modeler application (interface)'''''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In general, BPS software can be classified into&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Østergård|first=Torben|last2=Jensen|first2=Rasmus L.|last3=Maagaard|first3=Steffen E.|date=2016-08-01|title=Building simulations supporting decision making in early design – A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211600280X|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=61|pages=187–201|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.03.045}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Applications with integrated simulation engine (e.g. EnergyPlus, ESP-r, IES-VE, IDA ICE)
* Software that docks to a certain engine (e.g. [[Designbuilder]], eQuest, RIUSKA, Sefaira)
* Plugins for other software enabling certain performance analysis (e.g. DIVA for Rhino, Honeybee, [[Autodesk]] Green Building Studio)

Contrary to this presentation, there are some tools that in fact do not meet these sharp classification criteria, such as ESP-r which can also be used as a modeler application for EnergyPlus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lists.strath.ac.uk/archives/esp-r/2015/003176.html|title=Exporting ESP-r models to E+ .idf files|last=|first=|date=|website=Answered question in the ESP-r support forum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also other applications using the IDA simulation environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equa.se/de/tunnel|title=IDA Tunnel|last=|first=|date=|website=Software "Tunnel" uses IDA simulation environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes "IDA" the engine and "ICE" the modeler. Most modeler applications support the user with a graphical user interface to make data input easier. The modeler creates an input file for the simulation engine to solve. The engine returns output data to the modeler application or another visualization tool which in turn presents the results to the user. For some software packages, the calculation engine and the interface may be the same product. The table below gives an overview about commonly used simulation engines and modeler applications for BPS.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annex 43/Task 34 Final Task Management Report - Testing and Validation of Building Energy Simulation Tools|last=Judkoff|first=Ron|publisher=International Energy Agency (IEA)|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BPS in practice ==
Since the 90's, building performance simulation has undergone the transition from a method used mainly for research to a design tool for mainstream industrial projects. However, the utilization in different countries still varies greatly. Building certification programs like [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (USA), [[BREEAM]] (UK) or [[DGNB]] (Germany)  showed to be a good driving force for BPS to find broader application. Also, national building standards that allow BPS based analysis are of good help for an increasing industrial adoption, such as in the United States ([[ASHRAE 90.1]]),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sweden (BBR),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boverket.se/en/start-in-english/|title=BBR - Swedish building regulation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland (SIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sia.ch/en/the-sia/|title=Swiss society of architects and engineers (SIA)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom (NCM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uk-ncm.org.uk/|title=UKs National Calculation Method|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish building regulations are unique in that computed energy use has to be verified by measurements within the first two years of building operation. Since the introduction in 2007, experience shows that highly detailed simulation models are preferred by modelers to reliably achieve the required level of accuracy. Furthermore, this has fostered a simulation culture where the design predictions are close to the actual performance. This in turn has led to offers of formal energy guarantees based on simulated predictions, highlighting the general business potential of BPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gbpn.org/databases-tools/bc-detail-pages/sweden#Summary|title=Swedish code summarized in global performance network|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance-based compliance ==
In a performance-based approach, compliance with building codes or standards is based on the predicted energy use from a building simulation, rather than a prescriptive approach, which requires adherence to stipulated technologies or design features. Performance-based compliance provides greater flexibility in the building design as it allows designers to miss some prescriptive requirements if the impact on building performance can be offset by exceeding other prescriptive requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbei.psu.edu/eeb-codes-performance-based-codes/|title=A new paradigm for building codes|last=Senick|first=Jennifer|date=|website=cbei.psu.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certifying agency provides details on model inputs, software specifications, and performance requirements.

The following is a list of U.S. based energy codes and standards that reference building simulations to demonstrate compliance:

The '''Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2)''' is a foundation located on the campus of the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB) whose mission is to promote interdisciplinary research in [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]]. In addition to research activities, the ICN2 provides training for researchers, education programs and services to industry and the scientific community.

The ICN2 is part of the Catalan Government's organisation for research centres (CERCA) &lt;ref&gt;[http://cerca.cat/en/cerca-centres/ CERCA Centres]&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to encourage and maximise synergies and strategic cooperation between research centres in [[Catalonia]]. The Institute is also a founding member of The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology which was established in collaboration with five other research centres in Catalonia to achieve greater international competitiveness by promoting multidisciplinary scientific collaboration in the fields of genomic regulation, chemical research nanoscience and nanotechnology, photonic sciences, high energy physic and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bist.eu/ Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The ICN2 was initially established as the `[[Catalan Institute of Nanotechnology]] (ICN) in 2003, at the initiative of the Catalan government and the UAB with the aim of attracting international research talent to create a world renowned centre for nanoscience and nanotechnology research.
Following collaborations between the ICN and the Spanish government's Centre for Research in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (CIN2), the ICN and the Spanish Research Council (CSIC) agreed to put their collaboration on an official footing and signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect in 2006.

This agreement was formalised in 2011, when CSIC representatives joined the ICN's board of patrons and then in 2013, when the ICN changed its name to the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2).
In addition to research, management and financial synergies, an important outcome of this agreement was the construction of a new building on the UAB campus containing state-of-the-art equipment and purpose-built research facilities. The building was inaugurated in 2014 and provides facilities for 180 researchers and 40 technical and support staff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9489">{{Other uses|Characterization (disambiguation)}}
&lt;!-- NOTE: the spelling as "characterization" with "z" is intentional (see page title!). Please do not change it to "characterisation". Cf. Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Retaining_the_existing_variety  --&gt;
'''Characterization''' or '''characterisation''' is the representation of persons (or other beings or creatures) in [[narrative]] and [[drama]]tic [[The arts|works of art]].  This representation may include direct methods like the attribution of qualities in description or commentary, and indirect (or "dramatic") methods inviting readers to infer qualities from characters' [[Action (narrative)|action]]s, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], or appearance.  Such a personage is called a [[Character (arts)|character]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character is a [[literary element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Literature|2015|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''characterization'' was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, pp. 51-2)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] promoted the primacy of plot over characters, that is, a plot-driven narrative, arguing in his ''[[Poetics]]'' that tragedy "is a representation, not of men, but of action and life." This view was reversed in the 19th century, when the primacy of the character, that is, a character-driven narrative, was affirmed first with the [[realist novel]], and increasingly later with the influential development of [[psychology]].

==Direct vs. indirect==
There are two ways  an [[author]] can convey information about a character:
;''Direct'' or ''[[wiktionary:explicit|explicit]]'' characterization: The author literally tells the audience what a character is like. This may be done via the [[narrator]], another character or by the character themselves.
;''Indirect'' or ''[[wiktionary:implicit|implicit]]'' characterization: The audience must infer for themselves what the character is like through the character's thoughts, actions, speech (choice of words, manner of speaking), physical appearance, mannerisms and interaction with other characters, including other characters' reactions to that particular person.

==In drama==
Characters in theater, television, and film differ from those in novels in that an actor may interpret the writer's description and dialogue in their own unique way to add new layers and depth to a character. This can be seen when critics compare, for example, the 'Lady Macbeths' or 'Heathcliffs' of different actors.  Another major difference in drama is that it is not possible to 'go inside the character's head' in the way possible in a novel, meaning this method of character exposition is unavailable.  Still another is that in drama, a character usually can be seen and heard and need not be described.

==Character archetypes==
The psychologist [[Carl Jung]] identified twelve primary 'original patterns' of the human psyche. He believed that these reside in the collective subconscious of people across cultural and political boundaries. These twelve archetypes are often cited in fictional characters. [[Character (arts)#Round vs. flat|'Flat' characters]] may be considered so because they stick to a single archetype without deviating, whereas 'complex' or 'realistic' characters will combine several archetypes, with some being more dominant than others – as people are in real life.
Jung's twelve archetypes are: the Innocent, the Orphan, the Hero, the Caregiver, the Explorer, the Rebel, the Lover, the Creator, the Jester, the Sage, the Magician, and the Ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html | title=The 12 Common Archetypes | work=SoulCraft | accessdate=June 29, 2016 | author=Golden, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character's voice== &lt;!-- Character's voice links here. --&gt;
{{Distinguish|Grammatical voice|Writer's voice}}

A '''character's voice''' is his or her manner of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different characters use different vocabularies and rhythms of speech.  For example, some characters are talkative, others taciturn.  The way a character speaks can be a powerful way of revealing the character’s personality.  In theory, a reader should be able to identify which character is speaking simply from the way he or she talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamand|2009|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a character voice has been created that is rich and distinctive, the writer can get away with omitting many speech attributions (tag lines).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The manner of a character’s speech is to literature what an actor’s appearance and costume are to cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fiction, what a character says, as well as how he or she says it, makes a strong impression on the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each character should have his or her distinctive voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To differentiate characters in fiction, the writer must show them doing and saying things, but a character must be defined by more than one single topic of conversation or by the character’s accent.  The character will have other interests or personality quirks as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although individual temperament is the largest determinant of what a character says, it is not the only one.  The writer can make the characters’ dialogue more realistic and interesting by considering several factors affecting how people speak:  ethnicity, family background, region, gender, education, and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|pp=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words characterize by their diction, cadence, complexity, and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerisms and catch-phrases can help too.  Considering the degree of formality in spoken language is also useful.  Characters who spend a lot of their lives in a more formal setting often use a more formal language all the time, while others never do.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamand|2009|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tone of voice, volume, rate of delivery, vocabulary, inflection, emphasis, pitch, topics of conversation, idioms, colloquialisms, and figures of speech:  all of these are expressions of who the character is on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A character’s manner of speech must grow from the inside out.  The speaking is how his or her essential personality leaks out for the world to see; it is not the sum total of his or her personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple studies have correlated childhood gender nonconformity with eventual [[homosexuality]]; in these studies, a majority of those who identify as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]] self-report being gender nonconforming as children.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-84169-018-6|pages=201–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roychiRaM8gC&amp;pg=PA202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schroeder"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carolyn S.

One study suggested that childhood gender nonconformity is [[heritable]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"/&gt;

==Manifestations==
''[[Gender nonconformity]]'' in children can have many forms, reflecting various ways in which a child relates to their gender. In literature, ''[[gender variance]]'' and ''gender atypicality'' are used synonymously with ''gender nonconformity''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adelson L.|first=Stewart|year=2012|title=Practice Parameter on Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Orientation, Gender Nonconformity, and Gender Discordance in Children and Adolescents|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089085671200500X|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=51| issue = 9|pages=957–974|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2012.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and developmental theories of gender==

The concept of childhood [[gender]] nonconformity assumes that there is a correct way to be a girl or a boy.  There are a number of social and developmental perspectives that explore how children come to identify with a particular gender and engage in activities that are associated with this [[gender role]].

Psychoanalytic theories of gender emphasize that children begin to identify with the parent, and that girls tend to identify with their mothers and boys with their fathers. The identification is often associated with the child's realization that they do not share the same [[sex organ|genitals]] with both parents.  According to [[Freud]]’s theories, this discovery leads to [[penis envy]] in girls and [[castration anxiety]] in boys. Although there is not much [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] to back up Freud, his theories sparked new conversations surrounding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and gender. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Social learning theory emphasizes the rewards and punishments that children receive for sex appropriate or inappropriate behaviors.  One of the criticisms of [[social learning theory]] is that it assumes that children are passive, rather than active participants in their [[social environment]].

Cognitive development theory argues that children are active in defining gender and behaving in ways that reflect their perceptions of [[gender role]]s.  Children are in search of regularities and consistencies in their environment, and the pursuit of [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive consistency]] motivates children to behave in ways that are congruent with the [[social constructionism|societal constructions]] of gender.

Gender schema theory is a hybrid model that combines social learning and [[cognitive development]] theories.  [[Daryl J. Bem]] argues that children have a cognitive readiness to learn about themselves and their surroundings.  They build [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s to help them navigate their social world, and these schemas form a larger network of associations and beliefs about gender and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bem|first=D.J.|title=Exotic Becomes Erotic: A Developmental Theory of Sexual Orientation|journal=Psychological Review|year=1996|volume=103|pages=320–335|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.320|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences of androgens==
===Toy preference studies===
[[File:Young Rhesus Macaque.jpg|thumb|Studies with young [[rhesus macaque]]s suggest that some gender-typical preferences may not only be caused by human socialization.]]
Toys for girls tend to be round and pink, while toys for boy tend to be angular and blue.  The subtle characteristics of toys may differentially appeal to the developing brains of female and male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jadva|first=V.|title=Infants' preferences for toys, colors and shapes|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|year=2010|volume=39|doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9618-z|issue=6|pages=1261–73|pmid=20232129|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In a study of toy preferences of twelve- to 24-month-old infants, males spent more time looking at cars than females and females spent more time looking at dolls than males.  No preference for color was found, and within each sex, both boys and girls preferred dolls to cars at age 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=G.M.|title=An evolutionary perspective of sex-typed toy preferences: pink, blue, and the brain|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|year=2003|volume=32|pages=7–14|doi=10.1023/A:1021833110722|pmid=12597267|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines 2010 448"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M.|title=Sex-related variation in human behavior and the brain|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2010|volume=14|issue=10|pages=448–56|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.005|pmid=20724210|pmc=2951011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of preschool-aged children found that the cultural labeling of toys as "gender-appropriate" impacted toy preferences. In partial contrast to this view, certain animal studies have lent support for [[biological determinism|biologically determined]] gendered toy preferences.  In a study of juvenile [[rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]], when given the option between plush or wheeled toys, female monkeys gravitated toward both toys, while male monkeys mainly preferred toys with wheels.  These findings suggest that gendered preferences for toys can occur without the complex [[socialization]] processes that we find in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassett|first=Janice M.|author2=Siebert, Erin R.|author3=Wallen, Kim.|title=Differences in Rhesus Monkey Toy Preferences Parallel those of Children|journal=Hormones and Behavior|year=2008|volume=54|issue=3|pages=359–64|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.03.008|pmid=18452921|pmc=2583786}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Female rhesus monkeys also tend to engage in more nurturing play activities, while males tend to engage in more rough-and-tumble play. However, the co-author of the study warned about overinterpreting the results, stating "The plush and wheeled categories served as proxies for feminine and masculine, but other toy characteristics, such as size or colour, might explain the male's behaviour, or the male monkeys might seek out more physically active toys."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13596-male-monkeys-prefer-boys-toys/|title=Male monkeys prefer boys’ toys|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) have atypically high blood concentrations of [[testosterone]].  In studies of toy preference, these girls show increased interest in male-typical toys, like trucks and balls.  Overall, their play habits and preferences more closely resembled male-typical play than female-typical play.  Even with children exposed a normal range of prenatal androgens, increased testosterone was associated with increased preference for male-typical toys, and decreased prenatal testosterone was associated with greater interest in female-typical toys.

Overall, the degree of androgen exposure during prenatal and postnatal development may bias males and females toward specific [[cognition|cognitive processes]], which are further reinforced through processes of [[socialization]]. The male interest in balls and wheeled toys may relate to the androgenised brains preference for objects that move through space.  The higher levels of androgens in the developing male brain could elicit greater attraction to cars and balls, while lower levels of androgens elicit a preference for dolls and nurturing activities in the female brain.&lt;ref name="Hines 2010 448"/&gt;

[[Cordelia Fine|Dr. Cordelia Fine]] criticizes toy-preference studies in non-human primates. She explains the disparity across research and the labeling of toys, with the rhesus monkey study deeming stuffed animals as inherently feminine, all the while a study with [[vervet monkeys]] shows males displaying a preference for stuffed dogs. Moreover, the effects of hormonal treatment are deemed inconclusive and significant long-term effects on rhesus monkeys being nonexistent, with treated prenatal females showing no increase in aggression and still adopting "feminine" social roles into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Cordelia|title=Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference|year=2010|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0-393-06838-2|pages=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2ZtdAx83yMC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Fine presents the argument of correlation being confused for causality; are females with CAH interested in typically masculine activities due to their having an innate quality or is this a result of their association with boys and men as a gender? If a visual and spatial value is deemed as a preeminent element in typically masculine toys (such as trucks), females with CAH and males in studies should consequently show a much higher interest for neutral toys such as puzzles and sketchpads (as opposed to non-CAH females), something which they do not.&lt;ref name="Fine"/&gt;

===Playmate and play-style preferences===

Children's preference for same-sex play mates is a robust finding that has been observed in many human cultures and across a number of animal species.   Preference for same-sex playmates is at least partially linked to [[socialization]] processes, but children may also gravitate toward peers with similar play styles. Girls generally engage in more nurturing-and-mothering-type behaviors, while boys show greater instances of rough-and-tumble play.&lt;ref name="Hines 1994 1042–53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M. |author2=Kaufman, Melissa |author3=Francine, R.|title=Androgen and the Development of Human Sex-Typical Behavior: Rough and Tumble Play and Sex of Preferred Playmates in Children with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=Child Development|year=1994|volume=65|issue=4|pages=1042–53|doi=10.2307/1131303|pmid=7956464}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of human history, people lived in small [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.  Over time [[evolution]]ary forces may have selected for children’s play activities related to adult survival skills.

However, it is not uncommon for girls and boys to prefer opposite-sex playmates and to engage in gender atypical play styles.  Similarly to toy preferences, androgens may also be involved in playmate and play style preferences.  Girls who have [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) typically engage in more rough-and-tumble play. Hines and Kaufman (1994) found that 50% of girls with CAH reported a preference for boys as playmates, while less than 10% of their non-CAH sisters preferred boys as playmates.&lt;ref name="Hines 1994 1042–53"/&gt; Another study found that girls with CAH still preferred same-sex playmates, but their atypical play styles resulted in them spending more time alone engaging in their preferred activities. Girls with CAH are more likely to have [[intersex|masculinized genitalia]], and it has been suggested that this could lead parents to treat them more like boys; however, this claim is unsubstantiated by parental reports.&lt;ref name="Hines 2004 75–81"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=M.|author2=Brook, C.|author3=Conway, G.S.|title=Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=Journal of Sex Research|year=2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=75–81|doi=10.1080/00224490409552215|pmid=15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult traits===

There have been a number of studies correlating childhood gender nonconformity (CGN) and [[sexual orientation]]; however, the relationship between CGN and [[trait theory|personality traits]] in adulthood has been largely overlooked.  Lippa measured CGN, gender-related occupational preferences, self-ascribed [[masculinity]]-[[femininity]] and anxiety in [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] women and men through self-report measures. Gay men showed a tendency toward more feminine self-concepts than heterosexual men.  Similarly, lesbian women reported "higher self-ascribed masculinity, more masculine occupational preferences, and more CGN than heterosexual women." Lippa's study found stronger correlations in CGN and adult personality trait in men than in women. Overall, Lippa's study suggests that gender nonconforming behaviors are relatively stable across a person a life-time.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lippa|first=Richard|title=The Relation between Childhood Gender Nonconformity and Adult Masculinity–Femininity and Anxiety in Heterosexual and Homosexual Men and Women|journal=Sex Roles|year=2008|volume=59|issue=9–10|pages=684–93|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of Lippa's study is the relatively high sample size of 950 participants, that was diverse both in terms of representations of sexual orientation and [[ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Although there may be a tendency to want to generalize these findings to all heterosexual and homosexual men and women, awareness that a tendency toward certain behaviors does not mean that they are a monolithic group is necessary; for some individuals, sexual orientation may be the only thing they have in common.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;

===Measures of anxiety===

CGN is associated with higher levels of psychological distress in gay men than in lesbian women.  The findings were extended to heterosexual men and women, where "CGN [was] associated with psychological distress in heterosexual men but not in heterosexual women."&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;  In effect, "CGN impacts men more negatively than women, regardless of sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt; The pattern of results may be derived by from society's greater acceptance of typically masculine behaviors in girls, and discouragement of typically feminine behaviors in boys.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2008 684–93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skidmore|first=W.C.|author2=Linsenmeier, J.A.W.|author3=Bailey, J.M.|title=Gender Nonconformity and Psychological Distress in Lesbians and Gay Men|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2006|volume=35|pages=685–97|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9108-5|issue=6|pmid=17109224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual orientation==

===General===
A great deal of research has been conducted on the relationship between CGN and sexual orientation. Gay men often report being feminine boys, and lesbian women often report being masculine girls. In men, CGN is a strong predictor of sexual orientation in adulthood, but this relationship is not as well understood in women.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Michael P.|author2=Bailey, J.M.|author3=Kirk, K.M.|author4=Martin, N.G.|title=The Subtlety of Sex-Atypicality|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2000|volume=29|issue=6|doi=10.1023/A:1002002420159|pages=549–65|pmid=11100262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=J.M.|author2=Zucker, K.J.|title=Childhood Sex-typed Behavior and Sexual Orientation: A Conceptual Analysis and Quantitative Review|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1995|volume=21|pages=43–55|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.43|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with CAH reported more male typical play behaviours and showed less heterosexual interest.&lt;ref name="Hines 2004 75–81"/&gt;

The [[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]] is a well documented phenomenon that predicts that a man's odds of being homosexual increase 33-48% with each older brother that the man has. Research has shown that the mother develops an [[immune system|immune response]] due to blood factor incompatibility with male fetuses. With each male fetus, the mother's immune system responds more strongly to what it perceives as a threat.  The mother’s immune response can disrupt typical prenatal hormones, like testosterone, which have been implicated in both childhood gender nonconformity and adult sexual orientation.

Bem proposes a theory on the relationship between childhood gender non-conformity, which he refers to as the "exotic become erotic."&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"/&gt; Bem argues that biological factors, such as [[Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation|prenatal hormones]], [[gene]]s and [[neuroanatomy]], predispose children to behave in ways that do not conform to their sex assigned at birth.  Gender nonconforming children will often prefer opposite-sex playmates and activities.  These become alienated from their same-sex peer group.  As children enter [[adolescence]] "the exotic becomes erotic" where dissimilar and unfamiliar same-sex peers produces [[arousal]], and the general arousal become eroticized over time. Bem's theory does not seem to fit female homosexuality.  Perhaps, males who demonstrate gender nonconformity experience more alienation and separation from same-sex peers, because cultural constructions of masculinity are generally more rigid than femininity.&lt;ref name="Bem 1996 320–335"/&gt;

===Biases in retrospective studies===
Although childhood gender nonconformity has been correlated to sexual orientation in adulthood, there may be a [[reporting bias]] that has influenced the results.  Many of the studies on the link between CGN and sexual orientation are conducted [[Retrospective cohort study|retrospectively]], meaning that adults are asked to reflect on their behaviors as children.  Adults will often reinterpret their childhood behaviors in terms of their present conceptualizations of their [[gender identity]] and sexual orientation.  Gay men and lesbian women who endorsed a [[biological determinism|biological perspective]] on gender and sexual orientation tended to report more instances of childhood gender nonconformity and explain these behaviors as early genetic or biological manifestations of their sexual orientation.  Lesbian women who endorse a [[social constructionism|social constructionist]] perspective on gender identity often interpret their childhood GNC as an awareness of [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] norms and rejection of gender roles.  Heterosexual men are more likely to downplay GNC, attributing their behaviors to being sensitive or artistic. Retrospective reinterpretation does not invalidate studies linking GNC and sexual orientation, but awareness of how present conceptualization of gender identity and sexual orientation can affect perceptions of childhood may be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gottschalk|first=Lorene|title=Same-Sex Sexuality and Childhood Gender Non-Conformity: A Spurious Connection|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|year=2003|volume=12|issue=1|pages=35–50|doi=10.1080/0958923032000067808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender dysphoria==
Children with [[gender dysphoria]], also known as gender identity disorder (GID), exhibit the typical gender nonconforming patterns of behaviors, such as a preference for toys, playmates, clothing, and play-styles that are typically associated with the opposite-sex.  Children with GID will sometimes display disgust toward their own genitals or changes that occur in [[puberty]] (e.g. facial hair or [[menstruation]]).&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langer|first=Susan J.|author2=Martin, James I.|title=How Dresses Can Make You Mentally Ill: Examining Gender Identity Disorder in Children|journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal|date=February 2004|volume=21|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diagnosis of GID in children requires evidence of discomfort, confusion, or aversion to the gender roles associated with the child's genetic sex.  Children do not necessarily have to express a desire to be the opposite-sex, but it is still taken in consideration when making a [[diagnosis|diagnoses]].&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"/&gt;

Some advocates have argued that a [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] diagnosis legitimizes the experiences of these children, making it easier to rally around a medically defined disorder, in order to raise public awareness, and garner funding for future research and therapies.  Diagnoses of [[gender identity disorder in children]] (GIDC) remains controversial, as many argue that the label pathologizes behaviors and cognitions that fall within the normal variation within gender.  The [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with mental health disorders may do more harm than good.&lt;ref name="Langer 2004"/&gt;

==Parental reactions==
Parents with gender non-conforming children may not know where to turn to express their feelings. Many parents accept their child’s choice but are more concerned for the overall well being of the child. In some cases families are not accepting of their child’s non-conformity, typically lashing out with punishment grounded on [[homophobia]] and [[sexism]]. Regardless of the stance a parent decides to take on gender non-conformity, it will affect the child and the child’s relationship with the family.

Transphobia can occur when gender nonconforming children are met with others who do not understand or accept what they are going through. Dr. Diane Ehrensaft states that, "Transphobia is the anxieties, prejudices, aspersion, aggression, and hatred cast on individuals who do not accept the gender assigned to them at birth but instead play outside that definition of self or perhaps any binary categorizations of gender, possibly to the extent of altering their body."&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011&gt;Ehrensaft, Diane, PhD. "Boys Will Be Girls, Girls will Be Boys: Children Affect Parents as Parents Affect Children in Gender Nonconformity." Psychoanalytic Psychology 28.4 (2011): 528-48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Transphobia can become a serious conflict within the family and can damage the relationship the child has with his or her family.

Parents who recognize that they have gender non-conforming children sometimes experience a feeling of loss, shock, denial, anger, and despair.&lt;ref&gt;Children's National Medical Center. If You Are Concerned About Your Childs Gender Behavior. N.p.: Children's National Medical Center, n.d. Children's National Medical Center. Web. 31 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings typically subside as a parent learns more about gender nonconformity. However, there are families that remain unaccepting of gender nonconformity and correlate it to psychological or social problems. Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Jean Malpas says, "Some react very negatively and the gender nonconformity can become a significant source of conflict between parents and a damaging source of disconnection between parent and child."&lt;ref&gt;Malpas, Jean. "Between Pink and Blue: A Multi-Dimensional Family Approach to Gender Nonconforming Children and Their Families." Family Process 50.4 (2011): 453-470. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Diane Ehrensaft cites that there are three family types that can affect the outcome of a child's gender nonconformity: transformers, transphobics, and transporters.&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011/&gt; Transformers: Transformers are parents that are comfortable in supporting their child in their gender variant journey and can easily identify their child as a separate person. Ehrensaft states, "These parents will stand a good chance of overcoming whatever transphobic reactions may reside within them to evolve into parents who both meet their child where he or she is and become an advocate for their gender nonconforming child in the outside world."&lt;ref name=Ehrensaft2011/&gt; Transphobics: Transphobic parents are not comfortable in their own gender, and may not understand that gender is fluid.  Transphobic parents may feel their child is an extension of themselves and respond negatively when their child is faced with his or her own adversity.  Ehrensaft believes these parents deny their child with an excess of negativity and transphobic "reactivity" this allows the child no room for nonconformity and undermines the love the parent claims to have for the child. 'Transporters: Transporters are parents that appear to be completely accepting of their child's gender nonconformity but on the inside have doubts about whether or not it is an authentic conformity. Transporter parents may say things like, "It's just a phase," or "he or she will grow out of it."

== Peer reactions ==
Once children reach school age, girls who are considered "tomboys" and boys who are considered to be more "sensitive" than their gender typical peers, are more likely to face challenges during childhood than their gender-typical counterparts. It is possible that their nonconformity goes unnoticed, however it is more likely that they fall victim to bullying and harassment when they reach school age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldeman | first1 = Douglas C | year = 2000 | title = Gender atypical youth: Clinical and social issues | url = | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 29 | issue = 2| page = 192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study on gender atypical fifteen year olds, atypical males self-report being lonelier, bullied more, less likely to have male friends, and be in "greater distress" than gender-typical males in the same demographic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert, and Helen Sweeting. "Adolescent bullying, relationships, psychological well-being, and gender-atypical behavior: A gender diagnosticity approach." ''Sex Roles'' 50, no. 7-8 (2004): 525-537.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Needs of gender nonconforming children and families==

There is still controversy regarding the best approach for gender nonconforming children, but as gender nonconformity becomes more widely accepted many parents and professionals have identified things that gender variant or gender nonconforming children need to easily adjust to their transformation.&lt;ref name=Riley2013&gt;Reilly, Elizabeth A., Gomathi Sitharthan, Lindy Clemson, and Milton Diamond. "Recognizing the Needs of Gender-variant Children and Their Parents." Sex Education 13.6 (2013): 644-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents have suggested that their children need the ability to discuss their gender non-conformity freely with their parent, to be loved throughout their transformation, and to be permitted to make choices regarding their gender on their own. They have also suggested a peer support team and supportive counseling in addition to support from their school and schools administrators and authorities.&lt;ref name=Riley2013/&gt;

Parents must be mindful of a child's need for parent expressions of acceptance and validation. If not validated a child may begin sharing less with their parent and more with friends, this could lead to the parent thinking the gender nonconformity was just a brief phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menvielle | first1 = Edgardo J. | last2 = Tuerk | first2 = Catherine | year = 2002 | title = A Support Group for Parents of Gender-Nonconforming Boys | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 8| pages = 1010–013 | doi=10.1097/00004583-200208000-00021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disclosure is also a very important to a family when raising a gender non-conforming child. Parents need to consider whom to talk to about their child and what type of information they decide to share. Other members of the family must also be prepared to make decisions regarding what to say and who to say it to.&lt;ref&gt;"Parent Considerations." Gender Spectrum. Gender Spectrum, n.d. Web. http://www.genderspectrum.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Regarding their own needs, parents have suggested that they need information regarding gender nonconforming children that can better assist them and their child in making their transition. Additionally, parents have stated they need increased education on gender nonconforming children, and support from surrounding friends and family to help build parental confidence. Parents have also suggested they need counseling to help provide direction, support from medical professionals and peers, and access to transgender people to help provide them with a positive portrayal of transgender communities.&lt;ref name=Riley2013/&gt;

An article in The Sunday Times, 25 November 2018, by journalist, [[Andrew Gilligan]] reports criticism of Trans Groups for large increases in the number of child referrals to the UK National Health Service specialist service dealing with Transgender children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk|title=Trans groups under fire for huge rise in child referrals|last=Gilligan|first=Andrew|date=25 November 2018|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical treatments for gender dysphoria==
It is important for clinicians to identify children whose gender dysphoria will persist into adolescence and those who outgrow their gender identity disorder (GID) or gender dysphoria diagnosis. In instances where the child’s distress and discomfort continues clinicians will sometimes prescribe [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) to delay puberty.&lt;ref name="Wallien 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallien|first=M.S.C|author2=Cohen-Kettenis, P.T.|title=Psychosexual Outcome of Gender-Dysphoric Children|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2008|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31818956b9|volume=47|issue=12|pages=1413–1423}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Identifying stable and persistent cases of GID may reduce the number of surgeries and hormonal interventions individuals undergo in adolescence and adulthood. Gender identity disorders persist into adolescence in about 27% of children with GID diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Wallien 2008"/&gt;

Diagnosis and treatment of GID in children can be distressing for the parents, which can further exacerbate distress in their child.  Parents had difficulties accepting their child's desire to be the opposite sex, and are resistant to children wanting to alter their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Darryl B.|author2=Rozanski, C.|author3=Carfagnini, J.|author4=Willoughby, B.|title=Gender Identity Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence|journal=Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality|year=2006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=7–34|doi=10.1300/J056v17n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supportive professionals===

Some professionals, including Dr. Edgardo J. Menvielle of the Children's National Medical Center, who has specialized in this area in his clinical practice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensnational.org/FindADoctor/DoctorProfile.aspx?DoctorId=325&amp;Name=Edgardo%20Menvielle *Edgardo J. Menvielle, MD, MSHS of the Children's National Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the proper response to gender variant behavior is supportive therapy aimed at helping the child deal with any social issues which may arise due to homophobia / transphobia. These professionals believe that attempts to alter these behaviors, and/or whatever mechanism is responsible for their expression, are generally ineffective and do more harm than good. While not universally advocating for what childhood transgender advocates refer to as full social transition, the CNMC model generally supports allowing a child to express cross gendered interests at home in an age appropriate fashion.  Other professionals associated with a supportive model include Dr. [[Norman Spack]] of Children's Hospital Boston,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site2280/mainpageS2280P4.html Gender Management Service (GeMS) Clinic at Children's Hospital in Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;  Catherine Tuerk, MA, RN, Herbert Schreier, MD (Children's Hospital Oakland), and Ellen C. Perrin, MD of the Center for Children with Special Needs (CCSN) at TUFTS. Rosenburg (2002) recommends a parent-centered approach that helps parents learn to accept and support their child's identity and help the child to work through the issues surrounding identity, without trying to eliminate gender-variant behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=M.|title=Children with gender identity issues and their parents in individual and group treatment|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=41|pages=619–21|doi=10.1097/00004583-200205000-00020|pmid=12014795|issue=5|last2=Jellinek|first2=Michael S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reparative therapy===

Other professionals, typified by Dr. [[Kenneth Zucker]], the Head of the Gender Identity Service, Child, Youth, and Family Program and Psychologist-in-Chief at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, believe that behavior modification to extinguish gender variance is the appropriate response to cross gender interests. Dr. Zucker asks the rhetorical question of whether it would be ethical to treat an African American child who wishes to identify as Caucasian with cosmetic surgeries to facilitate this identity, though his critics point out that gender identity is completely non-analogous to ethnic identity. Dr. Zucker's choice as one of the professionals creating the new DSM entry on GID has elicited a firestorm of controversy in the LGBTQ community. Dr. Zucker has expressed the opinion that if his therapies also occasionally prevent a homosexual outcome, they are a valid parental choice.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He was also criticized for statements suggesting that children with nonnormative gender might be autistic and hyperfocusing on gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harley |first1=Nicola |title=Children who believe they are transgender 'could have autism', says controversial expert |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/children-believe-transgender-could-have-autism-says-controversial/ |website=The Telegraph |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no one universal set of [[behavior modification|behavioral interventions]] designed to reduce stress in children with GID.  Zucker (2000) asserts that childhood gender dysphoria is caused by "tolerating or encouraging cross-gender behaviour or by intentionally raising [[androgyny|androgynous]] children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zucker|first=K.J|title=Gender identity disorder|journal=Handbook of developmental psycholpathology.|year=200|volume=2nd ed.|pages=671–86|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-4163-9_36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He advises that behavioural treatments should aim to discourage gender-variant behaviours that have inadvertently been reinforced in the past.  In contrast, [[reparative therapy]] for adults is generally discouraged by the ethics guidelines of major U.S. mental health organizations, including the [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[American Counseling Association]]. There is no such consensus around such therapies for children.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3628">{{Music of China}}

'''Chinese musicology''' is the academic study of traditional [[Chinese music]].  This discipline has a very long history. The concept of music ''yue'' stands among the oldest categories of Chinese thought, however, in the known sources it does not receive a fairly  clear definition until the writing of the ''[[Classic of Music]]'' (lost during the Han dynasty).

==Music scales==
The first [[musical scale]]s were derived from the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. On the [[Guqin]] (a traditional instrument) all of the dotted positions are equal string length divisions related to the open string like 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, etc. and are quite easy to recognize on this instrument. The Guqin has a scale of 13 positions all representing a natural harmonic position related to the open string.

The ancient Chinese defined, by mathematical means, a gamut or series of ''[[Shí-èr-lǜ]]'' (called the 十二律 12 ''lü'') from which various sets of five or seven frequencies were selected to make the sort of "do re mi" major [[scale (music)|scale]] familiar to those who have been formed with the [[Musical notation|Western Standard notation]]. The 12 ''lü'' approximate the frequencies known in the West as the chromatic scale, from A, then B-flat, through to G and A-flat.

==Scale and tonality==

Most Chinese music uses a [[pentatonic scale]], with the intervals (in terms of ''lǜ'') almost the same as those of the major pentatonic scale. The notes of this scale are called ''gōng'' 宫, ''shāng'' 商, ''jué'' 角, ''zhǐ'' 徵 and ''yǔ'' 羽. By starting from a different point of this sequence, a scale (named after its starting note) with a different interval sequence is  created, similar to the construction of [[Musical mode#Modern modes|modes]] in modern Western music.

Since the Chinese system is not an [[equal tempered]] tuning, playing a melody starting from the ''lǜ'' nearest to A will not necessarily sound the same as playing the same melody starting from some other ''lǜ'', since the [[wolf interval]] will occupy a different point in the scale. The effect of changing the starting point of a song can be rather like the effect of shifting from a [[major key|major]] to a [[minor key]] in Western music. The scalar tunings of [[Pythagoras]], based on 2:3 ratios (8:9, 16:27, 64:81, etc.), are a western near-parallel to the earlier calculations used to derive Chinese scales.

&lt;!--this image is not limited in width to 400px due to the amount of small detail--&gt;
[[File:Chinese_Music_Gamut_&amp;_Scales.svg|800px|left|thumb|How the scales are produced: Start with a fundamental frequency. (440 hertz is used here.) Apply the ratios to make the first column. Copy the second and all further elements in this column to the respective heads of the other eleven columns. Apply the ratios to make the second through the twelfth columns. So doing produces 144 frequencies (with some duplications). From each column five different selections of non-adjacent frequencies can be made. (See the colored blocks at the far left.) So each column can produce 60 different pentatonic scales.]]

A '''class II gene''' is a type of [[gene]] that codes for a [[protein]]. Class II genes are [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] by [[RNAP|RNAP II]].

Class II genes have a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] that may contain a [[TATA box]]. 

Basal transcription of class II genes requires the formation of a [[Transcription preinitiation complex|preinitiation complex]].

They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, include both intron and exon, and code for polypeptide.

[[Major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) class II genes are important in the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2987717 | pmid=19890353 | doi=10.1038/gene.2009.83 | volume=11 | issue=2 | title=Regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression, genetic variation and disease | year=2010 | journal=Genes Immun | pages=99–112 | last1 = Handunnetthi | first1 = L | last2 = Ramagopalan | first2 = SV | last3 = Ebers | first3 = GC | last4 = Knight | first4 = JC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to other measures of codon usage bias, such as the '[[effective number of codons]]' (Nc), which measure deviation from a uniform bias (null hypothesis), CAI measures the deviation of a given protein coding gene sequence with respect to a reference set of genes.

== Rationale ==
Ideally, the reference set in CAI is composed of highly expressed genes, so that CAI provides an indication of gene expression level under the assumption that there is translational selection to optimize gene sequences according to their expression levels. The rationale for this is dual: highly expressed genes need to compete for resources (i.e. ribosomes) in fast-growing organisms and it makes sense for them to be also more accurately translated. Both hypotheses lead to highly expressed genes using mostly codons for tRNA species that are abundant in the cell.

== Implementation ==
CAI is simply defined as the geometric mean of the weight associated to each codon over the length ({{math|L}}) of the gene sequence (measured in codons).

:&lt;math&gt;\text{CAI}= (\Pi_{i=1}^{L} w_{i})^{\frac{1}{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

For each amino acid, the weight of each of its codons, in CAI, is computed from the reference sequence set, as the ratio between the observed frequency of the codon {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;f&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;VAR&gt;i&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the frequency of the most frequent synonymous codon {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;f&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;VAR&gt;j&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} for that amino acid.

:&lt;math&gt;w_i=\frac{f_i}{\max(f_j)} \qquad i,j \in [\text{synonymous codons for amino acid}]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Cork''' is an [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] [[buoyancy|buoyant]] material, the [[Cork cambium|phellem layer]] of [[bark (botany)|bark]] tissue that is harvested for commercial use primarily from ''[[Quercus suber]]'' (the cork oak), which is [[endemism|endemic]] to southwest [[Europe]] and northwest [[Africa]]. Cork is composed of [[suberin]], a [[hydrophobic]] substance. Because of its impermeable, buoyant, elastic, and fire retardant properties, it is used in a variety of products, the most common of which is [[wine stopper]]s. The [[Dehesa (pastoral management)|montado]] landscape of [[Portugal]] produces approximately half of cork harvested annually worldwide, with [[Corticeira Amorim]] being the leading company in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Once the trees are about 25 years old the cork is traditionally stripped from the trunks every nine years, with the first two harvests generally producing lower quality cork. The trees live for about 300 years.

The cork industry is generally regarded as environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, Sarah, ''USA Today'' (August 26, 2007). [https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2007-08-26-cork-debate_N.htm "Stopper pulled on cork debate"]&lt;/ref&gt; Cork production is generally considered [[sustainable]] because the cork tree is not cut down to obtain cork; only the bark is stripped to harvest the cork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClellan|first=Keith|title=Apples, Corks, and Age|url=http://www.blanconews.com/news/116198/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227232506/http://www.blanconews.com/news/116198/|archivedate=2014-12-27|publisher=Blanco County News|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree continues to live and grow. The [[sustainability]] of production and the easy [[recycling]] of cork products and by-products are two of its most distinctive aspects. [[Cork oak]] forests also prevent [[desertification]] and are a particular habitat in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the refuge of various [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;Henley, Paul, BBC.com (September 18, 2008) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7623912.stm "Urging vintners to put a cork in it"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon footprint]] studies conducted by [[Corticeira Amorim]], Oeneo Bouchage of France and the Cork Supply Group of Portugal concluded that cork is the most environmentally friendly [[wine]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] in comparison to other alternatives. The [[Corticeira Amorim]]’s study, in particular ("Analysis of the life cycle of Cork, Aluminum and Plastic Wine Closures"), was developed by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], according to [[ISO 14000|ISO 14040]].&lt;ref&gt;[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]/ECOBILAN (October 2008). [http://www.corkfacts.com/pdffiles/Amorim_LCA_Final_Report.pdf Analysis of the life cycle of Cork, Aluminium and Plastic Wine Closures]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913143609/http://www.corkfacts.com/pdffiles/Amorim_LCA_Final_Report.pdf |date=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results concluded that, concerning the emission of greenhouse gases, each plastic stopper released 10 times more [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], whilst an aluminium screw cap releases 26 times more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than does a cork stopper.

The cork oak is unrelated to the "cork trees" (''[[Phellodendron]]''), which have corky bark but are not used for cork production.

==Harvesting==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
[[File:IAPH Saca del corcho.jpg|thumbnail|Cork extraction near [[Aracena]], Spain]]
Cork is extracted only from early May to late August, when the cork can be separated from the tree without causing permanent damage. When the tree reaches 25–30 years of age and about 24 in (60&amp;nbsp;cm) in circumference, the cork can be removed for the first time. However, this first harvest almost always produces poor quality or "virgin" cork (Portuguese ''cortiça virgem''; Spanish ''corcho bornizo'' or ''corcho virgen''&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/|title=DRAE|website=Lema.rae.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Bark from initial harvests can be used to make flooring, shoes, insulation and other industrial products. Subsequent extractions usually occur at intervals of 9 years, though it can take up to 13 for the cork to reach an acceptable size. If the product is of high quality it is known as "gentle" cork (Portuguese ''cortiça amadia'',&lt;ref&gt;''Amadio'' comes from and is synonym of ''amavio'', "beberage or spell to seduce" (Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa), from ''amar'', "to love".&lt;/ref&gt; but also ''cortiça secundeira'' only if it is the second time; Spanish ''corcho segundero'', also restricted to the "second time"&lt;ref name="DRAE"/&gt;), and, ideally, is used to make stoppers for wine and champagne bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvesting Cork Is as Natural as Shearing Sheep|url=http://about.newsusa.com/article/harvesting-cork-is-as-natural-as-shearing-sheep.aspx|website=Newsusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The workers who specialize in removing the cork are known as extractors. An extractor uses a very sharp axe to make two types of cuts on the tree: one horizontal cut around the plant, called a crown or necklace, at a height of about 2–3 times the circumference of the tree, and several vertical cuts called rulers or openings. This is the most delicate phase of the work because, even though cutting the cork requires significant force, the extractor must not damage the underlying [[phellogen]] or the tree will be harmed.
  
To free the cork from the tree, the extractor pushes the handle of the axe into the rulers. A good extractor needs to use a firm but precise touch in order to free a large amount of cork without damaging the product or tree.

These freed portions of the cork are called planks. The planks are usually carried off by hand since cork forests are rarely accessible to vehicles. The cork is stacked in piles in the forest or in yards at a factory and traditionally left to dry, after which it can be loaded onto a truck and shipped to a processor.

==Properties and uses==
[[File:Cork bathroom flooring.jpg|thumb|Varnished cork tiles can be used for [[flooring]], as an alternative for [[linoleum]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[ceramic]] [[tile]]s]]
Cork's [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elasticity]] combined with its near-impermeability makes it suitable as a material for [[bottle]] [[stopper (plug)|stoppers]], especially for [[wine bottle]]s. Cork stoppers represent about 60% of all cork based production. Cork has an almost zero [[Poisson's ratio]], which means the radius of a cork does not change significantly when squeezed or pulled.&lt;ref name="Stavroulakis1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stavroulakis | first1 = G.E. | year = 2005| title = Auxetic behaviour: Appearance and engineering applications | url = | journal = Physica Status Solidi B | volume = 242 | issue = 3| pages = 710–720 | doi=10.1002/pssb.200460388|bibcode = 2005PSSBR.242..710S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork is an excellent [[gasket]] material. Some [[carburetor]] float bowl gaskets are made of cork, for example.

Cork is also an essential element in the production of [[badminton]] [[shuttlecock]]s.

Cork's bubble-form structure and natural fire retardant make it suitable for acoustic and [[thermal insulation]] in house walls, floors, ceilings and facades. The by-product of more lucrative stopper production, corkboard is gaining popularity as a non-allergenic, easy-to-handle and safe alternative to petrochemical-based insulation products.

Sheets of cork, also often the by-product of stopper production, are used to make [[bulletin boards]] as well as [[flooring|floor and wall tiles]].

Cork's low [[density]] makes it a suitable material for [[fishing]] [[Float (fishing)|floats]] and buoys, as well as handles for [[fishing rod]]s (as an alternative to [[neoprene]]).

Granules of cork can also be mixed into [[concrete]]. The composites made by mixing cork granules and cement have lower thermal conductivity, lower density and good energy absorption. Some of the property ranges of the composites are density (400–1500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³), compressive strength (1–26 MPa) and flexural strength (0.5–4.0&amp;nbsp;MPa).&lt;ref&gt;Karade SR. 2003.

===Use in wine bottling===
[[File:Cork p1160013.jpg|thumb|A cork [[Stopper (plug)|stopper]] for a wine bottle]]
As late as the mid-17th century, French [[vintners]] did not use cork stoppers, using instead oil-soaked rags stuffed into the necks of bottles.&lt;ref&gt;Prlewe, J. Wine From Grape to Glass. New York: Abbeville Press, 1999, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wine corks can be made of either a single piece of cork, or composed of particles, as in champagne corks; corks made of granular particles are called "agglomerated corks".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brewerylane.com/corks.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113052418/http://www.brewerylane.com/corks.html |date=January 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural cork [[Closure (wine bottle)|closures]] are used for about 80% of the 20 billion bottles of [[wine]] produced each year. After a decline in use as wine-stoppers due to the increase in the use of synthetic alternatives, cork wine-stoppers are making a comeback and currently represent approximately 60% of wine-stoppers today{{when|date=December 2018}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Champagne uncorking photographed with a high speed air-gap flash.jpg|thumb|upright|left|High-speed [[air-gap flash]] image of a champagne bottle being uncorked]]
Because of the cellular structure of cork, it is easily compressed upon insertion into a bottle and will expand to form a tight seal. The interior diameter of the neck of glass bottles tends to be inconsistent, making this ability to seal through variable contraction and expansion an important attribute.  However, unavoidable natural flaws, channels, and cracks in the bark make the cork itself highly inconsistent. In a 2005 closure study, 45% of corks showed gas leakage during pressure testing both from the sides of the cork as well as through the cork body itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Gibson |first= Richard, ''Scorpex Wine Services'' |title= variability in permeability of corks and closures |url= http://www.scorpex.net/ASEVClosures2005RGibson.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130512182445/http://www.scorpex.net/ASEVClosures2005RGibson.pdf|archivedate=May 12, 2013 |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1990s, a number of wine brands have switched to [[alternative wine closures]] such as [[plastic]] stoppers, [[Screw cap (wine)|screw caps]], or other closures. During 1972 more than half of the Australian bottled wine went bad due to corking. A great deal of anger and suspicion was directed at Portuguese and Spanish cork suppliers who were suspected of deliberately supplying bad cork to non-EEC wine makers to help prevent cheap imports. Cheaper wine makers developed the aluminium "Spelvin" cap with a polypropylene stopper wad. More expensive wines and  carbonated varieties continued to use cork, although much closer attention was paid to the quality. Even so, some high premium makers prefer the Spelvin as it is a guarantee that the wine will be good even after many decades of ageing. Some consumers may have conceptions about screw caps being representative of lower quality wines, due to their cheaper price; however, in Australia, for example, much of the non-sparkling wine production now uses these Spelvin caps as a cork alternative, although some have recently switched back to cork citing issues using screw caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.co.uk/news/rusden-wines-abandons-screwcap-for-cork/312560.article|title=Rusden Wines abandons screwcap for cork |publisher=Harpers Wine &amp; Spirit Trade News|website=Harpers.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alternatives to cork have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, screwtops are generally considered to offer a [[Cork taint|trichloroanisole]] (TCA) free seal, but they also reduce the oxygen transfer rate between the bottle and the atmosphere to almost zero, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the wine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} TCA is the main documented cause of [[cork taint]] in wine. However, some in the wine industry say natural cork stoppers are important because they allow oxygen to interact with wine for proper aging, and are best suited for wines purchased with the intent to age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cork or screw cap – which is best for your wine?|url=http://www.corklink.com/index.php/cork-or-screw-cap-which-is-best-for-your-wine/|website=Corklink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoppers which resemble natural cork very closely can be made by isolating the suberin component of the cork from the undesirable [[lignin]], mixing it with the same substance used for contact lenses and an adhesive, and molding it into a standardized product, free of TCA or other undesirable substances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewinesociety.com/growers-and-vintages-winemaking-diam-corks Diam Corks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216121843/http://www.thewinesociety.com/growers-and-vintages-winemaking-diam-corks |date=2014-12-16 }}, The Wine Society&lt;/ref&gt;  Composite corks with real cork veneers are used in cheaper wines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Konohovs|first1=Konohovs|title=The True Cost of a Bottle of Cheap Wine|url=http://kalw.org/post/true-cost-bottle-cheap-wine#stream/0|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=[[KALW]]|date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork is used in musical instruments, particularly [[woodwind instrument]]s, where it is used to fasten together segments of the instrument, making the seams airtight. Low quality conducting baton handles are also often made out of cork.

It is also used in shoes, especially those using [[Welt (shoe)|welt construction]] to improve climate control and comfort.

Because it is impermeable and moisture-resistant, cork is often used as an alternative to leather in [[handbag]]s, [[wallet]]s and other fashion items.

Cork can be used to make [[brick]]s for the outer walls of houses, as in Portugal's pavilion at [[Expo 2000]].

Cork is used as the core of both [[Baseball (ball)|baseballs]] and [[cricket ball]]s. A [[corked bat]] is made by replacing the interior of a [[baseball bat]] with cork – a practice known as "corking". It was historically a method of cheating at [[baseball]]; the [[wikt:efficacy|efficacy]] of the practice is now discredited.

Cork is often used, in various forms, in spacecraft [[Heat shield#Space|heat shields]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/gm2/spacecraft/sample.html|title=Genesis: Search for Origins Spacecraft Subsystems – Sample Return Capsule|publisher=JPL NASA|quote=cork-based material called SLA-561V that was developed by Lockheed Martin for use on the Viking missions to Mars, and have been used on several missions including Genesis, Pathfinder, Stardust and the Mars Exploration Rover missions.|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Payload fairing|fairings]].

The '''digital dividend''' refers to the [[radio spectrum]] which is released in the process of [[digital television transition]].  When [[television broadcast]]ers switch from [[analog TV]] to digital-only platforms, part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] that has been used for broadcasting will be freed-up because [[digital television]] needs less spectrum than analog television. One reason is that new [[digital video compression]] technology can transmit numerous [[digital subchannel]]s using the same amount of spectrum used to transmit one analog [[TV channel]].  However, the primary reason is that digital transmissions require much less of a [[guard band]] on [[sideband|either side]], since they are not nearly as prone to [[RF interference]] from [[adjacent channel]]s.  Because of this, there is no longer any need to leave [[white space (radio)|empty channels]] to protect stations from each other,  in turn allowing stations to be repacked into fewer channels, leaving more contiguous spectrum to be [[frequency allocation|allocated]] for other [[wireless]] services.

The digital dividend usually locates at frequency bands from 174 to 230&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[Very high frequency|VHF]]) and from 470 to 862&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]). However, the location and size of digital dividend vary among countries due to the factors including geographical position and penetration of satellite/cable services.

As a result of the technological transition, a significant number of governments are now planning for or allocating their digital dividends.  For examples, the United States completed its transition on 12 June 2009 and auctioned the spectrum. Meanwhile, Australia is still planning for it.

==Potential uses==
In countries where the digital television transition has not yet finished, over-the-air broadcasting services are still using radio-frequency spectrum in what is known as the [[Very High Frequency|Very High Frequency (VHF)]] and [[Ultra high frequency|Ultra High Frequency]] (UHF) bands.
After the completion of digital transition, part of this spectrum will be released as digital dividend to provide a range of new communication services. Proposed utilization of the released spectrum includes:

* Digital Terrestrial TV
* Advanced Mobile Services
* Broadcast Mobile TV
* Commercial Wireless Broadband services, both to fixed locations and mobile devices
* Wireless Broadband services for public safety and disaster relief (PPDR)
* Services ancillary to broadcasting and programming (SAB/SAP)

Analog television spectrum in the UHF bands is valuable to potential purchasers because of its ability to carry signals over long distances, penetrate buildings and carry large amounts of data.

Lots of countries are in favour of using a part of the digital dividend for electronic communications services, such as [[mobile communications]] and [[wireless broadband]]. These new services would utilize the upper part of the UHF band (790-862&amp;nbsp;MHz).

===Allocation for mobile services===
One proposal to utilize the digital dividend is to develop an international mobile service using frequencies which will be released after the completion of digital transition in a global range. This part spectrum suits for 3G mobile telecommunication service. However, it would be difficult to fully realize the potentials of the digital dividend because countries in the world will not finish the switch to digital TV simultaneously. Further it is an issue involving factors such as topography, penetration of satellite/cable services, the requirements for regional service, spectrum usage in neighboring countries, etc.

In 2007, the [http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/index.asp?category=conferences&amp;rlink=wrc-07&amp;lang=en World Radiocommunication Conference] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usitua.org/Training-Workshops/Session%203%20-%20JM.ppt |work=WRC-07 Workshop |title=Select Critical Issues with a Commercial Sector Focus |accessdate=2014-02-22 |last=Manner |first=Jennifer A. |date=2007-09-19 |publisher=Mobile Satellite Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; revised the allocation of a portion of UHF spectrum for mobile broadband services and advanced mobile services. Although the allocations set a framework, they do not dictate member countries how to allocate digital dividend spectrum. Rather they can take national requirements into consideration. Countries in global regions one and three, such as [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Russia]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]] use the spectrum range from 790-960&amp;nbsp;MHz which is one of the bands dedicated to the roll-out of [[International Mobile Telecommunications-2000|international mobile telecommunications (IMT)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/imt-2000/DocumentsIMT2000/IMT-2000.pdf international mobile telecommunications (IMT)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306095648/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/imt-2000/DocumentsIMT2000/IMT-2000.pdf |date=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries in global region three, such as [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]], identified the band or portions of the band 698–790&amp;nbsp;MHz for the implementation of IMT. Meanwhile, the spectrum 698-960&amp;nbsp;MHz was planned for implementation of IMT in global region two, the Americas. However, parts of the spectrum, 806-960&amp;nbsp;MHz, are already used for [[mobile telecommunications]] in global region two.

===Benefits of mobile broadband use===
Experts{{who|date=February 2014}} see several benefits of using the freed spectrum for mobile broadband because it is cheaper than fixed broadband to provide [[last mile]] connectivity.

It could facilitate [[economic development]]. McKinsey's report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/en/Client_Service/Telecommunications/Latest_thinking/Mobile_broadband_for_the_masses.aspx |title=Mobile Broadband for the Masses |publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company |date=February 2009 |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202015603/http://www.mckinsey.com/en/Client_Service/Telecommunications/Latest_thinking/Mobile_broadband_for_the_masses.aspx |archivedate=2016-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that every 10% increase in household broadband penetration will bring 1.4% increase of  [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth. Usually GDP growth leads to job creations. One good thing about mobile broadband is that mobile penetration is much higher than PC penetration, that means mobile broadband will help to the [[broadband penetration]] to increase faster.

Mobile broadband could be used to serve people living in rural area and low income groups, such as [[farmer]]s. It could provide them medical, educational and other general information.

===For bridging the digital divide===
Some researchers argued that digital dividend could provide opportunity to bridging the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=847186 |title=Digital Divide to Digital Dividend |first1=Nikhilesh |last1=Dholakia |first2=Nir |last2=Kshetri |publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=2005-11-13 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that because of the characteristics of this spectrum fewer [[radio station]]s are needed to cover a given area. Therefore, the cost to provide broadband in remote rural areas could be significantly reduced. In the past, a profitable roll out of [[fixed line]] broadband infrastructure is not feasible because the necessary investments to cover the long distances are too high. However,  [[wireless broadband]] using the spectrum of the digital dividend offers an opportunity to overcome the digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=847186 Digital Divide to Digital Dividend]&lt;/ref&gt;

But not all of them agree with the point. Those who do not agree, argued that this approach suffers from the trade-off between reach and speed significantly limit scalability of the network. If the transmission demands grow at current rates, a wireless broadband access network covering large areas will be likely outdated before being deployed. Therefore, the digital divide will still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emnet.univie.ac.at/uploads/media/Picot_Grove_Jondral_Elsner_01.pdf |title=Why the Digital Dividend will not close the Digital Divide |last2=Grove |first2=Nico |last1=Picot |first1=Arnold |last3=Jondral |first3=Friedrich K. |last4=Elsner |first4=Jens |format=PDF |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital dividend policies around the world==

===United States of America===
{{outdated|date=August 2018|inaccurate=600 mhz?? other purchases? lots missing}}

{{Main|United States 2008 wireless spectrum auction}}

The chunk of spectrum being freed from broadcasting was auctioned for commercial uses in the U.S. The 700&amp;nbsp;MHz auction, known officially as Auction 73, concluded with 1090 provisionally winning bids covering 1091 licenses and raised a total of $19,120,378,000 in winning bids and $18,957,582,150 in net winning bids.

Due to its physical attributes, 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band penetrates walls fairly easily and well. This makes this chunk of spectrum perfect for either cellular or long-range wireless broadband. A telco could build a powerful wireless network by holding it. An ISP could also make a fortune with it.

The auction went the following way: the part of the available spectrum, which runs from 698-806&amp;nbsp;MHz, had already been auctioned off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&amp;id=73 |title=Auction 73 - 700 MHz Band |publisher=FCC |work=FCC auctions |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of it is reserved for the nationwide public safety broadband network that will be constructed over the next few years. The remaining was divided up into A,B,C,D, and E blocks, regionally. Every bidder was supposed to secretly declare their intent to the FCC before the auction, but Google did not keep its intentions secret. Winners picked up their allocations around two months after the auction.

There was a lot of excitement over the auction of C and D blocks. Block C was the prime spectrum that Verizon and others, such as Google, were interested in. This block covered two 11&amp;nbsp;MHz chunks of spectrum that could be bid on together, making 22&amp;nbsp;MHz available. Besides the bidders of this chunk, the other reason drawing attention to this block was that Google convinced the FCC to load up with two open-access provisions: (i) the winner has to make the network open so any "safe" device can use it; (ii)  they have to make their own networked devices open as well.

The block D licenses covers two 5&amp;nbsp;MHz sections for a total of 10&amp;nbsp;MHz. This block is special compared with other blocks because the winners must be part of the Public Safety/Private Partnership established by the FCC. Therefore, the winner's wireless network has to be good enough to meet public safety specifications for coverage and redundancy. Furthermore, the winner could operate two public safety portions, 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, as a commercial network. Commercial traffic can also be carried over the public safety portion of the network as long as it is not being utilized.

The blocks A, B, and E covered 30&amp;nbsp;MHz in total. The licenses for each of the blocks were only good for small geographic areas. The FCC's intention was that the winners would use the spectrum for regional or rural area telecommunication services.

There were some other conditions for the winners of blocks A, B, C, and E. For blocks A, B and E, winners needed to cover at least 35 percent of the territory of their license within four years, and a full 70 percent of the territory within 10 years. For block C the winners were also required to cover 40 percent of the territory within four years, 75 percent coverage within 10 years. The FCC will automatically reclaim "unserved portions of the license area" from companies that do not meet the build-out requirements.

Not all of the licenses were sold.  On April 15, 2011, the FCC announced that they would hold auction 92 on July 19, 2011 to sell the available license of 700&amp;nbsp;MHz. The results for all of the blocks were as follows:

====Block A====
Verizon Wireless and U.S. Cellular Corp. got 25 licenses each. But no one company dominated the A-Block. Other notable winners included CenturyTel Inc. and Cellular South. Verizon Wireless's licenses mainly covered densely populated urban areas, while U.S. Cellular was focused on the ones for the Midwest, Northeast and Northwest.

====Block B====
AT&amp;T Mobility got one-third of the available licenses, spending $6.6 billion. U.S. Cellular snapped 127 licenses which are near its current market clusters in the Midwest, Northeast and Northwest. Verizon Wireless scooped up 77 B-Block licenses.

====Block C====
Verizon Wireless paid more than $4.6 billion for licenses covering the contiguous 48 states as well as Hawaii. Triad 700 L.L.C. picked up C-Block licenses covering Alaska, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, while Small Ventures USA L.P. bought the license for the C Block covering the Gulf of Mexico.

====Block D====
No licenses were sold in this block and new auctions were scheduled to sell it.

====Block E====
EchoStar Corp, satellite television provider, picked up 168 of the total 176 E-Block licenses for more than $711 million. Qualcomm also bought 5 licenses covering markets in California, Arizona and the Northeast.

====The winners====
Of the 214 applicants approved to bid in the FCC's auction, 101 walked away with spectrum.

[[Verizon Wireless]]'s winnings covered seven of the 10 regional C-Block licenses, as well as 77 licenses in the B Block and 25 licenses in the A Block.

[[AT&amp;T Mobility]] spent $6.64 billion for 227 B-Block licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirelessstrategy.com/700auction.html |title=Summary of Top 10 Winners by Net Winning Bids |publisher=Wireless Strategy, LLC |work=700 MHz Auction |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining C-block licenses were won by a number of operators:
* Triad 700 L.L.C. took the Alaska and Puerto Rico/U.S. Virgin Islands licenses and Small Ventures USA L.P. took the Gulf of Mexico license.
* [[Qualcomm|Qualcomm Inc.]] won nine licenses for a total of around $500 million: B-Block licenses covering Yuba City and Imperial, Calif., and Hunterdon, N.J.; and five E Block licenses.
* [[MetroPCS|MetroPCS Communications Inc.]] scored only one license, the A Block for Boston, for $313 million.
* Chevron walked away with the A, B and E blocks covering the Gulf of Mexico, most likely for the company's oil operations there.
* Cavalier Wireless spent $61.8 million for licenses across the A and B Blocks.
* [[Cox Communications]] won $304 million in the A and B blocks.
* [[U.S. Cellular]] won 152 licenses for $401 million in the A and B Block.
* Regional telecom operator [[CenturyTel]] Inc. spent close to $150 million for 48 B-Block licenses and 21 A-Block licenses.
* [[Vulcan Inc.|Vulcan Ventures]], owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, won two licenses, in the Seattle/Tacoma and Portland/Salem markets, for $112 million.
* Regional wireless provider [[Cellular South]] spent $191.5 million on A- and B-Block licenses.

===Europe===
{{update|section|date=November 2013}}

The [[European Union]] has not yet worked out a specific plan on how to use the freed spectrum. According to the visions of trans-European [[4G]] mobile wireless, economists predict that it will bring €50 billion [[economic growth]]. To utilize the full benefit of the digital dividend, the European countries at least have two steps to take: first, all member states of the European Union are requested to make sure that the switchover to digital transmission technologies will be completed by 1 January 2012. Therefore, the complete digital dividend should be made available for communication services. Second, member states shall use a standardized regulatory framework to ensure the use for the [[800 MHz frequency band|790–862&amp;nbsp;MHz]] sub-band for electronic communications services throughout the EU ([[European Commission]] 2009).
The EU published a schedule table in the 2009 Report for the European Commission ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Exploiting the digital dividend' – a European approach''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rspg.groups.eu.int/_documents/documents/meeting/rspg19/rspg09_283_memberstates_workshop.pdf |title='Exploiting the digital dividend' – a European approach |format=PDF |date=2009-05-05 |publisher=Analysis Mason Limited, DotEcon Limited, Hogan &amp; Hartson LLP |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425092311/http://rspg.groups.eu.int/_documents/documents/meeting/rspg19/rspg09_283_memberstates_workshop.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}}, the [[digital television transition]] has been completed in all of the [[member states of the European Union]] with the exception of [[Romania]] (which is due in 2015).

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the key auction of radio airwaves that will support future mobile Internet use will be delayed until late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101218084746/http://kbspectrum.com/blog/?p=556 Canada Digital Dividend Spectrum Auction — Late 2012 according to Financial Post] &lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of obstacles to the sale of frequencies, including a continuing consultation by [[Industry Canada]] on whether to abolish or at least scale back restrictions on foreign investment considered among the most restrictive in the G8 group of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/pwc09.htm#t46 |work=Digital Transition Models |title=The Digital Dividend |publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227090258/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/pwc09.htm |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australia]] an independent engineering consultancy firm, Kordia Pty Ltd, was commissioned by the [[Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy]] to identify issues and options for releasing spectrum after analog television is switched off in Australia.
Kordia found that it is possible for 126&amp;nbsp;MHz of UHF spectrum to be released as a digital dividend. The government also have some other factors to consider.
The factors are:
1. The uncertainty of future uses of spectrum;
2. Australia needs to align [[spectrum allocation]]s with major developed countries because she is a technology taker.
3. Public interest
Based on the political and technological considerations Australia government's target digital dividend is 126&amp;nbsp;MHz of contiguous UHF spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.dbcde.gov.au/2013/october/digital_dividend_green_paper_html |title=Digital dividend green paper |publisher=Australian Government - Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy |date=January 2010 |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227064244/http://www.archive.dbcde.gov.au/2013/october/digital_dividend_green_paper_html |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in July 1985, the '''Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences''' (ERIRAS) was originally an outgrowth of the general energy department at [[Institute for High Temperatures RAS]] (IVTAN).  The staff at the newly formed organization comprised professionals gathered from other scientific organizations.  At the time of its creation, ERIRAS’ challenge was to develop the basic content and quantitative substantiation for the Energy Program of the USSR.  The first director of ERIRAS was [[Lev Aleksandrovich Milentyev]], an Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  At present, Academician [[Aleksei Aleksandrovich Makarov]] is the director of the Institute. 

== Organization ==
The Institute employs approximately 80 staff members, of whom 65% are highly skilled specialists.  It comprises eight scientific departments: 

*the Laboratory for the study of the interconnections between economics and energy
*the Laboratory for the study of the improvement of energy consumption and energy savings
*the Laboratory for the modeling of [[energy market]]s
*the Laboratory for research on the methodology of energy policy development 
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of oil and gas systems
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of electricity and heat systems
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of the coal industry
*the Centre for the study of international energy markets

The Institute deploys a matrix organizational structure in order to maximize flexibility.  Thus, different departments can work together jointly and each can be modified according to the circumstances.

== Activities ==
The Institute’s mission is to find solutions to a wide range of contemporary challenges including: 
efficient energy production and consumption techniques to promote energy savings; appropriate pricing mechanisms for energy markets; and legislation, tax policy and other general issues related to domestic energy policy.

ERIRAS work is divided into the following research areas:

*the study of the regularities of energy development 
*the modeling of energy development
*the theory and methods of energy system studies 
*the creation of a scientific basis for energy policy and the mechanisms for its implementation 
*the identification of the rational spheres and magnitudes of energy savings, and the mechanisms for energy saving policy implementation which take into consideration environmental concerns
*the study of the priorities in energy technical policy
*the identification of rational mechanisms for the regulation of energy development within a market framework, including primary legislation, pricing techniques, and tax and investment policy
*the forecasting of energy markets
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the oil &amp; gas industry
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the energy sectors (electricity &amp; heat)
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the coal industry

The Institute’s work is based on complex mathematical modeling, a unique database, and advanced computer technologies.

Today, ERIRAS is a major scientific center that is at the forefront of fundamental and applied research.  The knowledge produced by ERIRAS provides the basis for energy development forecasting and policy in Russia, the CIS, and for international energy markets.

ELSI was conceived in 1988 when [[James Watson]], at the press conference announcing his appointment as director of the [[Human Genome Project]] (HGP), suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly declared that the ethical and social implications of genomics warranted a special effort and should be directly funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Deegan, R. 1994/1995.

Life Sciences, Society and Policy 2013, 9:3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

At least four features seem typical for an ELSA approach,&lt;ref&gt;Zwart H., Nelis A. (2009) What is ELSA genomics? Science and Society Series on convergence research. EMBO Reports 10 (6), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; namely: 
# proximity (closeness to or embedding in large-scale scientific programs); 
# early anticipation (of societal issues and potential controversies); 
# interactivity (encouraging stakeholders and publics to assume an active role in co-designing research agendas); 
# interdisciplinarity (bridging boundaries between research communities such as for instance [[bioethics]] and STS).

== Reception ==

The ELSA approach has been widely endorsed by academics studying the societal impact of science and technology, but also criticized. Michael Yesley, responsible for the US Department of Energy (DOE) part of the ELSI programme, claims that the ELSI Program was in fact a discourse of justification, selecting topics of ethics research that will facilitate rather than challenge the advance of genetic technology.&lt;ref&gt;Yesley M.S. (2005) What’s ELSI got to do with it? Bioethics and the human genome project. New Genetics and Society 27: 1–6, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ELSA genomics as the handmaiden of genomics research. In Europe, in the context of the [[Horizon 2020]] program, ELSA-style research is now usually framed as [[Responsible Research and Innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;Zwart H., Landeweerd L., Van Rooij A. (2014). Adapt or perish? Assessing the recent shift in the European research funding arena from ‘ELSA’ to ‘RRI’. Life Sciences, Society and Policy. 10:11 (14 May 2014). doi:10.1186/s40504-014-0011-x.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Examples of academic journals open to publishing ELSA research results are ''New Genetics and Society'' (Taylor and Francis) and ''[[Life Sciences, Society and Policy]]'' (SpringerOpen).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2103">'''Exchange to exchange''' (sometimes '''Exchange-to-exchange''', abbreviated '''E2E''') is [[System integration|integration]], between certain pairs of computer systems. To qualify as E2E, each of the paired systems must have a primary use of acting as an [[B2B Gateway|exchange]], or gateway, among its own customers.

A common example is a connection between [[Stockbroker|stock brokerage]] firms' internal systems and systems of a [[stock market]] in which the broker trades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6BvLR8UQDMC&amp;pg=PA911|title=Wiley CIA Exam Review 2013, Internal Audit Knowledge Elements|last=Vallabhaneni|first=S. Rao|date=2013-02-12|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118515181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These connections are often facilitated by [[middleware]] services, such as [[object request broker]]s.

Each E2E partner system has a primary function to its own clients of allowing them to transfer information or conduct other transactions, This is a form of the business to business ([[B2B e-commerce|B2B]]) commerce model, as each E2E partner is a B2B gateway for its clients, and in turn exchanges information with at least one other B2B gateway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsswBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary Of Computer &amp; Information Technology|last=Talukdar|first=Mrinal|publisher=Prabhat Books|year=2013|isbn=9789350485057|location=|pages=108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between the two B2B systems (exchanges) is then an exchange to exchange integration.

E2E is an alternative to direct application to application integration (A2A),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xi5q7uO3X34C&amp;pg=PA292|title=E-Business Management: Integration of Web Technologies with Business Models|last=Shaw|first=Michael|date=2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781402071782|location=|pages=292|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some A2A can be classified as E2E.

Most atoms on [[Earth]] came from the [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] [[interstellar dust|dust]] and [[interstellar gas|gas]] from which the [[Sun]] and [[Solar System]] formed.  However, in the [[space science]] community, "'''extraterrestrial materials'''" generally refers to objects now on Earth that were solidified prior to arriving on Earth.  In October 2011, scientists reported that one form of extraterrestrial material, [[cosmic dust]], contains complex [[organic compound|organic]] matter ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [[aromatic]]-[[aliphatic]] structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [[stars]].&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chow |first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Organic Matter from Stars |url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ScienceDaily]] Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2011-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111026"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kwok |first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature10542 |bibcode = 2011Natur.479...80K |pmid=22031328 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=80–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database] for tracking [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) in the [[universe]]. According to scientists, more than 20% of the [[carbon]] in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible [[PAH world hypothesis|starting materials]] for the [[Abiogenesis#PAH world hypothesis|formation]] of [[Life#Extraterrestrial life|life]]. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the [[Big Bang]], are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with [[Star formation|new stars]] and [[exoplanets]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

==Categories==
To date these fall into a small number of broad categories, namely: 
# [[Meteorites]] too large to vaporize on atmospheric entry but small enough to leave fragments lying on the ground
# [[Moon rock]]s brought to Earth by the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Luna programme|Luna]] missions
# Unmelted micrometeorites typically less than 100 micrometres in diameter [[Interplanetary dust cloud#Collecting interplanetary dust on earth|collected]] on Earth and in the Earth's stratosphere
# Specimens returned from space-borne collection missions like NASA's [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] (LDEF) and the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] sample return mission.

A minor but notable subset of the materials that make up the foregoing collections were also solidified ''outside of the Solar System''. These are often referred to as interstellar materials, some of which are also [[presolar grains|presolar]] i.e. they predate the formation of the Solar System.

Each of these types of material is treated elsewhere.  This entry, therefore, is here primarily to consider the relationship between types of extraterrestrial materials on Earth, as well as the types of extraterrestrial material we'd like to have a closer look at.

== Special characteristics ==

=== Oxidation state ===

Thanks to the "romance" between [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] atoms, which form gases when they combine, the solid material in a given [[planetary system]] probably depends on whether carbon abundances were greater, or less, than those of oxygen. What is left over goes into solids. There was more oxygen than carbon in the Solar System, so solid planetary surfaces (as well as primitive meteorites) are largely made up of oxides like SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[silicate]]s, resulting in [[silicate planet]]s). If the converse was true, [[carbide]]s might be the dominant form of "rock" (resulting in [[carbon planet]]s).

Larger [[planetary body|planetary bodies]] in the early Solar System were hot enough to experience melting and [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]], with heavier [[chemical element|elements]] (like [[nickel]]) finding their way into the [[planetary core|core]].  The lighter silicate rocks presumably float to the surface.  Thus this might explain why [[iron]] on Earth's surface is depleted in nickel, while [[iron meteorite]]s (from the center of a differentiated [[planetoid]]) are rich in nickel.  Since it is not a very active rock-forming element, most of our nickel is in the [[Structure of the Earth#Core|Earth's core]]. A key feature of extraterrestrial materials, in comparison to naturally occurring terrestrial materials, is therefore Ni/Fe ratios above several percent.

Another consequence of the leftover oxygen in the early Solar System is the fact that presolar carbides from [[star system]]s with higher ratios of C/O are easier to recognize in primitive meteorites, than are presolar silicates.  Hence presolar carbon and carbide grains were discovered first.

===Elemental abundances===

Present day elemental abundances are superimposed on an (evolving) galactic-average set of elemental abundances that was inherited by the Solar System, along with some atoms from local [[nucleosynthesis]] sources, at the time of the Sun's formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suess | first1 = H. E. | last2 = Urey | first2 = H. C. | year = 1956 | title = Abundances of the elements | url = | journal = Rev Mod Phys | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 53–74 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53 | bibcode=1956RvMP...28...53S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cameron | first1 = A. G. W.  | year = 1973 | title = Abundances of the elements in the solar system | url = | journal = Space Sci Rev | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 121–146 |doi=10.1007/BF00172440|bibcode=1973SSRv...15..121C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anders | first1 = E. | last2 = Ebihara | first2 = M. | year = 1982 | title = Solar-system abundances of the elements | url = | journal = Geochim. Cosmochim.

Awaiting more on this here cf. [[cosmic abundance]].

=== Impact and irradiation effects ===

The atmosphere of planet Earth, and the Earth's magnetic field, protect us from impact and irradiation by a wide range of objects that fly around in space.  Those who know about these effects can often learn from them a lot about the history of extraterrestrial materials.

==== Microcraters and such====

Microcraters, "pancakes", and "splashes" were first seen on the surface of [[lunar rock]]s and [[lunar regolith|soil]] grains.  They tell us about the direct exposure of an object's surface to space in the absence of an atmosphere.  These structures are quite unlike features found on the surface of terrestrial rocks and soil.  They have also been identified on grains found in meteorites, and on man-made objects exposed to the micrometeorite flux in space.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

==== Nuclear particle tracks ====

Nuclear track damage trails from the passage of heavy ions in non-conducting solids were first reported by E. C. H. Silk and R. S. Barnes in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silk | first1 = E. C. H. | last2 = Barnes | first2 = R. S. | year = 1959 | title = Examination of fission fragment tracks with an electron microscope | url = | journal = Phil. Mag. | volume = 4 | issue = 44| pages = 970–971 | doi = 10.1080/14786435908238273 |bibcode = 1959PMag....4..970S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their etchability along with many subsequent applications were established by Fleischer, [[Buford Price|Price]] and Walker, starting with their work at General Electric Laboratories in Schenectady, New York.&lt;ref name="Fleischer1975"&gt;R. L. Fleischer, P. Buford Price, and Robert M. Walker (1975) ''Nuclear Tracks in Solids'' (U. California Press, Berkeley).&lt;/ref&gt;  See also [[solid state nuclear track detector]].

Nuclear particle tracks subsequently found many uses in extraterrestrial materials, thanks both to the exposure of those materials to radiation in space, and to their sometimes ancient origins.  These applications included (i) determining the exposure of mineral surfaces to [[solar flare]] particles from the Sun, (ii) determining the spectrum of solar flare particle energies from the early Sun, and (iii) the discovery of fission tracks from extinct isotopes of [[Plutonium 244]] in primitive meteorites.

==== Nuclear spallation effects ====

Particles subject to bombardment by sufficiently energetic particles, like those found in cosmic rays, also experience the transmutation of atoms of one kind into another.  These [[spallation]] effects can alter the trace element isotopic composition of specimens in ways which allow researchers in the laboratory to fingerprint the nature of their exposure in space.

These techniques have been used, for example, to look for (and determine the date of) events in the pre-Earth history of a meteorite's parent body (like a major collision) that drastically altered the space exposure of the material in that meteorite.  For example, the [[Murchison meteorite]] landed in Australia in 1967, but its parent body apparently underwent a collision event about 800,000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;M. W. Caffee, J. N. Goswami, C. M. Hohenberg, K. Marti and R. C. Reedy (1988) in ''Meteorites and the early solar system'' (ed. J. F. Kerridge and M. S. Matthews, U Ariz. Press, Tucson AZ) 205-245.&lt;/ref&gt; which broke it into meter-sized pieces.

=== Isotopic abundances ===

The isotopic homogeneity of our [[planet]] and the Solar System provides a blank slate on which to detect the effect of nuclear processes on Earth, in the Solar System,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = Robert N.  | year = 1978 | title = Isotopic anomalies in the early solar system | url = | journal = Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 501–522 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ns.28.120178.002441 |bibcode = 1978ARNPS..28..501C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in objects coming to us from outside the Solar System.  Awaiting more here, see [[natural abundance]].

==== Noble gases ====

[[Noble gas]]es are particularly interesting from an isotopic perspective, first because they avoid chemical interactions, secondly because many of them have more than one isotope on which to carry the signature of nuclear processes ([[xenon]] has many), and finally because they are relatively easy to extract from solid materials by simple heating.  As a result, they play a pivotal role in the unfolding drama of extraterrestrial materials study.

Some clues to moving further might be found in this book&lt;ref&gt;Minoru Ozima and Frank A. Podosek (2002) ''Noble gas geochemistry'' (Cambridge U. Press, NY, second edition) {{ISBN|0-521-80366-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.gca.2006.06.518  | bibcode = 2006GeCAS..70Q.258H | title = Noble gas mass spectrometry in the 21st century | year = 2006 | last1 = Hohenberg | first1 = C | journal = Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta | volume = 70 | issue = 18 | pages = A258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Radiometric dating in general ====

Isotopic abundances provide important clues to the date of events that allowed a material to begin accumulating gaseous decay byproducts, or that allowed incident radiation to begin transmuting elements.  Because of the harsh radiations, unusual starting compositions, and long delays between events sometimes experienced, isotopic dating techniques are of special importance in the study of extraterrestrial materials.

Until more perspective is added here on the importance of these tools to extraterrestrial materials research, you can find clues to some strategies not mentioned here under [[radiometric dating]].

==== Other isotopic studies ====

The categories of study mentioned before this are classic isotopic applications.  However, extraterrestrial materials also carry information on a wide range of other nuclear processes.  These include for example: (i) the decay of now-extinct [[radionuclide]]s, like those supernova byproducts introduced into Solar System materials shortly before the collapse of our [[solar nebula]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = Ernst  | year = 2003 | title = An isotopic view of the early solar system | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/300/5617/265 | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5617| pages = 265–267 | doi = 10.1126/science.1080300 | pmid = 12690180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (ii) the products of [[stellar nucleosynthesis|stellar]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis|explosive]] nucleosynthesis found in almost undiluted form in presolar grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = Ernst  | year = 1998 | title = Stellar nucleosynthesis and the isotopic composition of presolar grains from primitive meteorites | url = | journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 147–188 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.earth.26.1.147 |bibcode = 1998AREPS..26..147Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter are providing astronomers with up-close information on the state of the whole periodic table in exotic environments scattered all across the early Milky Way.

== Function ==

This gene product is a component of a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particle thought to participate in the first step in processing pre-ribosomal (r)RNA. It is associated with the [[Small nucleolar RNA U3|U3]], [[U8 small nucleolar RNA|U8]], and [[U13 small nucleolar RNA|U13]] small nucleolar RNAs and is located in the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of the [[nucleolus]]. The encoded protein contains an N-terminal repetitive domain that is rich in glycine and arginine residues, like fibrillarins in other species. Its central region resembles an RNA-binding domain and contains an RNP consensus sequence. Antisera from approximately 8% of humans with the autoimmune disease [[scleroderma]] recognize fibrillarin.&lt;ref name="entrez"/&gt;

Fibrillarin is a component of several ribonucleoproteins including a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein ([[SnRNP]]) and one of the two classes of [[snoRNA|small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins]] (snoRNPs). SnRNAs function in [[Splicing (genetics)|RNA splicing]] while snoRNPs function in [[ribosomal RNA]] processing. 

Fibrillarin is associated with U3, U8 and U13 [[small nuclear RNA]]s in mammals and is similar to the yeast NOP1 protein. Fibrillarin has a well conserved sequence of around 320 amino acids, and contains 3 domains, an N-terminal Gly/Arg-rich region; a central domain resembling other RNA-binding proteins and containing an RNP-2-like consensus sequence; and a C-terminal alpha-helical domain. An evolutionarily related pre-rRNA processing protein, which lacks the Gly/Arg-rich domain, has been found in various archaea.

A study by Schultz et al. indicated that the K-turn binding 15.5-kDa protein (called Snu13 in yeast) interacts with [[spliceosome]] proteins hPRP31, hPRP3, hPRP4, CYPH and the small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins [[NOL5A|NOP56]], [[NOP5/NOP58|NOP58]], and fibrillarin. The 15.5-kDa protein has sequence similarity to other RNA-binding proteins such as ribosomal proteins S12, L7a, and L30 and the snoRNP protein [[NOLA2|NHP2]]. The U4/U6 snRNP contains 15.5-kDa protein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=16782898 Protein-Protein and Protein-RNA Contacts both Contribute to the 15.5K-Mediated Assembly of the U4/U6 snRNP and the Box C/D snoRNPs] by Annemarie Schultz, Stephanie Nottrott, Nicholas James Watkins and Reinhard Lührmann in ''Molecular and Cellular Biology'' (2006) Volume 26, pages 5146–5154.&lt;/ref&gt; The 15.5-kDa protein also exists in a ribonucleoprotein complex that binds the U3 box B/C motif. The 15.5-kDa protein also exists as one of the four core proteins of the [[snoRNA|C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein]] that mediates methylation of pre-ribosomal RNAs.

Structural evidence supporting the idea that fibrillarin is the snoRNA [[methyltransferase]] has been reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=17284456 The structure and function of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins] by Steve L.

{{evolutionary biology}}
'''Fitness''' (often denoted '''&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''ω''' in [[population genetics]] models) is the [[Numerical data|quantitative]] representation of [[natural selection|natural]] and [[sexual selection]] within [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]. It can be defined either with respect to a [[genotype]] or to a [[phenotype]] in a given environment. In either case, it describes individual [[reproductive success]] and is equal to the [[expected value|average contribution]] to the [[gene pool]] of the next generation that is made by individuals of the specified genotype or phenotype. The fitness of a genotype is manifested through its phenotype, which is also affected by the developmental environment. The fitness of a given phenotype can also be different in different selective environments.

With [[asexual reproduction]], it is sufficient to assign fitnesses to genotypes. With [[sexual reproduction]], genotypes are scrambled every generation. In this case, fitness values can be assigned to [[allele]]s by averaging over possible genetic backgrounds. Natural selection tends to make [[allele]]s with higher fitness more common over time, resulting in [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution.

The term "Darwinian fitness" can be used to make clear the distinction with [[physical fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;Wassersug, J. D., and R. J. Wassersug, 1986. Fitness fallacies. Natural History 3:34-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitness does not include a measure of survival or life-span; [[Herbert Spencer]]'s  well-known phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" should be interpreted as: "Survival of the form (phenotypic or genotypic) that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations."

[[Inclusive fitness]] differs from individual fitness by including the ability of an allele in one individual to promote the survival and/or reproduction of other individuals that share that allele, in preference to individuals with a different allele. One mechanism of inclusive fitness is [[kin selection]].

==Fitness is a propensity==

Fitness is often defined as a [[propensity]] or probability, rather than the actual number of offspring. For example, according to [[Maynard Smith]], "Fitness is a property, not of an individual, but of a class of individuals — for example homozygous for allele A at a particular locus. Thus the phrase ’expected number of offspring’ means the average number, not the number produced by some one individual. If the first human infant with a gene for levitation were struck by lightning in its pram, this would not prove the new genotype to have low fitness, but only that the particular child was unlucky." &lt;ref&gt;Maynard-Smith, J. (1989) ''Evolutionary Genetics'' {{ISBN|0-19-854215-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, "the fitness of the individual - having an array x of [[phenotypes]] — is the probability, s(x), that the individual will be included among the group selected as parents of the next generation."&lt;ref&gt;Hartl, D. L. (1981) ''A Primer of Population Genetics'' {{ISBN|0-87893-271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models of fitness: asexuals ==

To avoid the complications of sex and recombination, we initially restrict our attention to an asexual population without [[genetic recombination]]. Then fitnesses can be assigned directly to genotypes rather than having to worry about individual alleles. There are two commonly used measures of fitness; absolute fitness and relative fitness.

===Absolute fitness===

The absolute fitness (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) of a genotype is defined as the proportional change in the abundance of that genotype over one generation attributable to selection. For example, if &lt;math&gt; n(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the abundance of a genotype in generation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in an infinitely large population (so that there is no [[genetic drift]]), and neglecting the change in genotype abundances due to [[mutation]]s, then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimura|first1=James F. Crow, Motoo|title=An introduction to population genetics theory|date=1970|publisher=Blackburn Press|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-1-932846-126|pages=5|edition=[Reprint]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n(t+1)=Wn(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt; 
An absolute fitness larger than 1 indicates growth in that genotype's abundance; an absolute fitness smaller than 1 indicates decline.

===Relative fitness===

Whereas absolute fitness determines changes in genotype abundance, relative fitness (&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;) determines changes in genotype [[Allele frequency|frequency]]. If &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the total population size in generation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and the relevant genotype's frequency is &lt;math&gt;p(t)=n(t)/N(t)&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(t+1)=\frac{w}{\overline{w}}p(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean relative fitness in the population (again setting aside changes in frequency due to drift and mutation). Relative fitnesses only indicate the change in prevalence of different genotypes relative to each other, and so only their values relative to each other are important; relative fitnesses can be any nonnegative number, including 0. It is often convenient to choose one genotype as a reference and set its relative fitness to 1. Relative fitness is used in the standard [[Genetic drift#Wright.E2.80.93Fisher model|Wright-Fisher]] and [[Moran process|Moran model]]s of population genetics.

Absolute fitnesses can be used to calculate relative fitness, since &lt;math&gt;p(t+1)=n(t+1)/N(t+1)=(W/\overline{W})p(t)&lt;/math&gt; (we have used the fact that &lt;math&gt;N(t+1)=\overline{W} N(t) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean absolute fitness in the population). This implies that &lt;math&gt;w/\overline{w}=W/\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt;, or in other words, relative fitness is proportional to &lt;math&gt;W/\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt;. It is not possible to calculate absolute fitnesses from relative fitnesses alone, since relative fitnesses contain no information about changes in overall population abundance &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Change in genotype frequencies due to selection ===

[[File:Selective sweep, frequency vs time.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Increase in frequency over time of genotype &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, which has a 1% greater relative fitness than the other genotype present, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The change in genotype frequencies due to selection follows immediately from the definition of relative fitness,
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = p(t+1)-p(t)=\frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p(t) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, a genotype's frequency will decline or increase depending on whether its fitness is lower or greater than the mean fitness, respectively.

In the particular case that there are only two genotypes of interest (e.g. representing the invasion of a new mutant allele), the change in genotype frequencies is often written in a different form. Suppose that two genotypes &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; have fitnesses &lt;math&gt;w_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_B&lt;/math&gt;, and frequencies &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\overline{w}=w_A p + w_B (1-p)&lt;/math&gt;, and so
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p = \frac{w_A-w_B}{\overline{w}}p(1-p) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, the change in genotype &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'s frequency depends crucially on the difference between its fitness and the fitness of genotype &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Supposing that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is more fit than &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and defining the [[selection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;w_A=(1+s)w_B&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p = \frac{s}{1+sp}p(1-p)\approx sp(1-p) &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/center&gt;
where the last approximation hold for &lt;math&gt;s\ll 1&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the fitter genotype's frequency grows approximately [[Logistic function|logistically]].

== History ==
[[Image:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Herbert Spencer]].]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sociologist]] [[Herbert Spencer]] coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]"  in his 1864 work ''Principles of Biology'' to characterise what [[Charles Darwin]] had called [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=sotf&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5140#back-mark-5140.f5 | title=Letter 5140 – Wallace, A. R. to Darwin, C. R., 2 July 1866 | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project | accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5145#mark-5145.f3 | title=Letter 5145 – Darwin, C. R. to Wallace, A. R., 5 July (1866) | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project | accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;
^ "Herbert Spencer in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864, vol. 1, p. 444, wrote: 'This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called "natural selection", or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.'" {{Citation | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=maurice_stucke | title=Better Competition Advocacy | accessdate=29 August 2007 | author=Maurice E. Stucke}}, citing HERBERT SPENCER, THE PRINCIPLES OF BIOLOGY 444 (Univ. Press of the Pac. 2002.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] was the first to quantify fitness, in terms of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] of Darwinism and [[Mendelian genetics]] starting with his 1924 paper ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection]]''. The next further advance was the introduction of the concept of [[inclusive fitness]] by the British biologist [[W.D. Hamilton]] in 1964 in his paper on ''[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]]''.

== Genetic load ==
{{main article|Genetic load}}
[[Genetic load]] measures the average fitness of a population of individuals, relative either to a theoretical genotype of optimal fitness, or relative to the most fit genotype actually present in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewens|first1=Warren J.|title=Mathematical population genetics.|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0387201917|edition=2nd|pages=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider n genotypes &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} _1 \dots \mathbf{A} _n&lt;/math&gt;, which have the fitnesses &lt;math&gt;w_1 \dots w_n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[genotype frequency|genotype frequencies]] &lt;math&gt;p_1 \dots p_n&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Ignoring [[frequency-dependent selection]], then genetic load (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) may be calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;L = {{w_\max - \bar w}\over w_\max}&lt;/math&gt;

Genetic load may increase when deleterious mutations, migration, [[inbreeding depression|inbreeding]], or [[outbreeding depression|outcrossing]] lower mean fitness. Genetic load may also increase when beneficial mutations increase the maximum fitness against which other mutations are compared; this is known as the [[Haldane's dilemma|substitutional load or cost of selection]].

The '''flexibility–usability tradeoff''' is a [[design elements and principles|design principle]] maintaining that, as the [[flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] of a system increases, its [[usability]] decreases. The tradeoff exists because accommodating flexibility requires satisfying a larger set of requirements, which results in complexity and usability compromises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinebach|first=Gerhard, and Subhrajit Guhathakurta, Hans Hagen|title=Visualizing Sustainable Planning|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=3540882022|pages=256|url=https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Sustainable-Planning-X-media-publishing-Steinebach/dp/3540882022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design theory maintains that over their lifecycle, systems shift from supporting multiple uses inefficiently, towards efficiently supporting a single use as users' needs become more defined and better understood, both by themselves and designers.

When weighting the relative importance of flexibility versus usability, designers are advised to consider how well the needs of the user are understood. If user needs are well understood, designers should bias toward simple less-flexible systems. Otherwise, designers should create flexible designs that support multiple future applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=London|isbn=1592535879|pages=102–103|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coloring ions==
[[File:Iron2GlassStonePile.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Iron(II) oxide glass]]
Ordinary [[soda-lime glass]] appears [[color]]less to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a [[green]] tint which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further [[metal]]s and metal [[oxide]]s can be added to glass during its manufacture to change its color which can enhance its aesthetic appeal. Examples of these additives are listed below:

[[File:Amber Glass Flask.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Amber Glass]]
[[File:U glass with black light.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Uranium glass]] glowing under [[UV light]]]]
[[File:bristol.blue.glass.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cobalt glass]] for decoration]]
[[File:Beer_bottles_2018_G1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beer]] [[bottle|bottles]] of different colors]]

* [[Iron(II) oxide]] may be added to glass resulting in bluish-green glass which is frequently used in beer bottles. Together with [[chromium]] it gives a richer green color, used for [[wine bottle]]s.
* [[Sulfur]], together with [[carbon]] and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. In [[borosilicate glass]]es rich in boron, sulfur imparts a blue color. With [[calcium]] it yields a deep yellow color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1st-glass.1st-things.com/articles/glasscolouring.html Substances Used in the Making of Coloured Glass] 1st-glass.1st-things.com (David M Issitt). Retrieved 9 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manganese]] can be added in small amounts to remove the [[green]] tint given by iron, or in higher concentrations to give glass an [[Amethyst (color)|amethyst]] color. Manganese is one of the oldest glass additives, and purple manganese glass was used since early Egyptian history.
* [[Manganese dioxide]], which is [[black]], is used to remove the green color from the glass; in a very slow process this is converted to [[sodium permanganate]], a dark [[purple]] compound. In [[New England]] some houses built more than 300 years ago have window glass which is lightly tinted [[Violet (color)|violet]] because of this chemical change; and such glass panes are prized as antiques. This process is widely confused with the formation of "desert amethyst glass", in which glass exposed to desert sunshine with a high ultraviolet component develops a delicate violet tint. Details of the process and the composition of the glass vary and so do the results, because it is not a simple matter to obtain or produce properly controlled specimens.&lt;ref name="Nassau2001"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kurt|last=Nassau|title=The physics and chemistry of color: the fifteen causes of color|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oasPAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-39106-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Small concentrations of [[cobalt]] (0.025 to 0.1%) yield [[blue]] glass. The best results are achieved when using glass containing [[potash]]. Very small amounts can be used for decolorizing.
* 2 to 3% of [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]] produces a [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]] color.
* [[Nickel]], depending on the concentration, produces blue, or [[violet (colour)|violet]], or even [[black]] glass. [[Lead crystal]] with added nickel acquires purplish color. Nickel together with a small amount of cobalt was used for decolorizing of [[lead glass]].
* [[Chromium]] is a very powerful colorizing agent, yielding dark green&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speclab.com/elements/chromium.htm Chemical Fact Sheet - Chromium] www.speclab.com. Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or in higher concentrations even black color. Together with tin oxide and arsenic it yields [[emerald (color)|emerald green]] glass. Chromium [[aventurine]], in which [[aventurescence]] was achieved by growth of large parallel [[chromium(III) oxide]] plates during cooling, was also made from glass with added chromium oxide in amount above its solubility limit in glass.
* [[Cadmium]] together with sulphur forms [[cadmium sulfide]] and results in deep yellow color, often used in glazes. However, cadmium is toxic. Together with selenium and sulphur it yields shades of bright red and orange.&lt;ref name="glassblow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glassblowing for Laboratory Technicians|url=http://wiredfreak.com/.Chemistry%20eBooks%20Collection/Laboratory/Glassblowing/Glassblowing%20for%20laboratory%20technicians%20-%20Barbour/Glassblowing%20for%20laboratory%20technicians%20-%20Barbour.pdf|publisher=wiredfreak.com|accessdate=9 April 2014|author=R.

* Adding [[titanium]] produces [[yellow]]ish-[[brown]] glass. Titanium, rarely used on its own, is more often employed to intensify and brighten other colorizing additives.
* [[Uranium]] (0.1 to 2%) can be added to give glass a fluorescent yellow or [[green]] color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glassassociation.org.uk/sites/default/files/WEBSITE%20Uranium%20Glass%20website%20%282%29.pdf Uranium Glass] www.glassassociation.org.uk (Barrie Skelcher). Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uranium glass]] is typically not [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] enough to be dangerous, but if ground into a powder, such as by polishing with sandpaper, and inhaled, it can be [[carcinogenic]]. When used with lead glass with very high proportion of lead, produces a deep red color.
* [[Didymium]] gives green color (used in UV filters) or lilac red.&lt;ref name="glassblow"/&gt;

==Striking glasses==
[[File:Vintage cranberry glass.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cranberry glass]] bowl]]
[[File:PhotochromicLens.jpg|thumb|[[Photochromic lens|Photochromic eyeglass lens]]. The coloring is caused by [[silver nanoparticle]]s.]]

* [[Selenium]], like manganese, can be used in small concentrations to decolorize glass, or in higher concentrations to impart a [[red]]dish color, caused by selenium nanoparticles dispersed in glass. It is a very important agent to make pink and red glass. When used together with cadmium sulfide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selenium|url=http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html|work=Illustrated Glass Dictionary|publisher=www.glassonline.com|accessdate=9 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001052915/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html|archivedate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it yields a brilliant red color known as "Selenium Ruby".
* Pure metallic [[copper]] produces a very dark red, opaque glass, which is sometimes used as a substitute for gold in the production of [[ruby]]-colored glass.
* Metallic [[gold]], in very small concentrations (around 0.001%, or 10 ppm), produces a rich ruby-colored glass ("Ruby Gold" or "Rubino Oro"), while lower concentrations produces a less intense red, often [[marketing|marketed]] as "[[Cranberry glass|cranberry]]". The color is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of [[lead glass]] with added [[tin]].
* [[Silver]] compounds such as [[silver nitrate]] and [[silver halide]]s can produce a range of colors from [[Orange (colour)|orange]]-red to yellow. The way the glass is heated and cooled can significantly affect the colors produced by these compounds. Also [[photochromic lens]]es and [[photosensitive glass]] are based on silver.

==Colored inclusions==
[[Tin oxide]] with [[antimony trioxide|antimony]] and [[arsenic trioxide|arsenic]] oxides produce an opaque [[white]] glass ([[milk glass]]), first used in [[Venice]] to produce an imitation [[porcelain]]. Similarly, some [[smoked glass]]es may be based on dark-colored inclusions, but with ionic coloring it is also possible to produce dark colors (see above).

==Color caused by scattering==
[[File:Why is the sky blue.jpg|thumb|The [[Tyndall effect]] in [[Opalescence|opalescent]] glass: it appears blue from the side, but orange light shines through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is the sky blue, and sunsets red?: Blue and Red|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/14B.html|work=Causes of Color|publisher=Institute for Dynamic Educational Advancement|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:WetPorousGlass.jpg|thumb|[[Porous glass]] pore-size gradient (large pores on the right); coloring based on the [[Tyndall effect]].]]
Glass containing two or more [[phase (matter)|phase]]s with different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] shows coloring based on the [[Tyndall effect]] and explained by the [[Mie theory]], if the dimensions of the phases are similar or larger than the [[Frequency#Physics of light|wavelength of visible light]]. The scattered light is blue and violet as seen in the image, while the transmitted light is yellow and red.

==Dichroic glass==
{{main|Dichroic glass}}
[[File:Dichroic glass pendant.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A pendant made from [[dichroic glass]]]]
Dichroic glass has one or several coatings in the nanometer-range (for example metals, metal oxides, or nitrides) which give the glass [[dichroic]] optical properties. Also the blue appearance of some automobile [[windshield]]s is caused by dichroism.

'''Gnomic poetry''' consists of meaningful sayings put into verse to aid the memory. They were known by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] as gnomes, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "an opinion". A ''gnome'' was defined by the Elizabethan critic [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]] as "a saying pertaining to the manners and common practices of men, which declareth, with an apt brevity, what in this our life ought to be done, or not done".&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Gnome and Gnomic Poetry|volume=12|pages=151-152|first=Edmund|last=Gosse|authorlink=Edmund Gosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It belongs to the broad family of [[wisdom literature]], which expresses general truths about the world. Topics range over the divine and secular, from moral aphorisms to hierarchical social relationships.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Ancient Greek gnomic literature==
The gnomic poets of Greece, who flourished in the 6th century BCE, were those who arranged series of sententious maxims in verse. These were collected in the 4th century, by [[Lobon of Argos]], an orator, but his collection has disappeared.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Hesiod's ''[[Works and Days]]'' is considered to be one of the earliest works of this genre.

The chief gnomic poets were [[Theognis]], [[Solon]], [[Phocylides]], [[Simonides of Amorgos]], [[Demodocus of Leros|Demodocus]], [[Xenophanes]] and [[Euenus]]. With the exception of Theognis, whose gnomes were fortunately preserved by some schoolmaster about 300 BCE, only fragments of the gnomic poets have come down to us.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There is at least one known woman gnomic poet, [[Kassia]]; nearly 789 of her verses survive.

The moral poem attributed to [[Phocylides]], long supposed to be a masterpiece of the school, is now known to have been written by a [[Jew]] in [[Alexandria]]. Of the gnomic movement typified by the moral works of the poets named above, [[Gilbert Murray]] has remarked that it receives its special expression in the conception of the [[Seven Wise Men]], to whom such proverbs as "[[Know thyself]]" and "[[Nothing in excess]]" were popularly attributed, and whose names differed in different lists.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

These gnomes or maxims were extended and put into literary shape by the poets. Fragments of Solon, Euenus and [[Mimnermus]] have been preserved, in a very confused state, from having been written, for purposes of comparison, on the margins of the manuscripts of Theognis, whence they have often slipped into the text of that poet. Theognis enshrines his moral precepts in his [[elegy|elegies]], and this was probably the custom of the rest; it is improbable that there ever existed a species of poetry made up entirely of successive gnomes. But the title gnomic came to be given to all poetry which dealt in a sententious way with questions of ethics. It was, unquestionably, the source from which [[moral philosophy]] was directly developed, and theorists upon life and infinity, such as [[Pythagoras]] and Xenophanes, seem to have begun their career as gnomic poets.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Gnomes, in their literary sense, belong to the dawn of literature, in their naiveté and their simplicity and moralizing. Many of the ethical reflections of the great dramatists, and in particular of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], are gnomic [[distich]]es expanded. The ancient Greek gnomes are not all solemn; some are voluptuous and some chivalrous. Those of [[Demodocus of Leros]] had the reputation of being droll.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[John Addington Symonds|J. A. Symonds]] writes that the gnomic poets mark a transition from [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] to the dramatists and moralists of [[Attica]].&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, J.A., ''Studies of the Greek Poets'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and early modern gnomic literature==
Gnomes are frequently to be found in the ancient literatures of [[Arabia]], [[Persia]] and [[India]], in [[Anglo-Saxon poetry|Anglo-Saxon/Old English poetry]] and in the [[Iceland]]ic [[Icelandic magical staves|staves]]. Comparable with the Anglo-Saxon examples are the Early Welsh gnomic poems.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kenneth, ''Early Welsh Gnomic Poems''. University of Wales Press, Cardiff. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[priamel]], a brief, sententious kind of poem, which was in favor in [[Germany]] from the 12th to the 16th centuries, belonged to the true gnomic class, and was cultivated with particular success by [[Hans Rosenblut]], the lyrical goldsmith of [[Nuremberg]], in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Gnomic literature, including ''Maxims I'' and ''Maxims II'', is a [[genre]] of [[Medieval Literature]] in England.

The gnomic spirit has occasionally been displayed by poets of a homely philosophy, such as [[Francis Quarles]] (1592–1644) in England and [[Gui de Pibrac]] (1529–1584) in France. The once-celebrated ''Quatrains'' of the latter, published in 1574, enjoyed an immense success throughout [[Europe]]; they were composed in deliberate imitation of the Greek gnomic writers of the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

With the gnomic writings of Pibrac it was long customary to bind up those of [[Antoine Faber]] (or Favre) (1557–1624) and of [[Pierre Mathieu]] (1563–1621).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The '''hyperpersonal model''' is a model of interpersonal communication that suggests [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) can become hyperpersonal because it "exceeds [face-to-face] interaction", thus affording message senders a host of communicative advantages over traditional face-to-face (FtF) interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther"&gt;Walther, J. B. (1996). Computer-mediated communication: Impersonal, [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], and hyperpersonal interaction. Communication Research, 23, 3-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to ordinary FtF situations, a hyperpersonal message sender has a greater ability to strategically develop and edit self-presentation, enabling a selective and optimized presentation of one's self to others.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

Communication professor [[Joseph Walther]] is credited with the development of this theory in 1996, after extensive research on computer-mediated communication.

== Conditions and Key Components ==

=== Conditions: ===
The hyperpersonal model specifies conditions favorable to either interpersonal or impersonal interaction. The hyperpersonal model addresses three questions: 1) when is mediated interaction impersonal; 2) when is CMC interpersonal; and 3) when is CMC hyperpersonal? Hyperpersonal communication, according to Walther, is "more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction" (p.&amp;nbsp;17).&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;   Combinations of media attributes, social phenomena, and social-psychological processes may lead CMC to become "hyperpersonal", that is, to exceed face-to-face (FtF) communication. This perspective suggests that CMC users may experience greater levels of intimacy, unity and liking within a group or [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] than similar groups or dyads interacting FtF.

=== Key Components: ===

====Senders====
This component refers to "selective self-presentation".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph B.|last2=Liang|first2=Yuhua Jake|last3=DeAndrea|first3=David C.|last4=Tong|first4=Stephanie Tom|last5=Carr|first5=Caleb T.|last6=Spottswood|first6=Erin L.|last7=Amichai-Hamburger|first7=Yair|date=2011-03-09|title=The Effect of Feedback on Identity Shift in Computer-Mediated Communication|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F15213269.2010.547832|journal=Media Psychology|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.1080/15213269.2010.547832|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In CMC, message senders have a greater opportunity to optimize their self-presentation. Walther argues, "[CMC participants] were better able to plan, and had increased opportunity to [[Self-censorship|self-censor]]. With more time for message construction and less stress of ongoing interaction, users may have taken the opportunity to [[objective self-awareness]], reflection, selection and transmission of preferable cues."&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; Message senders use the process of selective self-presentation, which refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self-censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context to a greater extent than in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent. Walther points out that asynchronous messages and reduced communication cues contribute to selective [[self-presentation]].&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; In CMC, communicators may inflate attributions about their communication partners. When communication partners are geographically dispersed, individuals are likely to make positive attributions if group salience is high. As a result, members are more likely to make attributions of similarity that lead to greater liking for partners. Paralinguistic cues are used as part of assessing communication partners when using CMC. Selective self-presentation provides an avenue for people to manage their image in a manner that FtF interaction does not.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;  Reduced communication cues and potentially asynchronous communication are both common in CMC.

''Reduced Cues'': CMC reduces cues present in normal FtF interactions. In CMC, first impressions aren't based on physical, and instead rely on information and personality. Senders impressions are more malleable than in an in-person interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

Walther cites a study by Chilcoat and DeWine (1985) in which three interpersonal perceptions were examined (attractiveness, attitude similarity, and credibility) against three asynchronous communication vehicles (FtF, videoconferencing, and audioconferencing). One would expect FtF to produce higher ratings for the interpersonal characteristics, but the opposite was true: audioconferencing partners produced higher ratings of their partners' attractiveness, attitude similarity, and credibility than in videoconference or FtF interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

====Receivers====
This component refers to "idealization".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Walther argues that receivers have an "idealized perception" of the message sender in CMC. He says that the [[social identity model of deindividuation effects]] (SIDE) predicts that subtle context cues take on a strong value in CMC. The absence of FtF cues leads to the fact that receivers may be very sensitive to any subtle social or personality cues that occur in CMC communication this way, CMC partners build impressions of one another on minimal cues. With fewer cues on which to base their perceptions, receivers have to "fill in the gaps" of their understanding of the other interactant and often assume more positive characteristics of them. In other words, without FtF cues to mediate the interaction, participants may assume their partner is a "better person" than they actually are.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

====Asynchronous channel====
Since CMC doesn't require [[Compresence|copresence]] the way FtF communication does, members can take part in activities at their own convenience, taking advantaged of disentrained communication channels. Walther cites a relaxation of time constraints in CMC, often allowing for an asynchronous mode of communication. For example, with [[group communication]], "...Making temporal commitments becomes discretionary. Group members may attend to the group process independently in time. When partners may attend their groups at their convenience, limitations on the amount of partners' mutual time available for meetings are less problematic."&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

Disentrained channels—most often [[asynchronous communication]], via email or forums—gives individuals a way to manage their relationships within groups more efficiently than via FtF. Using asynchronous communication, such as email, individuals are able to manage group relationships in a way that maximizes time spent on group tasks. Through the process of entrainment, people synchronize their activities to meet the requirements of the group's needs, which is constrained by each individuals time and attention.  Entrainment can make it difficult for groups to complete tasks together since it requires FtF, and thus synchronous, communication, which may include off-topic discussions that hinder productivity. Asynchronous communication may mitigate entrainment associated with group interaction. According to Walther, asynchronous group interaction may not be constrained by time and/or competing commitments.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; Group members using asynchronous communication can devote their full attention to the group when they have the opportunity. Greater attention can be spent focusing on tasks related to the group rather than spending time and effort on communication that is irrelevant to the goal.

According to Walther, CMC removes temporal limitations, thereby freeing time constraints. "Both task-oriented and socially oriented exchanges may take place without one constraining the time available for the other.

====Feedback processes====
Walther argues that the ''[[behavioral confirmation]]'' - "reciprocal influence that partners exert" in sender-receiver roles&amp;nbsp;— is magnified in minimal-cue interaction like CMC. In other words, in CMC communication, we behave based on the expectation of the other and the social data occurring in communication process is selectively sent and perceived by communicators.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; Feedback between sender and receiver is a critical part of the communication interaction for relationship development in either FtF or CMC relationships. However, feedback in a minimal-cue environment may be magnified. Behavioral confirmation is the process of communication partners developing impressions and intimacy as a result of interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; In CMC, behavioral confirmation along with magnification can become idealized, leading CMC partners to develop greater affinity for CMC partners than he or she might develop in a FtF context.  This kind of CMC interaction fosters the development of an intensification loop, explaining the hyperpersonal relationships that develop in a cues-limited environment.

As the last component of hyperpersonal model, it is conceptualized as reciprocal interaction with others that strengthens one’s online performance by bringing together the identity transforming potentials embedded within the other theoretical components.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Foundations of the Model ==

===FtF vs. CMC===
In [[face-to-face communication]], physical features such as appearance, facial expressions, gesture and postures is exposed to others, which can help to convey nonverbal information to help with the communication. Face-to-face communication is formed naturally in emotional, cognitive and physical aspects. Those [[Nonverbal language|nonverbal languages]] are the cues that lack in CMC communication.&lt;ref name="Walther'2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=J. B.|year=2007|title=Selective self-presentation in computer-mediated communication: Hyperpersonal dimensions of technology, language, and cognition|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=23|issue=5|pages=2538–2557|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2006.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the lack of nonverbal cues in CMC may decrease one's capability of fostering and managing accurate impression on others.&lt;ref name="Walther'2007" /&gt; Additionally, the lack of nonverbal cues leads to the fact that CMC communication involves less emotional elements than FtF communication does, which contributes to less richness and interpersonal and expressive cues that may provide more positive impression.&lt;ref name="Okdie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okdie|first=B. M.|author2=Guadagno, R. E.|author3=Bernieri, F. J.|author4=Geers, A. L.|author5=Mclarney-Vesotski, A. R.|year=2011|title=Getting to know you: Face-to-face versus online interactions|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=27|pages=153–159|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While other holds the opposite opinions. Walther suggested in his research in 1996 that CMC can actually improve the interpersonal bond between senders and receivers because of the lack of nonverbal cues and demographic messages.&lt;ref name="Okdie" /&gt; Walther argued that nonverbal and demographic cues that occur in FtF communication play a distracting role; while in CMC communication, hyperpersonal interaction is created in which senders pay more attention on the strategy of delivering message so that the [[self-presentation]] is enhanced and optimized, which eventually improve the interpersonal interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okdie" /&gt;

===Social information processing (SIP)===
Walther developed an alternate approach to the cues-filtered-out approach.&lt;ref name="Walther1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=J.B.|year=1992|title=Interpersonal effects in computer-mediated interaction: A relational perspective{{!}}journal|journal=Communication Research|volume=19|pages=52–90|doi=10.1177/009365092019001003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Social information processing (theory)|social information-processing (SIP)]] viewpoint, Walther states that people naturally want to develop social relationships.&lt;ref name="Walther1992" /&gt; With SIP, the idea of the rate at which social information is exchanged is introduced. Additionally, SIP looks at verbal strategies used in mediated communication.&lt;ref name="Walther1992" /&gt; Individuals strategically use language to convey a myriad of information about the sender, enabling the receiver to make attributes about the sender. Yet if CMC really was impersonal, why were so many people adopting CMC for social purposes, such as online gaming, bulletin boards and online chat groups? Walther advanced a different model to explain the growing trend toward the use of CMC for social interaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;  When media attributes, social phenomena and social-psychological processes are integrated, the result is what Walther called "hyperpersonal."&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

==Development of the Model==

=== Three Phases of CMC: Impersonal, Interpersonal, Hyperpersonal ===
According to Walther's research(1996), the study of CMC went through three phases: from [[Impersonal communication|impersonal]], to [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], and finally to hyperpersonal. First, because CMC shows no [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal cues]], some argued that CMC was more task-oriented than was FtF. The reasons are:
# The concentration on the content of communication will not be distracted by social or emotional influences, so that CMC can "promote rationality by providing essential discipline."&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;
# CMC is also advantageous in group decision making since it avoids the influence of pressure of peers and status.
# CMC can facilitate the efficiency of group work since it saves time when irrelevant interpersonal influence decreases.
# Group members can enjoy more "democratic" atmosphere in CMC than that in FtF communication. In addition, [[anonymity]], which can result in more freedom for members to verbalize without feeling pressure from high-status members, is one of the most important features of CMC.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;

Early CMC group research suggested that CMC groups were better for task-oriented interactions than their FtF counterparts. In task-oriented situations, where overly personal interpersonal interaction is not desired, then impersonal interaction is the appropriate kind of interaction, because the communication exchanges are more focused on the group's task. For example, a geographically dispersed technology team tasked with solving a software application bug may be more productive when the communication is task focused rather than interpersonal in nature. This doesn't mean that all CMC is impersonal, but points out that specific contexts may be better suited for impersonal interaction rather than personal exchanges.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;

Then, Walther stated that CMC is not always impersonal; instead, it can also develop social relationships. Although there is less social information exchange in CMC because of the absence of nonverbal cues, as the communication time increases, the exchange of social information is increasing accordingly. And the anticipation of future communication may make communicators to look for more information about the other. This mechanism leads to similar immediacy, similarity, composure, and receptivity as in FtF communication. However, there is a shortcoming. Since it takes time for CMC to achieve consensus, if the time for CMC is limited, the information exchanged will be much less than do FtF, which may impact the efficiency of group work.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;

Finally, Walther brought up the concept of hyperpersonal communication, which demonstrates that "CMC that is more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction."&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;  Walther proposes that CMC users do take part in hyperpersonal communication.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;  Senders and receivers engage in the process of selective-self presentation through the message they create and send. This can lead to the idealization of the sender by the receiver based on making attributions from available paralingual cues found in the message. This process is enhanced with asynchronous exchanges, letting both sender and receiver have ample time to consider the messages sent and received. Hyperpersonal interaction would be excessively or above normal personal interaction. In other words, online relationships can develop into hyperpersonal that is excessively personal. When users experience commonality and are self-aware, physically separated, and communicating via a limited-cues channel, they can selectively self-present and edit their communication, enabling them to construct and reciprocate representations of their partners and relations without the interference of environmental reality.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt; Hyperpersonal communication can thus be defined as computer-mediated interaction that is more attractive than experiences in similar FtF exchanges.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt; The hyperpersonal model can be understood by looking at the established communication processes that include sender, receiver, channel, and feedback. The sender uses the process of selective self-presentation; this refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self-censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context to a greater extent than in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent.

He made this argument in four aspects of the communication process: receivers, senders, characteristics of the channel, and feedback processes.&lt;ref name=Walther /&gt;

=== Relationship between Hyperpersonal Model and CMC ===
There are results showing that under CMC, relational intimacy increased faster than FtF.&lt;ref name="Hian"&gt;Schumaker, E. M. (2013). Exploring the hyperpersonal model: Determining the inflated nature of feedback in computer-mediated communication Available from Social Science Premium Collection. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1647746817&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of the logics behind this finding is that hyperpersonal model is determining the inflated nature of feedback in CMC.&lt;ref name="Hian" /&gt;Online communication behaviors have the possibility to exaggerate the influence on self-expression or self-presentations and following internalization. The theoretical assumption of the inflated interpersonal feedback in CMC pointed out in the hyperpersonal model by Walther&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; is advanced by this research. Hyperpersonal model can be deemed as the theoretical framework for the research on exaggerated social process in CMC mainly from the following perspectives: 1)selective presentation, 2)Impression management, 3)Impression management in CMC, 4) idealized interpretation, 5)interpersonal feedback loop, 6)Identity shift, and 7) influence of feedback on identity shift.&lt;ref name="Hian" /&gt;

==Examples and application==

=== Relational Intimacy Comparison between CMC &amp; FtF ===

* Hian, Chuan, Trevor and Detenber's 2006 study shows support for the hyperpersonal model. They found that relational intimacy increased at a faster rate in CMC than in FtF interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hian, Chuan, Trevor and Detenber|first=Lee Bee, Sim Li, Tan Mon Kiat, Benjamin H.|date=April 2004|title=Getting to Know You: Exploring the Development of Relational Intimacy in Computer-mediated Communication|url=DOI: 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00290.x|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=9(3)|pages=|via=Researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The hyperpersonal theory is also confirmed in a study of the disclosure-intimacy link in CMC vs FtF communication. Research proved that CMC "intensified the association between disclosure and intimacy relative to face-to-face interactions, and this intensification was fully mediated by increased interpersonal (relationship) attributions observed in the computer-mediated condition."&lt;ref&gt;L.

=== Online Relationships ===

==== Online Friendships ====

* In the article titled "'I've never clicked this much with anyone in my life': Trust and hyperpersonal communication in online friendships", Samantha Henderson and Michael Gilding (2004) explored the development of trust in hyperpersonal communication. They found that, in hyperpersonal communication, 1) online trust depends on the reputation of pseudonymous identities; 2) the online communication performance is essential in building up online trust; 3) hyperpersonal communication and online trust can be facilitated by [[Precommitment|pre-commitment]]; 4) situational factors in Western societies can help to promote the active trust in hyperpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henderson|first=S.|author2=Gilding, M.|year=2004|title='I've never clicked this much with anyone in my life': Trust and hyperpersonal communication in online friendships|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=6|issue=4|pages=487–506|doi=10.1177/146144804044331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Online Romantic Relationships ====

* Anderson and Emmers-Sommer used hyperpersonal theory to test their predictors of relationship satisfaction in online romantic relationships. Based on hyperpersonal theory, it's likely that users of CMC would feel more satisfaction in an online relationship since the communication is enhanced and there is a reduced number of cues on which to base the relationship.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Traci Anderson; Tara Emmers-Sommer (2006).

*Another research of "modality switching" between online and offline dating elaborates the role of hyperpersonal model takes in providing clues of self-presentation and self-disclosure in online dating. In terms of the [[self-disclosure]], in online dating which is hyperpersonal communication, there is a perceived anonymity which can accelerate the rate of self-disclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Chih-Chien|last2=Chang|first2=Ya-Ting|date=2010-04-01|title=Cyber relationship motives: Scale development and validation|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2010/00000038/00000003/art00001%3bjsessionid=1vdici4t5jpl1.x-ic-live-03|journal=Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=289–300|doi=10.2224/sbp.2010.38.3.289|issn=0301-2212}}&lt;/ref&gt;As for [[self-presentation]], online daters portray idealized versions of selves.

The results of this study showed that participants became [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] once they were on their individual profile pages. Once participants edited their Facebook profile they reported high levels of self-esteem. These findings suggest that selective self representation in digital media leads to intensified relationship formation. Thus a high involvement on [[social media]] definitely enhances self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=Amy|author2=Jeffrey Hancock|date=17 February 2011|title=Mirror, Mirror on my Facebook Wall: Effects of Exposure to Facebook on Self-Esteem|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=1-2|issue=1–2|pages=79–83|doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0411|pmid=21329447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lies on the Internet ===

*In their book "Truth, Lies &amp; Trust on the Internet" authors Monica Whilly and Adam Johnson also affirm the hyperpersonal model. They talk about the formation of hyperpersonal relationships being formed on the Internet due to extreme proximity and closeness. In this book they go one step further and talk about the issues of truth, lies and trust in these relationships. Several stories in the book talk about how the Internet's anonymity basically enables high levels of self disclosures in relationships which can in turn possibly lead to deception and flaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Truth, Lies &amp; trust on the internet|last=Whitty|first=Monica|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application in Medical Treatment ===

* Jeanine Warisse Turner, Jean A. Grube, and Jennifer Meyers discussed in their work, titled 'Developing an optimal match within online communities: An exploration of CMC support communities and traditional support', the application of hyperpersonal model in the context of cancer treatment. They found that: 1) CMC can play a significantly important role for patients to seek support, which confirmed the hyperpersonal model in the context of patients' communication; 2) the experience of face-to-face communication with a partner will enhance the relationship of hyperpersonal communication; 3) a deep face-to-face relationship may lead to an indirect way of communication since partners are concerned with offending others even though they still want to offer support, while CMC communication is more able to focus on a specific goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=J.

=== Application in Group/Community Activities ===

* The hyperpersonal model posits that in the absences of cues available in FtF encounters, distributed partners form exaggerated impressions other group members. Pena, Walther and Hancock (2007) looked at perceptions of dominance in collocated virtual groups versus distributed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pena|first=J.|author2=Walther, J.B.|author3=Hancock, J.T.|year=2007|title=Effects of geographic distribution on dominance perceptions in computer-mediated group|journal=Communication Research|volume=34|issue=3|pages=313–331|doi=10.1177/0093650207300431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicate that collocated groups perceived member dominance to be less extreme than in distributed groups. But there appeared to be no difference in the way collocated group members and distributed group member's perceived dominance. This supports the assertion that CMC environments intensify impression development, as suggested by the hyperpersonal models element of selective self-presentation.
* One study looking at perceived behaviors of assigned versus emergent leaders in CMC groups found that the "[[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]] of behavioral stereotypes through hyperpersonal CMC allows emergent leaders to develop greater recognition" (p.&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref name="Wickham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wickham|first=K.R.|author2=Walther, J.B.|year=2007|title=Perceived behaviors of emergent and assigned leaders in virtual groups|journal=International Journal of E-Collaboration|volume=35|pages=59–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The question posed by these authors was under which conditions, having an assigned group leader or an unassigned group leader, would a leader emerge in a CMC context. They speculated that leaders emerge in CMC groups, as suggested by the hyperpersonal model, through the development of online behaviors.&lt;ref name="Wickham" /&gt; Wickham and Walther found that in CMC groups, there is greater consensus among group members about the group leader when the leader emerges from the group opposed to leaders being assigned to the group.&lt;ref name="Wickham" /&gt; Within assigned leader groups, leaders were not rated as being more intelligent than other group members. In contrast, in unassigned leader groups, there was a strong associated between perceived intelligence and leader emergence.
*In another study by Anita L. Blanchard titled "Testing a sense of a model of a community" talks about group salience being higher on a virtual community, thus, reaffirming the hyperpersonal model assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Anita|date=September 2008|title=Testing a model of sense of virtual community|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=24|issue=5|pages=2107–2123|citeseerx=10.1.1.156.1496|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2007.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Anxiety ===

* Andrew C. High and Scott E.

=== Application in Traditional Communication Tools ===

* In a 2006 study on politeness of requests made via email and voicemail, Kirk Duthler determined that emails were ranked more polite because users had more time to compose their requests compared to the voicemail user. Duthler's study supports hyperpersonal theory. He said: "The filtering of nonverbal cues advantages communicators. Communicators are strategically enabled to manipulate their identity, time the transmission of their messages, and plan, organize, and edit their communication in pursuit of relational goals. Such strategic control in CMC can facilitate negotiation, relationship development, and social tasks."&lt;ref&gt;Duthler, Kirk W. (2006).

*In his thesis "Text messaging: The new venue of [[self-disclosure]]" in 2010, Steven Brunner thoroughly studied the text messaging as a relational enhancing device, from the perspectives of hyperpersonal theory, social penetration theory, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/749770382/|title=Text messaging: The new venue of self-disclosure - ProQuest|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===

* The evolution route of marketing has gone "from big and broad to small and hyeprpersonal". The interaction between customers and business processes in microlevel conversation through a hyper-personalized experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketingtechnews.net/news/2015/oct/14/situational-marketing-rise-hyper-personal-experience/|title=Situational marketing: The rise of the hyper-personal experience|last=Patel|first=Manish|date=14 October 2015|work=Marketing Tech|access-date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==

Joyce Lamerichs and Hedwig F. M. Te Molder from the department of communication science at [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] evaluate the ways in which [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) has thus far been conceptualized, proposing an alternative approach. They argue that traditional perspectives ignore participants' everyday understanding of media use and media characteristics by relying on an individualistic and cognitive framework. The social identity model of deindividuation effects model totally disregards identity construction in daily communication activities like talk, text &amp; email. In order to understand this they tried to re study online interaction and specifically studied an online forum on depression. It is shown that participants' identities do not so much mirror their inner worlds but are discourse practices in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamerchs|first=Joyce|author2=Hedwig Molder|date=December 2003|title=Computer-Mediated Communication: From a Cognitive to a Discursive Model|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=5|issue=4|pages=451–473|doi=10.1177/146144480354001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study by Sonja Utz titled "Social information processing in MUDS: The development of friendships in virtual worlds" conducted a study that actually examines friendships in the virtual world. This study revealed a high level of skepticism in participants when it came to CMC. This theory used the [[social information processing]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Utz|first=Sonia|year=2000|title=Social Information Processing in MUDs: The Development of Friendships in Virtual Worlds by Sonja Utz, Ph.D.|journal=Journal of Online Behavior|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related theory==

===SIDE model===
[[Social identity model of deindividuation effects|SIDE model]] is a recent development of [[Deindividuation|deindividuation theory]], refers to social identity/deindividuation model. It demonstrates that it is that the property of group identity increases, rather other that individual identity loses, that leading to the occurring changes of CMC users. SIDE model predicts that in CMC, the sense of self diminishes, while the sense of group increases. SIDE model is distinguished from classical deindividuation theory which put its focus on the sense of self rather than the sense of group identity.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=L. H.|author2=Paternite, C. E. |author3=Sherman, R.

===Impression management===
In the work titled 'The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life' (1959), Goffman demonstrated that in FtF communication, people use verbal and nonverbal languages to present appropriately and favorably to others since they care about the image or impression they leave for others and others' perception towards them. This phenomenon is called [[impression management]]. While in text-based CMC, the modification of impression is limited to "language, [[Typography|typographic]], and [[Chronemics|chronemic]] information."&lt;ref name="Walther'2007" /&gt;

=== Deindividuation ===
[[Deindividuation]] is a social psychology theory being generally thought as the loss of [[self-awareness]] in [[Social group|groups]], though this is a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spears|first=Russell|date=2016-07-07|title=Deindividuation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199859870.013.25|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199859870.013.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpersonal communication ===
[[Interpersonal communication]] is a process of information exchange between two or more people. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/181517359|title=The international encyclopedia of communication|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Pub|others=Donsbach, Wolfgang, 1949-|isbn=9781405131995|location=Malden, MA|oclc=181517359}}&lt;/ref&gt;This research generally contributes to six categories of inquiry: 1) how humans adapt their [[verbal communication]] and [[nonverbal communication]] during [[face-to-face communication]], 2) the message production processes. 3)  how uncertainty influences our behavior and information-management strategies, 4) [[Interpersonal deception theory|deceptive communication]], 5) [[relational dialectics]], and 6) social interaction that is [[Computer-mediated communication|mediated by technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Charles R|date=2005-09-01|title=Interpersonal communication: Theoretical perspectives, future prospects|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=55 (3)|pages=415–447|via=doi:10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02680.x.

=== Media richness theory ===
[[Media richness theory]], also sometimes referred to as information richness theory/MRT, is introduced by [[Richard L. Daft]] and Robert H. Lengel in 1986 as an extension of information processing theory. It is a framework aiming to describe a communication medium's ability in reproducing the information sent over it.

=== Nonverbal communication ===
[[Nonverbal communication]] is communication process sending and receiving information in the form of wordless cues.

=== Politeness theory ===
[[Politeness theory]] explains the redressing of affronts by face-threatening acts to a person's "[[Face (sociological concept)|face]]". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35280797|title=Anthropological linguistics : an introduction|last=A.|first=Foley, William|date=1997|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|isbn=0631151214|location=Malden, MA|oclc=35280797}}&lt;/ref&gt;This concept of face is originally generated from Chinese and then into English in the 19th century.

'''Islamic studies''' refers to the study of [[Islam]]. Islamic studies can be seen under at least two perspectives:&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pHweBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA2 The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies], 2013, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

* From a secular perspective, Islamic studies is a field of academic research whose subject is Islam as religion and civilization. 

* From a traditional Islamic perspective, Islamic studies is an [[umbrella term]] for religious sciences ('''Ulum al-din'') pursued by the [[ulama]].

==Overview==
In a [[Muslim]] context, '''Islamic studies''' is the [[umbrella term]] for the Islamic sciences ('''Ulum al-din''). It includes all the traditional forms of religious thought, such as ''[[kalam]]'' (Islamic theology) and ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), but also incorporates fields generally considered [[secular]] in the West, such as [[Islamic science]] and [[Islamic economics]].

In a non-Muslim context, Islamic studies generally refers to the [[History of Islam|historical study of Islam]]: [[Islamic civilization (disambiguation)|Islamic civilization]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, [[Islamic history]] and [[historiography]], [[Islamic law]], [[Islamic theology]] and [[Islamic philosophy]]. Academics from diverse disciplines participate and exchange ideas about Islamic societies, past and present, although Western, academic Islamic studies itself is in many respects a self-conscious and self-contained field. Specialists in the discipline apply methods adapted from several ancillary fields, ranging from [[Biblical studies]] and [[classical philology]] to [[modern history]], [[legal history]] and [[sociology]]. A recent trend, particularly since [[9/11]], has been the study of contemporary [[Islamist]] groups and movements by academics from the [[social sciences]] or in many cases by journalists, although since such works tend to be written by non-[[Arabists]] they belong outside the field of Islamic studies proper.

Scholars in the field of academic Islamic studies are often referred to as "Islamicists" and the discipline traditionally made up the bulk of what used to be called [[Oriental studies]].  In fact, some of the more traditional Western universities still confer degrees in Arabic and Islamic studies under the primary title of "Oriental studies".  This is the case, for example, at the [[University of Oxford]], where Classical Arabic and Islamic studies have been taught since as early as the 16th century, originally as a sub-division of [[Divinity]]. This latter context gave early academic Islamic studies its Biblical studies character and was also a consequence of the fact that throughout early-Modern Western Europe the discipline was developed by churchmen whose primary aim had actually been to refute the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Irwin, 'For Lust of Knowing: the Orientalists and their Enemies'.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their now generally secular, academic approach, many non-Muslim Islamic studies scholars have written works which are widely read by Muslims, while in recent decades an increasing number of Muslim-born scholars have trained and taught as academic Islamicists in Western universities. Many leading universities in Europe and the US offer [[academic degrees]] at both undergraduate and postgraduate level in Islamic studies, in which students can also study Arabic and therefore begin to read Islamic texts in the original language. Because Arabic and Islamic studies are generally seen as inseparable in academia, named undergraduate degrees that combine the two are usually still categorized as single-subject degrees rather than as 'joint' or 'combined' degrees like, for example, those in Arabic and Politics. This rationale explains why, because of their heavy emphasis on the detailed study of Islamic texts in [[Classical Arabic]], some institutions{{spaced ndash}}such as the School of Oriental and African Studies ([[SOAS]]) in London and [[Georgetown University]] in Washington DC{{spaced ndash}}only accept graduates who already have degree-level Arabic and a strong background in the academic study of Islam onto their Masters programmes in Islamic studies. Such institutions will generally direct students new to the field and with little or no Arabic to broader master's degrees in [[Middle Eastern studies]] or [[Middle East politics]], in which Arabic can be studied ''[[ab initio]]''.

A recent HEFCE report emphasises the increasing, strategic importance for Western governments since [[9/11]] of Islamic studies in [[higher education]] and also provides an international overview of the state of the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/indirreports/2008/re0708/rd07_08.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Islamic studies is often argued by Muslims, to begin with, the founding of the Islamic religion by [[Abraham]], continue throughout the history of Judaism with Islamic Prophets such as David and Solomon, then early Christianity with Jesus in particular, and then up to modern times with the final revelation of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|163|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to understand [[Islam]] as a topic of modern scholarship (as opposed to a Christological heresy) was within the context of 19th-century Christian European [[Oriental studies]].

In the years 1821 to 1850, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in England, the [[Société Asiatique]] in France, the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft]] in Germany, and the [[American Oriental Society]] in the United States were founded.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World: [http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0395 ''Islamic Studies''] - History of the field, Methodology&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd half of the 19th century, philological and historical approaches were predominant. Leading in the field were German researchers like [[Theodore Nöldeke]] 's study on the history of the Quran, or [[Ignaz Goldziher]] 's work on the prophetic tradition.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Western orientalists and Muslim scholars alike preferred to interpret the history of Islam in a conservative way. They did not question the traditional account of the early time of Islam, of Muhammad and how the Quran was written.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the 1970s, the [[Revisionist School of Islamic Studies]] questioned the uncritical adherence to traditional Islamic sources and started to develop a new picture of the earliest times of Islam by applying the [[historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

===History of Islam===
{{main|History of Islam}}
To understand the history of Islam provides the indispensable basis to understand all aspects of Islam and its culture. Themes of special interest are:
* [[Historiography of early Islam]]
* [[History of the Quran]]
* [[Historicity of Muhammad]]
* [[Early Muslim conquests]]

===Theology===
{{Main|Islamic theology|Kalam}}
''Kalam'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|علم الكلام}}}}) is one of the "religious sciences" of Islam. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word means "discussion" and refers to the Islamic tradition of seeking theological principles through [[dialectic]]. A scholar of ''kalam'' is referred to as a ''mutakallim''.

* [[Islamic eschatology]]

===Mysticism===
{{main|Sufism}}

Sufism ({{lang|ar|{{big|تصوف}}}} ''taṣawwuf'') is a [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[tradition]] of Islam based on the pursuit of spiritual truth as it is gradually revealed to the heart and mind of the Sufi (one who practices Sufism).

It might also be referred to as Islamic mysticism. While other branches of Islam generally focus on [[exoteric]] aspects of religion, Sufism is mainly focused on the direct perception of [[truth]] or [[God]] through mystic practices based on divine love. Sufism embodies a number of [[culture]]s, philosophies, central teachings and bodies of [[esoteric knowledge]].

===Law===
{{main|Sharia|Fiqh}}
Islamic jurisprudence relates to everyday and social issues in the life of Muslims. It is divided in fields like:
* the study of [[sharia]] law
* [[Islamic economics]]
* [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]] studies  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/11796624/Knowledge_of_Shariah_and_Knowledge_to_Manage_Self_and_System_Integration_of_Islamic_Epistemology_with_the_Knowledge_and_Education|title=Knowledge of Shariah and Knowledge to Manage ‘Self’ and ‘System’: Integration of Islamic Epistemology with the Knowledge and Education|first=Tareq M|last=Zayed|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key distinctions include those between ''[[fiqh]]'', ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[ijtihad]]''.

===Philosophy===
{{main|Islamic philosophy}}
Islamic philosophy is a part of Islamic studies. It is a longstanding attempt to create harmony between [[faith]], reason or [[philosophy]], and the religious teachings of [[Islam]]. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a [[List of Muslim philosophers|Muslim philosopher]].

It is divided in fields like:
* [[Early Islamic philosophy]]
** [[Avicennism]]
** [[Averroism]]
* [[Islamic philosophy]]
* [[Modern Islamic philosophy]]
** [[Sufi philosophy]]
** [[Transcendent theosophy]]
* [[List of Muslim philosophers]]
* [[Illuminationist philosophy]]
* [[Islamic ethics]]
* [[Sufi metaphysics]]

===Sciences===
{{main|Islam and science|Science in medieval Islam}}
[[Islam and science]] is [[science]] in the context of traditional religious ideas of [[Islam]], including its [[ethics]] and prohibitions. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a [[Muslim scientist]]

This is not the same as science as conducted by any [[Muslim]] in a secular context. Certain [[liberal movements in Islam]] eschew the practice of Islamic science, arguing that science should be considered separate from religion as it is today in the West. As in [[Catholicism]] however, believers argue that the guiding role of religion in forming ethics of science cannot be ignored and must impose absolute constraints on inquiry.
* [[Qur'an and science]]
* [[Islamic creationism]]

[[Science in medieval Islam]] examines the full range of scientific investigation in the [[Muslim world]], whether performed within a religious or secular context. Significant progress in science was made in the Muslim world during the [[Middle Ages]], especially during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], which is considered a major period in the [[history of science]].
* [[Timeline of Islamic science and engineering]]
* [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam]]
* [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]]
** [[Islamic astrology]]
* [[Inventions in medieval Islam]]
* [[Mathematics in medieval Islam]]
* [[Medicine in medieval Islam]]
** [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam]]
* [[Physics in medieval Islam]]
* [[Psychology in medieval Islam]]

===Literature===
{{main|Islamic literature}}
* [[Arabic literature]]
** [[Arabic epic literature]]
* [[Islamic poetry]]
** [[Arabic poetry]]
* [[Persian literature]]

This field includes the study of [[Arabic Language|modern]] and [[classical Arabic]] and the literature written in those languages. It also often includes other modern, classic or ancient languages of the [[Middle East]] and other areas that are or have been part of, or influenced by, Islamic culture, such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Azeri|Azerbaijanian]] and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]].

===Architecture===
{{main|Islamic architecture}}
Islamic architecture is the entire range of architecture that has evolved within [[Muslim culture]] in the course of the [[history of Islam]]. Hence the term encompasses religious buildings as well as secular ones, historic as well as modern expressions and the production of all places that have come under the varying levels of Islamic influence.

It is very common to mistake [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] for Islamic architecture.

===Art===
{{main|Islamic art}}
* [[Islamic calligraphy]]
* [[Islamic pottery]]
* [[Muslim music]]

[[Islam]]ic visual [[art]] has, throughout history, been mainly abstract and decorative, portraying geometric, floral, [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], and [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] designs. Unlike the strong tradition of portraying the human figure in [[Christian art]], Islamic art is typically distinguished as not including depictions of human beings. The lack of [[portrait]]ure is due to the fact that early Islam forbade the painting of human beings, especially [[Muhammad|the Prophet]], as Muslims believe this tempts followers of the Prophet to [[idolatry]]. This prohibition against human beings or icons is called [[aniconism]]. Despite such a prohibition, depictions of human beings do occur Islamic art, such as that of the [[Mughals]], demonstrating a strong diversity in popular interpretation over the pre-modern period. Increased contact with the [[western world|Western civilization]] may also have contributed to human depictions in Islamic art in modern times.

===Comparative religion===
{{main|Islam and other religions}}
Islamic [[comparative religion]] is the study of religions in the view of Islam. This study may be undertaken from a conservative [[Muslim]] perspective, which often sees [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] as having been originally similar to Islam, and later developing away from the root monotheist religion. However, some [[liberal movements within Islam]] dispute the conservative view as being ahistorical; they claim that Islam is the end-result rather than the origin point of monotheist thought.

* [[Islam and Christianity]]
* [[Islam and Jainism]]
* [[Islam and Judaism]]
** [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)]]

===Economics===
{{main|Islamic economic jurisprudence}}
Islamic economics is [[economics]] in accordance with [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Because the [[Qur'an]] spoke against [[usury]] in the context of early Muslim society, it generally entails trying to remove or redefine [[interest rates]] from financial institutions. In doing so, Islamic economists hope to produce a more "Islamic society". However, [[liberal movements within Islam]] may deny the need for this field, since they generally see Islam as compatible with modern secular institutions and law.

* [[Islamic banking]]
* [[Islamic economics in the world]]

===Psychology===
{{main|Islamic psychology}}
* [[Psychology in medieval Islam]]
* [[Sufi psychology]]
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Islam and Modernity===
An interesting field of study is how Islam reacts on the contact with Western modernity, and how Islam can catch up with modernity without betraying itself. These studies comprise Islamic history, Islamic theology, Islamic Mysticism, and Islamic philosophy, as well as the study of Western philosophy, sociology and politology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77312">'''Lambda calculus''' (also written as '''λ-calculus''') is a [[formal system]] in [[mathematical logic]] for expressing [[computability|computation]] based on function [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] and [[function application|application]] using variable [[Name binding|binding]] and [[Substitution (algebra)|substitution]]. It is a universal [[model of computation]] that can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]]. It was first introduced by mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] in the 1930s as part of his research of the [[foundations of mathematics]].

Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them. In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Syntax !! Name !! Description
|-
| x || Variable || A character or string representing a parameter or mathematical/logical value
|-
| (λx.M) || Abstraction || Function definition (M is a lambda term). The variable x becomes [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] in the expression.
|-
| (M N) || Application || Applying a function to an argument. M and N are lambda terms.
|}

producing expressions such as: (λ''x''.λ''y''.(λ''z''.(λ''x''.''z x'') (λ''y.z y'')) (''x y'')). Parentheses can be dropped if the expression is unambiguous. For some applications, terms for logical and mathematical constants and operations may be included.

The reduction operations include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Operation !! Name !! Description
|-
| (λx.M[x]) → (λy.M[y]) || α-conversion || Renaming the bound (formal) variables in the expression. Used to avoid [[name collision]]s.
|-
| ((λx.M) E) → (M[x:=E]) || β-reduction || Replacing the bound variable with the argument expression in the body of the abstraction
|}

If [[De Bruijn index]]ing is used then α-conversion is no longer required as there will be no name collisions. If [[Reduction strategy (lambda calculus)|repeated application]] of the reduction steps eventually terminates then by the [[Church-Rosser theorem]] it will produce a [[beta normal form]].

==Explanation and applications==
Lambda calculus is [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]], that is, it is a universal [[model of computation]] that can be used to simulate any [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. M. |last=Turing |authorlink=Alan Turing |title=Computability and λ-Definability |jstor=2268280 |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=December 1937 |pages=153–163 |doi=10.2307/2268280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its namesake, the Greek letter lambda (λ), is used in '''lambda expressions''' and '''lambda terms''' to denote [[Free variables and bound variables|binding]] a variable in a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

Lambda calculus may be ''untyped'' or ''typed''. In typed lambda calculus, functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given input's "type" of data. Typed lambda calculi are ''weaker'' than the untyped lambda calculus that is the primary subject of this article, in the sense that ''typed lambda calculi can express less'' than the untyped calculus can, but on the other hand typed lambda calculi allow more things to be proved; in the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] it is, for example, a theorem that every evaluation strategy terminates for every simply typed lambda-term, whereas evaluation of untyped lambda-terms need not terminate. One reason there are many different typed lambda calculi has been the desire to do more (of what the untyped calculus can do) without giving up on being able to prove strong theorems about the calculus.

Lambda calculus has applications in many different areas in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Coquand|Coquand, Thierry]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/type-theory/ "Type Theory"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''  (Summer 2013 Edition), Edward N.

[[Functional programming language]]s implement the lambda calculus.

==History==
The lambda calculus was introduced by mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Church |authorlink=Alonzo Church |title=A set of postulates for the foundation of logic |journal=Annals of Mathematics |series=Series 2 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=346–366 |year=1932 |doi=10.2307/1968337 |jstor=1968337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full history, see Cardone and Hindley's "History of Lambda-calculus and Combinatory Logic" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The original system was shown to be [[Consistency|logically inconsistent]] in 1935 when [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]] developed the [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleene|first1=S. C.|authorlink1=Stephen Kleene|last2=Rosser|first2=J. B.|authorlink2=J. B. Rosser|title=The Inconsistency of Certain Formal Logics|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|date=July 1935|volume=36|issue=3|pages=630|doi=10.2307/1968646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Church|first=Alonzo|authorlink=Alonzo Church|title=Review of Haskell B.

Subsequently, in 1936 Church isolated and published just the portion relevant to computation, what is now called the untyped lambda calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Church |authorlink=Alonzo Church |title=An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |volume=58 |number=2 |year=1936 |pages=345–363 |doi=10.2307/2371045 |jstor=2371045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he also introduced a computationally weaker, but logically consistent system, known as the [[simply typed lambda calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Church | authorlink=Alonzo Church | first1 = A. | year = 1940 | title = A Formulation of the Simple Theory of Types | journal = Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–68 | doi=10.2307/2266170 |jstor=2266170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1960s when its relation to programming languages was clarified, the λ-calculus was only a formalism. Thanks to [[Richard Montague]] and other linguists' applications in the semantics of natural language, the λ-calculus has begun to enjoy a respectable place in both linguistics&lt;ref name='mm-linguistics'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Partee|first1=B.

Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal description==
{{no footnotes|section|date=September 2013}}

===Motivation===
[[Computable function]]s are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The λ-calculus provides a simple [[Semantics#Computer science|semantics]] for computation, enabling properties of computation to be studied formally. The λ-calculus incorporates two simplifications that make this semantics simple.
The first simplification is that the λ-calculus treats functions "anonymously", without giving them explicit names. For example, the function 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{square\_sum}(x, y) = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;
can be rewritten in ''anonymous form'' as 
:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;
(read as "a tuple of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is [[Map (mathematics)|mapped]] to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;"). Similarly, 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;
can be rewritten in anonymous form as
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt;
where the input is simply mapped to itself.

The second simplification is that the λ-calculus only uses functions of a single input. An ordinary function that requires two inputs, for instance the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{square\_sum}&lt;/math&gt; function, can be reworked into an equivalent function that accepts a single input, and as output returns ''another'' function, that in turn accepts a single input. For example, 
:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;
can be reworked into 
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto (y \mapsto x^2 + y^2)&lt;/math&gt;
This method, known as [[currying]], transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.

[[Function application]] of the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{square\_sum}&lt;/math&gt; function to the arguments (5, 2), yields at once
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;((x, y) \mapsto x^2 + y^2)(5, 2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = 5^2 + 2^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = 29&lt;/math&gt;,
whereas evaluation of the curried version requires one more step
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Bigl(\bigl(x \mapsto (y \mapsto x^2 + y^2)\bigr)(5)\Bigr)(2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = (y \mapsto 5^2 + y^2)(2)&lt;/math&gt; // the definition of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has been used with &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; in the inner expression.  This is like β-reduction.
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = 5^2 + 2^2&lt;/math&gt;  // the definition of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; has been used with &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. Again, similar to β-reduction.
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; = 29&lt;/math&gt;
to arrive at the same result.

===The lambda calculus===
The lambda calculus consists of a language of '''lambda terms''', which is defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules, which allow manipulation of the lambda terms. These transformation rules can be viewed as an equational theory or as an [[operational definition]].

As described above, all functions in the lambda calculus are anonymous functions, having no names. They only accept one input variable, with currying used to implement functions with several variables.

====Lambda terms====

The syntax of the lambda calculus defines some expressions as valid lambda calculus expressions and some as invalid, just as some strings of characters are valid [[C (programming language)|C]] programs and some are not. A valid lambda calculus expression is called a "lambda term".

The following three rules give an [[inductive definition]] that can be applied to build all syntactically valid lambda terms:
* a variable, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, is itself a valid lambda term
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a lambda term, and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a variable, then &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.t)&lt;/math&gt; is a lambda term (called a '''lambda abstraction''');
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are lambda terms, then &lt;math&gt;(ts)&lt;/math&gt; is a lambda term (called an '''application''').
Nothing else is a lambda term. Thus a lambda term is valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules. However, some parentheses can be omitted according to certain rules. For example, the outermost parentheses are usually not written. See ''[[#Notation|Notation]]'', below.

A '''lambda abstraction''' &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.t&lt;/math&gt; is a definition of an anonymous function that is capable of taking a single input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and substituting it into the expression &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. 
It thus defines an anonymous function that takes &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and returns &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x^2+2&lt;/math&gt; is a lambda abstraction for the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2 + 2&lt;/math&gt; using the term &lt;math&gt;x^2+2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The definition of a function with a lambda abstraction merely "sets up" the function but does not invoke it.  The abstraction [[Free variables and bound variables|binds]] the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

An '''application''' &lt;math&gt;ts&lt;/math&gt; represents the application of a function &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to an input &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, that is, it represents the act of calling function &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; on input &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to produce &lt;math&gt;t(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

There is no concept in lambda calculus of variable declaration. In a definition such as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x+y&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + y&lt;/math&gt;), the lambda calculus treats &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a variable that is not yet defined. The lambda abstraction &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x+y&lt;/math&gt; is syntactically valid, and represents a function that adds its input to the yet-unknown &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

Bracketing may be used and may be needed to disambiguate terms. For example, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.((\lambda x.x)x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(\lambda x.x)) x&lt;/math&gt; denote different terms (although they coincidentally reduce to the same value). Here the first example defines a function that defines a function and returns the result of applying x to the child-function (apply function then return), while the second example defines a function that returns a function for any input and then returns it on application of x (return function then apply).

==== Functions that operate on functions ====

In lambda calculus, functions are taken to be '[[First-class object|first class values]]', so functions may be used as the inputs, or be returned as outputs from other functions.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt; represents the identity function, &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.x)y&lt;/math&gt; represents the identity function applied to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Further, &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.y)&lt;/math&gt; represents the '''constant function''' &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto y&lt;/math&gt;, the function that always returns &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, no matter the input. In lambda calculus, function application is regarded as [[Operator associativity|left-associative]], so that &lt;math&gt;stx&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;(st)x&lt;/math&gt;.

There are several notions of "equivalence" and "reduction" that allow lambda terms to be "reduced" to "equivalent" lambda terms.

====Alpha equivalence====
A basic form of equivalence, definable on lambda terms, is alpha equivalence. It captures the intuition that the particular choice of a bound variable, in a lambda abstraction, does not (usually) matter.
For instance, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda y.y&lt;/math&gt; are alpha-equivalent lambda terms, and they both represent the same function (the identity function). 
The terms &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are not alpha-equivalent, because they are not bound in a lambda abstraction.
In many presentations, it is usual to identify alpha-equivalent lambda terms.

The following definitions are necessary in order to be able to define beta reduction:

====Free variables====
The '''free variables''' of a term are those variables not bound by a lambda abstraction. The set of free variables of an expression is defined inductively:
* The free variables of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are just &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
* The set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.t&lt;/math&gt; is the set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, but with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; removed
* The set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;ts&lt;/math&gt; is the union of the set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and the set of free variables of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the lambda term representing the identity &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt; has no free variables, but the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda x. yx&lt;/math&gt; has a single free variable, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

====Capture-avoiding substitutions====

Suppose &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are lambda terms and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are variables.
The notation &lt;math&gt;t[x := r]&lt;/math&gt; indicates substitution of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in a ''capture-avoiding'' manner. This is defined so that:
* &lt;math&gt;x[x := r] = r&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;y[x := r] = y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \neq y&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;(ts)[x := r] = (t[x := r])(s[x := r])&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.t)[x := r] = \lambda x.t&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;(\lambda y.t)[x := r] = \lambda y.(t[x := r])&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \neq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not in the free variables of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is said to be "fresh" for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.x)[y := y] = \lambda x.(x[y := y]) = \lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;((\lambda x.y)x)[x := y] = ((\lambda x.y)[x := y])(x[x := y]) = (\lambda x.y)y&lt;/math&gt;.

The freshness condition (requiring that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not in the free variables of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) is crucial in order to ensure that substitution does not change the meaning of functions.
For example, a substitution is made that ignores the freshness condition: &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.y)[y := x] = \lambda x.(y[y := x]) = \lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt;. This substitution turns the constant function &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.y&lt;/math&gt; into the identity &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt; by substitution.

In general, failure to meet the freshness condition can be remedied by alpha-renaming with a suitable fresh variable.
For example, switching back to our correct notion of substitution, in &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.y)[y := x]&lt;/math&gt; the lambda abstraction can be renamed with a fresh variable &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, to obtain &lt;math&gt;(\lambda z.y)[y := x] = \lambda z.(y[y := x]) = \lambda z.x&lt;/math&gt;, and the meaning of the function is preserved by substitution.

====Beta reduction====
The beta reduction rule states that an application of the form &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . t) s&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the term &lt;math&gt; t [ x := s]&lt;/math&gt;. The notation &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . t ) s \to t [ x := s ] &lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate that &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x .t ) s &lt;/math&gt; beta reduces to &lt;math&gt; t [ x := s ] &lt;/math&gt;.
For example, for every &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . x ) s \to x[ x := s ] = s &lt;/math&gt;. This demonstrates that &lt;math&gt; \lambda x . x &lt;/math&gt; really is the identity.
Similarly, &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . y ) s \to y [ x := s ] = y &lt;/math&gt;, which demonstrates that &lt;math&gt; \lambda x . y &lt;/math&gt; is a constant function.

The lambda calculus may be seen as an idealised version of a functional programming language, like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] or [[Standard ML]].
Under this view, beta reduction corresponds to a computational step. This step can be repeated by additional beta conversions until there are no more applications left to reduce. In the untyped lambda calculus, as presented here, this reduction process may not terminate.
For instance, consider the term &lt;math&gt;\Omega = (\lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx )&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;( \lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx) \to ( xx )[ x := \lambda x . xx ] = ( x [ x := \lambda x . xx ] )( x [ x := \lambda x . xx ] ) = ( \lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx )&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, the term reduces to itself in a single beta reduction, and therefore the reduction process will never terminate.

Another aspect of the untyped lambda calculus is that it does not distinguish between different kinds of data.
For instance, it may be desirable to write a function that only operates on numbers. However, in the untyped lambda calculus, there is no way to prevent a function from being applied to [[truth value]]s, strings, or other non-number objects.

==Formal definition==
{{main|Lambda calculus definition}}

===Definition===
Lambda expressions are composed of:
* variables v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, ...
* the abstraction symbols lambda 'λ' and dot '.'
* parentheses ( )
The set of lambda expressions, Λ, can be [[Recursive definition|defined inductively]]:
#If x is a variable, then x ∈ Λ
#If x is a variable and M ∈ Λ, then (λx.M) ∈ Λ
#If M, N ∈ Λ, then (M N) ∈ Λ
Instances of rule 2 are known as abstractions and instances of rule 3 are known as applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Notation===
To keep the notation of lambda expressions uncluttered, the following conventions are usually applied:
* Outermost parentheses are dropped: M N instead of (M N)
* Applications are assumed to be left associative: M N P may be written instead of ((M N) P)&lt;ref name="lambda-bound"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambda-bound.com/book/lambdacalc/node27.html |title=Example for Rules of Associativity |publisher=Lambda-bound.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The body of an abstraction extends [[Regular expression#Lazy matching|as far right as possible]]: λx.M N means λx.(M N) and not (λx.M) N
* A sequence of abstractions is contracted: λx.λy.λz.N is abbreviated as λxyz.N&lt;ref name="Selinger"&gt;

===Free and bound variables===
The abstraction operator, λ, is said to bind its variable wherever it occurs in the body of the abstraction. Variables that fall within the scope of an abstraction are said to be ''bound''. All other variables are called ''free''. For example, in the expression &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.''x'' ''x'' ''y''&lt;/tt&gt;, y is a bound variable and x is free. Also note that a variable is bound by its "nearest" abstraction. In the following example the single occurrence of x in the expression is bound by the second lambda: &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.''y''  (λ''x''.''z'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;

The set of ''free variables'' of a lambda expression, M, is denoted as FV(M) and is defined by recursion on the structure of the terms, as follows:
# FV(x) = {x}, where x is a variable
# FV(λx.M) = FV(M) \ {x}
# FV(M N) = FV(M) ∪ FV(N)&lt;ref name="BarendregtBarendsen"&gt;{{Citation

An expression that contains no free variables is said to be ''closed''. Closed lambda expressions are also known as combinators and are equivalent to terms in [[combinatory logic]].

==Reduction==
The meaning of lambda expressions is defined by how expressions can be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Ruy de Queiroz |last=de Queiroz |first=Ruy J. G. B. |doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1988.tb00919.x |title=A Proof-Theoretic Account of Programming and the Role of Reduction Rules |journal=Dialectica |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=265–282 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three kinds of reduction:
* '''α-conversion''': changing bound variables ('''alpha''');
* '''β-reduction''': applying functions to their arguments ('''beta''');
* '''η-conversion''': which captures a notion of extensionality ('''eta''').
We also speak of the resulting equivalences: two expressions are ''β-equivalent'', if they can be β-converted into the same expression, and α/η-equivalence are defined similarly.

The term ''redex'', short for ''reducible expression'', refers to subterms that can be reduced by one of the reduction rules. For example, &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.M) N&lt;/tt&gt; is a beta-redex in expressing the substitution of N for x in M. The expression to which a redex reduces is called its reduct; the reduct of &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.M) N&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;M[''x'':=N]&lt;/tt&gt;.

If &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; is not free in &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.M ''x''&lt;/tt&gt; is also an eta-redex, with a reduct of &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt;.

===α-conversion===
Alpha-conversion, sometimes known as alpha-renaming,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Design concepts in programming languages |last1=Turbak |first1=Franklyn |last2=Gifford |first2=David |year=2008 |publisher=MIT press |page=251| isbn=978-0-262-20175-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows bound variable names to be changed. For example, alpha-conversion of &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt; might yield &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;. Terms that differ only by alpha-conversion are called ''α-equivalent''. Frequently, in uses of lambda calculus, α-equivalent terms are considered to be equivalent.

The precise rules for alpha-conversion are not completely trivial. First, when alpha-converting an abstraction, the only variable occurrences that are renamed are those that are bound to the same abstraction. For example, an alpha-conversion of &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt; could result in &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, but it could ''not'' result in &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.λ''x''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;. The latter has a different meaning from the original. This is analogous to the programming notion of [[variable shadowing]].

Second, alpha-conversion is not possible if it would result in a variable getting captured by a different abstraction. For example, if we replace &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;''y''&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.λ''y''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, we get &lt;tt&gt;λ''y''.λ''y''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;, which is not at all the same.

In programming languages with static scope, alpha-conversion can be used to make [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] simpler by ensuring that no variable name [[Variable shadowing|masks]] a name in a containing [[scope (programming)|scope]] (see [[Name resolution (programming languages)#Alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial|alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial]]).

In the [[De Bruijn index]] notation, any two alpha-equivalent terms are syntactically identical.

====Substitution====
Substitution, written {{mono|1=''E''[''V'' := ''R'']}}, is the process of replacing all free occurrences of the variable {{mono|''V''}} in the expression {{mono|''E''}} with expression {{mono|''R''}}.
Substitution on terms of the λ-calculus is defined by recursion on the structure of terms, as follows (note: x and y are only variables while M and N are any λ expression).
 ''x''[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; N
 ''y''[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; ''y'', if ''x'' ≠ ''y''
 (M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; (M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''x'' := N]) (M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[''x'' := N])
 (λ''x''.M)[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; λ''x''.M
 (λ''y''.M)[''x'' := N]&amp;#09;&amp;equiv; λ''y''.(M[''x'' := N]), if ''x'' ≠ ''y'', ''provided'' ''y'' ∉ FV(N)

To substitute into a lambda abstraction, it is sometimes necessary to α-convert the expression. For example, it is not correct for {{mono|1=(λ''x''.''y'')[''y'' := ''x'']}} to result in {{mono|(λ''x''.''x'')}}, because the substituted {{mono|''x''}} was supposed to be free but ended up being bound. The correct substitution in this case is {{mono|(λ''z''.''x'')}}, up to α-equivalence. Notice that substitution is defined uniquely up to α-equivalence.

===&amp;beta;-reduction===
Beta-reduction captures the idea of function application. Beta-reduction is defined in terms of substitution: the beta-reduction of &lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;((λ''V''.''E'') ''E&amp;prime;'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;''E''[''V'' := ''E&amp;prime;'']&lt;/tt&gt;.

For example, assuming some encoding of &lt;tt&gt;2, 7, &amp;times;&lt;/tt&gt;, we have the following β-reduction: &lt;tt&gt;((λ''n''.''n''&amp;times;2) 7) &lt;/tt&gt;→&lt;tt&gt; 7&amp;times;2&lt;/tt&gt;.

===&amp;eta;-conversion===
Eta-conversion expresses the idea of [[extensionality]], which in this context is that two functions are the same [[if and only if]] they give the same result for all arguments. Eta-conversion converts between &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.(''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; whenever &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; does not appear free in &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Normal forms and confluence ==
{{Main|Normalization property (abstract rewriting)}}
For the untyped lambda calculus, β-reduction as a [[rewrite system|rewriting rule]] is neither [[strongly normalising]] nor [[weakly normalising]].

However, it can be shown that β-reduction is [[confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]]. (Of course, we are working up to α-conversion, i.e. we consider two normal forms to be equal, if it is possible to α-convert one into the other.)

Therefore, both strongly normalising terms and weakly normalising terms have a unique normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.

==Encoding datatypes==
{{Main|Church encoding|Mogensen–Scott encoding}}

The basic lambda calculus may be used to model booleans, [[arithmetic]], data structures and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections.

===Arithmetic in lambda calculus===
There are several possible ways to define the [[natural number]]s in lambda calculus, but by far the most common are the [[Church numeral]]s, which can be defined as follows:
: &lt;tt&gt;0 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;1 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' ''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;2 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;3 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;
and so on. Or using the alternative syntax presented above in ''[[#Notation|Notation]]'':

: &lt;tt&gt;0 := λ''fx''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;1 := λ''fx''.''f'' ''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;2 := λ''fx''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;3 := λ''fx''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;

A Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]]—it takes a single-argument function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, and returns another single-argument function. The Church numeral &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; is a function that takes a function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; as argument and returns the &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt;-th composition of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, i.e. the function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; composed with itself &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; times. This is denoted &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and is in fact the &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt;-th power of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; (considered as an operator); &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is defined to be the identity function. Such repeated compositions (of a single function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;) obey the [[laws of exponents]], which is why these numerals can be used for arithmetic. (In Church's original lambda calculus, the formal parameter of a lambda expression was required to occur at least once in the function body, which made the above definition of &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; impossible.)

One way of thinking about the Church numeral &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt;, which is often useful when analysing programs, is as an instruction 'repeat ''n'' times'. For example, using the &lt;tt&gt;PAIR&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;NIL&lt;/tt&gt; functions defined below, one can define a function that constructs a (linked) list of ''n'' elements all equal to ''x'' by repeating 'prepend another ''x'' element' ''n'' times, starting from an empty list. The lambda term is
: &lt;tt&gt;λ''n''.λ''x''.''n'' (PAIR ''x'') NIL&lt;/tt&gt;
By varying what is being repeated, and varying what argument that function being repeated is applied to, a great many different effects can be achieved.

We can define a successor function, which takes a Church numeral &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; and returns &lt;tt&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/tt&gt; by adding another application of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, where '(mf)x' means the function 'f' is applied 'm' times on 'x':
: &lt;tt&gt;SUCC := λ''n''.λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' (''n'' ''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;
Because the &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt;-th composition of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; composed with the &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt;-th composition of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; gives the &lt;tt&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/tt&gt;-th composition of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, addition can be defined as follows:
: &lt;tt&gt;PLUS := λ''m''.λ''n''.λ''f''.λ''x''.''m'' ''f'' (''n'' ''f'' ''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;PLUS&lt;/tt&gt; can be thought of as a function taking two natural numbers as arguments and returning a natural number; it can be verified that
: &lt;tt&gt;PLUS 2 3&lt;/tt&gt;
and
: &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;
are β-equivalent lambda expressions. Since adding &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt; to a number &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; can be accomplished by adding 1 &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt; times, an alternative definition is:
: &lt;tt&gt;PLUS := λ''m''.λ''n''.''m'' SUCC ''n&amp;thinsp;''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Similarly, multiplication can be defined as
: &lt;tt&gt;MULT := λ''m''.λ''n''.λ''f''.''m'' (''n'' ''f'')&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref name="Selinger" /&gt;
Alternatively
: &lt;tt&gt;MULT := λ''m''.λ''n''.''m'' (PLUS ''n'') 0&lt;/tt&gt;
since multiplying &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as repeating the add &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; function &lt;tt&gt;''m''&lt;/tt&gt; times and then applying it to zero.
Exponentiation has a rather simple rendering in Church numerals, namely
: &lt;tt&gt;POW := λ''b''.λ''e''.''e'' ''b''&lt;/tt&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
The predecessor function defined by &lt;tt&gt;PRED ''n'' = ''n'' − 1&lt;/tt&gt; for a positive integer &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;PRED 0 = 0&lt;/tt&gt; is considerably more difficult. The formula
: &lt;tt&gt;PRED := λ''n''.λ''f''.λ''x''.''n'' (λ''g''.λ''h''.''h'' (''g'' ''f'')) (λ''u''.''x'') (λ''u''.''u'')&lt;/tt&gt;
can be validated by showing inductively that if ''T'' denotes &lt;tt&gt;(λ''g''.λ''h''.''h'' (''g'' ''f''))&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(λ''u''.''x'') = (λ''h''.''h''(''f''&lt;sup&gt;(''n''−1)&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')))&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;''n'' &gt; 0&lt;/tt&gt;. Two other definitions of &lt;tt&gt;PRED&lt;/tt&gt; are given below, one using [[#Logic and predicates|conditionals]] and the other using [[#Pairs|pairs]]. With the predecessor function, subtraction is straightforward. Defining
: &lt;tt&gt;SUB := λ''m''.λ''n''.''n'' PRED ''m''&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;SUB ''m'' ''n''&lt;/tt&gt; yields &lt;tt&gt;''m'' − ''n''&lt;/tt&gt; when &lt;tt&gt;''m'' &gt; ''n''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise.

===Logic and predicates===
By convention, the following two definitions (known as Church booleans) are used for the boolean values &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;:
: &lt;tt&gt;TRUE := λ''x''.λ''y''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;FALSE := λ''x''.λ''y''.''y''&lt;/tt&gt;
::(Note that &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to the Church numeral zero defined above)
Then, with these two λ-terms, we can define some logic operators (these are just possible formulations; other expressions are equally correct):
: &lt;tt&gt;AND := λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;OR := λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''p'' ''q''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;NOT := λ''p''.p FALSE TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;IFTHENELSE := λ''p''.λ''a''.λ''b''.''p'' ''a'' ''b''&lt;/tt&gt;
We are now able to compute some logic functions, for example:

: &lt;tt&gt;AND TRUE FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;
::&lt;tt&gt;≡ (λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p'') TRUE FALSE →&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; TRUE FALSE TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
::&lt;tt&gt;≡ (λ''x''.λ''y''.''x'') FALSE TRUE →&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;  FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;
and we see that &lt;tt&gt;AND TRUE FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;.

A ''predicate'' is a function that returns a boolean value. The most fundamental predicate is &lt;tt&gt;ISZERO&lt;/tt&gt;, which returns &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; if its argument is the Church numeral &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; if its argument is any other Church numeral:
: &lt;tt&gt;ISZERO := λ''n''.''n'' (λ''x''.FALSE) TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
The following predicate tests whether the first argument is less-than-or-equal-to the second:
: &lt;tt&gt;LEQ := λ''m''.λ''n''.ISZERO (SUB ''m'' ''n'')&lt;/tt&gt;,
and since &lt;tt&gt;''m'' = ''n''&lt;/tt&gt;, if &lt;tt&gt;LEQ ''m'' ''n''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;LEQ ''n'' ''m''&lt;/tt&gt;, it is straightforward to build a predicate for numerical equality.

The availability of predicates and the above definition of &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; make it convenient to write "if-then-else" expressions in lambda calculus. For example, the predecessor function can be defined as:
: &lt;tt&gt;PRED := λ''n''.''n'' (λ''g''.λ''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (λ''v''.0) 0 &lt;/tt&gt;
which can be verified by showing inductively that &lt;tt&gt;''n'' (λ''g''.λ''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (λ''v''.0)&lt;/tt&gt; is the add &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; − 1 function for &lt;tt&gt;''n''&lt;/tt&gt; &gt; 0.

===Pairs===
A pair (2-tuple) can be defined in terms of &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;, by using the [[Church encoding#Church pairs|Church encoding for pairs]]. For example, &lt;tt&gt;PAIR&lt;/tt&gt; encapsulates the pair (&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;''y''&lt;/tt&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;FIRST&lt;/tt&gt; returns the first element of the pair, and &lt;tt&gt;SECOND&lt;/tt&gt; returns the second.

: &lt;tt&gt;PAIR := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''f''.''f'' ''x'' ''y''&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;FIRST := λ''p''.''p'' TRUE&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;SECOND := λ''p''.''p'' FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;NIL := λ''x''.TRUE &lt;/tt&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;NULL := λ''p''.''p'' (λ''x''.λ''y''.FALSE)&lt;/tt&gt;

A linked list can be defined as either NIL for the empty list, or the &lt;tt&gt;PAIR&lt;/tt&gt; of an element and a smaller list. The predicate &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt; tests for the value &lt;tt&gt;NIL&lt;/tt&gt;. (Alternatively, with &lt;tt&gt;NIL := FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;, the construct &lt;tt&gt;''l'' (λ''h''.λ''t''.λ''z''.deal_with_head_''h''_and_tail_''t'') (deal_with_nil)&lt;/tt&gt; obviates the need for an explicit NULL test).

As an example of the use of pairs, the shift-and-increment function that maps &lt;tt&gt;(''m'', ''n'')&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;(''n'', ''n'' + 1)&lt;/tt&gt; can be defined as
: &lt;tt&gt;Φ := λ''x''.PAIR (SECOND ''x'') (SUCC (SECOND ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;
which allows us to give perhaps the most transparent version of the predecessor function:
: &lt;tt&gt;PRED := λ''n''.FIRST (''n'' Φ (PAIR 0 0)).&lt;/tt&gt;

==Additional programming techniques==
There is a considerable body of [[programming idiom]]s for lambda calculus. Many of these were originally developed in the context of using lambda calculus as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda calculus as a [[low-level programming language]]. Because several programming languages include the lambda calculus (or something very similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but may then be perceived as obscure or foreign.

===Named constants===
In lambda calculus, a [[library (computing)|library]] would take the form of a collection of previously defined functions, which as lambda-terms are merely particular constants. The pure lambda calculus does not have a concept of named constants since all atomic lambda-terms are variables, but one can emulate having named constants by setting aside a variable as the name of the constant, using lambda-abstraction to bind that variable in the main body, and apply that lambda-abstraction to the intended definition. Thus to use &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; to mean ''M'' (some explicit lambda-term) in ''N'' (another lambda-term, the "main program"), one can say
: &lt;tt&gt;(λ''f''.&lt;/tt&gt;''N''&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; ''M''
Authors often introduce [[syntactic sugar]], such as &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt;, to permit writing the above in the more intuitive order
: &lt;tt&gt;let ''f'' = &lt;/tt&gt;''M''&lt;tt&gt; in &lt;/tt&gt;''N''
By chaining such definitions, one can write a lambda calculus "program" as zero or more function definitions, followed by one lambda-term using those functions that constitutes the main body of the program.

A notable restriction of this &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; is that the name &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; is not defined in ''M'', since ''M'' is outside the scope of the lambda-abstraction binding &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;; this means a recursive function definition cannot be used as the ''M'' with &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt;. The more advanced &lt;tt&gt;letrec&lt;/tt&gt; syntactic sugar construction that allows writing recursive function definitions in that naive style instead additionally employs fixed-point combinators.

===Recursion and fixed points===
{{Main|Fixed-point combinator}}
{{see also|SKI combinator calculus#Self-application and recursion}}
[[Recursion]] is the definition of a function using the function itself. Lambda calculus cannot express this as directly as some other notations: all functions are anonymous in lambda calculus, so we can't refer to a value which is yet to be defined, inside the lambda term defining that same value. However, recursion can still be achieved by arranging for a lambda expression to receive itself as its argument value, for example in&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''x'' ''x'') ''E''&lt;/tt&gt;.

Consider the [[factorial]] function &lt;tt&gt;F(''n'')&lt;/tt&gt; recursively defined by

:&lt;tt&gt;F(''n'') = 1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &amp;times; F(''n'' − 1)&lt;/tt&gt;.

In the lambda expression which is to represent this function, a ''parameter'' (typically the first one) will be assumed to receive the lambda expression itself as its value, so that calling it &amp;ndash; applying it to an argument &amp;ndash; will amount to recursion. Thus to achieve recursion, the intended-as-self-referencing argument (called &lt;tt&gt;''r''&lt;/tt&gt; here) must always be passed to itself within the function body, at a call point:

:&lt;tt&gt;G := λ''r''. λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &amp;times; (''r'' ''r'' (''n''−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
::: with&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt; ''r'' ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;to hold, so&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt;''r'' = G&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;and
:&lt;tt&gt;F := G G = (λ''x''.''x'' ''x'') G&lt;/tt&gt;

The self-application achieves replication here, passing the function's lambda expression on to the next invocation as an argument value, making it available to be referenced and called there.

This solves it but requires re-writing each recursive call as self-application. We would like to have a generic solution, without a need for any re-writes:

:&lt;tt&gt;G := λ''r''. λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &amp;times; (''r'' (''n''−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
::: with&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt; ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;to hold, so&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt;''r'' = G ''r'' =: FIX G&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;and
:&lt;tt&gt;F := FIX G&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ensp;where&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt;FIX ''g'' := (''r'' where ''r'' = ''g'' ''r'') = ''g'' (FIX ''g'')&lt;/tt&gt;
::: so that&amp;ensp; &lt;tt&gt; FIX G = G (FIX G) = (λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' &amp;times; ((FIX G) (''n''−1)))) &lt;/tt&gt;

Given a lambda term with first argument representing recursive call (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; here), the ''fixed-point'' combinator &lt;tt&gt;FIX&lt;/tt&gt; will return a self-replicating lambda expression representing the recursive function (here, &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;). The function does not need to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the self-replication is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression &lt;tt&gt;(FIX G)&lt;/tt&gt; is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving [[self-reference]].

In fact, there are many possible definitions for this &lt;tt&gt;FIX&lt;/tt&gt; operator, the simplest of them being:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''Y''' := λ''g''.(λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;

In the lambda calculus, &lt;tt&gt;'''Y''' ''g''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;thinsp; is a fixed-point of &lt;tt&gt;''g''&lt;/tt&gt;, as it expands to:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''Y''' ''g''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;(λ''h''.(λ''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x''))) ''g''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;''g'' ((λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;''g'' ('''Y''' ''g'')&lt;/tt&gt;

Now, to perform our recursive call to the factorial function, we would simply call &lt;tt&gt;('''Y''' G) ''n''&lt;/tt&gt;,&amp;nbsp; where ''n'' is the number we are calculating the factorial of. Given ''n'' = 4, for example, this gives:

:&lt;tt&gt;('''Y''' G) 4 &lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;G ('''Y''' G) 4 &lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;(λ''r''.λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (''r'' (''n''−1)))) ('''Y''' G) 4&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;(λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) 4&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;1, if 4 = 0; else 4 × (('''Y''' G) (4−1))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (G ('''Y''' G) (4−1))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × ((λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) (4−1))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (1, if 3 = 0; else 3 × (('''Y''' G) (3−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (G ('''Y''' G) (3−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × ((λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) (3−1)))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (1, if 2 = 0; else 2 × (('''Y''' G) (2−1))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (G ('''Y''' G) (2−1))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × ((λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) (2−1))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1, if 1 = 0; else 1 × (('''Y''' G) (1−1)))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (G ('''Y''' G) (1−1)))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × ((λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0; else ''n'' × (('''Y''' G) (''n''−1)))) (1−1)))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (1, if 0 = 0; else 0 × (('''Y''' G) (0−1))))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (1))))&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;24&lt;/tt&gt;

Every recursively defined function can be seen as a fixed point of some suitably defined function closing over the recursive call with an extra argument, and therefore, using &lt;tt&gt;'''Y'''&lt;/tt&gt;, every recursively defined function can be expressed as a lambda expression. In particular, we can now cleanly define the subtraction, multiplication and comparison predicate of natural numbers recursively.

===Standard terms===
Certain terms have commonly accepted names:
: {{anchor|I}} &lt;tt&gt;'''I''' := λ''x''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|K}} &lt;tt&gt;'''K''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.''x''&lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|S}} &lt;tt&gt;'''S''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''x'' ''z'' (''y'' ''z'') &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|B}} &lt;tt&gt;'''B''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''x'' (''y'' ''z'') &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|C}} &lt;tt&gt;'''C''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''z''.''x'' ''z'' ''y''&lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|W}} &lt;tt&gt;'''W''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.''x'' ''y'' ''y''&lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|U}} &lt;tt&gt;'''U''' := λ''x''.λ''y''.''y'' (''x'' ''x'' ''y'')  &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|omega}} &lt;tt&gt;'''ω''' := λ''x''.''x'' ''x'' &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|Omega}} &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω''' := '''ω''' '''ω''' &lt;/tt&gt;
: {{anchor|Y}} &lt;tt&gt;'''Y''' := λ''g''.(λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))&lt;/tt&gt;
Several of these have direct applications in the ''elimination of lambda-abstraction'' that turns lambda terms into [[combinator calculus]] terms.

===Abstraction elimination===
{{main|Combinatory_logic#Completeness_of_the_S-K_basis}}
If ''N'' is a lambda-term without lambda-abstraction, but possibly containing named constants ([[combinatory logic|combinators]]), then there exists a lambda-term ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;,''N'') which is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.&lt;/tt&gt;''N'' but lacks lambda-abstraction (except as part of the named constants, if these are considered non-atomic). This can also be viewed as anonymising variables, as ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;,''N'') removes all occurrences of &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; from ''N'', while still allowing argument values to be substituted into the positions where ''N'' contains an &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;. The conversion function ''T'' can be defined by:
: ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;) := '''I'''
: ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, ''N'') := '''K''' ''N'' if &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; is not free in ''N''.
: ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, ''M'' ''N'') := '''S''' ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, ''M'') ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;, ''N'')
In either case, a term of the form ''T''(&lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;,''N'') ''P'' can reduce by having the initial combinator '''I''', '''K''', or '''S''' grab the argument ''P'', just like β-reduction of &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.&lt;/tt&gt;''N''&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; ''P'' would do. '''I''' returns that argument. '''K''' throws the argument away, just like &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.&lt;/tt&gt;''N''&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; would do if &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; has no free occurrence in ''N''. '''S''' passes the argument on to both subterms of the application, and then applies the result of the first to the result of the second.

The combinators '''B''' and '''C''' are similar to '''S''', but pass the argument on to only one subterm of an application ('''B''' to the "argument" subterm and '''C''' to the "function" subterm), thus saving a subsequent '''K''' if there is no occurrence of &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; in one subterm. In comparison to '''B''' and '''C''', the '''S''' combinator actually conflates two functionalities: rearranging arguments, and duplicating an argument so that it may be used in two places. The '''W''' combinator does only the latter, yielding the [[B, C, K, W system]] as an alternative to [[SKI combinator calculus]].

== Typed lambda calculus ==
{{main|Typed lambda calculus}}
{{Summarize|from|typed lambda calculus|date=August 2009}}&lt;!-- this was requested by multiple editor on talk --&gt;
A '''typed lambda calculus''' is a typed [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that uses the lambda-symbol (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and  ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.&lt;ref&gt;Types and Programming Languages, p. 273, Benjamin C. Pierce&lt;/ref&gt;

Typed lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).

==Computable functions and lambda calculus==
A function ''F'': '''N''' → '''N''' of natural numbers is a computable function if and only if there exists a lambda expression ''f'' such that for every pair of ''x'', ''y'' in '''N''', ''F''(''x'')=''y'' if and only if ''f'' &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;''y''&lt;/tt&gt;,&amp;nbsp; where &lt;tt&gt;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''y''&lt;/tt&gt; are the Church numerals corresponding to ''x'' and ''y'', respectively and =&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; meaning equivalence with beta reduction. This is one of the many ways to define computability; see the [[Church–Turing thesis]] for a discussion of other approaches and their equivalence.

==Undecidability of equivalence==
There is no algorithm that takes as input two lambda expressions and outputs &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; depending on whether or not the two expressions are equivalent. This was historically the first problem for which undecidability could be proven. As is common for a proof of undecidability, the proof shows that no computable function can decide the equivalence. [[Church's thesis]] is then invoked to show that no algorithm can do so.

Church's proof first reduces the problem to determining whether a given lambda expression has a ''normal form''. A normal form is an equivalent expression that cannot be reduced any further under the rules imposed by the form. Then he assumes that this predicate is computable, and can hence be expressed in lambda calculus. Building on earlier work by Kleene and constructing a [[Gödel numbering]] for lambda expressions, he constructs a lambda expression &lt;tt&gt;''e''&lt;/tt&gt; that closely follows the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]]. If &lt;tt&gt;''e''&lt;/tt&gt; is applied to its own Gödel number, a contradiction results.

==Lambda calculus and programming languages==
As pointed out by [[Peter Landin]]'s 1965 paper "A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=363749&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM |title=A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation |first=P. J. |last=Landin |authorlink=Peter Landin |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1965 |pages=89–101 |doi=10.1145/363744.363749}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sequential [[procedural programming|procedural programming languages]] can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application.

===Anonymous functions===
{{main|Anonymous function}}
For example, in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] the "square" function can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:
&lt;!-- Please do not add the same example in different languages to this article, see Anonymous function for that. Thank you! --&gt;
&lt;source lang="Lisp"&gt;
(lambda (x) (* x x))
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example is an expression that evaluates to a first-class function. The symbol &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; creates an anonymous function, given a list of parameter names, &lt;code&gt;(x)&lt;/code&gt; – just a single argument in this case, and an expression that is evaluated as the body of the function, &lt;code&gt;(* x x)&lt;/code&gt;. Anonymous functions are sometimes called lambda expressions.

For example, [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and many other imperative languages have long supported passing [[subprograms]] as [[arguments]] to other subprograms through the mechanism of [[function pointers]]. However, function pointers are not a sufficient condition for functions to be [[First-class function|first class]] datatypes, because a function is a first class datatype if and only if new instances of the function can be created at run-time. And this run-time creation of functions is supported in [[Smalltalk]], [[JavaScript]], and more recently in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] ("agents"), [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] ("delegates") and [[C++11]], among others.

===Reduction strategies===
{{details|Evaluation strategy}}
Whether a term is normalising or not, and how much work needs to be done in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used. The distinction between reduction strategies relates to the distinction in functional programming languages between [[eager evaluation]] and [[lazy evaluation]].

;Full beta reductions: Any redex can be reduced at any time. This means essentially the lack of any particular reduction strategy—with regard to reducibility, "all bets are off".
;Applicative order: The rightmost, innermost redex is always reduced first. Intuitively this means a function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.
:Most programming languages (including Lisp, ML and imperative languages like C and [[Java programming language|Java]]) are described as "strict", meaning that functions applied to non-normalising arguments are non-normalising. This is done essentially using applicative order, call by value reduction ([[#Call by value|see below]]), but usually called "eager evaluation".
;Normal order: The leftmost, outermost redex is always reduced first. That is, whenever possible the arguments are substituted into the body of an abstraction before the arguments are reduced.
;Call by name: As normal order, but no reductions are performed inside abstractions. For example, &lt;tt&gt;λ''x''.(λ''x''.''x'')''x''&lt;/tt&gt; is in normal form according to this strategy, although it contains the redex &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''x'')''x''&lt;/tt&gt;.
;Call by value: Only the outermost redexes are reduced: a redex is reduced only when its right hand side has reduced to a value (variable or lambda abstraction).
;Call by need: As normal order, but function applications that would duplicate terms instead name the argument, which is then reduced only "when it is needed". Called in practical contexts "lazy evaluation". In implementations this "name" takes the form of a pointer, with the redex represented by a [[thunk (functional programming)|thunk]].

Applicative order is not a normalising strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω''' = ωω&lt;/tt&gt; where &lt;tt&gt;'''ω''' = λ''x''.''xx''&lt;/tt&gt;. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt;. Since this is the only available reduction, &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt; has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression &lt;tt&gt;'''KIΩ''' = (λ''x''.λ''y''.''x'') (λ''x''.''x'')'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt; is reduced by first reducing &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt; to normal form (since it is the rightmost redex), but since &lt;tt&gt;'''Ω'''&lt;/tt&gt; has no normal form, applicative order fails to find a normal form for &lt;tt&gt;'''KIΩ'''&lt;/tt&gt;.

In contrast, normal order is so called because it always finds a normalising reduction, if one exists. In the above example, &lt;tt&gt;'''KIΩ'''&lt;/tt&gt; reduces under normal order to ''I'', a normal form. A drawback is that redexes in the arguments may be copied, resulting in duplicated computation (for example, &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt; reduces to &lt;tt&gt;((λ''x''.''x'')''y'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt; using this strategy; now there are two redexes, so full evaluation needs two more steps, but if the argument had been reduced first, there would now be none).

The positive tradeoff of using applicative order is that it does not cause unnecessary computation, if all arguments are used, because it never substitutes arguments containing redexes and hence never needs to copy them (which would duplicate work). In the above example, in applicative order &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt; reduces first to &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'')''y''&lt;/tt&gt; and then to the normal order &lt;tt&gt;''yy''&lt;/tt&gt;, taking two steps instead of three.

Most ''purely'' functional programming languages (notably [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]] and its descendents, including Haskell), and the proof languages of [[Automated theorem prover|theorem provers]], use ''lazy evaluation'', which is essentially the same as call by need. This is like normal order reduction, but call by need manages to avoid the duplication of work inherent in normal order reduction using ''sharing''. In the example given above, &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt; reduces to &lt;tt&gt;((λ''x''.''x'')''y'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')&lt;/tt&gt;, which has two redexes, but in call by need they are represented using the same object rather than copied, so when one is reduced the other is too.

===A note about complexity===
While the idea of beta reduction seems simple enough, it is not an atomic step, in that it must have a non-trivial cost when estimating [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Statman |authorlink=Richard Statman |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4567929 |title=The typed λ-calculus is not elementary recursive |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |year=1979 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=73–81 |doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable &lt;tt&gt;''V''&lt;/tt&gt; in the expression &lt;tt&gt;''E''&lt;/tt&gt;, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of these locations in some way, implying a space cost. A naïve search for the locations of &lt;tt&gt;''V''&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;''E''&lt;/tt&gt; is [[Big O notation|''O''(''n'')]] in the length ''n'' of &lt;tt&gt;''E''&lt;/tt&gt;. This has led to the study of systems that use [[explicit substitution]]. Sinot's [[director string]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F.-R. |last=Sinot |url=http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~sinot/publis.php?onlykey=sinot-jlc05 |title=Director Strings Revisited: A Generic Approach to the Efficient Representation of Free Variables in Higher-order Rewriting |journal=Journal of Logic and Computation |volume=15 |number=2 |pages=201–218 |year=2005 |doi=10.1093/logcom/exi010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; offer a way of tracking the locations of free variables in expressions.

===Parallelism and concurrency===
The [[Church–Rosser theorem|Church–Rosser]] property of the lambda calculus means that evaluation (β-reduction) can be carried out in ''any order'', even in parallel. This means that various [[evaluation strategy#Nondeterministic strategies|nondeterministic evaluation strategies]] are relevant. However, the lambda calculus does not offer any explicit constructs for [[parallel computing|parallelism]]. One can add constructs such as [[Futures and promises|Futures]] to the lambda calculus. Other [[process calculi]] have been developed for describing communication and concurrency.

===Optimal reduction===
In Lévy's 1988 paper "[http://pauillac.inria.fr/~levy/pubs/88icot.pdf Sharing in the Evaluation of lambda Expressions]", he defines a notion of optimal sharing, such that no work is ''duplicated''. For example, performing a beta reduction in normal order on &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') (II)&lt;/tt&gt; reduces it to &lt;tt&gt;II (II)&lt;/tt&gt;. The argument &lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt; is duplicated by the application to the first lambda term. If the reduction was done in an applicative order first, we save work because work is not duplicated: &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') (II)&lt;/tt&gt; reduces to &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') I&lt;/tt&gt;. On the other hand, using applicative order can result in redundant reductions or even possibly never reduce to normal form. For example, performing a beta reduction in normal order on &lt;tt&gt;(λ''f''.f I) (λy.(λ''x''.''xx'') (y I))&lt;/tt&gt; yields &lt;tt&gt;(λy.(λ''x''.''xx'') (y I)) I&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;(λ''x''.''xx'') (II)&lt;/tt&gt; which we know we can do without duplicating work. Doing the same but in applicative order yields &lt;tt&gt;(λ''f''.f I) (λy.y I (y I))&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;(λy.y I (y I)) I&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;I I (I I)&lt;/tt&gt;, and now work is duplicated.

Lévy shows the existence of lambda terms where there ''does not exist'' a sequence of reductions which reduces them without duplicating work. The below lambda term is such an example.

&lt;tt&gt;((λg.(g(g(λx.x))))
(λh.((λf.(f(f(λz.z))))
(λw.(h(w(λy.y)))))))&lt;/tt&gt;

It is composed of three similar terms, &lt;tt&gt;x=((λg. ... ) (λh.y))&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y=((λf. ...) (λw.z) )&lt;/tt&gt;, and finally &lt;tt&gt;z=λw.(h(w(λy.y)))&lt;/tt&gt;. There are only two possible beta reductions to be done here, on x and on y. Reducing the outer x term first results in the inner y term being duplicated, and each copy will have to be reduced, but reducing the inner y term first will duplicate its argument z, which will cause work to be duplicated when the values of h and w are made known. Incidentally, the above term reduces to the identity function &lt;tt&gt;(λy.y)&lt;/tt&gt;, and is constructed by making wrappers which make the identity function available to the binders &lt;tt&gt;g=λh...&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f=λw...&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;h=λx.x&lt;/tt&gt; (at first), and &lt;tt&gt;w=λz.z&lt;/tt&gt; (at first), all of which are applied to the innermost term &lt;tt&gt;λy.y&lt;/tt&gt;.

The precise notion of duplicated work relies on noticing that after the first reduction of &lt;tt&gt;I I&lt;/tt&gt; is done, the value of the other &lt;tt&gt;I I&lt;/tt&gt; can be determined, because they have the same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting &lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt; terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of &lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt; can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the &lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt; term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.

While Lévy defines the notion of optimal sharing, he does not provide an algorithm to do it. In Vincent van Oostrom, Kees-Jan van de Looij, and Marijn Zwitserlood's paper ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237723293_Lambdascope_Another_optimal_implementation_of_the_lambda-calculus Lambdascope: Another optimal implementation of the lambda-calculus]'', they provide such an algorithm by transforming lambda terms into [[interaction nets]], which are then reduced. Roughly speaking, the resulting reduction is optimal because every term that would have the same labels as per Lévy's paper would also be the same graph in the interaction net. In the paper, they mention that their prototype implementation of Lambdascope performs as well as the ''optimised'' version of the reference optimal higher order machine BOHM.

More details can be found in the short article [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312462365_About_the_efficient_reduction_of_lambda_terms About the efficient reduction of lambda terms].

==Semantics==
The fact that lambda calculus terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, and even on themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics was to find a set ''D'' isomorphic to the function space ''D'' → ''D'', of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such ''D'' can exist, by [[cardinality]] constraints because the set of all functions from ''D'' to ''D'' has greater cardinality than ''D'', unless ''D'' is a [[singleton set]].

In the 1970s, [[Dana Scott]] showed that, if only [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]] were considered, a set or [[Domain theory|domain]] ''D'' with the required property could be found, thus providing a [[Model theory|model]] for the lambda calculus.

This work also formed the basis for the [[denotational semantics]] of programming languages.

The '''Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research''' ({{lang-de|Leibniz-Institut für Ostseeforschung Warnemünde}}, abbreviated IOW) is a research institution located in [[Warnemünde]] ([[Rostock]]), [[Germany]].

It is part of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz-Association]], cooperates with the [[University of Rostock]] and was founded in 1992. Employing about 160 people the main focus lies on interdisciplinary study of coastal oceans and marginal seas, especially on [[Baltic Sea]] related [[oceanography]]. The institute is a follow-up of the former Institute of Oceanography ("Institut für Meereskunde") which was part of the [[East Germany|GDR]] Academy of Science.

The institute is divided in four departments: physical oceanography, marine chemistry, biological oceanography, and marine geology. Central task of the institute is fundamental research but also teaching at the universities of [[University of Rostock|Rostock]] and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]]. IOW has direct access to the research vessel "[[RV Maria S. Merian|Maria S. Merian]]" and can access by request a variety of other medium-sized vessels for longer trips and interdisciplinary tasks from the German research fleet. The institute's facilities are financed by the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]], and the Ministry of Education of [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]].

'''Mach tuck''' is an [[aerodynamic]] effect whereby the nose of an [[aircraft]] tends to [[Pitch (flight)|pitch]] downward as the airflow around the wing reaches [[supersonic]] speeds; the aircraft will first experience this effect at significantly below [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Transonic flow patterns.svg|thumb|right|Shock wave above wing moves rearwards as aircraft speed approaches Mach 1]]

==Causes==
Mach tuck is usually caused by two things, a rearward movement of the [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] of the wing and a decrease in wing downwash velocity at the tailplane both of which cause a nose down pitching moment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ce560xl.com/files/High_Altitude_Aerodynamics.pdf critical aspects of mach flight e.&lt;/ref&gt; For a particular aircraft design only one of these may be significant in causing a tendency to dive, delta-winged aircraft with no foreplane or tailplane in the first case and, for example, the [[Lockheed P-38]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930092690.pdf p.4&lt;/ref&gt; in the second case. Alternatively, a particular design may have no significant tendency, for example the [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://rahauav.com/Library/Aerodynamic/Aerodynamic_design_of_transport_aircraft_www.rahaUAV.com.pdf p.379&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aerofoil generating lift moves through the air, the air flowing over the top surface accelerates to a higher local speed than the air flowing over the bottom surface. When the aircraft speed reaches its [[critical Mach number]] the accelerated airflow locally reaches the speed of sound and creates a small shock wave, even though the aircraft is still travelling below the speed of sound.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975) ''Aerodynamics'', section 11.10, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0 273 01120 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region in front of the shock wave generates high lift. As the aircraft itself flies faster, the shock wave over the wing gets stronger and moves rearwards, creating high lift further back along the wing. This rearward movement of lift causes the aircraft to tuck or pitch nose-down.

The severity of Mach tuck on any given design is affected by the thickness of the aerofoil, the sweep angle of the wing, and the location of the tailplane relative to the main wing.{{explain|date=October 2016}}

A tailplane which is positioned further aft can provide a larger stabilizing pitch-up moment.

The [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] and thickness of the aerofoil affect the critical Mach number, with a more highly curved upper surface causing a lower critical Mach number.

On a swept wing the shock wave typically forms first at the [[wing root]], especially if it is more cambered than the [[wing tip]]. As speed increases, the shock wave and associated lift extend outwards and, because the wing is swept, backwards.

The changing airflow over the wing can reduce the [[downwash]] over a conventional tailplane, promoting a stronger nose-down pitching moment.

Another problem with a separate horizontal stabiliser is that it can itself achieve local supersonic flow with its own shock wave. This can affect the operation of a conventional elevator control surface.

Aircraft without enough elevator authority to maintain trim and fly level can enter a steep, sometimes unrecoverable dive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the aircraft is supersonic, the faster top shock wave can reduce the authority of the elevator and horizontal stabilizers.&lt;ref name="selkirk"&gt;[http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/aerodynamics1/High-Speed/Page2e.html Transonic Aircraft Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614103204/http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/aerodynamics1/High-Speed/Page2e.html |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All transonic and supersonic aircraft experience Mach tuck.

==Recovery==
Recovery is sometimes impossible in subsonic aircraft; however, as an aircraft descends into lower, warmer, denser air, [[control authority]] may return because drag tends to slow the aircraft while the speed of sound and control authority both increase.

To prevent Mach stall from progressing, the pilot should keep the airspeed below the type's critical Mach number by reducing [[throttle]], extending [[air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and if possible, extending the [[landing gear]].

==Design features==

A number of design techniques are used to counter the effects of Mach tuck.

On both conventional tailplane and [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] foreplane configurations, the horizontal stabiliser may be made large and powerful enough to correct the large trim changes associated with Mach tuck. In place of the conventional elevator control surface, the whole stabiliser may be made moveable or "all-flying", sometimes called a [[stabilator]]. This both increases the authority of the stabilizer over a wider range of aircraft pitch, but also avoids the controllability issues associated with a separate elevator.&lt;ref name="selkirk" /&gt;

Aircraft that fly supersonic for long periods, such as [[Concorde]], may compensate for Mach tuck by moving fuel between tanks in the fuselage to change the position of the [[centre of mass]] to match  the changing location of the centre of pressure, thereby minimize the amount of aerodynamic trim required.

A Mach trimmer is a device which varies the pitch trim automatically as a function of Mach number to oppose Mach tuck and maintain level flight.

==History==
[[File:Lockheed P-38H Lightning - 1.jpg|thumb|The [[P-38 Lightning]] gave [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] engineers a great deal of initial design trouble because it was so fast that it was the first American aircraft to experience [[Compressibility#Aeronautical dynamics|compressibility]] and Mach tuck.]] The fastest [[Air warfare of World War II|World War II fighters]] were the first aircraft to experience Mach tuck.   Their wings were not designed to counter Mach tuck because research on supersonic airfoils was just beginning; areas of supersonic flow, together with shock waves and flow separation,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr. ''Introduction to Flight'', Third Edition, McGraw Hill Book Company, {{ISBN|0-07-001641-0}}, Figure 5.17 point c and Figure 5.20&lt;/ref&gt; were present on the wing. This condition was known at the time as compressibility burble and was known to exist on propeller tips at high aircraft speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1935/naca-tn-543.pdf NACA Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[P-38 Lightning|P-38]] was the first 400&amp;nbsp;mph fighter, and it suffered more than the usual teething troubles.&lt;ref name=Bodie&gt;Bodie, Warren M. ''The Lockheed P-38 Lightning: The Definitive Story of Lockheed's P-38 Fighter''. Hayesville, North Carolina: Widewing Publications, 2001, 1991. {{ISBN|0-9629359-5-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a thick, high-lift wing,  distinctive [[twin boom]]s and a single, central [[nacelle]] containing the cockpit and armament.  It quickly accelerated to terminal velocity in a dive. The short stubby fuselage had a detrimental effect in reducing the critical Mach number of the 15% thick wing center section with high velocities over the canopy adding to those on the upper surface of the wing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1947/naca-rm-a7c24.pdf NACA Report] p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Mach tuck occurred at speeds above Mach&amp;nbsp;0.65;&lt;ref name=erickson&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a800790.pdf Erickson report] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; the air flow over the wing center section became [[Transonic speed|transonic]], causing a loss of lift. The resultant change in downwash at the tail caused a nose-down pitching moment and the dive to steepen (Mach tuck). The aircraft was very stable in this condition&lt;ref name=erickson
/&gt; making recovery from the dive very difficult. Dive recovery (auxiliary)&lt;ref&gt;Abzug and Larrabee, ''Airplane Stability and Control'', Cambridge University Press 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-02128-6}}, p.165&lt;/ref&gt; flaps were added to the underside of the wing (P-38J-LO) to increase the wing lift and downwash at the tail to allow recovery from transonic dives.

A '''metaconstitution''' is a set of pre-constitutional rules.&lt;ref&gt;These rules are often referred to as "metarules". The metarules are developed from axioms appropriate to the time period. Thus, what is actually constructed can be variable.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in lieu of a formalized [[constitution]] and consists of accepted axiomatic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Alexander |first= Larry|title=  Constitutionalism:Philosophical Foundations| pages= 2–3| isbn=0-521-79999-6| publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution is similar to or developed from this. A metaconstitution is also less binding, and can be used to a less rigid form of government. To many nations, the metaconstitution provides an "exit-option", where they may variate from the written document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaken |first= Anne Van|author2=Christian List |author3=Christoph Lutege |title=Deliberation and Decision|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| isbn=0-7546-2358-0| page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metaconstitution, unlike formal constitutions, never needs to be written. Its creation results from the morality and judgment of the people. To be formulated, the people must be generally opposed to anarchy and must desire some form of governing force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=O'Mahony|first=Paul|title= Criminal Justice in Ireland| publisher=Institute of Public Administration| isbn=1-902448-71-5| page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although vague in concept, the metaconstitution almost always creates the basic roles of leader v. follower. The purpose of the document, however, prevents the placement of total power on the leader. The populace is trusted to self-govern except in severe cases. Such theory does not differ much from [[salutary neglect]] or [[laissez faire]].

==Historical concept==
Many prominent political philosophers have discoursed on the subject of metaconstitutionalism, though not directly. Some address the topic as a looser constitution in which the government's singular duty is to protect the people and vice versa. Per [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: {{cquote|If it be admitted that a man possessing absolute power may misuse that power . . . . why should not a majority be liable to the same reproach? Men do not change their characters by uniting with each other. . . . For myself, when I feel the hand of power lie heavy on my brow, I care but little to know who oppresses me; and I am not the more disposed to pass beneath the yoke because it is held out to me by the arms of a million of men.|25px|25px|Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), Democracy in America, New York: New American Library, 1956, pp. 114, 149}}

The concept of metaconstitutionalism received light during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], as a possible replacement to the [[Articles of Confederation]]. Per the Federalist, Number 51: {{cquote|In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself . A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.|25px|25px|Federalist, Number 51}}

==Metaconstitutions==

{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}

==Criticisms==
A metaconstitution is constructed to provide a looser equivalent for government. However, a metaconstitutionalistic society is more likely to suffer from domestic disorder.&lt;ref name= "disorder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kromkowski|first=Charles Aloysius|title=Recreating the American Republic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80848-0|page=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the government cannot wield any power to control the outbreak. Lack of trade and corruption are also major difficulties for a metaconstitution. Again, the governments legal inability to enforce powerful law prevents it from containing situations.&lt;ref name= "disorder" /&gt; In this usage of "metaconstitution", it can also mean a constitution with a nearly non-existent [[executive branch]].

'''Minusheet perfusion culture system''' is used for advanced [[cell culture]] experiments in combination with [[Subculture (biology)#Adherent cells|adherent cells]] and to generate specialized tissues in combination with selected [[biomaterial]]s, special tissue carriers and compatible [[perfusion]] culture containers.

The technical development of the Minusheet perfusion culture system was driven by the idea to create under [[in vitro]] conditions an environment resembling as near as possible the situation of specialized tissues found within the [[organism]]. Basis of this invention is therefore individually selected biomaterials for optimal cell adhesion mounted in Minusheet tissue carriers. Moreover, to always offer fresh [[nutrition]] including respiratory gas and to simulate a tissue-specific fluid environment, the tissue carriers can be inserted into compatible perfusion culture containers. As a result, a variety of publications illustrates that tissues generated by this innovative approach exhibit an excellent and stable quality. Thus, on the one hand the system provides a highly adaptable basis for the culture of adherent cells and the generation of specialized tissues. On the other hand the Minusheet perfusion culture system is bridging a methodical gap between the conventional static 24 well culture plate and modern perfusion culture technology.

==Crucial generation of specialized tissues==
Specialized tissues in culture are urgently needed in [[regenerative medicine]], [[tissue engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], biomaterial research and advanced [[toxicity]] testing of newly developed [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]]. However, it is often observed that raised tissues do not exhibit expected functional features. Instead [[Cellular differentiation|dedifferentiation]] is observed [1-4]. These cell biological alterations arise after isolation of cells and proceed during static culture in a dish due to suboptimal fluid environment and minor adhesion on biomaterials. Further uncontrolled supply with nutrition and respiratory gas, an overshoot of [[metabolite]]s and paracrine factors or missing [[Rheometry|rheological]] stress can increase the degree of dedifferentiation. In consequence, regarding an optimal generation of specialized tissues a powerful strategy has to exclude as much as possible harmful parameters, while factors supporting the process of tissue development must be intensified [5].

==Selected biomaterials promote development within a tissue carrier==
Under natural conditions a prerequisite for an optimal tissue development is a cell-specific interaction with the extracellular matrix, while under in vitro conditions a substitute for the extracellular matrix has to be selected. However, the crucial problem is that a [[biomaterial]] can influence the development of functional features within a maturing tissue in a good and in a bad sense. In consequence, the suitability of a decellularized extracellular matrix, newly developed synthetic polymers, biodegradable scaffolds, ceramics or metal alloys cannot be predicted but must be tested. 
To meet parameters positively influencing cell adhesion and communication, the technical concept is based on a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1). By the help of this tool cell adhesion and development of tissue can be tested with individually selected biomaterials. These experiments can be performed first under static (Fig. 2) and then under dynamic (Fig. 3) culture conditions [6]. In both cases a Minusheet tissue carrier prevents damage but supports development of contained cells or tissues during experimentation.  
[[File:Minusheet Figure 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 1|Figure 1: Mounting of a Minusheet tissue carrier. (a) First an individual biomaterial measuring 13 mm in diameter is selected. (b) For mounting the biomaterial is placed in the base part of a tissue carrier. (c) After pressing down a tension ring the mounted tissue carrier can be used for cell seeding. For improved provision with medium a tissue carrier rests with protrusions at the bottom of a dish.]]
To stay compatible with a conventional 24 well culture plate a selected biomaterial must be punched in a diameter of 13&amp;nbsp;mm. In this format many materials are also commercially available. Further materials can be applied in form of filters, foils, nets, fleeces and scaffolds (Fig. 1a). For an easy handling and to prevent damage during development the selected specimens are placed in the base part of a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1b). Pressing down a [[tension ring]] the biomaterial is held in position (Fig. 1c). After mounting a tissue carrier is enveloped in a bag and sterilized.

==Cell seeding on a tissue carrier==
For cell seeding the mounted tissue carrier is transferred by a forceps in a 24 well culture plate (Fig. 2). To concentrate cells on top of a tissue carrier culture medium is added to a level so that the selected biomaterial is just wetted. Then an [[wikt:Special:Search/aliquot|aliquot]] of cells is transferred by a pipette to the surface of the mounted biomaterial.
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 2|Figure 2: Minusheet tissue carriers including different biomaterials within a 24 well culture plate. Cell seeding is performed in static environment of this dish.]]

A standard culture protocol with a tissue carrier can be initiated by seeding cells onto the upper side. When a tissue carrier is turned, cells can also be seeded on the other side so that co-culture experiments with two different cell types become possible.
Not only single cells but also a thin slice of tissue can be mounted between two pieces of a woven net within a Minusheet tissue carrier. Further flexible materials such as [[collagen]] sheets can be used in a tissue carrier like the skin of a drum. Last but not least excellent results were obtained by mounting a polyester fleece as an artificial [[interstitium]] for spatial [[parenchyma]] development [5,6,8]. It is obvious that for each specialized tissue very individual spatial environments within a tissue carrier can be created.

==Compatible perfusion culture containers==
It has been shown that the static environment within a 24 well culture plate leads to a decrease of nutrition and hormones, an uncontrollable increase of [[metabolite]]s and an overshoot of [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine]] factors during time. Due to these reasons a Minusheet tissue carrier with adherent cells is used only for the short period of cell seeding in a 24 well culture plate.
In consequence, after adhesion of cells the tissue carrier is transferred to a perfusion culture container to offer a dynamic fluid environment. To meet the individual requirements of specialized tissues a variety of perfusion culture containers was constructed (Fig. 3).
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 3|Figure 3: Variety of perfusion culture containers for insertion of Minusheet tissue carriers.]]
 
Each of the perfusion culture containers has at least one inlet and one outlet for the transport of culture medium. A basic version of a container allows the simple bathing of cells respectively growing tissues under continuous medium transport (Fig. 4a). In a gradient container the tissue carrier is placed between the base and the lid so that both sides can be provided with individual media mimicking a typical environment for [[epithelia]] (Fig. 4b). A further culture container is made of a transparent lid and base allowing the microscopic observation during tissue development (Fig. 4c).
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 4.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 4|Figure 4: Use of a Minusheet tissue carrier in perfusion culture containers. (a) A standard perfusion culture container holds six tissue carriers to provide them with always fresh medium. (b) In a gradient perfusion culture container an epithelium is exposed to different fluids at the luminal and basal side. (c) In a microscope container a transparent lid and base allow observation of developing tissue during perfusion culture.]]

In addition, a perfusion culture container can exhibit a flexible [[silicone]] lid. Applying force to this lid by an eccentric rotor simulates a mechanical load as required in [[cartilage]] and [[bone]] [[tissue engineering]]. Shaped tissues such as an [[Ear|auricle]] or different forms of cartilage can be generated with individual scaffolds in a special tissue engineering container. Finally, spatial extension of [[tubule]]s derived from renal stem/progenitor cells is obtained within a perfusion container filled with an artificial interstitium made of polyester fleece. Finally, all of these containers are machined out of a special polycarbonate ([[Makrolon]]®) so that all of them can be [[autoclave]]d for multiple uses.

==Performance of perfusion culture experiments==
To maintain the necessary temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C within a perfusion culture container, a heating plate (MEDAX-Nagel, Kiel, Germany) and a cover lid (not shown) are used during performance of culture experiments over weeks (Fig. 5, 7). The transport of [[culture medium]] is best accomplished using a slowly rotating [[peristaltic pump]] (ISMATEC, IPC N8, Wertheim, Germany). It is able to deliver adjustable and exact pump rates between 0.1 and 5 ml per hour.
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 5.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 5|Figure 5: Perfusion culture set-up is working on a laboratory table. A thermo plate maintains the desired temperature of 37°C. During culture a peristaltic pump transports the medium for example with 1.25 ml/h from a storage bottle (left side) to the waste bottle (right side).]]

On the passage from the storage bottle through the perfusion culture container medium is transported along a mounted tissue carrier to provide contained cells. The exact geometrical placement of the tissue carrier within a perfusion culture container guarantees during transport of medium provision with always fresh nutrition and respiratory gas from all sides. At the same time it prevents an unphysiological accumulation of metabolic products and an overshoot of paracrine factors. To maintain for the whole culture period this controlled environment, the metabolized medium is collected in a separate waste bottle. In consequence, medium is not recirculated.

==Stabilization of pH during perfusion culture==
Normally cell culture experiments are performed in a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator. Also perfusion culture experiments can be performed in such an atmosphere. However, a much better solution is the performance of perfusion culture experiments under atmospheric air on a laboratory table, since it facilitates the complete handling. However, in this case the culture medium has to be adjusted to atmospheric air.
Keeping media in a 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere within an incubator always a relatively high amount of NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is contained to maintain a constant pH between 7.2 and 7.4. If such a formulated medium is used for perfusion culture outside a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator, the pH will shift from the physiological range to much more alkaline values due to the low content of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (0.3%) in atmospheric air.
For that reason any medium used for perfusion culture outside a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubator has to be stabilized by reducing the NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentration and/or by adding biological buffers such as HEPES (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) or BUFFER ALL (Sigma-Aldrich-Chemie, München, Germany). The necessary amount can be easily determined by admixing increasing amounts of biological buffer solution to an aliquot of medium. Then the medium must equilibrate over night on a thermo plate at 37&amp;nbsp;°C under atmospheric air. For example, application of 50&amp;nbsp;mmol/l HEPES or an equivalent of BUFFER ALL (ca. 1%) to IMDM (Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium, GIBCO/Invitrogen) will maintain a constant pH of 7.4 throughout long term perfusion culture under atmospheric air on a laboratory table.

==Availability of oxygen in medium==
To obtain in a perfusion culture experiment a high saturation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a selected medium such as IMDM has to be transported through a gas permeable silicone tube. The use of a silicone tube provides a large surface for [[gas exchange]] by diffusion due to a thin wall (1&amp;nbsp;mm), the small inner diameter (1&amp;nbsp;mm) and its extended length (1 m). For example, analysis of IMDM (3024&amp;nbsp;mg/l NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 50&amp;nbsp;mmol/l HEPES) equilibrated against atmospheric air during a standard perfusion culture experiment shows constant partial pressures of at least 160 mmHg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [7].

==Modulation of oxygen content==
It has been shown that growing cells and tissues have very individual [[oxygen]] requirements. Due to this reason it is important that the content of oxygen can be adapted in individual perfusion culture experiments. The technical solution is a gas exchanger module containing a gas inlet and outlet (Fig. 6a). Further a spiral with a long thin-walled silicon tube for medium transport is mounted inside the module. Since the tube is highly gas-permeable, it guarantees optimal diffusion of gases between culture medium and internal atmosphere of the gas exchange module. In consequence, the desired gas atmosphere can be adjusted by a constant flow of a specific gas mixture through the module. This way the content of oxygen or any other gases can be modulated in the medium by diffusion. Applying this simple protocol it became possible to decrease the oxygen partial pressure within the transported medium during long term culture experiments under absolutely sterile conditions [7].
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 6.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 6|Figure 6: Gas exchange and gas expander module for perfusion culture. (a) A gas exchange module is used, when adaption of respiratory gas in perfusion culture has to be performed. By a gas inlet and outlet the desired gas composition is transported to a spiral of silicone tube containing the culture medium. Between the wall of the silicone tube gas is exchanged. (b) A gas expander module is used for the elimination of gas bubbles during transport of culture medium. Medium with gas bubbles is entering at the inlet and has to pass a barrier. Here the medium expands and bubbles are separated. Finally medium is leaving the container bubble-free but gas-saturated.]]

==Elimination of harmful gas bubbles==
Performing perfusion culture experiments it always has to be considered that gas bubbles are forming during slow transport of culture medium. They arise during suction of medium in the storage bottle, during transport within the tube, during distribution within the culture container and during elimination on the way to the waste bottle. Due to unknown reasons gas bubbles accumulate especially at material transitions between tubes, connectors and perfusion containers. First these gas bubbles are so small that they cannot be observed with the human eye, but during ongoing transport of culture medium they increase in size and are able to form an [[embolus]] that massively impedes medium flow. Within a culture container gas bubbles are leading to a regional shortage of medium supply and are causing breaks in the fluid continuum so that massive [[fluid pressure]] changes result. In a gradient perfusion culture container, where two media are transported at exactly the same speed, embolic effects can lead to pressure differences destroying in turn the contained epithelial barrier [5,9].

To avoid the concentration of gas bubbles within a perfusion culture experiment, a gas expander module was developed (Fig. 6b). This module removes gas bubbles from the medium during transport.  When medium is entering the gas expander module, it rises within a small reservoir and expands before it drops down a barrier. During this process gas bubbles are separated from the medium at the top of the gas expander module. In consequence, medium leaving the container is oxygen-saturated but free of gas bubbles [8,9].
 
[[File:Minusheet Figure 7.jpg|thumb|alt=Figure 7|Figure 7: Perfusion culture set-up with an epithelium inside a gradient perfusion culture container. A thermo plate maintains the desired temperature of 37°C. To provide the luminal and basal side of the contained epithelium with nutrition and respiratory gas, two channels of a peristaltic pump transport a red and a clear medium at exactly the same rate of 1.25 ml/h from a storage bottle (left side) to the waste bottle (right side). For elimination of gas bubbles during transport of medium a gas expander module is placed before the gradient container.]]

==Broad spectrum of applications==
In the last years numerous papers were published dealing with the Minusheet perfusion culture system. The wide spectrum illustrates that the modular system was applied to generate specialized tissues in excellent cell biological quality used in tissue engineering, [[biomaterial]] research and advanced pharmaceutical [[drug toxicity]] testing. A complete list of these applications is found in the data bank ‘Proceedings in perfusion culture’ (see 'External links').
   
As demonstrated by numerous patents (DE 39 23 279, DE 42 00 446, DE 42 08 805, DE 44 43 902, DE 19530 556, DE 196 48 876 C2, DE 199 52 847 B4, US 5 190 878, US 5 316 945, US 5 665 599, J 2847669, DE 10 2005 002 938, PA 10 2004 054 125.6, PA 10 2005 001 747.9, patents pending) Will W. Minuth has invented the presented Minusheet perfusion culture system.

Numerous pilot experiments with the Minusheet perfusion culture system were performed in the last years by Lucia Denk and Will W. Minuth. The experimental work is presently focusing on the creation of an artificial polyester interstitium to repair injured renal parenchyma.

In 1992 the Minusheet perfusion culture system received the Philip Morris research award ‘Challenge of the Future’ in [[Munich]], Germany. The award was handed over by [[Henry Kissinger]], Hans Joachim Friedrichs and [[Paul Müller (biologist)|Paul Müller]].

To introduce the Minusheet perfusion culture system on the market, Katharina Lorenz-Minuth founded non-profit orientated Minucells and Minutissue Vertriebs GmbH (D-93077 Bad Abbach/Germany).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18996">'''Neoabolitionist''' (or '''neo-abolitionist''' or '''new abolitionism''') is  a term used in [[historiography]] to characterize historians of race relations motivated by the spirit of racial equality typified by the abolitionists who fought to abolish slavery in the mid-19th century.  They write especially about [[African-American]] history, slavery, the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]].

As abolitionists had worked in the 19th century to end slavery and provide equal rights under the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] to blacks, the new activists worked to enforce constitutional rights for all citizens and restore equality under the law for African Americans, including [[suffrage]] and [[civil rights]].

In the late 20th century some historians emphasized the worlds of African Americans in their own words, in their own communities, to recognize them as agents, not victims. Publishing in the mid-1960s and through the 20th century, a new generation of historians began to revise traditional accounts of slavery in the United States, reconstruction, [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] laws. Some major historians began to apply the term "neoabolitionist" to such historians, and some of this group identified as such.

==Early 20th century: Dunning School==
{{main|Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)}}
Many early 20th-century histories of the abolitionists and of the Reconstruction Era gave harsh assessments to the movement and the attempts by the federal government to force a transition in the South to a new social system. For instance, what was called the [[Dunning School]], an influential group of white historians led by [[William Archibald Dunning]] at [[Columbia University]], assessed Reconstruction as marred by African-American participation, saying that all the state legislatures were dominated by freedmen, that they were incompetent to govern; that they had been misled by northern carpetbaggers; and that these governments of the postwar decades were unusually corrupt.

In the 19th century after Reconstruction, former abolitionists, especially [[African American]]s such as [[Frederick Douglass]], presented positive views of its achievements: gaining of [[civil rights]] for African Americans, and expanded [[suffrage]] to include poor whites. In the early 20th century, [[Fisk University]] historian [[Alrutheus Taylor]] described the period of Reconstruction in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] in several books and articles. [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a leading Marxist historian, published his ''Black Reconstruction in America'' in 1935, challenging the Dunning School. Du Bois stressed biracial cooperation and noted the achievements of biracial Reconstruction legislatures: establishment of public education in the South for the first time, founding of hospitals, asylums, and charitable institutions to improve general welfare. He said the higher taxes were needed to finance the new infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Milton Stampp|author2=Leon F. Litwack, eds.|title=Reconstruction: An Anthology of Revisionist Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__OQ__dLw-MC&amp;pg=PA221|year=1969|publisher=Louisiana State UP|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New views of race and slavery==
Beginning in the 1960s, historians writing about slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, emphasized the human advancement achieved by the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of those who had been enslaved. Historians such as [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] and [[Martin Duberman]] admired the abolitionists and wrote studies of them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Duberman, ed. ''The Antislavery Vanguard: New Essays on the Abolitionists'' 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Through the later 20th century, such historians as David W. Blight,&lt;ref name=Blight&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David W. Blight]]|title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory|year=2001|publisher=Belknap Press; |isbn=0-674-00819-7 |pages=2&amp;ndash;3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Les Benedict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michael Les Benedict]]|title=A Compromise of Principle: Congressional Republicans and Reconstruction, 1863-1869|year=1974|publisher=Norton, W. W. &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=0-393-05524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; James McPherson, [[John Hope Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Hope Franklin]] with Alfred Moss|title=From Slavery to Freedom. A History of African Americans|edition=8th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2001|isbn=0-07-112058-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Hahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Steven Hahn]]|title=A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-674-01765-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; marshalled documentation to reject the Dunning School notion that the Reconstruction era was overwhelmingly corrupt. They evaluated the postwar period as not more corrupt than many times of social change and turmoil in American history.

[[John Hope Franklin]]  argued that Reconstruction had positive elements: most significantly, the [[enfranchisement]] of African Americans, both those already free before the war and former slaves; the extension of citizenship and civil rights to four million African Americans; and the introduction of public schools throughout the South where such schools generally had not existed. Franklin, for example, points to the founding of [[Howard University|Howard]] and [[Fisk University|Fisk]], [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black universities]] that educated generations, as two major successes of Reconstruction.

They went far beyond that in looking at slavery in detail, with changes in ideas about relations between masters and enslaved, and the various forms of resistance the latter used. The development of African-American communities, education and political culture has been intensively studied.

Historians argued that depriving African Americans of suffrage and civil rights, as was done in the South following Reconstruction, was itself a terrible form of corruption. They considered it a violation of the tenets of [[representative government]], as African Americans had been effectively excluded from political participation and public life for decades.

In his 1988 book [[Eric Foner]] dated the beginning of Reconstruction in 1863, emphasizing the significance of emancipation and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. His title, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'' (1988), emphasized the "unfinished" theme in its subtitle, explicitly connecting Reconstruction to the [[American Revolution]], which had been based on ideas about human liberty and equality. His work suggested that Reconstruction had not completed the work of providing equality and rights to all American citizens, even after constitutional amendments to provide freedmen with citizenship. That work was continuing in the 20th century. His book was published after the civil rights movement gained federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights of suffrage and equal treatment under the law for African Americans and overturn state discrimination.

* In 2014, historian Yonatan Eyal argued that starting in the 1950s with Kenneth Stampp "the neo-abolitionist school diametrically flipped the views of the revisionists.

By 2008, Eyal continues: "More Americans identify with the Civil War as a struggle for a 'new birth of freedom,' rather than for the Union, and neo-abolitionist historiography has contributed to that sense over the past several decades."&lt;ref&gt;Yonatan Eyal, "Franklin Pierce, Democratic Partisan ," in [[Joel H.

 | quote = For the purposes of this book we decided to take a conservative approach, and to focus on the relationship between pitch and musical melodies.  Following the earlier ASA definition, we define pitch as 'that attribute of sensation whose variation is associated with musical melodies.' Although some might find this too restrictive, an advantage of this definition is that it provides a clear procedure for testing whether or not a stimulus evokes a pitch, and a clear limitation on the range of stimuli that we need to consider in our discussions.

Pitch may be quantified as a [[frequency]], but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustical]] attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system.&lt;ref name=hartmann&gt;{{Cite book| title = Signals, Sound, and Sensation | last= Hartmann |first= William Morris| publisher = Springer | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-1-56396-283-7 | pages = 145, 284, 287 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3N72rIoTHiEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=William+M.+Hartmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of pitch==

===Pitch and frequency===
Pitch is an auditory sensation in which a listener assigns [[musical tone]]s to relative positions on a [[musical scale]] based primarily on their perception of the [[frequency]] of vibration.&lt;ref name=plack&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific attribute that can be measured. Pitch is each person's ''subjective perception'' of a sound wave, which cannot be directly measured. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower.

The [[oscillations]] of sound waves can often be characterized in terms of ''frequency''. ''Pitches'' are usually &lt;u&gt;associated with&lt;/u&gt;, and thus &lt;u&gt;quantified as&lt;/u&gt;, ''frequencies'' (in cycles per second, or hertz), by comparing the sounds being assessed against sounds with [[pure tone]]s (ones with [[Period (physics)|periodic]], [[sinusoidal]] waveforms). Complex and aperiodic sound waves can often be assigned a ''pitch'' by this method.&lt;ref&gt;

According to the [[American National Standards Institute]], pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high. Since pitch is such a close [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] for frequency, it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity, or [[amplitude]], of the wave. That is, "high" pitch means very rapid oscillation, and "low" pitch corresponds to slower oscillation. Despite that, the [[idiom]] relating vertical height to sound pitch is shared by most languages.&lt;ref name="pratt1930"/&gt; At least in English, it is just one of many deep conceptual metaphors that involve up/down. The exact etymological history of the musical sense of high and low pitch is still unclear. There is evidence that humans do actually perceive that the source of a sound is slightly higher or lower in vertical space when the sound frequency is increased or reduced.&lt;ref name="pratt1930"&gt;Carroll C. Pratt, "[http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/pratt30.htm The Spatial Character of High and Low Tones]", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' 13 (1930): 278–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the pitch of complex sounds such as [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[musical note]]s corresponds very nearly to the repetition rate of periodic or nearly-periodic sounds, or to the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the time interval between repeating similar events in the sound waveform.&lt;ref name=goldstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=lyon/&gt;

The pitch of complex tones can be ambiguous, meaning that two or more different pitches can be perceived, depending upon the observer.&lt;ref name=hartmann/&gt; When the actual [[fundamental frequency]] can be precisely determined through physical measurement, it may differ from the perceived pitch because of [[overtones]], also known as upper partials, [[harmonic]] or otherwise. A complex tone composed of two sine waves of 1000 and 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz may sometimes be heard as up to three pitches: two spectral pitches at 1000 and 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz, derived from the physical frequencies of the pure tones, and the [[combination tone]] at 200&amp;nbsp;Hz, corresponding to the repetition rate of the waveform. In a situation like this, the percept at 200&amp;nbsp;Hz is commonly referred to as the [[missing fundamental]], which is often the [[greatest common divisor]] of the frequencies present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=David A.|author2=Dale Purves|title=Pitch Is Determined by Naturally Occurring Periodic Sounds|journal=Hearing Research|date=May 2004|volume=194|issue=1–2|pages=31–46|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2004.01.019|pmid=15276674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitch depends to a lesser degree on the [[sound pressure]] level (loudness, volume) of the tone, especially at frequencies below 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz and above 2,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The pitch of lower tones gets lower as sound pressure increases. For instance, a tone of 200&amp;nbsp;Hz that is very loud seems one semitone lower in pitch than if it is just barely audible. Above 2,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the pitch gets higher as the sound gets louder.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; These results were obtained in the pioneering works by S.Stevens &lt;ref name=stevens1935&gt;Stevens S. S. The relation of pitch to intensity//J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. 1935. Vol. 6. P. 150-154.&lt;/ref&gt; and W.Snow &lt;ref name=snow&gt; Snow W. B. (1936) Change of Pitch with Loudness at Low Frequencies. J. Acoust. Soc. Am/ 8:14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;. Later investigations, i.e. by A.Cohen, had shown that in most cases the apparent pitch shifts were not significantly different from pitch‐matching errors. When averaged, the remaining shifts followed the directions of Stevens' curves but were small (2% or less by frequency, i.e. not more than a semitone)&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;Cohen, A. (1961).

===Theories of pitch perception===

[[Scientific theory|Theories]] of pitch perception try to explain how the physical sound and specific physiology of the auditory system work together to yield the experience of pitch. In general, pitch perception theories can be divided into [[Place theory (hearing)|place coding]] and [[Temporal theory (hearing)|temporal coding]]. Place theory holds that the perception of pitch is determined by the place of maximum excitation on the [[basilar membrane]].

A place code, taking advantage of the [[tonotopy]] in the auditory system, must be in effect for the perception of high frequencies, since neurons have an upper limit on how fast they can phase-lock their [[action potential]]s.&lt;ref name=plack /&gt; However, a purely place-based theory cannot account for the accuracy of pitch perception in the low and middle frequency ranges.

Temporal theories offer an alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action potentials, mostly the [[Circle map|phase-locking]] and [[Arnold tongue#Mode locking|mode-locking]] of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus.

===Just-noticeable difference===

The ''[[just-noticeable difference|just-noticeable difference (jnd)]]'' (the [[Sensory threshold|threshold]] at which a change is perceived) depends on the tone's frequency content.  Below 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, the jnd is about 3&amp;nbsp;Hz for sine waves, and 1&amp;nbsp;Hz for complex tones; above 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the jnd for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 [[Cent (music)|cents]]).&lt;ref&gt;

The '''jnd''' is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F.

===Aural illusions===

The relative perception of pitch can be fooled, resulting in ''[[aural illusion]]s''. There are several of these, such as the [[tritone paradox]], but most notably the [[Shepard scale]], where a continuous or discrete sequence of specially formed tones can be made to sound as if the sequence continues ascending or descending forever.

==Definite and indefinite pitch== &lt;!--[[Definite pitch]], "Indefinite pitch", and "Indeterminate pitch" all redirect to this section heading--&gt;

Not all musical instruments make notes with a clear pitch. The [[unpitched percussion instrument]] (a class of [[percussion instrument]]) does not produce particular pitches. A sound or note of '''definite pitch''' is one where a listener can possibly (or relatively easily) discern the pitch. Sounds with definite pitch have [[harmonic]] [[frequency spectrum|frequency spectra]] or close to harmonic spectra.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;

A sound generated on any instrument produces many modes of vibration that occur simultaneously. A listener hears numerous frequencies at once. The vibration with the lowest frequency is called the ''[[fundamental frequency]]''; the other frequencies are ''[[overtones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | quote = "The one with the slowest vibration rate—the one lowest in pitch—is referred to as the fundamental frequency, and the others are collectively called overtones."}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Harmonics]]'' are an important class of overtones with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental. Whether or not the higher frequencies are integer multiples, they are collectively called the [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partials]], referring to the different parts that make up the total spectrum.

A sound or note of '''indefinite pitch''' is one that a listener finds impossible or relatively difficult to identify as to pitch. Sounds with indefinite pitch do not have harmonic spectra or have altered harmonic spectra—a characteristic known as [[inharmonicity]].

It is still possible for two sounds of indefinite pitch to clearly be higher or lower than one another. For instance, a [[snare drum]] sounds higher pitched than a [[bass drum]] though both have indefinite pitch, because its sound contains higher frequencies. In other words, it is possible and often easy to roughly discern the relative pitches of two sounds of indefinite pitch, but sounds of indefinite pitch do not neatly correspond to any specific pitch.
A special type of pitch often occurs in free nature when sound reaches the ear of an observer directly from the source, and also after reflecting off a sound-reflecting surface. This phenomenon is called ''[[repetition pitch]]'', because the addition of a true repetition of the original sound to itself is the basic prerequisite.

==Pitch standards and Standard pitch==

{{Main|Concert pitch}}

A pitch standard (also [[Concert pitch]]) is the conventional pitch reference a group of [[musical instrument]]s are tuned to for a performance. Concert pitch may vary from ensemble to ensemble, and has varied widely over musical history.

{{listen|filename=Sine wave 440.ogg|title=440&amp;nbsp;Hz}}

Standard pitch is a more widely accepted convention. The '''A''' above [[middle C]] is usually set at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz (often written as "A = [[A440 (pitch standard)|440&amp;nbsp;Hz]]" or sometimes "A440"), although other frequencies, such as 442&amp;nbsp;Hz, are also often used as variants. Another standard pitch, the so-called ''Baroque pitch'', has been set in the 20th century as A = 415&amp;nbsp;Hz—approximately an equal-tempered semitone lower than A440 to facilitate transposition.

[[Transposing instruments]] have their origin in the variety of pitch standards. In modern times, they conventionally have their [[Part (music)|parts]] transposed into different [[key signatures|keys]] from voices and other instruments (and even from each other). As a result, musicians need a way to refer to a particular pitch in an unambiguous manner when talking to each other.

For example, the most common type of [[clarinet]] or [[trumpet]], when playing a note written in their [[Part (music)|part]] as C, sounds a pitch that is called B{{music|flat}} on a non-transposing instrument like a violin (which indicates that at one time these wind instruments played at a standard pitch a tone lower than violin pitch). To refer to that pitch unambiguously, a musician calls it ''concert B{{music|flat}}'', meaning, "...the pitch that someone playing a non-transposing instrument like a violin calls B{{music|flat}}."

==Labeling pitches==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
{{for|a comprehensive list of frequencies of musical notes|Scientific pitch notation|Frequencies of notes}}
[[File:Music frequency diatonic scale-3.svg|thumb|350px|right|Note frequencies, four-octave C major diatonic scale, starting with [[C (musical note)|C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]].]]
Pitches are labeled using:
* Letters, as in [[Helmholtz pitch notation]]&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Grove Dictionary of Music: ''[http://www.answers.com/topic/hermann-von-helmholtz Hermann von Helmholtz], Oxford University Press (1994), ''Answers.com''. Retrieved 3 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helmholtz|first1=Hermann|title=On the Sensations of Tone (English Translation)|date=1885|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CiqYQXZjIYC&amp;pg=PA15|isbn=9781602066397}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A combination of letters and numbers—as in [[scientific pitch notation]], where notes are labelled upwards from C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the 16&amp;nbsp;Hz C
* Numbers that represent the frequency in [[hertz]] (Hz), the number of cycles per second
For example, one might refer to the A above middle C as ''a′'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''440&amp;nbsp;Hz''. In standard Western [[equal temperament]], the notion of pitch is insensitive to "spelling": the description "G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; double sharp" refers to the same pitch as ''A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''; in other temperaments, these may be distinct pitches.
Human perception of musical intervals is approximately logarithmic with respect to [[fundamental frequency]]: the perceived interval between the pitches "A220" and "A440" is the same as the perceived interval between the pitches ''A440'' and ''A880''.  Motivated by this logarithmic perception, music theorists sometimes represent pitches using a numerical scale based on the logarithm of fundamental frequency.  For example, one can adopt the widely used [[MIDI]] standard to map fundamental frequency, ''f'', to a real number, ''p'', as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
p = 69 + 12\times\log_2 { \left(\frac {f}{440 \mbox{ Hz}} \right) }
&lt;/math&gt;
This creates a linear [[pitch space]] in which octaves have size 12, semitones (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and A440 is assigned the number 69. (See [[Frequencies of notes]].) Distance in this space corresponds to musical intervals as understood by musicians. An equal-tempered semitone is subdivided into 100 [[Cent (music)|cents]]. The system is flexible enough to include "microtones" not found on standard piano keyboards. For example, the pitch halfway between C (60) and C{{music|sharp}} (61) can be labeled 60.5.

The following table shows frequencies in Hz for notes in various octaves, named according to the [[Helmholtz pitch notation#Staff representation|"German method" of octave nomenclature]]:

==Scales==

The relative pitches of individual notes in a [[scale (music)|scale]] may be determined by one of a number of [[musical tuning|tuning]] systems. In the west, the twelve-note [[chromatic scale]] is the most common method of organization, with [[equal temperament]] now the most widely used method of tuning that scale. In it, the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale is exactly the twelfth root of two (or about 1.05946). In [[well temperament|well-tempered]] systems (as used in the time of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], for example), different methods of [[musical tuning]] were used. Almost all of these systems have one [[interval (music)|interval]] in common, the [[octave]], where the pitch of one note is double the frequency of another. For example, if the A above middle C is 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, the A an octave above that is {{Audio-nohelp|Tone 880Hz.ogg|880&amp;nbsp;Hz}}.

==Other musical meanings of pitch==

In [[atonal]], [[twelve tone technique|twelve tone]], or [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] a "pitch" is a specific frequency while a [[pitch class]] is all the octaves of a frequency. In many analytic discussions of atonal and post-tonal music, pitches are named with [[integer]]s because of octave and enharmonic equivalency (for example, in a serial system, C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|flat}} are considered the same pitch, while C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; are functionally the same, one octave apart).

Discrete pitches, rather than continuously variable pitches, are virtually universal, with exceptions including "[[Shout-and-fall|tumbling strains]]"&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In ''The Wellsprings of Music'', edited by J. Kunst. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff. Cited in Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and "indeterminate-pitch chants".&lt;ref&gt;Malm, W.P. (1967). ''Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and Asia''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. Cited in Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Gliding pitches are used in most cultures, but are related to the discrete pitches they reference or embellish.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Edward M. (1999).

'''Post literacy''' or '''post literacy education''' is a concept used in [[continuing education]] and [[adult education]] programs aimed at recently [[illiterate]] or "neo-literate" adults and communities, largely in the [[developing world]]. Unlike continuing education or [[further education]], which covers secondary or vocational topics for adult learners, Post literacy programs provide skills which might otherwise be provided in [[primary education]] settings.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Alan.

A '''programmable load''' is a type of test equipment or instrument which emulates DC or AC resistance loads normally required to perform functional tests of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[power supply|power supplies]] or [[solar cells]]. By virtue of being programmable, tests like [[load regulation]], [[Battery (electricity)#Battery capacity and discharging|battery discharge]] curve measurement and [[Transient (oscillation)|transient tests]] can be fully automated and load changes for these tests can be made without introducing switching transient that might change the measurement or operation of the power source under test.

== Implementation ==
In a sense, a fully programmable load is simply a programmable power supply that applies a voltage and sinks current (absorbing power) or sources current (transferring power). This is necessary to simulate real loads where there are moments when current and voltage have polarity which makes the load appear to act as a ''source'' of power; for example, circuits with capacitive or inductive elements when an AC or varying DC is applied; see [[power factor]]. By being able to change the current direction, the programmable load schematically will still "look like" a programmable resistor while still being a programmable ([[Thévenin's theorem|Thévenin]]) voltage source.

However, most commercially available "electronic DC loads" or "programmable DC loads" on the market cannot source power, since by being DC loads, by strict definition, they do not need to. (They are not power supplies), being only able to absorb power (sinking current from a positive voltage, or sourcing to a negative voltage). These most commonly use one transistor/FET, or an array of parallel connected transistors/FETs for more current handling, to act as a variable resistor. Internal circuitry in the equipment monitors the actual current through the transistor/FET, compares it to a user-programmed desired current, and through an error amplifier changes the drive voltage to the transistor/FET to dynamically change its resistance. This 'negative feedback' results in the actual current always matching the programmed desired current, regardless of other changes in the supplied voltage or other variables. Of course, if the power source is not able to supply the desired amount of current, the DC load equipment cannot furnish the difference; it can restrict current to a level, but it cannot boost current to a higher level. Most commercial DC loads are equipped with microprocessor front end circuits that allow the user to not only program a desired current through the load ('constant current' or CC), but the user can alternatively program the load to have a constant resistance (CR) or constant power dissipation (CP).

Advanced DC Programmable loads offer additional test capabilities with internal controls that can detect oscillations within a fraction of a second and immediately stabilize the load profile. By eliminating the effects of oscillation and current spikes a programmable load can protect against damage to your mission critical electronics.

Electronic load testing systems for defense, aerospace, commercial electronics and utilities industries, as well as for mega data center performance often require special modes of operation such as constant voltage, constant current, constant resistance and constant power. For some demanding applications, these electronic load banks may offer fast slew rates and pulsed load profiles such as sine, square, triangle and ramp as well as internal capacitance, inductance, and time delay modes of operation. Today's most advanced programmable loads typically offer 16bit measurement and drive accuracy for superior performance.

'''Range rate''' defines a signed scalar value describing the time rate of change of the range (distance) between two locations.

==Derivation==

Given a differentiable vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} \epsilon \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; defining the instantaneous position of a target relative to an observer.

Let

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the target with respect to the observer. 

The magnitude of the position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;||\mathbf{r}|| = \langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{r} \rangle^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The quantity range rate is the time [[derivative]] of the magnitude ([[Norm (mathematics)|norm]]) of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, expressed as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d||\mathbf{r}||}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Substituting ({{EquationNote|2}}) into ({{EquationNote|3}})

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d||\mathbf{r}||}{dt} = \frac{d \langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{r} \rangle^{1/2} }{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the derivative of the right-hand-side

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d||\mathbf{r}||}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}  \frac{d \langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{r} \rangle}{dt}  \frac{1}{\langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{r} \rangle^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d||\mathbf{r}||}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}  \frac{\langle \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt},\mathbf{r} \rangle + \langle \mathbf{r},\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \rangle}{\langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{r} \rangle^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

using ({{EquationNote|1}}) the expression becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d||\mathbf{r}||}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}  \frac{\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{r} \rangle+\langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{v} \rangle}{\langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{r} \rangle^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Kunzel|first2=Ray|year=1971|title=Linear Algebra|edition=Second|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|page=271|isbn=0135367972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{r} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{v} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

With

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}} =\frac{ \mathbf{r} }{\langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{r} \rangle^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

The range rate is simply defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d||\mathbf{r}||}{dt} = \frac{\langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{v} \rangle}{\langle \mathbf{r},\mathbf{r} \rangle^{1/2}} = \langle \hat{\mathbf{r}},\mathbf{v} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

the projection of the observer to target velocity vector onto the &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; unit vector.

A singularity exists for coincident observer target, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, range rate does not exist as &lt;math&gt;||\mathbf{r}|| = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''semiotic square''', also known as the '''Greimas square''', is a tool used in structural analysis of the relationships between [[semiotic]] [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] through the opposition of concepts, such as feminine-masculine or beautiful-ugly, and of extending the relevant ontology.

The semiotic square, derived from Aristotle's logical [[square of opposition]], was developed by [[Algirdas J. Greimas]], a [[France|French]]-[[Lithuania]]n [[linguist]] and semiotician, who considered the semiotic square to be the elementary structure of meaning.

Greimas first presented the square in ''Semantique Structurale'' (1966), a book which was later published as ''Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method'' (1983).  He further developed the semiotic square with Francois Rastier in "The Interaction of Semiotic Constraints" (1968).

== Basic structure ==

The Greimas Square is a model based on relationships:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structure
! Relationship Type
! Relationship Elements
|-
| Complex
| Contrary
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Neutral
| Contrary
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Schema 1
| Contradiction
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Schema 2
| Contradiction
| S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Deixes 1
| Implication
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Deixes 2
| Implication
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

*S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = positive [[seme (semantics)|seme]]
*S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = negative seme
*S = complex axis (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
*~S = neutral axis (neither S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nor S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
# The Semiotic Square is formed by an initial binary relationship between two contrary signs. S&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;is considered to be the assertion/positive element and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the negation/negative element in the binary pair:
# The second binary relationship is now created on the ~S axis.  ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be the complex term, and ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the neutral term. This is where the principle of difference is brought into play: every element in a system is defined by its differences from the other elements. 
# In most modes of interpretation, the S-axis is a hyponym of the ~S-axis.  The ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; element combines aspects of S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is also contradictory to S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; . The ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; element contains aspects of neither S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nor S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; .
# Finally, the ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; element can be identified. Considered to be "always the most critical position and the one that remains open or empty the longest time, for its identification completes the process and in that sense constitutes the most creative act of the construction.".&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric. 1987. "Foreword." ''On Meaning: Selected Writings.'' Algirdas Julien Greimas. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. pg. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

Starting from a given opposition of concepts S1 and S2, the semiotic square entails first the existence of two other concepts, namely ~S1 and ~S2, which are in the following relationships:

* S1 and S2: opposition
* S1 and ~S1, S2 and ~S2: contradiction
* S1 and ~S2, S2 and ~S1: complementarity

The semiotic square also produces, second, so-called meta-concepts, which are compound ones, the most important of which are:

* S1 and S2
* neither S1 nor S2

For example, from the pair of opposite concepts masculine-feminine, we get:

* S1: masculine
* S2: feminine
* ~S1: not-masculine
* ~S2: not-feminine
* S1 and S2: masculine and feminine, i.e. hermaphrodite, gender-fluid
* neither S1 nor S2: neither masculine nor feminine, agender

== Styles of interpretation ==

The Greimas Square is a tool used within the system of semiotics.
*As such, one form of interpretation is to look at each of the elements: S1, S2, ~S1, and ~S2 as either developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (bi-modal) or [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (tripartite) sign.
*In the Peircean system of semiotics, the [[interpretant]] becomes the representamen for another, interrelated sign. In this same way, each of the elements of the Semiotic Square (S1, S2, ~S1, and ~S2) can become an element in a new, interrelated square.
*Finally, Greimas suggests placing semiotic squares of associated meaning on top of one another to create a layered effect and another form of analysis and interpretation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The square is a map of logical possibilities. As such, it can be used as a heuristic device, and in fact, attempting to fill it in stimulates the imagination. The puzzle pieces, especially the neutral term, seldom fall conveniently into place … playing with the possibilities of the square is authorized since the theory of the square allows us to see all thinking as a game, with the logical relations as the rules and concepts current in a given language and culture as the pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Katilius-Boydstun, Marvin. 1990. “The Semiotics of A.J. Greimas: An Introduction,” Litanus: Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences. 36(3).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils''''' ({{lang-de|The Taboo of Homosexuality: The History of a Prejudice}}) is a standard work of Germanophone research into [[homophobia]], written by German sociologist, ethnologist, and sexologist [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]], and first published in 1978.

== Background ==

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg used the better part of the 1970s in order to complete ''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils'' (reprinted in 1981, then leaving out the word ''Tabu'' from its title) as beside drawing from scholars such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Marija Gimbutas]], and [[Michel Foucault]], she conducted sociological research on homophobia and homosexuality, and translated previously unavailable or neglected artifacts and records from dead languages for the first time.

== Authority ==

''Tabu Homosexualität'' is considered a foundational standard work in Germanophone research into homophobia, misogyny, patriarchy, general repression of sensuality and particularly repression of sexual deviance (''Leibfeindlichkeit'').&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen, Wolfgang (1980).

== Content ==

=== Introducing chapters ===

In the prefacing ''Einführung'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg deals with the post-WWII mitigation of German laws forbidding same-sex activities, and her motivations for researching the issue of homophobia, an undertaking whereupon she came upon increasingly earlier and earlier manifestations each inspiring countless cultural derivations of this hatred.

In order to give an idea of the old age of negative prejudices directed against same-sex activities in the West, in Chapter I, ''Alte Nachrichten über die ethische Bewertung der männlichen Homosexualität bei germanischen Stämmen'' ("Ancient sources on the ethical evaluation of male homosexuality by Germanic tribes"), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg mainly discusses many ancient European writers (mostly Greek and Roman) denouncingly accusing other tribes and nations across Europe as tolerant towards same-sex activities as was a common form of slander in Classical Antiquity, the absurdity of which is emphasized by the fact that writers of accused groups often accused the accuser's nation of the same thing even if ignorant of the original accusation hauled towards themselves. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thereby also demonstrates the strong [[numinous]] taboo regarding same-sex activities making them a near-unmentionable vice, as no rational explanation for this ostracization is ever provided, these activities are invariably depicted as negative ''in themselves''.

Only three exceptions are mentioned where the purpose of slander is not immediately obvious: Greek philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] in the third volume of his ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' mentioned a tribe of ''Karmans'' among whom "lewdness between men ''[...]'', as is said, is not regarded as abominable but just like any ordinary thing". Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg identifies it as one of many examples of Sextus Empiricus's often-used rhethoric device of applying the most absurd properties to people, places, and other objects simply for the purpose of demonstrating basic rules of logic. The second exception is a note by [[Posidonius]], quoted in [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', on [[Celts|Celtic]] sleeping customs which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg attributes to a misunderstanding of traditional separation of the sexes in daily life.

The third is an analysis of the common modern scholarly debate around the ritual killing of criminals regarded as altogether ''ignavi et imbellis et corpore infames'' ("cowardly, unbelligerent, and perverted") by proto-historic [[Germanic peoples|Germanics]] as mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', whereupon Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg first remarks that the complex issue of common Western homophobia as apparent in the presented material must be analyzed at a wider, more interdisciplinarian scope.

=== Ethnic and cultural background: The Three Strata of Indo-European society ===

According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural anthropology, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society.

Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural [[stratum|strata]] (see [[stratification (archeology)]], [[social stratification]], and [[archaeological horizon]]) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures. These three successive strata were the following:

*The Stone Age ''Subarctic Shamanic Culture'' of the [[last glacial period]] (called ''Würm'' regarding the Alps region, ''Weichsel'' regarding Scandinavia, and ''Devensian'' regarding the British Isles) ending c. 9,000 BCE,
*the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' of European and Middle East [[Bronze Age]], introducing farming and practicing [[fertility rite|fertility cults]] including sexual rites (c. 9.000 BCE to c. 3.000 BCE; roughly equivalent to Gimbutas's ''"[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]"''),
*and the violent West-bound conquest of these regions by belligerent Proto-Indo-European tribes from Asia (see [[Bronze Age collapse]], [[Kurgan hypothesis]], and [[Æsir-Vanir War#Theories]]), beginning around the end of the fourth millennium BCE, introducing domestication of animals (particularly horses for purposes of work, mobility, and especially warfare) and cattle breeding, and initiating the Indo-European [[Iron Age]] in Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Not all subsequent Indo-European or Indo-European-influenced cultures adopted or retained Indo-European languages. For instance, Semitic cultures never adopted an Indo-European language in spite of the obvious belligerent, sensually repressive Indo-European influence found in Abrahamitic and Semitic cultures. See Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's 1990 work ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'' based in this respect mainly on [[:de:Reinhard Schmoeckel|Reinhard Schmoeckel]]'s ''Indogermanistik'' research.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Three-age system]]. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg interprets these three strata as relating to the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] by [[Georges Dumézil]], of classic Indo-European society consisting of three distinct classes, clerical (= Shamanic), agricultural, and warrior. Yet other than Dumézil, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not regard all three of these components as genuinely Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European. Instead, in regard of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] and what Gimbutas saw as "[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg considers these three components as the result of successive superimposition of what originally were the above-mentioned three different cultures, with Indo-European culture in Europe and the Middle East since the Iron Age as the result. See [[Proto-Indo-European society]] for details.

The immediate cause of Indo-European homophobia, misogyny, and patriarchy was an ethnocentric culture shock when Proto-Indo-European tribes encountered the highly sensual ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' in general, and particularly last traces of Shamanic ritual transvestism and sex change absorbed within this culture. In proto-historic Norse culture for instance, the resulting [[religious stratification]] emerged as the cultural strata of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' and the subsequently dominant Indo-European influence respectively transformed into maternal, fertility [[Vanir]] and belligerent, patriarchal [[Æsir]] religion, with the mythological [[Æsir-Vanir War]] as a distorted cultural memory of Europe's Indo-Europeanization, similar to the story of [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]] in ancient Italy potentially recalling the same proto-historical process.

=== Subsequent derivations within Indo-European societies ===

From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations which exhibited increasing levels of rationalization:

*'''Chapter IV, ''Interdependenzen zwischen religiösen Werten und sozialen Normen bei den Germanen'' ("Interdependencies between religious values and social norms in Germanic culture"):''' Within subsequently dominant Indo-European culture, the originally highly regarded Shamanic priest of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' was ethnocentrically re-interpreted as an evil figure, and the former fertility rites as evil lewd magic. The least rationalized version of the resultant negative archetype of a lewd, non-human freak as apparent in sufficiently surviving artifacts and records is to be found in Norse sources, as the mythological, demonic ''[[Níð|nithing]]'' creature. Due to this lack of rationalization of the archetype's Norse version, it is the most pure, primordial version available to modern research, and the attributes of the ''nithing'' are thus the most easily identifiable among all the archetype's local variations as a negative ethnocentric, mythological re-interpretation of the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum under the circumstances of Indo-European cultural dominance. As explained in further chapters, this socio-cultural archetype of an evil, lewd non-human freak became a profound influence for every aspect about ubiquitous ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) that followed from it in Western civilization.
*'''Chapter V, ''Tendenzen der Beurteilung homosexuellen Verhaltens von der Christianisierung bis zum Beginn der Ketzer- und Hexenverfolgungen'' ("Tendencies in evaluation of homosexual behaviour between Christianisation and the beginning inquisitorial persecution of witches and heretics"), section 1, ''Die römische Gesetzgebung'' ("Roman laws"):''' Capital homophobic tendencies in Ancient Rome as apparent for instance in ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not cover Ancient Greece in depth until her 1990 book ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'', only emphasizing in ''Tabu Homosexualität'' and later works that [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greek pederasty]] does not meet her primary focus for ''Tabu Homosexualität'' of same-sex activities among adult males, as in Ancient Greece, these relations took place between fertile and infertile individuals, by quoting, among other modern scholars and ancient sources, [[Kenneth Dover]]).
*'''Chapter V, section 2, ''Die kirchlichen Bestimmungen'' ("Ecclesiastical regulations"):''' Homophobia apparent in the ancient Jewish culture ([[Leviticus 18]]) and in Early Christianity ([[Saint Paul]], early [[Church Fathers]], and [[penitential]]s) up to the ninth century CE. Here, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg debunks the Biblical origin of the common ''Sodom myth'' created by Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 500s CE who was the first person in the world to claim that [[Genesis 19]] would in any way relate to same-sex activities.
*'''Chapter V, section 3, ''Die gefälschten Kapitulare des Benedictus Levita'' ("The forged capitularies of Benedictus Levita"):''' The Medieval ecclesiastical concept of ''[[sodomy]]'' brought forth by the forged ''[[Benedictus Levita|Capitularia Benedicti Levitae]]'' within ''[[Pseudo-Isidore]]'' (a collection of persuasive false material on theological, legal, and political matters fabricated by [[Franks|Frankish]] monks around 850 CE). During proto-historic Iron Age, the religious fertility rites of the marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum had been ethnocentrically interpreted as the evil, lewd ''seid'' magic of a ''nithing'' in proto-historic Norse and Germanic sources. Referencing Justinian's ''Sodom myth'', Frankish monk Benedictus Levita as the author of the ''Capitularia Benedicti Levitae'' obviously appealed to these prevailing folk beliefs when he strongly associated his idea of ''sodomy'' with evil sorcery, satanism, heathenism, and heresy. Thereby, he also originally incorporated the common Germanic practice of burning ''nithings'' into ecclesiastical law as burning ''sodomites'' and ''witches'' alike at the stake. Prior to Levita, church dogma had denounced belief in witches and burning people out of these pagan beliefs as sinful.
*'''Chapter VI, ''Die Pönalisierung der Homosexualität im Rahmen der Ketzer- und Hexenprozesse des Mittelalters'' ("The penalisation of homosexuality within the Medieval heresy and witch trials"):''' How Levita's ideas were put into practice by creating the Inquisition. Also discusses in-depth the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' as an extension and further popularization of Levita's original ideas on ''sodomites'' and ''witches''.
*'''Chapter VII, ''Weiterentwicklung und Modifizierung des Vorurteils gegen die Homosexualität bis 1870'' ("Further developments and modifications of homophobic prejudice up until 1870"):''' Arriving at the theories of pathology (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg specifically mentions the concept of ''[[moral insanity]]''), corruption, and downfall of the state brought fourth by the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the history of these pseudo-scientific ideologies, and how they were instrumental in prolonging the traditional persecution of sexual deviants, especially homosexuals, in the Western world from the 17th to the 20th century.
*'''Chapter VIII, ''Beeinträchtigung der Erforschung des Vorurteils gegenüber der männlichen Homosexualität durch das Vorurteil selbst'' ("Obliteration of research into homophobic prejudice caused by the very prejudice itself"):''' Socio-psychological analyses of patterns and social dynamics of general and specifically homophobic prejudice and discrimination in Western society, building upon the facts, patterns, and concepts demonstrated in earlier chapters, emphasizing again the cultural impact and significance of Indo-European influence and the Three Strata of Western culture in general. In further detail than in this one chapter, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg would re-visit this academic field of general ''Vorurteilsforschung'' (''prejudice studies'') in her later work ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), in-depth analyzing in full the common patterns of prejudice and discrimination in modern Western society following from the cultural evolution described in ''Tabu Homosexualität''.

=== Relations to other works, by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg and others ===

In ''Mannbarkeitsriten'' (1980) and ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg further chronicles the re-enforcing influence of Western [[colonialism]] when Indo-European cultures began globally expanding from the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[First European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|Age of Conquests]] on, thus explorers and conquerors again came upon Shamanic cultures partly involving ritual fertility and sexual cults, and Europe simultaneously encountered the wide spread of [[syphilis]] through these new cross-cultural contacts just when modern science began to dawn.

These processes also fostered ethnocentric beliefs of Indo-European moral superiority over "uncivilized", sensual, and "filthy" "savages" (see for instance the saying of the ''[[White man's burden]]'' of being morally obliged to "civilize" non-Westerners), social and ethnic "aliens", and marginalized minorities in a complex process of interior socio-psychological, cultural structuring of human sensual desires on the one hand, and foreign political and military colonialism of these desires on the other hand. Thus, in all three books (''Tabu Homosexualität'', ''Mannbarkeitsriten'', and ''Angst und Vorurteil'') Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg alludes to cultural anthropology works such as ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' by [[Hannah Arendt]], Freud's ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', Critical Theory's ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', or ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' by [[Norbert Elias]].

Finally, as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg relates in ''Angst und Vorurteil'', just as colonialism and the rise of syphilis had compromised the [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific Enlightenment]] approach to sexuality, the impact of [[HIV]] corrupted [[Counterculture of the 1960s|post-WWII progressive counterculture]]'s influence on Western society's attitudes towards sexuality.

The '''Tehran Monolingual Corpus''' (TMC) is a large-scale Persian monolingual corpus. TMC is suited for [[Language model|Language Modeling]] and relevant research areas in [[Natural Language Processing]].

The corpus is extracted from [[Hamshahri Corpus]] and [[Iranian Students News Agency|ISNA news agency]] website. The quality of Hamshahri corpus is improved for language modeling purpose by a series of [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]] and spell-checking steps.

TMC comprises more than 250 million words. The total number of unique words (with frequency of two or more) of the corpus is about 300 thousand, which is relatively good for a highly-inflectional language like Persian.

TMC is created by Natural Language Processing Lab of [[University of Tehran]]. The corpus is free for research use, after obtaining permission from the corpus aggregator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">'''The Group''' was an informal but highly influential [[Not-for-profit arts organization|art association]] formed in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] in 1927. Initially begun by ex-students from [[Ilam School of Fine Arts|Canterbury College of Art]], its aim was to provide a freer, more experimental alternative to the academic salon painting exhibitions of the [[Canterbury Society of Arts]]. The Group exhibited annually for 50 years, from 1927 to 1977, and was continuously at the forefront of New Zealand art's [[avant-garde]] scene.

Many of the country's best-known artists were associated at some time with The Group, among them [[Colin McCahon]], [[Doris Lusk]], [[Toss Woollaston]], [[Rita Angus]], [[Olivia Spencer Bower]], [[Leo Bensemann]], [[Rata Lovell-Smith]], [[Philip Trusttum]], and [[Douglas MacDiarmid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 15.  – Canterbury region – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-15|website = www.teara.govt.nz|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en|first = New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last = Taonga}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of The Group extended into other areas of New Zealand culture through the collaborations and friendship of members with the likes of writer and editor [[Charles Brasch]] and composer [[Douglas Lilburn]].&lt;ref name="Bensemann"&gt;http://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/whats-on/leo-bensemann-friends-portraiture-and-the-group&lt;/ref&gt; Its influence was such that it is occasionally referred to as "[[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] South".&lt;ref name="Bensemann"/&gt;

'''Water testing''' is a broad description for various procedures used to analyze [[water quality]]. Millions of water quality tests are carried out daily to fulfill regulatory requirements and to maintain safety.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water testing – pass or fail?|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/10/6/market-insight/water-testing-pass-or-fail.html|publisher=Global Water Intelligence|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing may be performed to evaluate:
* '''ambient or environmental water quality''' – the ability of a [[surface water]] body to support aquatic life as an [[ecosystem]]. ''See'' [[Environmental monitoring]], [[Freshwater environmental quality parameters]] and [[Bioindicator]].
* '''[[wastewater]]''' – characteristics of [[water pollution|polluted water]] (domestic [[sewage]] or [[industrial waste]]) before treatment or after treatment. ''See'' [[Environmental chemistry]] and [[Wastewater quality indicators]].
* '''"[[raw water]]" quality''' – characteristics of a water source prior to treatment for domestic consumption ([[drinking water]]). ''See'' [[Bacteriological water analysis]] and specific tests such as [[turbidity]] and [[hard water]].
* '''"finished" water quality''' – water treated at a municipal [[water purification]] plant. ''See'' [[Bacteriological water analysis]] and [[:Category:Water quality indicators]].
* suitability of water for '''industrial uses''' such as laboratory, manufacturing or [[Water cooling#Industrial usage|equipment cooling]]. ''See'' [[purified water]].

==Government regulation==
Government regulations related to water testing and water quality for some major countries is given below.

===China===

====Ministry of Environmental Protection====
The Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China is the nation's environmental protection department charged with the task of protecting China's air, water, and land from pollution and contamination. Directly under the State Council, it is empowered and required by law to implement environmental policies and enforce environmental laws and regulations. Complementing its regulatory role, it funds and organizes research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEP Mission|url=http://english.mep.gov.cn/About_SEPA/Mission/200803/t20080318_119444.htm|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China]].

====Regulatory challenges and debates====
In late 2009, a survey was carried out by China Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development to assess the water quality of urban supplies in China's cities, which revealed that "at least 1,000" water treatment plants out of more than 4,000 plants surveyed at the county level and above failed to comply with government requirements. The survey results were never formally released to the public, but in 2012, China's Century Weekly published the leaked survey data. In response, Wang Xuening, a health ministry official, released figures derived from a pilot monitoring scheme in 2011 and suggested that 80% of China's urban tap water was up to standard.

China's new drinking water standards involve 106 indicators. Of China's 35 major cities, only 40% of cities have the capacity to test for all 106 indicators. The department in charge of local water and the health administration department will enter into a discussion to determine results for more than 60 of the new measures; hence it is not required to test the water using every indicator. The grading of water quality is based on an overall average of 95% to fulfill government requirements. The frequency of water quality inspections at water treatment plants is twice yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gong|first=Jing|title=What's coming out of China's taps?|url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4962-What-s-coming-out-of-China-s-taps-|publisher=China Dialogue|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===

====Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources====
Established in 1964, the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources aims to conduct, organize, coordinate and promote research in all aspects of water resources. As a national research organization, it undertakes and promotes applied and basic research in different disciplines of water sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About PCRWR|url=http://www.pcrwr.gov.pk/About.aspx|publisher=PCRWR|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent developments====
In March 2013, Minister for Science and Technology Mir Changez Khan Jamali notified the National Assembly that groundwater samples collected revealed that only 15-18% samples were deemed safe for drinking both in urban and rural areas in Pakistan. The Ministry has created 24 Water Quality Testing Laboratories across Pakistan, developed and commercialized water quality test kits, water filters, water disinfection tablets and drinking water treatment sachets, conducted training for 2,660 professionals of water supply agencies and surveyed 10,000 water supply schemes out of a grand total of 12,000 schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=24 water quality testing laboratories set up in country: NA told|url=http://www.brecorder.com/pakistan/industries-a-sectors/110480-24-water-quality-testing-laboratories-set-up-in-country-na-told.html|publisher=Business Recorder|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Drinking Water Inspectorate====
The Drinking Water Inspectorate is a section of Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs set up to regulate the public water supply companies in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking Water Inspectorate Home Page|url=http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water testing in England and Wales can be conducted at the environmental health office at the local authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking water quality|url=http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/drinking-water-quality/index.htm|publisher=DWI|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]].

===United States===

====Department of Homeland Security====
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet department of the United States federal government, created in response to the September 11 attacks, and with the primary responsibilities of protecting the United States of America and U.S. territories (including protectorates) from and responding to terrorist attacks, man-made accidents, and natural disasters. ''See'' [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 designates the Environmental Protection Agency as the sector-specific agency for the water sector's critical infrastructure protection activities.  All Environmental Protection Agency activities related to water security are carried out in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security. Possible threats to water quality include contamination with deadly agents, such as cyanide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Testing and Treatment Reflect the Times|url=http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2004/05/water-testing-and-treatment-reflect-times|publisher=R&amp;D Magazine|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physical attacks like the release of toxic gaseous chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Sector: Critical Infrastructure|url=https://www.dhs.gov/water-sector|publisher=US DHS|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316071920/http://www.dhs.gov/water-sector|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental Protection Agency====
The principal U.S. federal laws governing water testing are the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] and the [[Clean Water Act]]. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issues regulations under each law specifying analytical test methods. EPA' s annual ''Regulatory Agenda'' sets a schedule for specific objectives on improving its oversight of water testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulatory Agendas and Regulatory Plans |url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/regulatory-agendas-and-regulatory-plans |date=2017-05-31 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Drinking water analysis
Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, [[public water system]]s are required to regularly monitor their treated water for contaminants. Water samples must be analyzed using EPA-approved testing methods, by laboratories that are certified by EPA or a state agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/dwanalyticalmethods/learn-about-drinking-water-analytical-methods |title=Learn about Drinking Water Analytical Methods |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-10-02 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/dwlabcert/learn-about-laboratory-certification-drinking-water |title=Learn About Laboratory Certification for Drinking Water |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-10-07 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 revised total coliform rule and the 1989 total coliform rule are the only microbial drinking water regulations that apply to all public water systems. The revised rule highlights the frequency and timing of microbial testing by water systems based on population served, system type, and source water type. It also places a legal limit on the level for ''[[Escherichia coli]].'' Potential health threats must be disclosed to EPA or the appropriate state agency, and public notification is required in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Revised Total Coliform  And Total Coliform Rule |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/revised-total-coliform-rule-and-total-coliform-rule |date=2017-02-24 |website=Drinking Water Requirements for States and Public Water Systems |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for measuring acute toxicity usually take between 24 and 96 hours to identify contaminants in water supplies.&lt;ref name="Performance Verification Testing"&gt;{{cite web |title=Performance Verification Testing |url=http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/watersecurity/upload/2004_04_01_watersecurity_fs_security_rapid-tox.pdf |publisher=EPA |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Wastewater analysis
All facilities in the United States that discharge wastewater to surface waters (e.g. rivers, lakes or coastal waters} must obtain a permit under the [[Clean Water Act#NPDES permits for point sources|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]], a Clean Water Act program administered by EPA and state agencies. The facilities covered include sewage treatment plants, industrial and commercial plants, military bases and other facilities. Most permittees are required to regularly collect wastewater samples and analyze them for compliance with permit requirements, and report the results either to EPA or the state agency.&lt;ref name="NPDES basics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-07-24 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private wells====
Private wells are not regulated by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/privatewells |title=Private Drinking Water Wells |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-06-06 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, private well owners are responsible for testing their wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/testing.html |title=Well Testing |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2010-05-03 |website=Private Wells |publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some state or local governments regulate well construction and may require well testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngwa.org/Professional-Resources/state-info/Pages/default.aspx |title=State Resources |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-12-19 |publisher=National Groundwater Association |location=Westerville, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publication of test methods====
[[Peer review|Peer-reviewed]] test methods have been published by government agencies&lt;ref&gt;For example, EPA Clean Water Act methods for wastewater: "Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants."

====Regulatory challenges and debates====

=====Hydraulic fracturing=====
The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] created a loophole that exempts companies drilling for natural gas from disclosing the chemicals involved in fracturing operations that would normally be required under federal clean water laws. The loophole is commonly known as the "Halliburton loophole" because Dick Cheney, the former chief executive officer of Halliburton, was reportedly instrumental in its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dorner |first=Joshua |title=Cheney's Culture of Deregulation and Corruption |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/06/cheney_deregulation.html |publisher=Center for American Progress |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Safe Drinking Water Act excludes [[hydraulic fracturing]] from the Underground Injection Control regulation in section 1421 (d)(1), the use of diesel fuel during hydraulic fracturing is still regulated. In addition, there may be additional regulations for hydraulic fracturing by state oil and gas agencies. States or EPA have the authority under the Clean Water Act to regulate discharge of produced waters from hydraulic fracturing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Under the Safe Drinking Water Act |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/uic/class2/hydraulicfracturing/wells_hydroreg.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, federal environment officials scientifically linked underground water pollution with hydraulic fracturing for the first time in central Wyoming. EPA stated that the water supply contained at least 10 compounds known to be used in fracking fluids. The findings in the report contradicted arguments by the drilling industry on the safety of the fracturing process, such as the hydrologic pressure that naturally forces fluids downwards instead of upwards. EPA also commented that the pollution from 33 abandoned oil and gas waste pits were responsible for some degree of minor [[groundwater pollution]] in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lustgarten |first=Abrahm |title=Feds Link Water Contamination to Fracking for the First Time |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/feds-link-water-contamination-to-fracking-for-first-time |publisher=Pro Publica |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which is responsible for overseeing oil and gas production in Alaska, proposed new rules for regulating hydraulic fracturing in the state, which contains over two billion barrels of shale oil (second only to the Bakkan) and over 80 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Companies will be required to conduct water testing at least 90 days prior to and up to 120 days after hydraulically fracturing a well, which includes analysis of pH, alkalinity, total dissolved solids, and total petroleum hydrocarbons. The proposed rules necessitate disclosure of the identity and volume of chemicals used in fracturing fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=D'Angelo |first=Wayne J. |title=Hydraulic fracturing: State Regulatory Roundup Vol. 14 |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4023f7ca-2992-47a2-b644-b17805bffed5 |publisher=Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission]].

In February 2013, the state of Illinois introduced the Illinois Hydraulic Fracturing Regulatory Act, H.B. 2615, which imposes strict controls on fracturing companies, such as chemical disclosure requirements and water testing requirements. The bill includes baseline and periodic post-frack testing of potentially affected waters, such as surface water and groundwater sources near fracturing wells, to identify contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing wells will be closed if fracturing fluid is released outside of the shale rock formation being fractured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HB2615|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09800HB2615lv&amp;SessionID=85&amp;GA=98&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;DocNum=2615&amp;print=true|publisher=Illinois General Assembly|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pharmaceuticals and personal care products=====
Detectable levels of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in the parts per trillion, are found in many public drinking water systems in the US as many water treatment plants lack the technological know-how to remove these chemical compounds from raw water. There are now increasing worries about how these compounds degrade and react in the environment, during the treatment process, inside our bodies, and the long-term exposure to multiple contaminants at low levels. Out of over 80,000 chemicals registered with the EPA, the US federal drinking water rules mandate testing for only 83 chemicals, which calls for increased monitoring of pharmaceuticals on the presence and concentrations of chemical compounds in rivers, streams, and treated tap water. As traditional waste water regulations and treatment systems target microorganisms and nutrients, there are no federal standards for pharmaceuticals in drinking water or waste water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNabb|first=John|title=Testimony to Oversight Hearing|url=http://www.cleanwateraction.org/files/publications/ma/testimony-drugsinwater-mcnabb.pdf|publisher=Clean Water Action|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent developments====
In May 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency released a new list of contaminants, known as the unregulated contaminant monitoring regulation 3 (UCMR3), that will be part of municipal water systems testing starting this year and continuing through 2015. The UCMR3 testing will help municipal water system operators measure the occurrence and exposure of contamination levels that may endanger human health. The State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa is the only state environmental public health laboratory that has been certified and approved to test for all 28 chemical contaminants on the new list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blake|first=Pat|title=What's in your water?|url=http://now.uiowa.edu/2013/03/whats-your-water|publisher=Iowa Now|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency developed a new rapid water quality test that provides accurate same day results of contamination levels, which marks a significant improvement from current tests that require at least 24 hours to obtain results. The new test will help authorities determine whether beaches are safe for swimming to keep the public from falling sick and could help prevent beaches from being closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Water Testing Could Prevent Beach Closures|url=http://eponline.com/articles/2013/03/20/new-water-testing-could-prevent-beach-closures.aspx|publisher=Environmental Protection|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The International Maritime Organization, known as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization until 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IMO|url=http://www.imo.org/|publisher=IMO|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in Geneva in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Michael L|title=Ship Organization Nears Final Form; U.N. Maritime Body Expected to Have 3 Principal Organs – Panama in Opposition|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1948/03/04/archives/ship-organization-nears-final-form-un-maritime-body-expected-to.html?sq=international%2520maritime%2520organization&amp;scp=3&amp;st=cse|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=4 March 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force ten years later, meeting for the first time in 1959. ''See'' [[International Maritime Organization]].

The International Maritime Organization has been at the forefront of the international community by taking the lead in addressing the transfer of aquatic invasive species through shipping. On 13 February 2004, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments was adopted by consensus at a diplomatic conference held at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London. According to the convention, all ships are required to implement a ballast water and sediments management plan. All ships will have to carry a Ballast Water Record Book and will be required to carry out ballast water management procedures to a given standard. Parties to the Convention are given the option to take additional measures which are subject to criteria set out in the Convention and to International Maritime Organization guidelines. Ballast water management is subjected to the ballast water exchange standard and the ballast water performance standard. Ships performing ballast water exchange shall do so with an efficiency of 95 per cent volumetric exchange of ballast water and ships using a ballast water management system (BWMS) shall meet a performance standard based on agreed numbers of organisms per unit of volume. The Convention will enter into force 12 months after ratification by 30 States, representing 35 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballast Water Management|url=http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Environment/ballastwatermanagement/Pages/Default.aspx|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Ballast water discharge and the environment]].

==Water test initiatives==

===EarthEcho Water Challenge===
The [[World Water Monitoring Day|EarthEcho Water Challenge]] is an international education and outreach program that generates public awareness and involvement in safeguarding water resources globally by engaging citizens to conduct water testing of local water bodies. Participants learn how to conduct simple water quality tests, analyze common indicators of water health, specifically dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity. The program was originally called "World Water Monitoring Day" and later "World Water Monitoring Challenge", and was established in 2003. EarthEcho International encourages participants to conduct their monitoring activities as part of the "EarthEcho Water Challenge" during any period between March 22 ([[World Water Day]]) and December of each year.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatermonitoringday.org |title=EarthEcho Water Challenge |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=EarthEcho International |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water test market==

===Market size and structure===
As of 2009, the global water test market, which includes in-house, small commercial and large laboratory groups, is approximately US$3.6 billion. The global market for low-end test equipment is roughly $300–400 million. The global market for in-line monitors is approximately $100–130 million.&lt;ref name="Something in the water"&gt;{{cite web|title=Something in the water|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/10/6/market-insight/something-water.html|publisher=Global Water Intelligence|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product offering===
Key products include analytical systems, instrumentation, and reagents for water quality and safety analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dray|first=Deane M.|title=Investing In The Global Water Sector|url=http://www.waterinnovations.org/PDF/presentations/Dray-0927p.pdf|publisher=Citi|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagents are chemical testing compounds that identify presence of chlorine, pH, alkalinity, turbidity and other metrics.

The equipment market comprises low-end, onsite field testing equipment, in-line monitors, and high-end testing laboratory instruments.&lt;ref name="Something in the water"/&gt; High-end lab equipment are [[Mass Spectrometry]] devices that conduct organic analysis, using [[Gas Chromatography]] and [[Liquid Chromatography]], or metals analysis, using Inductively Coupled Plasma.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"/&gt;

====New developments====
Several trends to monitor include digital sensor plug-and-play techniques and luminescent dissolved oxygen meters replacing sensors.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Sector Primer|url=http://www.fullermoney.com/content/2005-07-01/IainLittleGoldmanSachsWaterPrimer61505.pdf|publisher=Goldman Sachs|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Razor and Razor-blade" business model===
The water test market is approximately two-thirds equipment and one-third consumables. Reagents are used with each test and generate [[recurring revenue]] for companies. Aftermarket maintenance agreements, operator training and parts replacement help to ensure resources are maximized.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt; The market leader with an estimated 21% market share, Danaher, is able to reap EBIT{{clarify|what does EBIT mean?|date=November 2017}} margins in the high-teens-to-low-20% on test equipment, but can command 40%+ margins on the water test reagents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geraghty|first=Michael|title=Global Themes Strategy|url=http://fa.smithbarney.com/public/projectfiles/f8e732d5-6162-4cd9-8b1d-7b7317360163.pdf|publisher=Citi|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Freebie marketing]].

===Distribution===
Companies tend to employ the "direct-to-end-user" model for most products, but may also try to sell low-end equipment via the Internet to reduce distribution costs.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

===Pricing===
Pricing depends on application and type of product. Instruments range from as low as $10 to thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

===Suppliers===
The low-end test equipment is dominated by few large suppliers, notably Germany's Loviband and Merck, DelAgua Water Testing of the UK who work globally, and US-based LaMotte. Major manufacturers of in-line equipment include Siemens and Danaher's Hach. Thermo Scientific and Waters are key producers of high-end test equipment.&lt;ref name="Something in the water"/&gt;

===End markets===
The end markets include municipal water plants, industrial users, such as beverage and electronics, and environmental agencies, such as the United States Geological Survey.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

==Water testing facilities==
There are two main types of laboratories: commercial and in-house.

===In-house laboratories===
In-house laboratories are usually present in municipal water and waste water facilities, breweries and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. They account for roughly half of all tests run annually.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"/&gt;

===Commercial laboratories===
Most of the commercial laboratories are single-site firms that only service institutions in the geographical region. The employee head count for each laboratory is usually fewer than five people, and revenues are under $1 million. These laboratories account for one quarter of all tests. There are several major laboratory groups, such as UK-based Inspicio and Australia-based ALS, which account for another quarter of all tests.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"/&gt;

==Privatization==

===Opinion===
The conventional impression is that private water systems, which sources groundwater from rural areas, produce higher water quality compared to public water systems. Studies have demonstrated that groundwater is vulnerable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which necessitates frequent water testing. However, critics like Charrois argue that inconvenience and time constraint impede regular testing in private wells and water systems, which poses risk of poor water quality to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kruger|first=Sasha Nicole|title=A Blue Revolution: The Global Crisis of Water Quality and Accessibility|url=http://dc.cod.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1365&amp;context=essai|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sydney water crisis===
In 1998, Sydney, Australia's water supply, 85% controlled by Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux until 2021,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Prospect Water Filtration Plant|url=http://www.degremont.com.au/projects/prospect-water-filtration-plant/|website=degremont.com.au|publisher=Suez Water and Treatment Solutions|access-date=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained high concentrations of parasites [[Giardia]] and [[Cryptosporidium]]. However, the public was not immediately informed of the water contamination when it had first occurred.&lt;ref name=MB&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=Maude|title=Blue Gold|url=http://www.ratical.org/co-globalize/BlueGold.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Suez (company)]] and [[1998 Sydney water crisis]].

===Ontario's Common Sense Revolution===
In Ontario, Canada, the Harris government introduced the "Common Sense Revolution" to cut the large provincial deficit accumulated under the previous Rae government, implementing major cuts to the environment budget, privatizing water testing labs, deregulating water protection infrastructure, and firing trained water testing experts. ''See'' [[Mike Harris]].

In 1999, in spite of a Canadian federal government study that found a third of Ontario's rural wells were contaminated with E. coli, the Ontario government dropped testing for E.coli from its Drinking Water Surveillance Program and subsequently closed the program in 2000. In June 2000, there was a wave of E. coli outbreaks in several communities in rural Ontario, where at least seven people died from consuming the water in Walkerton. The private testing company, A&amp;L Laboratories, detected E. coli in the water but failed to disclose the contamination to provincial authorities due to a loophole in the "common sense" regulation. A&amp;L Laboratories claimed that the test results were "confidential intellectual property" and therefore belonged only to the "client", who was the authorities of Walkerton who lacked the training for proper assessment.&lt;ref name=MB/&gt; ''See'' [[Escherichia coli]].

Out of 47 brands of bottled water commonly available in French supermarkets, 10 brands contained "residues from drugs or pesticides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willsher|first=Kim|title=One in five French bottled waters 'contain drugs or pesticides'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/25/french-bottled-waters-contaminated-brands|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 March 2013|location=London|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, almost 200 water fountains in Jersey City public schools were found to contain lead above regulatory standards, where one of the water fountains had lead contamination at levels more than 800 times the EPA's standard.

===Legal cases===
In March 2013, a defense lawyer asked a federal judge to dismiss charges against the owner of Mississippi Environmental Analytical Laboratories Inc. accused of falsifying records on industrial waste water samples. According to the indictment, Borg Warner Emissions Systems Inc. hired Tennie White, the owner of the laboratory, to test waste water discharge at its car parts plant in Water Valley. White is accused of creating three reports in 2009 that indicated tests were completed when they were not. The motion to dismiss was based on the lawyer's argument that the documents referred to in the indictment were not signed and were not submitted to a government agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawyer wants dismissal charges over water tests|url=http://www.wjtv.com/story/21654671/lawyer-wants-dismissal-charges-over-water-tests|publisher=WJTV|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The study of '''women and religion''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. Most religions elevate the status of men over women, have stricter sanctions against women, and require them to be submissive. While there has been progress towards equality, religions overall still lag the rest of society in addressing gender issues. There are fundamentalists within every religion who actively resist change. There is often a dualism within religion which exalts women on the one hand, while demanding more rigorous displays of devotion on the other. This leads some feminists to see religion as the last barrier for female emancipation.

{{Further|Women in Buddhism}}
[[File:Venerabletzuchuang-cropped.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A high-ranking [[Bhikkhuni]] in the [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist tradition]] during an alms round.]]
[https://file.scirp.org/pdf/OALibJ_2017042616323563.pdf Women in Buddhism] is a topic that can be approached from varied perspectives including those of theology, history, anthropology and feminism. Topical interests include the theological status of women, the treatment of women in Buddhist societies at home and in public, the history of women in Buddhism, and a comparison of the experiences of women across different forms of Buddhism. As in other religions, the experiences of Buddhist women have varied considerably.

[[Buddhism]] can be considered to be revolutionary within the social and political realms of ancient India in regards to the role of women. During this time period, members of the highest Hindu caste, called [[Brahmin]]s, did not allow women to have any involvement with religious rites or sacred texts of the Vedas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy|last=Halkias|first=Georgios|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=9781118324004|location=UK|pages=494|doi = 10.1002/9781118324004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were further oppressed by the sacred texts of Hindu code, called the Laws of Manu, which stated that “By a girl, by a young woman, or even an aged one, nothing must be done independently, even in her own house. In childhood a female must be subject to her own father, in youth to her husband, when her lord is dead to her sons; a woman must never be independent” (V, 147-46, 155).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu.htm|title=Laws of Manu|last=Buhler|first=George|date=|website=Internet Sacred Texts Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism can be attributed as revolutionary due to the fact that [[Gautama Buddha]] admitted women into the monastic order, during a time when monastic communities were dominated by males in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirimanne|first=Chand|date=November 2016|title=Buddhism and Women - Dhamma has no Gender|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1923&amp;context=jiws|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|volume=18|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, one of the main schools of tradition that originated from the early development of Buddhism, called [[Theravāda Buddhism]], expresses the assumption that “all men and women, regardless of their caste, origins, or status, have equal spiritual worth.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because Buddhism can be described as a religious and philosophical ideology that does not have an explicit “Creator” there is no implied “sacredness” in relation to one’s human form, which means that the practice itself is not bound to the ideas of gender, reproduction, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last=Gross|first=Rita|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is argued that Buddhist traditions still have underlying issues pertaining to gender roles. While Buddhist ideologies may be considered a revolutionary step forward in the [https://journal.fi/scripta/article/view/67383/27680 status of women], many still consider the tradition to be subject to the social and political context of undermining gender issues during its upbringing, and even up to this day. The progression of gender issues, especially between gender and authority, can be seen during the time period of [[Hinayana Buddhism]], when the Buddhist order underwent major reforms of splitting into about 20 different schools. During this time Buddhist narratives and beliefs arose limiting the status of women’s roles within the Buddhist communities, asserting that women could not reach enlightenment, or [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuichi|first=Kajiyama|date=1982|title=Women in Buddhism|jstor=44361658|journal=The Eastern Buddhist|volume=15|issue=2|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that women would not attain positions of leadership because of the fact that they could not reach enlightenment, unless they “gain good [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and are reborn as men beforehand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/forum/can-women-become-leaders-in-the-buddhist-tradition|title=Can Women Become Leaders in the Buddhist Tradition?|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Khandro Rinpoche]], a female lama in Tibetan Buddhism, shows a more optimistic view in regards to women in Buddhism:&lt;blockquote&gt;When there is a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as something new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, this is not the case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Blossoms of the Dharma: Living as a Buddhist Nun|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J6Ci86jyYq4C|publisher = North Atlantic Books|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 9781556433252|language = en|first = Thubten|last = Chodron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a YouTube interview on why there are so few female teachers in the Buddhist communities, Rinpoche goes on to say that: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is because of a lack of education. It was a very patriarchal society back in the East. Wherever Buddhism grew, these societies were very patriarchal. It limits the opportunity women have to study and be independent – and you have study and be independent to manifest any kind of realization or understanding…fortunately, that seems to be changing. I really think that opportunities for education have now really increased for women – there becoming very competitive and learned, and things are going to change.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Study Buddhism|title=Khandro Rinpoche – Why Are There So Few Female Teachers?|date=2017-11-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEG5OrINvNM|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Rinpoche states that while the underlying nature of the [[patriarchal system]] that still exists today creates more obstacles and limitations for women in Buddhism, she believes that there is a changing dynamic and optimistic future for women within the Buddhist community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Further|Women in Christianity}}
Some Christians believe Christianity has set a mold for women to adhere to and is one that limits a woman’s freedom in the church. According to the Christian Bible, wives are expected to be submissive in many ways. They are asked not only to be submissive to their husbands, but to the church, their community, and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openbible.info/topics/virtuous_woman|title=What Does the Bible Say About Virtuous Woman?|website=www.openbible.info|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "At the head of every household is a man; at the head of a man is Christ; and the head of every women is a man; and the head of Christ is God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11:3&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Corinthians 11:3 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives are seen as second in the family household, only to that of their husbands. This suggests that men are first hand in Christianity and adds to issue of equal rights for women in the religion.

As according to scripture in Genesis, “the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet (fit or suitable) for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2:18&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 2:18 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlanta.clclutheran.org/bibleclass/thechristianwoman.html|title=The Christian Woman- - the role of women in the home, church and society|website=atlanta.clclutheran.org|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage suggests that women are to play a supportive role to men and is supported in further passages from Christian Scripture. For example, in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A18-19&amp;version=NIV Colossians] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A1-7&amp;version=NIV Peter], the specific passages call for women to submit to their husbands and to stay silent in their shadow. Lastly, in terms of how women are suppressed by scripture, the specific passage in Titus calls for a woman to not teach or preach in public assembly for that would constitute authority of a man.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Leadership roles in the organized churches and sects of Christianity are often restricted to males. In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and also in [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses.

Although Christianity professes equality for all and says women and men were created equal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3:28&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Galatians 3:28 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown throughout history women have been subject to the patriarchy that is embedded in the religion. “In the midst of the Greek, Roman, and Jewish cultures, which viewed women almost on the level of possessions, Jesus showed love and respect for women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/articles/A168/gods-high-call-for-women|title=God's High Call for Women|website=Grace to You|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expressed in the preceding quote, Jesus Christ professed equality and Christianity does express and celebrate equality. It is the patriarchy of society that has influenced Christianity and put men in positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crossway.org/articles/does-the-bible-reflect-a-patriarchal-bias/|title=Does the Bible Reflect a Patriarchal Bias?|website=www.crossway.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though women have played a vital role in the church, as expressed by the Acts and many others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28:1-10&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 28:1-10 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16:13-15&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 16:13-15 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; none have ever been allowed a position of leadership.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Women such as Mary Magdalene, who played a major role in support Jesus’ and the ministry, show just how important women have been to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-mary-magdalene-119565482/|title=Who Was Mary Magdalene?|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apostle Paul is a great example in showing this as he worked, “side by side with them for the furtherance of the gospel,”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracechurch.org/about/distinctives/role-of-women|title=The Role of Women|website=www.gracechurch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but never appointed any women in roles of leadership or power.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Women in Christianity can be roughly summarized in the following quote: “Although women are spiritual equals with men and the ministry of women is essential to the body of Christ, women are excluded from leadership over men in the church.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

However some Christians disagree with the idea that women should not have leadership positions, popular female preachers like [[Joyce Meyer]], [[Paula White]] and [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] have had or have leadership roles in Church. It is mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] that women such as [[Deborah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JDG.4.4 |title=Judges 4:4 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huldah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2KI.22.14 |title=2 Kings 22:14 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were Prophets. In the [[New Testament]] Philip was said to have four daughters who prophesied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ACT.21.8-9 |title=Acts 21:8-9 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Women in Hinduism}}
In Hinduism, women are displayed as equal or even greater than men, for instance Kali Ma (Dark Mother) "is the Hindu goddess of creation, preservation, and goddess of destruction" her power symbolized the origin of all creation's life, as well as the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themystica.com/kali-ma/|title=Kali Ma {{!}} Hindu Goddess|date=2018-02-04|work=The Mystica|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her control over life and death, Kali was seen as a goddess that should be loved as well as feared. Another important female figure is Shakti, a goddess that is embodied as the energy of the universe, "often manifested to destroy demonic forces and restore balance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chopra.com/article/shakti-universal-force|title=Shakti: A Universal Force|date=2016-05-01|work=The Chopra Center|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Shakti is a universal force, she is embodied by all the gods in Hinduism and is worshiped as the "mother goddess".

While Hinduism illustrates women as important figures that play an important role in understanding how the world works, women in Hindu society have been overlooked and their importance has been diminished throughout time due to outside forces that cause "girls being made to feel lesser and not as important as boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/whitehindu/2014/06/the-truth-about-women-and-hinduism/|title=The Truth About Women and Hinduism|last=Hindu|first=The White|date=2014-06-05|work=The White Hindu|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes created a shift in power between men and women to the point where, "a Hindu woman was preordained to be ruled by the male and was subjected to all kinds of atrocities for these were the standards of being an ideal Hindu woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basharat|first=Tahira|date=July–December 2009|title=The Contemporary Hindu Women of India: An Overview|url=http://results.pu.edu.pk/images/journal/csas/PDF/5-Dr.%20Tahira.pdf|journal=A Research Journal of South Asian Studies|volume=24|pages=244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this change in perception, Hinduism is now seen as a Partiarchal religion that teaches sexism and inequality, when in actuality it is the people in Hindu society's perception that is sexist rather than the religion itself. However, this view of women being treated as property is slowing beginning to change, as Hindu societies are pushing for more equality and a change in the perception of women.

== Islam ==

{{Further|Women in Islam|Houri}}

[[Islam]] is a monotheistic religion that was founded in the early seventh century by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The notion of a good life for a Muslim person is defined in Islam’s sacred text, the [[Quran]], as well as the [[Hadith]] which are the direct teachings of [[Muhammad]]. Although these sources covered a lot, there were still some situations that were left to interpretation. Thus, Islamic scholars formed a consensus around a set of secondary sources, the most notable being the ijma, qiyas, ijtihad and fatwas. It is important to recognize that the Quran is not a static source with a fixed meaning but a dynamic, versatile one.&lt;ref&gt;Motahari, Ayatollah Morteza. "Jurisprudence and its principles." New York: Tahrike Tarsile Quran (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Quran emphasizes the equal treatment of all Islamic people, throughout history, the patriarchy has continued to oppress Muslim women since the religion was founded. Although the introduction of Islamic principles was a step in the right direction, men kept the dominant position and women were required to be obedient to their husbands. This was less due to the teachings of the religion but more so due to the mindsets of the era. Before Islam became so widespread, people of the Middle East lived in households in which women were seen as the property of their husbands and were only meant to perform household tasks, ultimately dehumanizing them.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Women." In ''The Islamic World: Past and Present''. Ed. John L. Esposito. ''Oxford Islamic Studies Online''. Apr 11, 2018. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e370&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of Islam also gave rise to the humanization of women and the recognition of women’s rights by placing men and women as equals in their ability to carry out the wishes of Allah and the teachings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jane I. "Women in Islam: Equity, Equality, and the Search for the Natural Order." Journal of the American Academy of Religion, vol. 47, no. 4, Dec. 1979, pp. 517-537. EBSCOhost, electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0000775406&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the introduction of Islamic principles was a step in the right direction, men kept the dominant position and women were required to be obedient to their husbands. This was mostly due to the cultural norms and was seen a way of life by the local community.  The three main things which [[sharia]] law introduced were a women’s rights to marriage, inheritance, and divorce. It also limited the oppressive privileges of men by placing restrictions on polygamy by limiting marriage to a maximum of four women only if they are taken care of equally and properly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Khel, Muhammad Nazeer Kaka. "THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN ISLAM."&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims must observe the five pillars of Islam: praying five times a day, fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]], making a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], donating to charity, accepting Allah as the only God and Muhammad as the messenger of God. Women have restrictions on public prayer and are either banned from mosques or have separate private spaces. On top of that they cannot pray during menstruation and if they are pregnant or in labor during the month of Ramadan, they must make up these fasting days.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These restrictions and the negative impact of veiling which was otherwise seen as a respectable act yielded in the seclusion of woman from mosques and other Islamic educational centers. This drove a wedge in their advancement and forced them into a dependency of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Due to their isolation, it became the responsibility of the [[ummah]], or Muslim community, to pass down the customs and traditions that mold a Muslim women's life. This guidance, sharia, and Islamic scripture outlined the structure for her education, employment opportunities, rights to inheritance, dress, public appearance, domestic 'duties', age of marriage, freedom to consent to marriage, marriage contract, mahr, permissibility of birth control, divorce, sex outside or before marriage, her ability to receive justice in case of sex crimes, property rights independent of her husband, and when ''salat'' (prayers) are mandatory for her.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, S. &amp; Kellison, R. B. "At the Intersection of Scripture and Law: Qur'an 4:34 and Violence against Women." Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, vol. 26 no. 2, 2010, pp. 11-36.

== Judaism ==
{{Further|Women in Judaism}}
The role of women in Judaism is determined by the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Oral Law (the corpus of rabbinic literature), by custom, and by non-religious cultural factors. Although the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature mention various female role models, religious law treats women differently in various circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Judaism 101: The Role of Women|url = http://www.jewfaq.org/women.htm|website = www.jewfaq.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout historical Jewish texts, all people were seen equal under the highest level: God.  The Hebrew bible states that “man” was made both “male and female”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genesis.  The Hebrew Bible|publisher=Cassell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dual gender, but was later separated into male and female.  In Judaism, God has never been exclusively viewed as male or masculine, but rather, he obtains both masculine and feminine qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coogan|first1=Michael|title=God and sex: What the Bible really says|date=2011|publisher=Twelve|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scriptures and ancient texts refer God as “him” because there is no neutral gender in the Hebrew language.  
  
Because it is an essential building block of marriage, family is strongly emphasized in Judaism.  Gender has a bearing on familial lines: in traditional Judaism, Jewishness is passed down through the mother, although the father's name is used to describe sons and daughters in the Torah, e.g., "Dinah, daughter of Jacob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Women|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/women.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Responsibilities were not taken lightly with regards to the family.  The wife and mother in Hewbrew, Jewish language, is called "akeret habayit," which in literal English translation means "mainstay." A Jewish household is expected to live up to the Torah, in which the aketet habayit, or woman of the house, tends to the family and household duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1802936/jewish/Woman-in-Judaism.htm|title=What is the Role of the Woman in Judaism?|website=www.chabad.org|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were highly regarded within the Jewish community because they were capable of a great degree of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|"binah"]] (institution, understanding, intelligence).  The term, “women of valor,” describes the ideal characteristics of a Jewish woman.  Traditionally, she is one who devoted all her energies towards the “physical and spiritual well-being of her family” because she had the capabilities to do so.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wenger|first1=Beth|title=Jewish Women and Voluntarism: Beyond the Myth of Enablers|journal=American Jewish History|volume=79|issue=1|pages=16–36|jstor=23884567|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her continuous devotion allowed her husband and children to flourish; her personal reward being their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Krieger|first1=Aliza|title=The Role of Judaism in Family Relationships|journal=Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development|volume=38|issue=3|pages=154–165|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1912.2010.tb00123.x|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, that role has reshaped itself throughout time.  The “women of valor’s” effect expanded beyond the household and into the community.  Volunteer work allowed women to acquire a sense of self-hood while sharpening leadership and organizational skills.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;  While it may seem that women only had influence in smaller communities, Jewish women eventually established enough authority to emerge as public figures.  In 1972, Sally Priesand, became the first female rabbi that was publicly ordained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Rabbis|url=https://jwa.org/rabbis|website=Jewish Women's Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were able to lead worship services and read from the Torah on par with men, if not even better because they had an alternative perspective of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=David|title=Women Rabbis: A Novel Idea|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=21865370&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in traditional Judaism has been grossly misrepresented and misunderstood. The position of women is not nearly as lowly as many modern people think; in fact, the position of women in [[halakhah]] (Jewish Law) that dates back to the biblical period is in many ways better than the position of women under American civil law as recently as a century ago.

[[File:Preparing langar.jpg|thumb|Volunteers preparing [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] at the [[Golden Temple]] in [[Amritsar]], [[India]].]]
{{Further|Women in Sikhism}}
According to [[Sikhism]], men and women are two sides of the same coin of the human. There is a system of inter-relation and inter-dependence where man takes birth from woman, and woman is born of a man's seed. According to Sikhism a man can not feel secure and complete during his life without a woman, and a man's success is related to the love and support of the woman who shares her life with him, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sri Guru Granth Sahib – A brief history {{!}}  Islam Ahmadiyya|url = https://www.alislam.org/egazette/updates/sri-guru-granth-sahib-a-brief-history/|website = www.alislam.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of Sikhism, [[Guru Nanak]], reportedly said in 1499 that "It is a woman who keeps the race going" and that we should not "consider woman cursed and condemned, when from woman are born leaders and rulers."

Sikhs have had an obligation to treat women as equals, and gender discrimination in Sikh society has not been allowed. However, gender equality has been difficult to achieve.

At the time of the Gurus women were considered very low in society. Both Hindus and Muslims regarded women as inferior and a man's property. Women were treated as mere property whose only value was as a servant or for entertainment. They were considered seducers and distractions from man's spiritual path. Men were allowed polygamy but widows were not allowed to remarry but encouraged to burn themselves on their husbands funeral pyre (sati). Child marriage and female infanticide were prevalent and purdah (veils) were popular for women. Women were also not allowed to inherit any property. Many Hindu women were captured and sold as slaves in foreign Islamic countries.
