Ilıcalı successfully adapted these formats for the Turkish viewers and broadcast them on primetime in the most watched TV channels of Turkey.

Acun Medya bought TV8 in 2013. Broadcasting Acun Medya productions carried TV8 from the 1% share it had on the market to becoming one of the most watched TV channels of Turkey. TV8 later joined forces with Doğuş Production Group, of the leading media groups of Turkey. In 2016 TV8.5 an entertainment and sports channel, was added to the company.

Acun Ilıcalı has made his first move into the international media arena in the year 2016 with his projects in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tgrthaber.com.tr/fotogaleri/acun-ilicali-yunanistan-planini-acikladi-8491?pg=1 Greece - Acun Ilıcalı's first move into the international media arena]&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, Acun Medya has produced ''The Voice'', ''Survivor'', ''Got Talent'', ''My Style Rocks'' and several more television programs. Broadcasting through [[Skai TV]] channel, some of these productions have reached high ratings.

After having earned success in Greece, Acun Medya developed a first-in-the-world television format that combines sports and reality.

'''Allan Johnston''' is an [[Australia]]n [[advertising agency|advertising]] creative executive and [[copywriter]] who enjoyed particular success as a jingle writer in the 1970s and 80s.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Together with his long-time business partner [[Alan Morris (advertiser)|Alan Morris]], he formed the Australian [[advertising agency]] [[Mojo (advertising)|Mojo]] which enjoyed much Australian and some international success in the 1980s and whose name survives today as Publicis Mojo, an Australian subsidiary of the [[France|French]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[advertising]] and communications company holding [[Publicis Groupe]].

==Career==
Born in [[Adelaide]] Johnston started out as a copywriter in that city before taking a job as an assistant producer in an Adelaide ad agency, then moving into the copy department writing jingles. He relocated to Sydney in 1968, joining an agency called Marketing and Advertising, later to be known as Hertz Walpole Advertising. In the mid 70s he was teamed with freelance writer Alan Morris and together they had immediate success as a team working on campaigns for Hertz Walpole's clients [[Meadow Lea]] margarine ("You oughta be congratulated") and [[Tooheys]] beer ("How do you feel?"). In 1973 they left the agency and in 1975 started their own consultancy and continuing to work on such accounts as they grew their business.&lt;ref name="Hertz Walpole history" &gt;[http://www.mjwadvertising.com.au/about_history.php Hertz Walpole history ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 their creative consultancy became the full-service ad agency [[Mojo (advertising)|Mojo]] and Meadow Lea &lt;ref name ="WorldToday"/&gt; and Tooheys &lt;ref name = "SMHJan"&gt;{{cite news |first= Julian |last= Lee |authorlink= |title= Doing very nicely, thanks Jan |url= http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/27/1098667826105.html|work= |publisher= Sydney Morning Herald |date= 28 October 2004 |accessdate= 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst other clients, signed with the new shop.

During the 1970s and 1980s Mojo was the hottest creative agency in Sydney and Mo and Jo had success jointly authoring [[World Series Cricket]]'s "[[C'mon Aussie C'mon]] ".&lt;ref name="SMHJan"/&gt; and later  the [[Tourism Australia|Australian Tourism Commission's]] spot with [[Paul Hogan]]'s instruction to put another "[[Shrimp on the barbie]].&lt;ref name="BakerBendel"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Baker  | first = Bill  | authorlink =   | author2 = Peggy Bendel  | issue = Summer 2005  | url = http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm  | title = Come and Say G’Day!  | journal = Travel Marketing Decisions  | publisher = The Association of Travel Marketing Executives  | accessdate = 2007-12-21  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071104153701/http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm  | archive-date = 2007-11-04  | dead-url = yes  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mojo approach to TV advertisements used a colloquial and irreverent style, often with a catchy jingle  to simple accompaniment and frequently sung in Jo's own "gravelly" voice. Contrasting against the clipped and British-imitating style of voice presenters on Australian TV up till that point, Mojo ads highlighted Australian idiom and its laconic accent. Ads such as “I’m as Australian as [[Ampol]]”, “Hit ‘em with the Old Pea Beau” (insectide), “Everybody loves [[Speedo]]”, “I Can Feel a [[Castlemaine XXXX|Fourex]] Coming on”, “Every Amco tells a Story” (for Amco jeans) all came out of the Mojo agency in the 1980s. The use of [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]]'s [[I Still Call Australia Home]] to promote [[Qantas]] was developed at Mojo in the late 1980s and until 2011 this campaign concept was still used by Qantas and its ad agencies.&lt;ref name ="WorldToday"&gt;{{cite news |first= Daniel |last= Hoare |authorlink= |title= Tribute to an advertising legend |url= http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2007/s1888748.htm |work= The World Today |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date= 3 April 2007 |accessdate= 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1987 Mojo was acquired by the Melbourne-based publicly listed agency Monaghan Dayman [[Phillip Adams|Adams]] Limited and became MojoMDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Phillip H. |last= Dougherty |authorlink= |title= Mojo Office In New York Wins 2 Jobs |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/09/business/the-media-business-advertising-mojo-office-in-new-york-wins-2-jobs.html |work= |publisher= The New York Times |date= 9 May 1988 |accessdate= 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resultant merged business maintained its listed status until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delisted.com.au/Company/5526/MOJO%20MDA%20GROUP%20LIMITED Mojo &amp; MDA listing status&lt;/ref&gt; The Mojo MDA Group had offices in London, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore and affiliates throughout Asia. In 1988 [[Advertising Age]] named it as International Agency of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Alarcon | first = Camille | date = 3 May 2007 | url = http://www.bandt.com.au/news/46/0c04b446.asp | title = Yabber merges to form Big Red | work =  | publisher = B &amp; T Magazine | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606031707/http://www.bandt.com.au/news/46/0c04b446.asp | archive-date = 2008-06-06 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1989 the Mojo MDA Group  was Australia's largest ad agency with billings of $180million and was acquired by the Los Angeles agency [[TBWA\Chiat\Day|Chiat\Day]]. The merger was unsuccessful and in 1992 Chiat/Day sold off Mojo to [[Draftfcb|Foote, Cone &amp; Belding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/tbwa-chiat-day?cat=biz-fin Answers.com - TBWA/Chiat/Day - company history]&lt;/ref&gt; In later international dealings which saw [[Draftfcb|FCB]] acquired by the [[Interpublic Group]], the Australian Mojo offices were sold to [[Publicis Groupe|Publicis]].

In 1994 Jo left the employment of the Australian Mojo business  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjwadvertising.com.au/about_history.php Hertz Walpole history]&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Hertz Walpole as an Executive Creative Director, taking up a shareholding. When Alan Morris finished up a stint at Singleton [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] in 1999, he took up the opportunity to re-unite with Jo and Jim Walpole and their agency was renamed "Morris Johnston Walpole". The re-unification failed to set the advertising world on-fire and in 2002 the veterans accepted an offer for sale from the Japanese multinational communications group [[Hakuhodo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bandt.com.au/news/mo-jo-walpole-sell-to-japan8217s-hakuhodo{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Sale to Hakuhodo&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010 the agency at which Jo started in 1968 which was then called "Marketing &amp; Advertising" is still in operation and known as "MJW Hakuhodo".

==Personal life==

{{Economic systems sidebar}}
The '''American School''', also known as the '''National System''', represents three different yet related constructs in politics, policy and philosophy. It was the American policy from the 1860s to the 1970s, waxing and waning in actual degrees and details of implementation. Historian [[Michael Lind]] describes it as a coherent applied economic philosophy with logical and conceptual relationships with other economic ideas.&lt;ref name="New America"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060106154801/http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=1080  "Free Trade Fallacy" New America].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]]'s ideas and three Reports to Congress formed the philosophical basis of the American School]]
The American School of economics represented the legacy of [[Alexander Hamilton]], who in his ''[[Report on Manufactures]]'', argued that the U.S. could not become fully independent until it was self-sufficient in all necessary economic products. Hamilton rooted this economic system, in part, in the successive regimes of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]'s [[France]] and [[Elizabeth I]]'s [[England]], while rejecting the harsher aspects of [[mercantilism]], such as seeking colonies for markets. As later defined by Senator [[Henry Clay]] who became known as the ''[[American System of Henry Clay|Father of the American System]]'' because of his impassioned support thereof, the American System was to unify the nation north to south, east to west, and city to farmer.&lt;ref name = "Cornell 50"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?root=%2Fmoa%2Fnora%2Fnora0033%2F&amp;tif=00369.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABQ7578-0033-23&amp;coll=moa&amp;frames=1&amp;view=50|title=George D. Prentice, "Life of Henry Clay", ''The North American Review'', Boston Massachusetts, 1831|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Bourgin's 1989 study of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] shows that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the Founders.&lt;ref name=bourgin&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank|last=Bourgin|title=The Great Challenge: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic|isbn=0-06-097296-3|year=1989|publisher=George Braziller Inc.|location=New York, NY|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal, most forcefully articulated by Hamilton, was to ensure that dearly won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce, was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny.

A number of programs by the federal government undertaken in the period prior to the Civil War gave shape and substance to the American School. These programs included the establishment of the [[Patent Office]] in 1802, the creation of the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation created by the 1824 [[Rivers and Harbors Act]],

Other developments included the various Army expeditions to the west, beginning with Lewis and Clark's [[Corps of Discovery]] in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s (see for example, the careers of Major [[Stephen Harriman Long]] and Major General [[John C. Frémont]]), almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]], and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed (see, for example, the career of Brigadier General [[Randolph B. Marcy]]), the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals, and the establishment of the [[First Bank of the United States]] and [[Second Bank of the United States]] as well as various protectionist measures such as the [[Tariff of 1828]].

Leading proponents were economists [[Friedrich List]] (1789–1846) and [[Henry C. Carey|Henry Carey]] (1793–1879). List was a leading 19th Century German and American economist who called it the "National System" and developed it further in his book [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/list/national.html ''The National System of Political Economy'']. Carey called this a ''[http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;q1=American%20System;rgn=full%20text;idno=AJB8869.0001.001;didno=AJB8869.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000019 Harmony of Interests]'' in his book by the same name, a harmony between labor and management, and as well a harmony between [[agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], and [[merchants]].

The name "American System" was coined by Clay to distinguish it, as a school of thought, from the competing theory of economics at the time, the "British System" represented by [[Adam Smith]] in his work ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Famwh%2Famwh0007%2F&amp;tif=00278.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABL5306-0007-45|title=cornell.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central policies ===
The American School included three cardinal policy points:

# Support industry: the advocacy of [[protectionism]], and opposition to [[free trade]] – particularly for the protection of "[[infant industry argument|infant industries]]" and those facing import competition from abroad. Examples: [[Tariff Act of 1789]], [[Tariff of 1816|Tariff Act of 1816]] and [[Morrill Tariff]].
# Create physical infrastructure: government finance of [[internal improvements]] to speed commerce and develop industry. This involved the [[regulation]] of privately held infrastructure, to ensure that it meets the nation's needs. Examples: [[Cumberland Road]] and [[Union Pacific Railroad]].
# Create financial infrastructure: a government sponsored [[National Bank]] to issue [[currency]] and encourage [[commerce]]. This involved the use of sovereign powers for the regulation of [[credit (finance)|credit]] to encourage the development of the economy, and to deter [[speculation]]. Examples: [[First Bank of the United States]], [[Second Bank of the United States]], and [[National Banking Act]].&lt;ref name = "HMCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_003600_americansyst.htm|title=hmco.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry C. Carey]], a leading American economist and adviser to [[Abraham Lincoln]], in his book ''Harmony of Interests'', displays two additional points of this American School economic philosophy that distinguishes it from the systems of [[Adam Smith]] or [[Karl Marx]]:
# Government support for the development of [[science]] and public [[education]] through a public 'common' school system and investments in creative research through grants and subsidies.
# Rejection of [[class struggle]], in favor of the "Harmony of Interests" between: owners and workers, farmer and manufacturers, the wealthy class and the working class.&lt;ref name = "Carey Harmony"&gt;[[Henry C. Carey]], ''Harmony of Interests''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a passage from his book, ''The Harmony of Interests'', Carey wrote concerning the difference between the American System and British System of economics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two systems are before the world; ...  One looks to increasing the necessity of commerce; the other to increasing the power to maintain it. One looks to underworking the Hindoo, and sinking the rest of the world to his level; the other to raising the standard of man throughout the world to our level. One looks to pauperism, ignorance, depopulation, and barbarism; the other to increasing wealth, comfort, intelligence, combination of action, and civilization. One looks towards universal war; the other towards universal peace. One is the English system; the other we may be proud to call the American system, for it is the only one ever devised the tendency of which was that of elevating while equalizing the condition of man throughout the world.&lt;ref name = "Carey Harmony"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The government issue of fiat paper money has also been associated with the American School from the 1830s onwards. The policy has roots going back to the days of the American colonies, when such a type of currency called [[colonial scrip]] was the medium of exchange. As early as 1837, [[John C. Calhoun]] called for a debt-free currency issued and controlled by the government. Such a policy would reduce the profits of the banks, and in response to this, the banking institutions threw their support behind the British school, espousing the [[gold standard]] throughout the 1800s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the Civil War, a shortage of specie led to the issue of such a fiat currency, called [[United States Note]]s, or "greenbacks". Towards the end of the Civil War in March 1865, [[Henry C. Carey]], Lincoln's economic advisor, published a series of letters to the Speaker of the House entitled "The Way to Outdo England Without Fighting Her."  Carey called for the continuance of the greenback policy even after the War, while also raising the reserve requirements of the banks to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;rgn=main;view=text;idno=AEU5158.0001.001 Making of America Books&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This would have allowed the US to develop its economy independent of foreign capital (primarily British gold). Carey wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most serious move in the retrograde direction is that one we find in the determination to prohibit the further issue of [United States Notes] ... To what have we been indebted for [the increased economic activity]? To protection and the " greenbacks"! What is it that we are now laboring to destroy? Protection and the Greenback! Let us continue on in the direction in which we now are moving, and we shall see ... not a re-establishment of the Union, but a complete and final disruption of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carey's plans did not come to fruition as Lincoln was assassinated the next month and new President [[Andrew Johnson]] supported the gold standard, and by 1879 the U.S. was fully back on the gold standard.

===Advocacy===
[[File:Henry Clay portrait by Henry F. Darby.jpg|thumb|174px|Senator [[Henry Clay]], leader of the Whig Party and advocate for the American System]]
The "[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]" was the name given by [[Henry Clay]] in a speech before Congress advocating an economic program&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/AmericanSystem.pdf The Senate 1789–1989 Classic Speeches 1830–1993] Volume three, Bicentennial edition, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington&lt;/ref&gt; based on the economic philosophy derived from Alexander Hamilton's economic theories (see [[Report on Manufactures]], [[Report on Public Credit]] I and II). Clay's policies called for a high [[tariff]] to support [[internal improvements]] such as road-building, and a national bank to encourage productive enterprise and to form a national currency as Hamilton had advocated as Secretary of the Treasury.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Clay first used the term "American System" in 1824, although he had been working for its specifics for many years previously. Portions of the American System were enacted by Congress. The Second Bank of the United States was rechartered in 1816 for 20 years. High tariffs were maintained from the days of Hamilton until 1832. However, the national system of internal improvements was never adequately funded; the failure to do so was due in part to sectional jealousies and constitutional scruples about such expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h278.html|title=Ideas and Movements: American System" U-S-History.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clay's plan became the leading tenet of the [[National Republican Party]] of John Quincy Adams and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] of himself and Daniel Webster.

The "American System" was supported by New England and the Mid-Atlantic, which had a large manufacturing base. It protected their new factories from foreign competition.

The South opposed the "American System" because its [[Planter (American South)|plantation owners]] were heavily reliant on production of cotton for export, and the American System produced lower demand for their cotton and created higher costs for manufactured goods. After 1828 the United States kept tariffs low until the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1861.

===Executive opposition to the American System by the Jacksonians===
Opposition to the economic nationalism embodied by Henry Clay's American System came primarily from the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, Martin van Buren, and James K. Polk. These three presidents styled themselves as the peoples' politicians, seeking to protect both the agrarian frontier culture and the strength of the Union. Jackson in particular, the founder of the movement, held an unflinching commitment to what he viewed as the sanctity of the majority opinion. In his first annual message to Congress, Jackson proclaimed that "the first principle of our system [is] that the majority govern".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Presidents|year=2000|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|pages=83|author=Russell L. Riley|authorlink=Andrew Jackson: 1829–1837|editor=Melvin I. Urofsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology governed Jackson's actions throughout his presidency, and heavily influenced his protégé Martin van Buren as well as the final Jacksonian president, James K. Polk.

This commitment to the majority and to the voiceless came in direct conflict with many elements of the American System. The Jacksonian presidents saw key tenets of the American System, including the support for the Second Bank of the United States and advocacy of protectionist tariffs, as serving moneyed or special interests rather than the majority of Americans. The Jacksonians opposed other elements of Clay's ideology, including support for internal infrastructural improvements, on the grounds that they represented governmental overstretch as well. Several key events, legislative conflicts, and presidential vetoes shaped the substantive opposition to the American System.

====The Second Bank of the United States and the Bank War====
The first and most well-known battle between Jacksonians and Clay focused on the struggle over renewing the charter of the Second Bank of the United States. In Andrew Jackson's first annual message to Congress in 1829, he declared that "[b]oth the constitutionality and the expediency of the law creating this bank are well questioned by a large portion of our fellow-citizens, and it must be admitted by all that it has failed in the great end of establishing a uniform and sound currency".&lt;ref name="Russell L. Riley 2000 87"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Presidents|year=2000|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|pages=87|author=Russell L. Riley|authorlink=Andrew Jackson: 1829–1837|editor=Melvin I. Urofsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further attacked the proponents of renewing the bank's charter, scathingly referring to the "stockholders" seeking a renewal of their "privileges".&lt;ref name="Russell L. Riley 2000 87"/&gt;

This rhetoric, portraying the supporters of the bank as privileged individuals, and claiming the opposition of "a large portion of our fellow-citizens" crystallizes Jackson's majoritarian distaste for the special interest serving economic nationalism embodied in the American System. Jackon's Secretary of the Treasury Roger B. Taney effectively summed up Jackson's opposition to the Second Bank of the United States: ""It is a fixed principle of our political institutions to guard against the unnecessary accumulation of power over persons and property in any hands. And no hands are less worthy to be trusted with it than those of a moneyed corporation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Presidents|year=2000|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|pages=89|author=Russell L. Riley|authorlink=Andrew Jackson: 1829–1837|editor=Melvin I. Urofsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sides of the debate became even more starkly defined as a result of the actions of Second Bank President Nicholas Biddle and Henry Clay himself. Upon hearing of Jackson's distaste for his bank, Biddle immediately set about opening new branches of the bank in key political districts in hopes of manipulating Congressional opinion.&lt;ref name="Russell L. Riley 2000 88"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Presidents|year=2000|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|pages=88|author=Russell L. Riley|authorlink=Andrew Jackson: 1829–1837|editor=Melvin I. Urofsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this action indeed helped acquire the votes necessary to pass the bill in Congress, it enraged Jackson. Jackson saw this manipulation as clear evidence of the penchant of a national bank to serve private, non-majoritarian interests.&lt;ref name="Russell L. Riley 2000 88"/&gt;

Henry Clay's American System supported the necessity for central institutions to "take an activist role in shaping and advancing the nation's economic development".&lt;ref name="Russell L. Riley 2000 88"/&gt; The bank thus fit well into Clay's worldview, and he took advantage of Biddle's manipulation in order to pass the renewal bill through Congress, despite expecting Jackson's inevitable veto. Clay hoped that when Jackson vetoed the bill, it would more clearly differentiate the two sides of the debate which Clay then sought to use to his advantage in running for president.&lt;ref name="Russell L. Riley 2000 88"/&gt;  With battle lines set, Jackson's majoritarian opposition to the Second Bank of the United States helped him be elected to a second term.

====The Tariff Question====
The question of protective tariffs championed by the American System proved one of the trickiest for Jacksonian presidents. Tariffs disproportionately benefited the industrial interests of the North while causing great injury to the trade-dependent agrarian South and West. As a result, the issue proved extremely divisive to the nation's unity, something Jacksonian presidents sought to protect at all costs. The Jacksonian presidents, particularly the southern-born Jackson, had to be extremely cautious when lowering tariffs in order to maintain their support in the North.&lt;ref name="Russell L. Riley 2000 92"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Presidents|year=2000|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|pages=92|author=Russell L. Riley|authorlink=Andrew Jackson: 1829–1837|editor=Melvin I. Urofsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the tariffs indeed represented an economic nationalism that primarily benefited the Northern States, while increasing the cost of European imports in the South. This ran strongly contrary to Jacksonian ideals. In the end, despite Northern objections, both President Jackson and President Polk lowered tariffs. Jackson reformed the Tariff of 1828 (also known as the Tariff of Abominations) by radically reducing rates in the Tariff of 1832. This helped stave off the Southern nullification crisis, in which Southern states refused to enact the tariff, and threatened secession if faced with governmental coercion.&lt;ref name="Russell L.

The bill that reduced the Tariff of 1828 was co-authored by Henry Clay in a desperate attempt to maintain national unity.&lt;ref name="Russell L. Riley 2000 92"/&gt;  Polk, on the other hand, in his characteristically efficient way, managed to push through significant tariff reductions in the first 18 months of his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Presidents|year=2000|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|pages=125|author=Wayne Cutler|authorlink=James Knox Polk: 1845–1849|editor=Melvin I. Urofsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition to government-financed internal improvements====
The final bastion of Jacksonian opposition to Clay's American System existed in relation to the use of government funds to conduct internal improvements. The Jacksonian presidents feared that government funding of such projects as roads and canals exceeded the mandate of the federal government and should not be undertaken.&lt;ref name="David J. Bodenhamer 2000 106"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Presidents|year=2000|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|pages=106|author=David J. Bodenhamer|authorlink=Martin Van Buren: 1837–1841|editor=Melvin I. Urofsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Buren believed very strongly that "[t]he central government, unlike the states, had no obligation to provide relief or promote the general welfare.&lt;ref name="David J. Bodenhamer 2000 106"/&gt;

This stance kept faith with the tenets of Jeffersonian republicanism, notably its agrarianism and strict constructionism, to which van Buren was heir".&lt;ref name="David J. Bodenhamer 2000 106"/&gt; As heir to the legacy of Van Buren and Jackson, Polk was similarly hostile to internal improvement programs, and used his presidential veto to prevent such projects from reaching fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Presidents|year=2000|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|pages=128|author=Wayne Cutler|authorlink=James Knox Polk: 1845-1849|editor=Melvin I. Urofsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
An extra session of congress was called in the summer of 1841 for a restoration of the American system. When the tariff question came up again in 1842, the compromise of 1833 was overthrown, and the protective system placed in the ascendant.

Due to the dominance of the then [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] of [[Martin Van Buren|Van Buren]], [[James K. Polk|Polk]], and [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] the American School was not embraced as the economic philosophy of the United States until the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, who, with a series of laws during the [[American Civil War]], was able to fully implement what [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]], [[Henry Clay|Clay]], [[Friedrich List|List]], and [[Henry C. Carey|Carey]] theorized, wrote about, and advocated.

[[File:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|thumb|174px|[[Abraham Lincoln]], an "Old Henry Clay tariff Whig" by his own definition, enacted much of the American School's core policies into law during his tenure as President from 1861 through 1865]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as Lincoln took office, the old Whig coalition finally controlled the entire government. It immediately tripled the average tariff, began to subsidize the construction of a transcontinental railroad in California even though a desperate war was being waged, and on February 25, 1862, the Legal Tender Act empowered the secretary of the treasury to issue paper money ('greenbacks') that were not immediately redeemable in gold or silver.&lt;ref name = "US History 256"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Richardson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Boritt"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United States continued these policies throughout the later half of the 19th century.

President [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses S Grant]] acknowledged the perceived efficacy of tariff protection in reference to Britain's success during the [[Industrial Revolution]], when tariff rates on manufactures peaked at 57%:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For centuries England has relied on protection, has carried it to extremes and has obtained satisfactory results from it. There is no doubt that it is to this system that it owes its present strength.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

President [[William McKinley]] (1897–1901) stated at the time:

{{quote|[They say] if you had not had the Protective Tariff things would be a little cheaper. Well, whether a thing is cheap or dear depends upon what we can earn by our daily labor. Free trade cheapens the product by cheapening the producer. Protection cheapens the product by elevating the producer. Under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man.

[It is said] that protection is immoral ... Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [the U.S. population] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates the rest of the world. We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefitting mankind everywhere. Well, they say, 'Buy where you can buy the cheapest' ... Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: 'Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.&lt;ref&gt;William McKinley speech, October 4, 1892 in Boston, MA William McKinley Papers (Library of Congress)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American System was important in the election politics for and against [[Grover Cleveland]],&lt;ref name = "Andrews"/&gt; the first Democrat elected after the Civil War, who, by reducing tariffs protecting American industries in 1893, began rolling back federal involvement in economic affairs, a process that continued until [[Herbert Hoover]]'s "too little, too late" attempts to deal with the worsening [[Great Depression]].

===Evolution===
As the United States entered the 20th century, the American School was the policy of the United States under such names as American Policy, [[economic nationalism]], National System,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=The National System of Political Economy| author=List, Friedrich |date=1841 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protective System, Protection Policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fnora%2Fnora0030%2F&amp;tif=00167.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABQ7578-0030-8|title=cornell.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protectionism, which alludes only to the tariff policy of this system of economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fscri%2Fscri0019%2F&amp;tif=00190.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DAFR7379-0019-20|title=cornell.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cornell 76"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fnora%2Fnora0147%2F&amp;tif=00490.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABQ7578-0147-76|title=cornell.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cornell 2"&gt;[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fmono%2Ffoot0012%2F&amp;tif=00264.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DAHS0062-0002 cornell.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cornell 50"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cornell 49"&gt;[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fnwng%2Fnwng0014%2F&amp;tif=00403.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABQ0722-0014-49 cornell.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;

This continued until 1913 when the administration of [[Woodrow Wilson]] initiated his [[The New Freedom]] policy that replaced the National Bank System with the Federal Reserve System, and lowered tariffs to revenue-only levels with the Underwood Tariff.

The election of [[Warren G. Harding]] and the Republican Party in 1920 represented a partial return to the American School through restoration of high tariffs.  A subsequent further return was enacted as President [[Herbert Hoover]] responded to the 1929 crash and the subsequent bank failures and unemployment by signing the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]], which some economists considered to have deepened the [[Great Depression]], while others disagree.&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;Gill, William J. ''Trade Wars Against America: A History of United States Trade and Monetary Policy'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Deal]] continued infrastructure improvements through the numerous public works projects of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as well as the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA); brought massive reform to the banking system of the Federal Reserve while investing in various ways in industry to stimulate production and control speculation; but abandoned protective tariffs while embracing moderate tariff protection (revenue based 20–30% the normal tariff under this) through [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], choosing to subsidized industry as a replacement. At the close of World War II, the United States now dominant in manufacturing with little competition, the era of free trade had begun.&lt;ref&gt;Lind, Michael: "Free Trade Fallacy" by Michael Lind, New America Foundation.] "Like Britain, the U.S. protected and subsidised its industries while it was a developing country, switching to free trade only in 1945, when most of its industrial competitors had been wiped out by the Second World War and the U.S. enjoyed a virtual monopoly in many manufacturing sectors." [https://web.archive.org/web/20060106154801/http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=1080 New America Foundation, – "Free Trade Fallacy" January 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 when the "Kennedy" Round concluded under President [[Richard Nixon]], who cut U.S. tariffs to all time lows, the New Deal orientation towards reciprocity and subsidy ended, which moved the United States further in the [[free market]] direction, and away from its American School economic system.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ravi Batra, "The Myth of Free Trade": "Unlike most of its trading partners, real wages in the United States have been tumbling since 1973, the first year of the country's switch to laissez-faire." (pp. 126–27)  "Before 1973, the U.S. economy was more or less closed and self-reliant, so that efficiency gains in industry generated only a modest price fall, and real earnings soared for all Americans." (pp. 66–67)  "Moreover, it turns out that 1973 was the first year in its entire history when the United States became an open economy with free trade." (p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lind, Michael:"The revival of Europe and Japan by the 1970s eliminated these monopoly profits, and the support for free trade of industrial-state voters in the American midwest and northeast declined. Today, support for free-trade globalism in the U.S. comes chiefly from the commodity-exporting south and west and from U.S. multinationals which have moved their factories to low-wage countries like Mexico and China." [https://web.archive.org/web/20060106154801/http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=1080 New America Foundation, "Free Trade Fallacy"  January 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

During her working life, Flores devoted herself entirely to the business of the mining equipment and construction company Whenhell, of which she was general manager and owner from age 27, from 1979 to 1984.&lt;ref name=mirada/&gt; She was also a representative of the companies Renardet Ingenieurs from 1984 to 1992, Santi Consulting from 1990 to 1997, and Iberinsa from 1992 to 1998. Flores was also owner of the investment group Cristal from 1995 until its end in 2002.&lt;ref name=NB&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.inesad.edu.bo/pdf/edicionimpresaNuevaBolivia.pdf |title=Ana María Flores |work=Nueva Bolivia |page=16 |language=Spanish |access-date=6 November 2017 |via=INESAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
At age 50, Flores was invited by [[Manfred Reyes Villa]]'s [[New Republican Force]] to participate in the elections, where she won the position of senator for [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz Department]] in the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref name=colombianos&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.la-razon.com/index.php?_url=/ciudades/seguridad_ciudadana/Exsenadora-Ana-Maria-Flores-secuestrada_0_1711628905.html |title=Dos colombianos y un boliviano están implicados en el secuestro de la exsenadora Ana María Flores |trans-title=Two Colombians and One Bolivian Are Implicated in the Kidnapping of the Ex-Senator Ana María Flores |last=Pérez |first=Mariana |work=[[La Razón (La Paz)|La Razón]] |location=La Paz |language=Spanish |date=24 October 2012 |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However she left the party after the [[Bolivian gas conflict|gas conflict]] in 2003, during the second government of president [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] (2002–2003).&lt;ref name=NB/&gt;

During this time, Flores joined the "Transversal Group", a number of senators who had resigned from their respective political parties after the gas conflict. Flores contributed by denouncing several instances of nepotism in the Bolivian congress. She held her senatorial position until 2005.&lt;ref name=NB/&gt;

Four years after leaving office, at age 57, Flores ran for president in the 2009 general election with the [[United Social Patriotic Movement]].&lt;ref name=colombianos/&gt; She finished fifth with 23,257 votes (0.51% of the general vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lostiempos.com/ustedelige/coyuntura/coyuntura/20091201/ana-flores-quiere-hacer-lo-que-“ningun-hombre”_47802_83134.html |title=Ana Flores quiere hacer lo que 'ningún hombre' pudo |trans-title=Ana Flores Wants to Do What 'No Man' Could |last=María Julia |first=Osorio M. |work=[[Los Tiempos]] |language=Spanish |date=1 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204014140/http://www.lostiempos.com/ustedelige/coyuntura/coyuntura/20091201/ana-flores-quiere-hacer-lo-que-%E2%80%9Cningun-hombre%E2%80%9D_47802_83134.html |archive-date=4 December 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidnapping===
In 2012, at age 60, Flores was kidnapped by a gang in the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]. According to some Bolivian media, she paid a ransom for her release (she never disclosed the amount of money), thus regaining her freedom. The report of her abduction would become national news.&lt;ref name=colombianos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eldiario.net/noticias/2015/2015_02/nt150209/politica.php?n=59&amp;-desarrollo-y-seguridad-ciudadana-para-la-paz |title=Desarrollo y seguridad ciudadana para La Paz |trans-title=Development and Citizen Security For La Paz |work=[[El Diario (La Paz)|El Diario]] |language=Spanish |date=9 February 2015 |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, at age 63, Flores returned to Bolivian politics, but this time participating in regional elections for the position of mayor of the city of [[La Paz]] for the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]]. She lost in subnational elections held on 29 March.&lt;ref name=mirada/&gt;

'''Academic analytics''' is basically defined as the process of evaluating and analysing organisational data received from university systems for reporting and decision making reasons (Campbell, &amp; Oblinger, 2007). According to Campbell &amp; Oblinger (2007), accrediting agencies, governments, parents and students are all calling for the adoption of new modern and efficient ways of improving and monitoring student success. This has ushered the higher education system into an era characterised by increased scrutiny from the various stakeholders. For instance, the Bradley review acknowledges that benchmarking activities such as student engagement serve as indicators for gauging the institution’s quality (Commonwealth Government of Australia, 2008). 

Increased competition, accreditation, assessment and regulation are the major factors encouraging the adoption of   analytics in   higher education. Although institutions of higher learning gather a lot of vital data that can significantly aid in solving problems like attrition and retention, the collected data is not being analysed adequately and hence translated into useful data (Goldstein, 2005.) Subsequently, higher education leadership are forced to make critical and vital decisions based on inadequate information that could be achieved by properly utilising and analysing the available data (Norris, Leonard, &amp; strategic Initiatives Inc., 2008). This gives rise to strategic problems. This setback also depicts itself at the tactical level. Learning and teaching at institutions of higher education if often a diverse and complex experience. Each and every teacher, student or course is quite different. However, LMS is tasked with taking care of them all. LMS is at the centre of academic analytics. It records each and every student and staff’s information and results in a click within the system. When this crucial information is added, compared and contrasted with different enterprise information systems provides the institution with a vast array of useful information that can be harvested to gain a competitive edge (Dawson &amp; McWilliam, 2008; Goldstein, 2005; Heathcoate &amp; Dawson, 2005).

In order to retrieve meaningful information from institution sources i.e. LMS, the information has to be correctly interpreted against a basis of educational efficiency, and this action requires   analysis from people with learning and teaching skills. Therefore, a collaborative approach is required from both the people guarding the data and those who will interpret it, otherwise the data will remain to be a total waste (Baepler &amp; Murdoch, 2010). Decision making at its most basic level is based on presumption or intuition (a person can make conclusions and decisions based on experience without having to do data analysis) (Siemens &amp; Long, 2011). However, a lot of decisions made at institutions of higher learning are too vital to be based on anecdote, presumption or intuition since significant decisions need to be backed by data and facts.

Analytics, which is often termed as business intelligence,  has   come out as new software and hardware that enables businesses to gather and analyse large amounts of information or data. The analytics process is made up of gathering, analysing, data manipulation and employing the results to answer critical questions such as ‘why’. Analytics was first applied in the admissions department in higher education institutions. The institutions normally used some formulas to choose students from a large pool of applicants. These formulas drew their information from high school transcripts and standardized test scores. In today’s world, analytics is commonly used in administrative units such as fund raising and admissions. The use and application of academic analytics is meant to grow due to the ever-increasing concerns about student success and accountability. Academic analytics primarily marries complex and vast data with [[predictive modelling]] and statistical techniques to better decision making. Current academic analytics initiatives are bent to use data to predict students experiencing difficulty (Arnold, &amp; Pistilli, 2012, April). This allows advisors and faculty members to intervene by tailoring procedures which will meet the student’s learning needs (Arnold, 2010). As such, academic analytics possesses the ability to improve learning, student success and teaching. Analytics has become a valuable tool for institutions because of its ability to predict, model and improve decision making.

== Analytic Steps ==

Analysis is made up of five basic steps: capture, report, predict, act and refine
Capture: All analytic efforts are centred on data. Consequently, academic analytics can be rooted in data from various sources such as a CMS, and financial systems (Campbell, Finnegan,  &amp; Collins, 2006). Additionally, the data comes in various different formats for example spread sheets. Also, data can be got from the institution’s external environment. To capture data, academic analytics needs to determine the type of available data, methods of harnessing it and the formats it is in. 
Report: After the data has been captured and stored in a central location, analysts will examine the data, perform queries, identify patterns, trends and exceptions depicted by the data. The standard deviation and mean (descriptive statistics) are mostly generated.

Predict: After analysing the warehoused data through the use of statistics, a predictive model is developed. These models vary depending on the question nature and type of data. To develop a probability, these models employ statistical regression concepts and techniques. Predictions are made after the use of statistical algorithms.

Act:  The major goal and aim of  analytics is to enable the institution to take actions based on the probabilities and predictions made. These actions might vary from invention to information. The interventions to address problems might be in the form of a personal email, phone call or an automated contact from faculty advisors about study resources and skills, such as office hours or help sessions. Undoubtedly, institutions have to come up with appropriate mechanisms for impact measurement; such as did the students actually respond or attend the help sessions when invited.
Refine: Academic analytics should also be made up of a process aimed at self-improvement. Statistics processes should be continually updated since the measurement of project impacts is not a one-time static effort but rather a continual effort. For instance, admission analytics should be updated or revised yearly. 

===Comprehending Involved Stakeholders===
Analytics affects  executive officers, students, faculty members, IT staff and student affairs staff. Whereas students will be keen to know academic analytics will affect their grades, faculty members will be interested in finding out how the information and data can be appropriated for other purposes (Pistilli,  Arnold &amp; Bethune, 2012). Moreover, the institution staff will be focussed on finding how the analysis will enable them to effectively accomplish their jobs while the institution president will be focussed on freshman retention and increase in graduation rates.

== Criticisms ==

Analytics have   been criticised for various reasons such as profiling. Their main use is to profile students into successful and unsuccessful categories. However, some individuals argue that profiling of students tends to bias people’s behaviours and expectations (Ferguson, 2012). Additionally, there is no clear guidelines on which profiling issues should be prohibited or allowed in institutions of higher learning.

==Organization==

ANAN was founded on 1 January 1979 and was incorporated on 28 September 1983. The Association was chartered on 25 August 1993 by Decree 76 of 1993.&lt;ref name=paccount20101118/&gt;
The governing council of ANAN is elected by its members.
It includes representatives of the Auditors General of the Federation, State and Local Government, and representatives of universities and polytechnics.&lt;ref name=cipfa201103/&gt;

Before being admitted to ANAN members must undertake academic studies, including one year at ANAN’s Nigerian College of Accountancy, followed by a two-year practical accountant-in-training program, leading to qualification as a [[Certified National Accountant]].
ANAN members must comply with its Professional Code of Conduct, which complies with [[International Federation of Accountants]] requirements.&lt;ref name=cipfa201103/&gt;
As of December 2007 ANAN had total membership of 10,260.&lt;ref name=paccount20101118/&gt;
By December 2010 membership had grown to 16,207.&lt;ref name=DChampion20110518/&gt;



ANAN was admitted as a member of the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria on 7 December 2010.&lt;ref name=DChampion20110518/&gt;
ANAN is also a member of the [[Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria]] (FRCN), which sets accounting standards for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Educational activities==

Both ANAN and its rival ICAN, as well as the CITN ([[Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria]]), have been criticized for not providing enough training to members at subsidized rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, ANAN operates a training school for accountants in [[Jos]], [[Plateau State]].&lt;ref name=Odiakose20091206/&gt;
At a ceremony in March 2006 the President of ANAN, Professor E. R. Iwok, laid the foundation stone of an ultra-modern auditorium for the [[Nigerian College of Accountancy]]. 
He said that ANAN planned to build the leading accountancy campus in Africa and to make Jos the Mecca of the accountancy profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As of March 2011 the college, which was attracting growing numbers of students from other countries in Africa, was still operating out of temporary facilities.
The only buildings completed at the permanent site were two large examination halls with capacity of 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Competing organizations==

In its charter, the government gave ANAN the authority needed to compete with ICAN. By 1994 the two organizations were fighting for control of the Chartered Accountants profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2002 ICAN applied to the courts to disqualify and/or bar Mr Clement Akpamgbo from representing ANAN, and the matter was referred to a lower court. ANAN appealed the decision, but the appeal was dismissed for lack of merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In March 2009, ANAN President Dr Samuel Nzekwe rejected an attempt by ICAN to set auditing standards for its members.
He said that the Nigerian Accounting Standards Board (NASB) Act 2003 said that only the board could set standards for the accounting profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In December 2009 were delays in passage by the [[Senate of Nigeria|Senate]] of bills on the Institute of Chartered Public Accountants (CPA) and the Chartered Institute of Management and Cost Accountants (CIMCA).&lt;ref name=Odiakose20091206/&gt;
The bills had been approved by both houses during the administration of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], but he had failed to sign them into law before the end of his term.  As a result, President [[Umaru Yar'Adua]] had to resubmit the bills when he took office in 2007.&lt;ref name=Odiakose20100311/&gt;
ANAN did not object to the new organizations but ICAN expressed concerns on the grounds of proliferation.&lt;ref name=Odiakose20091206/&gt;

In May 2012, ICAN President Prof. Francis Ojaide, has said the body and the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria have smoothed their relationship for the benefit of the nation’s economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Speaking in August 2009, the ANAN President Chief (Mrs). Iyamide Gafar criticized the recent dismissal of the heads of five banks as being selective, with just five scapegoats. Saying that the problems were more widespread, she also advocated more frequent rotation of accountants and auditors between banks to prevent them from getting too close to management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It has approximately 700 member agencies and works in collaboration with the [[Government of Bangladesh]].

Manpower export from Bangladesh was pioneered in 1976. Since then, International Recruiting or Placement Agents under BAIRA have recruited 5.5 million&lt;ref name="employed overseas"&gt;{{cite news |title=Figure of Bangladeshis working overseas |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=95584 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximate, 2009) Bangladeshis for jobs abroad. This resulted in record highest remittance inflow and foreign exchange earned of US$ 10 billion&lt;ref name="remittance"&gt;{{cite news |title=Remittance from Manpower sector in fiscal year 2008-9 |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=95584 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (net) for the fiscal year 2008-9, making migrant workers the leading contributor to Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserve.

==History and background==
Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) is one of the largest trade bodies in Bangladesh affiliated with the [[Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry]] (FBCCI), established in 1984. Currently BAIRA has about 1100+ Government Approved Recruiting Agents as its members.

While the opposition promised BAIRA Airlines serving international flights for in and outbound workers. The election recorded highest number of member attendance and votes cast.

Ghulam Mustafa and his 'Sammilita Ganatantrik Front' won 26 seats.

Migrant workers brought value addition to the workforce even.

Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-0936-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United Kingdom]] whose job was to separate impurities from [[coal]] by hand in a [[coal breaker]]. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys.&lt;ref&gt;This gave rise to a saying among coal miners: "Once an adult, twice a boy."

==Coal breaking==
[[File:Charles Green06.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"Breaker boy"&lt;br /&gt;by [[Charles Green (painter)|Charles Green]]]]
Coal came into wide use in late 1590s in the United Kingdom after the island nation was widely deforested and a ban was placed on the harvesting of wood by [[Charles I of England]] so that forests could be used solely by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="Connections"&gt;Burke, James. ''Connections.'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, 1978, {{ISBN|0-316-11685-8}}. p. 163-170.&lt;/ref&gt; A newly emergent [[middle class]] increasingly demanded [[glass]] for windows, and the glass-making industry relied heavily on [[charcoal]] for fuel. With charcoal no longer available, this industry turned to coal. Demand for coal also increased after the invention of the [[reverbatory furnace]] and the development of methods for casting iron objects such as cannons.&lt;ref name="Connections"/&gt;

The first function of a coal breaker is to break coal into pieces and sort these pieces into categories of nearly uniform size, a process known as breaking.&lt;ref name="Ketchum"&gt;Ketchum, Milo Smith. ''The Design of Mine Structures.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; But coal is often mixed with impurities such as rock, [[slate]], [[sulphur]], ash (or "bone"), [[clay]], or soil.&lt;ref name="Ketchum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ash are impurities such as [[alumina]], [[iron]], [[silica]], and other noncombustible materials. See: [http://www.photius.com/energy/ "Ash." ''Dictionary of Energy.'' June 30, 2007.] Accessed 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the second function of a coal breaker is to remove as many impurities as economically desirable and technologically feasible, and then grade the coal based on the percent of impurities remaining.&lt;ref name="Ketchum" /&gt; This was not necessary when coal was used in cottage-industry grade production methods, but became necessary when economies of scale moved production into early factories with a larger workforce and those installations began producing glass and iron in greater quantities.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the U.S. prior to 1830, very little [[bituminous coal]] was mined and the fuel of the early [[American Industrial Revolution]]&amp;mdash; [[anthracite coal]] underwent little processing before being sent to market, which was primarily iron works and smithies producing [[wrought iron]]. The miner himself would use a sledgehammer to break up large lumps of coal, then use a rake whose teeth were set two inches apart to collect the larger pieces of coal for shipment to the surface&lt;ref name="Korson"&gt;Korson, George Gershon. ''Black Rock: Mining Folklore of the Pennsylvania Dutch.'' Manchester, N.H.: Ayer Publishing, 1950. {{ISBN|0-405-10607-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; for such were easiest to pack densely in the sack-like bags that could be slung over the back, or onto a pack animal for the trip out of the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
 
The smaller lumps of coal were considered non-marketable and left in the mine.&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt; Beginning about 1830, surface processing of coal in the US began concurrent with various canal projects in Eastern Seaboard. These developments lagged behind Great Britain better matching the timing of similar developments in Continental Europe. Great Britain with its heavily deforested landscapes simply had to find economic alternatives sooner, stimulating Coal, Iron, and machine developments leading ultimately to Railroads and the infant [[industrial chemical]]s industries of the 1860s. Lumps of coal were placed on plates of perforated [[cast iron]] and "breakers" would hammer on the coal until it was in pieces small enough to fall through the holes.&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt; A second screen caught the coal, and was shaken (by hand, animal, steam, or water power) to remove the unmarketable smaller lumps.&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt; This "broken and screened" coal was worth much more than "broken" coal or lump coal&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt; for the even sizes combusted with less trouble and need for tending once past the [[ignition point]].

==Use of breaker boys==
[[File:Boys picking slate from coal. packer -5 breaker.jpg|Breaker boys|thumb|right|Breaker boys in the 1880s picking slate from coal at a coal breaker in [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania]]. Photo by George Bretz, 1880s]]
Until about 1900, nearly all coal breaking facilities in the United States were labor-intensive. The removal of impurities was done by hand, usually by breaker boys between the ages of eight and 12 years old.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;Freedman, Russell. ''Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labor.'' Reprint ed. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1998. {{ISBN|0-395-79726-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"&gt;Batchelor, Bob.

''Nature and the Environment in Nineteenth-Century American Life.'' Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. {{ISBN|0-313-33201-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of breaker boys began around 1866.&lt;ref name="Derickson"&gt;Derickson, Alan. ''Black Lung: Anatomy of a Public Health Disaster.'' Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8014-3186-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Textbook"&gt;International Textbook Company. ''International Library of Technology: A Series of Textbooks for Persons Engaged in the Engineering Professions and Trades.'' Vol. 38. Scranton, Pa.: International Textbook Co., 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"&gt;Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William.

Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-2087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass on to the next breaker boy for further processing.&lt;ref name="Korson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartoletti, Susan Campbell. ''Growing Up in Coal Country.'' New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1999. {{ISBN|0-395-97914-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into "clean" [[coal bin]]s.&lt;ref name="Textbook"/&gt;

The work performed by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could better handle the slick coal.&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding.&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only at the end of the working day.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak"/&gt; Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and [[asthma]] and [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]] were common.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;When coal is mixed with water, a chemical reaction occurs that generates acid on the surface of the coal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, F.E. "Acid Pollution of Streams." ''Journal of the American Water Works Association.'' 1921; "Stimulation of Free Settling by Electrolysis." ''Mining and Metallurgy.'' January 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Anthony F.C. ''St. Clair, A Nineteenth-Century Coal Town's Experience With A Disaster-Prone Industry.''

==Public condemnation==
[[File:Pennsylvania breaker boys 1911.jpg|thumb|Breaker boys sort coal in an anthracite coal breaker near South [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]], 1911.]]

Public condemnation of the use of breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 [[Pennsylvania]] enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker,&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pencak"/&gt; Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt; One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880,&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt; 18,000 working in 1900,&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; 13,133 working in 1902,&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt; and 24,000 working in 1907.&lt;ref name="Picker"&gt;"Install Mechanical Slate Pickers." ''Technical World Magazine.'' September 1906-February 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys,&lt;ref name="Picker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1895/01/06/archives/a-great-and-efficient-coal-breaker-some-of-the-advantages-expected.html?sq=%22coal+breaker&amp;scp=46&amp;st=p "A Great and Efficient Coal Breaker."] ''New York Times.'' January 6, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; but adoption of the new technology was slow.&lt;ref name="Derickson"/&gt;

By the 1910s, the use of breaker boys was dropping because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the enactment of [[compulsory education]] laws.&lt;ref name="Hindman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt; The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of the efforts of the [[National Child Labor Committee]], [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[photographer]] [[Lewis Hine]], and the [[National Consumers League]], all of whom educated the public about the practice and succeeded in obtaining passage of [[Child labor laws in the United States|national child labor laws]].&lt;ref name="Hindman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, David and Wels, Susan. ''America Then &amp; Now: Great Old Photographs of America's Life and Times, and How Those Same Scenes Look Today.'' New York: HarperCollins, 1992. {{ISBN|0-06-250176-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union activities==
Breaker boys were known for their fierce independence and rejection of adult authority.&lt;ref name="Novak" /&gt; Breaker boys often formed and joined [[trade union]]s, and precipitated a number of important strikes in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Strikes"&gt;Blatz, Perry K. ''Democratic Miners: Work and Labor Relations in the Anthracite Coal Industry, 1875-1925.'' Ithaca, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-1819-7}}; Bartoletti, Susan Campbell. ''Kids on Strike!''

{{Accounting}}

A '''Comprehensive Annual Financial Report''' (CAFR) is a set of U.S. [[government financial statements]] comprising the financial report of a state, municipal or other governmental entity that complies with the accounting requirements promulgated by the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB).  GASB provides standards for the content of a CAFR in its annually updated publication ''Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Earl|title=Accounting for Governmental &amp; Nonprofit Entities|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|location=Page 13|isbn=0073379603|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Federal Government adheres to standards determined by the [[Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board]] (FASAB).

A CAFR is compiled by a state, municipal or other governmental accounting staff and audited by an external [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) certified accounting firm utilizing GASB requirements. It is composed of three sections: Introductory, Financial and Statistical.&lt;ref&gt;2005 Governmental Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; It combines the financial information of [[fund accounting]] and [[Government-sponsored enterprise|Enterprise Authorities]] accounting.

==History==
The National Committee on Municipal Accounting (NCMA) was formed in 1934 by the [[Government Financial Officers Association]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfoa.org/  Government Financial Officers Association] Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; to create accounting standards. As a result of its work, the 'Principles of Municipal Accounting', the predecessor to the CAFR, was created. The successor to the NCMA, the National Council on Governmental Accounting (NCGA), issued 'Governmental Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting', which is the basis of the format for the current standard. This document, known as the "Blue Book", and its successors documented the CAFR accounting structure and provided standardization and example documents. By 1946, the various [[Political divisions of the United States|levels of government]]—federal, state, local and municipal—each began producing a CAFR to catalog an accurate picture of institutional funds, enterprise or financial holdings, assets and [[Fixed income|total investment incomes]] for those government and nongovernmental entities using the report. This measure is above and beyond the budget process and replaced what was regularly an "off-the-books" practice called the "general [[Fixed asset|fixed-asset]] account group". General Purpose government "budget" reports did not reflect accounting of this financial data, only reporting on the budget or "rainy day" funds or pension fund investments. By the 1970s, the CAFR became the nationwide paradigm for local government accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/business-finance-encyclopedia/government-financial-reporting  "Government Financial Reporting."] Encyclopedia of Business and Finance. Ed. Allison McClintic Marion. Gale Cengage, 2001. eNotes.com. 2006. 18 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting CAFR is presented to the GFOA, which conducts each year a review of applicant local government CAFRs and upon review awards their Certificate of Achievement Award for Excellence in Financial Reporting to those local governments that are in compliance with their CAFR accounting standards of preparation. Presently, accounting principles for government entities are set by transmittal letters issued to local governments by the GASB.

==Differences between a general budget and a CAFR==
The primary difference between a budget and a CAFR is a budget is a plan for a specific fiscal period (often a year) primarily showing where tax income is to be allocated. The CAFR contains the results of the period (year) with previous years accumulations. A CAFR shows the total of all financial accounting that a general purpose budget reports does not. The CAFR contains a section that provides a comparison of period budget and actual. Additionally, the CAFR gives a detailed showing of investment accounts by category reflecting balances over previous years, or in plain language using a personal example in comparison would be the difference between: Your house Budget for the year vs your statement of "Net Worth" covering the financial accounting over your lifetime. 1-year vs your lifetime.

A Government budget document is a blueprint for a "specific grouping" of government agencies' spending over the course of an annual financial period. General Purpose Budgets contain both the spending categories of specified units of government, such as school districts, social services, transportation, courts, police, fire, and park services; along with estimates of revenues expected to occur during the year, such as investment return; due from other funds, overrides of money from the previous year, and tax payments. They are usually more limited to the expected costs of running the aforementioned [[government operations]] through tax income as opposed to describing the status of any government fixed assets and investment wealth.

A CAFR is a report of the complete overall financial results not just for the year but what has accumulated since the inception of that local government of both those "specific groupings" of government agencies that appear in the current fiscal year General Purpose Budget and all other agencies and departments. These can be autonomous, enterprise (for example government or city owned golf courses), recycling, water, sewer, and financial management - often these agencies were created with the inception of that local, state or government. The CAFR provides information about all of these other government agencies that may have their own budgets and separate investment accounts but their financial holdings are ''not'' combined with the general purpose '''budget''' that the same government presents to the public. The CAFR, or as it is called in CANADA CanFR can be used along with a budget document to compare the organizations total financial standing to the annual general purpose budget. The CAFR is the complete showing of the financial investment and income records from all sources, that reflects what has developed over decades whereas a budget report is an inferior document to the CAFR being that it is primarily focused on what revenue is expected to be brought in and spent for just the year.

In contrast with the rules applying to governments, publicly traded US companies are required by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), to provide their Annual Financial Report (AFR) to every shareholder each year. Government's accounting falls under GAP (Generally Accepted Procedures)overseen by GASB.org for government accounting. US Companies have their own standards of accounting which would not be accepted by the SEC if US Companies attempted to use local Government's GAP accounting. To view the GASB.org accounting changes in local government CAFR GAP accounting, a short version of each change going back to 1984 can be viewed here - &lt;ref&gt;[http://gasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=GASB%2FPage%2FGASBSectionPage&amp;cid=1176156669308 GFOA CAFR ACCOUNTING CHANGES]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Coverage &amp; Misconceptions ==


News stories covering financial issues of government cite "rainy day funds" or special "ear marked" funds, loans between government entities, sales of government holdings in, for example, shares of a health care insurance company, self insurance management funds, debt repayment funds that can be up to 40% of the debt itself, and then the "budget" is often referred to, along with mentions of pension funds investments, but the full accounting of assets of government entities, the "CAFR" is typically not mentioned.{{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}

"Alternative" media, since the late 1990s, has exposed segments of the public to the subject of the (U.S.) CAFR contributing to the topic being labeled as "conspiracy theory" or "soap box" issue. {{Citation needed|reason=Which alternative media are we talking about here? Who is labeling these things "conspiracy theory" or "soap box"?|date=September 2017}} In all reality, local government's "Net Worth" accounting document, the CAFR is a mandatory review document for any responsible taxpaying citizen.

Reporting on government financial issues can be seen as sensationalized in dealing with alleged excesses in spending or tucked away wealth held not clearly visible in the budgetary accounting. A $10,000 dollar Christmas tree for example, or vague mentions of "many billions" in referring to issues around the road improvement, self-insurance, debt repayment, and pension funds managed by a state. {{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}

The State of TX based on good due diligence to its residents publishes a "Cash Report" that lists all funds managed by the state. [http://www.texastransparency.org/State_Finance/Budget_Finance/Reports/Cash_Report/14/texas_annual_cash_report_2014.pdf The 2014 TX Cash Report] can be viewed here - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.texastransparency.org/State_Finance/Budget_Finance/Reports/Cash_Report/14/texas_annual_cash_report_2014.pdf where several thousand separate funds managed by the State of TX can be viewed.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one recent series of reports, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100131020023/http://www.kaco.org/Home.htm Kentucky Association of Counties] whose spending came under scrutiny by the [[Lexington Herald-Leader]] provided some awareness of these types of entities as well as their surpluses and the claimed spending excesses while using money acquired from government fees for products like municipal insurance at premium rates, which build surpluses beyond the needs of the entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentucky.com/2010/04/13/1222627/attorney-general-investigating.html Attorney general investigating KLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical topics of the alternative media may include examples of: government entities financing each other's bond issues; Orange County California's or other divisions of government investments in derivatives; financial deals that are kept from the public to entice businesses to locate in a state, which may include tax incentives in exchange for stock assets in a company. {{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}
 
Much of both the mainstream and alternative media coverage of the topic of government financial issues must be considered a factor in public's confidence towards issues of government [[accountability]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12899">'''Industrial dynamics''' is the study of the means and processes through which industries change over time, through their own processes of evolution – as first analyzed by [[Joseph Schumpeter]].  It is the complementary study to that of an industry’s comparative statics, which still dominates economic analysis.  Industrial dynamics, as studied by scholars such as Carlsson and Eliasson,&lt;ref&gt;Carlsson, B. 1997. Technological systems and industrial dynamics. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlsson, B. and G. Eliasson 2003. Industrial dynamics and endogenous growth, Industry and Innovation, 10 (4): 435-455.&lt;/ref&gt; reveal the basic underlying forces driving industry evolution.  Some industries, particularly those with rapid product turnover or high levels of capital expenditure, reveal special dynamics moving through intrinsic upturns and downturns that are not necessarily related to the wider economic fluctuations.  These are known as '''cyclical industrial dynamics'''. They have recently come under investigation in the specialized literature.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, H., &amp; Mathews, J. A. In Press.{{Update after|2018|3}} Identification and analysis of industry cycles.  Journal of Business Research. {{doi|10.1016/j.jbusres.2009.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tan, H., &amp; Mathews, J. A. In Press.{{Update after|2018|3}}  Cyclical Industrial Dynamics: The case of the global semiconductor industry. Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change. {{doi|10.1016/j.techfore.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence of industry cycles==
Almost all industries exhibit cyclicality to some extent. Below are some examples where industry cycles have been particularly examined.

===Commodities===
The research by [[John Sterman]] finds that the so-called commodity cycles arise in many commodity markets.&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, John D. 2000. Business Dynamics. Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, price and production cycles in markets of hog, cattle and copper span 4 years, 10–12 years and 8–10 years each in average respectively. Margret Slade estimates that cycles in prices of metals including aluminum, copper, iron, lead, silver, tin, and zinc are about 10–14 years in duration, which is twice as long as the investment periods.&lt;ref&gt;Slade, Margret E. 1982. Cycles in Natural-Resource Commodity Prices: An Analysis of the Frequency Domain. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 9:138-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study by Thomas Stanback indicates a persistent cycle of approximately two years duration in the textile industry in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanback, Thomas M. 1958. The textile cycle: Characteristics and contributing factors. Southern Economic Journal 25 (2):174-188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alajoutsijärvi and colleagues report that the cycle in the German paper industry has shortened in duration since 1990, and is now about two or three years in length.&lt;ref&gt;Alajoutsijärvi, K., M. B. Klint, and H. Tikkanen. 2001. Customer Relationship Strategies and the Smoothing of Industry-Specific Business Cycles: The Case of the Global Fine Paper Industry. Industrial Marketing Management 30:487-497&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durable goods===
Based on his observations of the explicit cyclical movement in the shipbuilding industry, Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Jan Tinbergen]] believes the so-called ‘durable goods cycle’ is a result of the lag of the upstream industries such as shipbuilding in response to the cycles in end users markets such as that in freight rates.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, Jan, and J. J. Polak. 1950. The dynamics of business cycles : a study in economic fluctuations. London: Routledge &amp; K. Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;  He further suggests that the cycle length of the upstream industry is four times the lag, and is about 17 years in the shipbuilding industry.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, J. 1981. Kondratiev cycles and so-called long waves: The early research. Futures 13 (4):258-263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the traditional industries, many new industries such as semiconductors, flat panel displays, computers and telecommunications also exhibit strong cyclicality.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Noam, E. M. 2006. Fundamental instability: Why telecom is becoming a cyclical and oligopolistic industry. Information Economics and Policy 18:272-284; 2005. Liu, W.-H. Determinants of the semiconductor industry cycles. Journal of Policy Modeling 27:853-866; Mathews, J. A. 2005. Strategy and the Crystal Cycle. California Management Review 47 (2):6-32; McClean, B. 2001. 2001 IC industry at the crossroads. Semiconductor International 24 (1):73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===
In the service sector, for example, Choi and colleagues date the industry cycles of the US hotel industry and restaurant industry.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, J.-G. 1999. The Restaurant Industry: Business Cycles, Strategic Financial Practices, Economic Indicators, and Forecasting. Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia; and Choi, J.-G., M. D. Olsen, F. A. Kwansa, and E. C.-Y. Tse. 1999. Forecasting industry turning points: the US hotel industry cycle model. Hospitality Management 18:159-170.&lt;/ref&gt;  They establish the mean duration of the business cycle, measured with aggregate activities in absolute level, as about 7.3 years for the U.S. hotel industry; and for the U.S. restaurant industry, as about 8 years.

==Industry cycles versus business cycles==
Cyclical dynamics at the level of individual industries may present rather different patterns from those of the general business cycles. For example, while the fluctuations of many industries correlate with those in the aggregate economy, there were also many industries that are not sensitive to business cycles — such as the pharmaceutical, educational service, insurance carriers and public service industries; some other industries such as the health service industry even enjoy higher growth during recessions.&lt;ref&gt;Berman J, Pfleeger J. 1997. Which industries are sensitive to business cycles. Monthly Labor Review 120(2): 19-26&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, it was estimated that "in any one recession [during the 1980s and the 1990s] only 60% of all industrial sectors were actually in a downturn."&lt;ref&gt;‘How was it for you?’ The Economist, 2001, Vol. 362: 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing, duration and amplitude of industry cycles can vary widely. Durable goods industries in the US are approximately three times more cyclical than nondurable-goods industries.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, B., and S. Strongin. 1996. Why are some industries more cyclical than others? Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics 14 (2):189-198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification and measurement of industry cycles==
Industry cycles have been identified using either the ‘classical cycle’ approach or the ‘growth cycle’ approach. The former approach uses time series in levels of economic activities to define cycles; and only absolute decline in the activities qualifies as a ‘downturn’.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnowitz, V., and A. Ozyildirim. 2002. Time series decomposition and measurement of business cycles, trend and growth cycles. In NBER Working Paper 8736. Cambridge, Massachusetts: National Bureau of Economic Research&lt;/ref&gt;

While this approach is consistent with the approach used by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) to identify business cycles in the US, cycles at the industry level are usually concealed by strong industry trends which dominate industrial series. Therefore industry cycles are more commonly identified using the ‘growth cycle’ approach, by separating the cyclical component of a time series from the underlying trend.

Combining the growth cycle approach and other econometric techniques such as the [[Hodrick-Prescott filter]], the industry cycles in the global semiconductor, PCs and flat panel display industries in the past decades are identified.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Hao 2007. Cyclical Industrial Dynamics: Identification and Analysis of Cyclical Bebaviour in Three IT Industries. Doctoral Dissertation, Macquarie Graduate School of Management, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry cycles can be further measured using techniques such as the [[Fourier analysis]]. For example, three most powerful cycles of the global semiconductor shipment data in the frequency domain are identified, with an average period of 4 years, 2.29 years, and 1.03 years accordingly (reverting to the original time domain).&lt;ref&gt;Tan, H., &amp; Mathews, J. A. In Press. Identification and analysis of industry cycles.Journal of Business Research. {{doi|10.1016/j.jbusres.2009.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers of industry cycles==
Three main mechanisms are suggested to be responsible for industry cycles, namely industry cycles caused by business cycles; industry cycles caused by mismatch and delay between different market dynamics including investment, capacity, price and sales; and industry cycles caused by the dynamics of innovation.

Many industries boom when the aggregate economy is prosperous and bust when the economy is in recession. In other words, industry cycles of many industries in a given country are correlated with the business cycles of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kandil, M. 1997. What differentiates industrial business cycles? A cross-country investigation. Applied Economics 29:197-212.&lt;/ref&gt;  For other industries, mismatch and delay between different dynamics in markets is another important mechanism causing industry cycles. The [[Bullwhip effect]] at firm-level &lt;ref&gt;See Forrester, J. W. 1961. Industrial Dynamics. MIT Press; and Senge, P. M. 1990. The Fifth Discipline. The Art &amp; Practise of The Learning Organization. London: Century Business&lt;/ref&gt; and game-like competition at industry-level &lt;ref&gt;See theory at Tirole, J. 1988. The theory of industrial organization. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; see applications at, for example, Dearden, J. A., G. L. Lilien, and E. Yoon. 1999. Marketing and production capacity strategy for non-differentiated products: Winning and losing at the capacity cycle game. International Journal of Research in Marketing 16:57-74&lt;/ref&gt; can cause the sequential boom-bust movement in price, sales, capacity and investment in many industries. Finally, uneven pace of technology change appears to be another main driver of industry cycles as sales in an industry are likely to peak after a ‘dominant design’ has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;see Anderson, P., and [[M. L. Tushman]]. 1990. Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: A cyclical model of technological change. Administrative Science Quarterly 35:604-633; and [[Tushman, M. L.]], and P. Anderson. 1986. Technological discontinuities and organizational environments. Administrative Science Quarterly 31 (3):439-465.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic implications of industry cycles==
Some industrial dynamics can be better understood through the lens of industry cycles. For example, it has been found that industries become more concentrated during the industry cycle downturns.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, H., &amp; Mathews, J. A. In Press. Cyclical Industrial Dynamics: The case of the global semiconductor industry. Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change. {{doi|10.1016/j.techfore.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is consistent with the theory of [[Joseph Schumpeter]] which views downturns as providing a mechanism of ‘cleansing’ which allocates the resources to stronger competitors in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, J. A. 1939. Business Cycles: A theoretical, historical and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclical industrial dynamics constitute a key strategic setting for firms and thus bring many important implications to strategy-making of firms. For example, in the highly cyclical oil-well drilling industry, it has been suggested that, first, companies did adjust their strategic activities such as capital expenditure and asset allocation according to the stage of the cycle, and second, ‘optimal’ strategies varied across cycle stages.&lt;ref&gt;Mascarenhas, B., and D. A. Aaker. 1989. Strategy over the business cycle. Strategic Management Journal 10:199-210.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the highly cyclical flat panel display industry, where there have been five upturns and downturns since the industry began in 1990, John Mathews demonstrated that there is a striking pattern in firms’ entry behavior, where not a single successful entry was engineered during an industry upturn.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, J. A. 2005. Strategy and the Crystal Cycle. California Management Review 47 (2):6-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the marketing literature, the pattern where firms are found to utilize recessions as times to enhance the standing of their brand, has also been noted.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Srinivasan R, Rangaswamy A, Lilien GL. 2005. Turning adversity into advantage: Does proactive marketing during a recession pay off? International Journal of Research in Marketing 22: 109-125&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desmond John Schonegevel''' (born 9 October 1934) is a former [[cricketer]] who played 100 matches of [[first-class cricket]] in [[South Africa]] between 1954 and 1977.

==For Orange Free State==
A solid middle-order batsman and off-spin bowler, Des Schonegevel made his first-class debut for [[Free State cricket team|Orange Free State]] in the 1954-55 season and played regularly for Orange Free State until the end of the 1964-65 season. His highest score for Orange Free State was 151 against [[Border cricket team|Border]] in 1963-64, made in a little over six hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/26/26572.html | title = Border v Orange Free State 1963-64| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his best figures were 6 for 103 against [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]] in 1958-59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/23/23352.html | title = Griqualand West v Orange Free State 1958-59| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Captain (cricket)|captained]] Orange Free State from 1962-63 to 1964-65. Against [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal B]] in 1959-60 he scored 115, adding 280 for the third wicket with his captain, [[Clive Richardson]], and setting a Currie Cup third-wicket record.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Cricketer]]'', Spring Annual, 1960, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==For Griqualand West==
He moved to [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in 1965 and played for [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]] from 1965-66 until 1975-76, captaining them in 1968-69. In his third match for Griqualand West he top-scored in each innings with 79 not out and 138 not out against [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal B]]; in the second innings he and the number 11 batsman put on an unbroken partnership of 87 to avoid defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/27/27945.html | title = Griqualand West v Natal B 1965-66| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966-67 his 112 against Orange Free State helped Griqualand West achieve their first victory since 1959-60.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1968, pp. 926–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Against the [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 1969–70|Australians in 1969-70]] he top-scored in each innings, scoring 49 and 85, defying the Australian spin bowlers "with dour concentration", but this time Griqualand West lost by an innings.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden'' 1971, pp. 890–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

His highest score for Griqualand West was 138 not out against Natal B, as above, and his best bowling figures were 6 for 29 against Border in 1967-68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/29/29156.html| title = Griqualand West v Border 1967-68| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
He co-founded Desnics Planet Sport, a sporting goods business, in Kimberley in the 1960s, and continued to manage or co-manage the business until his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Sports Trader| title=A family store that serves the whole community|date=1 April 2006|url=http://www.sportstrader.co.za/Pages/Retailers%20showcase/DesnicsSports.php|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31967">A '''distributed workforce''' is a [[workforce]] that reaches beyond the restrictions of a traditional [[office]] environment. A distributed workforce is dispersed geographically over a wide area – domestically or internationally. By installing key technologies, distributed companies enable employees located anywhere to access all of the company’s resources and software such as applications, data and [[e-mail]] without working within the confines of a [[Brick and mortar business|physical company-operated facility]].

==Description==
This is not a [[virtual business]], where employees are distributed but remain primarily unconnected. A company with a distributed workforce connects its employees using a [[computer networking|networking infrastructure]] that makes it easy for team members across the world to work together. Using a shared software approach called SaaS, or [[software as a service]], workers and teams can share files securely as well as access the company’s [[database]]s, [[file sharing]], [[telecommunications]]/unified communications, [[Customer relationship management]] (CRM), video [[teleconferencing]], [[human resources]], [[information technology|IT]] service management, [[accounting]], IT security, [[world wide web|web]] analytics, web content management, e-mail, calendars and much more.

===History of distributed work===
New technologies are changing important aspects of how we live and work, and the ways we manage distance in the work environment.The management of distance requires more than just technical artifacts. In fact, techniques, [[social conventions]] and [[wikt:norm|norm]]s, organizational structures, and [[institutions]] are also required. In this section, we take a look at the ways ""distributed work"" has evolved over the past several centuries, but we specifically cover the last 50 decades.

Over the 20th century the workplace became increasingly associated with the [[office building]]. In the mid 1900’s, the most prominent business strategy was based on a mechanistic view of office workers as units of production to be housed in a unified and controlling space. Then, in the 1960s the office was seen as a communications system, with the floorplan opening up to facilitate the free flow of information. This office space was designed with the intention of fostering communication and flexible teamwork within the physical location. Then in the 1980s there was a major workplace revolution as the computer moved from the computer room to the desktop. In the 1990s a second workplace revolution saw the introduction of “new ways of working” a response to the realization that information technology was transforming cultural, social, technological and construction processes. At this time, the [[virtual world]] and digital tools reduced the need for synchronous, face-to-face [[communication]] and [[colocation (business)|colocation]] for office workers for the purposes of carrying out defined tasks.This [[digital revolution]] was the convergence between communications and computing technologies which now allows individuals and organizations to connect in ways, and on scales that were previously inconceivable. Today, the new economy is characterized by an increasing virtualization of products, processes, organizations and relationships. The new economy production no longer requires people to work together in the same physical space to access the tools and resources they need to produce their work and allows for distributed work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Andrew|title=Distributed Workplace Sustainable Work Environments|year=2003|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=020361657X|author2=Wheeler, Paul |author3=Whitehead, Carolyn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reviewing the chapter "Trust and Control in the Hudson's Bay Company in the book "Distributed Work", distributed work has been studied throughout history and not simply since the middle of the 1900s. Between 1670 and 1826, management had to rely on trust and control to successfully manage distributed work. During this time, in addition to dispersed operations that relied heavily on a combination of explicit information and detailed record keeping, more tacit and situated knowledge developed through socialization and participating in life on the Bay.

The Hudson's Bay Company case of distributed work showed a variety of control mechanisms including selection techniques, information requirements, and direct local oversight through its distributed practices of [[socialization]], [[communication]], and [[wikt:participation|participation]]. For example, the elaboration of reporting requirements during the period of inland expansion were used to supplement the current knowledge. A final aspect to note from the HBC case is the senior managements early learning about the strengths and weaknesses of contracts as a means of controlling distant agents. Early on the managers found out that "common sense" was not enough to encourage everyone to comply. Instead, the company's managers created a way to encourage all workers to comply to the businesses norms. All in all the HBC, concludes that trust and control is vital in distributed groups and organizations. HBC suggests that the process and outcome of geographically dispersed work is shaped by the interaction of a number of elements that are more complex, dynamic, and emergent than suggested by the contemporary literature. Thus, it is important to review distributed work prior to its public emergence in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael|first=O'Leary|title=Distributed work Over the Centuries: Trust and. Control in the Hudson's Bay Company, 1670-1826|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.

===Key concepts===
There are several key terms associated with collocated work and distributed work. The most important concepts are [[common ground (communication technique)|common ground]], coupling in work, collaboration readiness, and technology readiness. This section will briefly define these four concepts.

'''Common ground''' refers to the knowledge that participants have in common, and they are aware that they have this information in common. Common ground is not just established from some general knowledge about the person’s background, but also through specific knowledge learned from several different cues that are available at the moment, including the person’s appearance and behavior during conversational interactions. The figure below, shows the characteristics that contribute to achieving common ground that are inherent in various communication media.&lt;ref name="Distributed Work"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gary|first1=Olson|title=Distributed Work|year=2000|publisher=Human Computer Interaction|location=University of Michigan|pages=139–178|url=http://kraut.hciresearch.org/sites/kraut.hciresearch.org/files/protected/Olson01-DistanceMatters.pdf|author2=Judith Olson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that those who are remote complain about the difficulty of establishing common ground. This is because when individuals are connected by audio conferencing, it is difficult to tell who is speaking if you do not know the participant well. However, people with video can engage in the subtle negotiation that establishes local common ground- whether what was said was understood or not, whether the conversation can proceed or needs repair. Overall, the more common ground people can establish, the easier the [[communication]] will be and the greater the [[productivity]].

'''Coupling''' refers to the extent and kind of communication required by the work. Tightly coupled work is work that strongly depends on the talents of collections of workers and is nonroutine, and even ambiguous. Components of this type of work are highly interdependent, meaning that the work requires frequent, complex communication among group members, with short feedback loops and multiple streams of information. This type of communication is very difficult in remote locations, mostly because technology does not support rapid back and forth conversations or awareness and repair of ambiguity. On the other hand, loosely coupled work has fewer dependencies or is more routine. It is important that all group members establish common ground about the task, goals, and procedures before working, but this type of work overall requires less frequent or less complicated interactions.

'''Collaboration readiness''' is a groups willingness to work together and share their ideas. Using shared technology assumes that the coworkers need to share information and are rewarded for sharing it. It is important to note that one should not attempt to introduce groupware and remote technologies in organizations and communities that do not have a culture of sharing and collaboration.

Common ground is often used in collaboration, where a team is out to solve a complex problem. In order to solve a complex problem, the different skills and perspectives of members in a team must be pooled together. To do so, the team must make sure that they are on common ground in terms of knowledge and representation of the problem. Care must be taken to note that to achieve common ground when collaborating, differences are constructively managed, rather than downplayed. This is because collaboration differs from compromise.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Robert"&gt;Kramer, Robert. "Collaborating: Finding Common Ground for Multiparty Problems." Academy of Management Review 15.3 (1990): 545-47. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology readiness''' is a company or groups willingness and ability to use technology. Companies require a technical infrastructure if they are going to adopt technologies in the company. In particular, they require the habits, including those of preparation, regular access, attention given to others’ need for information, in order to effectively use the necessary technology for distributed work. Researchers repeatedly see that failure of distributed work often results from attempts to introduce new technologies to organizations or communities that are not yet comfortable with technologies that are already in place. The following chart explains the order in which various collaboration technologies should be adopted in organizations to allow the employees to become familiar with and learn each new technology.&lt;ref name="Distributed Work"/&gt;

The list below shows the observed order in which various collaboration technologies were adopted and used in different organizations.
* Telephone
* Fax
* E-mail
* Audio conferencing
* Voicemail
* E-mail with attachments
* Video conferencing
* Repositories built by others (e.g., intranet sites of static information)
* Shared calendaring
* Creating repositories
* Hand-off collaboration (e.g., using the Tracking Changes option in MS Word)
* Simultaneous collaboration (e.g., NetMeeting, Exceed, or Timbuktu screen sharing)&lt;ref name="kraut.hciresearch.org"/&gt;

As this chart shows, advanced technologies should be introduced in small steps.

These key concepts are important because they help differentiate between collocated and distributed work. Later on a fifth concept of organizational management was proposed.Organizational management is the "practices by which management activities are part of shaping the fundamental premises for collaboration without proximity" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bjørn|first1=Pernille|title=Does Distance Still Matter|year=2014|publisher=Human Computer Interaction|location=IT University of Copenhagen|url=http://orgcom17.hciresearch.org/sites/kraut.hciresearch.org/files/protected/Bjorn14-DoesDistanceStillMatter.pdf|author2=Morten Esbensen|author3=Rasmus Eskild Jensen|author4=Stina Matthiesen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributed vs collocated teams===
There are two types of work that explain the geographical distance between coworkers/collaborators. '''Collocated work''' is the case in which team members are at the same location. '''Distributed work''' is the term used to explain team members who are not in the same physical location when working on a project. There are many differences, similarities, benefits, and obstacles of these two types of work. In order to distinguish between collocated and distributed work, it is necessary to go into more detail.

Collocated work is the case in which the team members are at the same physical location. This may be temporary due to travel to a common location or permanent because all collaborators of the group are at the common work site. Same location means that the coworkers can get to each other’s workspaces with a short walk and communicate via face-to-face interactions. Also, during meetings or small group meetings, a major advantage of collocated work is that individuals are able to move from one meeting to another, simply by overhearing a conversation, seeing what someone is working on, and being aware of how long they had worked on it with or without progress. In addition, during these meetings coworkers can observe someone’s reaction by being able to see his/her gesture or glance. This allows for one to make sure that the group has [[common ground (communication technique)|common ground]] prior to moving on. Also, coworkers have access to common spaces for group interactions and have mutual access to significant shared information. In a study, researchers observed an individual describe something by drawing with his hands in the air. Later, someone referred to “that idea” by pointing to the spot in the air where the first person had “drawn his idea”.

Opposite of collocated work, distributed work is the case in which team members are not physically in the same location. Thus, they are forced to use different methods of technology to communicate to make progress on the project/problem they are working on. Today, the technology distributed work groups use to communicate is constantly changing because of rapid changes and because different groups have varying access to technology. [[Olson &amp; Olson]] describe the options of communication today which include:
* Telephony in its current incarnation
* Meeting room video conferencing
* Desktop video and audio conferencing
* Chat rooms for text interactions
* File transfer
* Application sharing
* Some very primitive virtual reality options

Distributed work can be very successful, if the company or group displays technology readiness. Some of the benefits of distributed work include:
* Simultaneous access to real-time data from instruments around the world, allowing coworkers to talk while something is happening
* [[Microsoft NetMeeting]] has been a success. People who had previously driven long distances to attend a meeting in their area began attending from their offices’. These individuals chose to forego the time and stress of travel in favor of remote participation
* Ongoing work- 1,000 software engineers working on the project in 4 sites. Has allowed numerous people at various different sites to stay in contact over email video and audio conferencing, transferred files and fax. If everyone understands the structure of the collaborative work and knows his or her role, distributed work can be a success.

Distributed work is far from perfect and there are many failures, some of which include:
* Complaints about the quality of communication over audio and video conferencing
* Hard to detect a persons motivation when you are not in the office. For example, if someone had a tough meeting you do not know this and therefore will not know that it is not the right time to send a lengthy, stern email. One important feature of collocation that is missing in remote work is awareness of the state of one’s coworkers, both their presence-absence and their mental state.

Overall, people who have little common ground benefit significantly from having a video channel.&lt;ref name="Distributed Work"/&gt;

===Communication technology===
Effective group communication involves various [[nonverbal communication]] characteristics. Because distance limits interpersonal interaction between members of distributed groups, these characteristics often become constrained. Communication media focuses on alternative ways to achieve these qualities and promote effective [[communication]]. This section addresses communication technology in relation to the theories of grounding and mutual knowledge, and discusses the costs and benefits of various communication technology tools.

'''Grounding and technology'''

[[Grounding in communication]] is the process of updating the evolving common ground, or shared information, between participants. The base of mutual knowledge is important for effective coordination and communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, participants constantly gather various forms of verbal and nonverbal evidence to establish understanding of change and task.

The following are means of grounding and collecting evidence:

{| class=wikitable
|-
! scope="col" | Quality
! scope="col" | Description
|-
! align="center" | Co-presence
|When sharing the same physical environment, participants are able to easily and hear what the other is doing and looking at.
|-
! align="center" | Visibility
|The participants are able to see each other and are able to pick up non-verbal facial cues and body language.
|-
! align="center" | Audibility
|When the participants are able to communicate by speaking, they are able to pick up voice intonation and utterance timing.
|-

! align="center" | Reviewability
|Participants are able to return to a physical form of the exchange at a later time.
|-
! align="center" | Revisability
|Participants are able to privately revise their statements before sending their message.
|}

Different forms of [[communication]] result in the varied presence of these communication characteristics. Therefore, the nature of communication technology can either promote or inhibit grounding between participants. The absence of grounding information results in reduced ability to read and understand social cues. This increases the social distance between them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Clark|title=Grounding in communication|year=1991|publisher=L.B. Resnick, R.M. Levine, &amp; S.D. Teasley|location=Washington, DC|pages=127–149|author2=Brennan, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Costs to grounding change'''

The lack of one of these characteristics generally forces participants to use alternative grounding techniques, because the costs associated with grounding change. There is often a trade-off between the costs- one cost will increase as another decreases. There is also often a correlation between the costs. The following table highlights several of the costs that can change as the medium of communication changes.

'''Examples of Communication Technology'''
 	
- Structured Management (Hinds &amp; Kiesler): It has been argued that work can be adapted to individual situations through task decomposition and version control. This can be applied to distributed groups by allowing groups to divide the work into manageable chunks. Group members can work autonomously and come together to produce a finished product. Many recent software developments have been built to specifically address this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinds|first=Pamela|title=Distributed work|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=57–73|author2=Kiesler, Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Email
Email prevents the communication of verbal inferences, such as sarcasm and humor and, additionally, leaves email writers unaware of what their communication is lacking. When people try to anticipate the perspective of their email audience, studies suggest that they end up pulling upon their own experience and perspective instead. This often leads to inconsistencies in email conversation and chaotic communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruger|first=J|title=Egocentrism over e-mail: Can we communicate as well as we think?|year=2005|publisher=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages=925–936|author2=Epley, N. |author3=Parker, J. |author4=Ng, Z.-W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case Study: Boeing-Rocketdyne SLICE===

'''Background'''
A team made up of a variety of professionals from different companies collaborated from different geographic locations to create an optimized rocket engine. They encountered a variety of challenges and used communication technology tools to plan and execute the project.

'''Task'''

SLICE was tasked with designing a rocket engine at 1/100 the current cost, increase the speed to market by ten times, and increase the rocket engine useful life by three times. Additionally, this team of eight presented their design after 10 months of work, without committing more than 15% of their working time to the project, without collocated meetings and without a common professional ground.

'''Management Practice 1: Strategy-Setting'''

The managers at the three involved companies began the project by spending a year developing an umbrella agreement, the “Continuous Ordering Agreement”, which explicitly defined contractual obligations, the allocation of intellectual property, and the allotment of time the team would have to work on the project. Determining these policies of risk management, project responsibility and funding between companies required a significant level of trust and respect between the teams.

The Continuous Ordering Agreement strategically accomplished three fundamental elements of a successful inter-company team. The team was able to candidly share information without worrying about disclosing company intellectual property, the planning time between idea and project kick-off was significantly reduced, and the team was protected from management changes within their respective companies.

'''Management Practice 2: Technology Use'''

The team primarily used the Internet Notebook, the Project Vault and teleconferences as their methods of collaborative technology. The Internet Notebook allowed the team to securely and remotely access the project and work on and review other ideas simultaneously. The Project Vault was a common file storage and information transfer tool used to promote sharing of all information. Although the team initially planned to use only this written communication, but, due to the overwhelming number of ideas and amount of data, the team began to hold two teleconferences a week. The following table illustrates the capabilities of each method:

In order to maintain efficiency and minimize confusion, the team decided to address their need for knowledge management by retracting the prohibition of face-to-face conversations and instead enforcing a rule of total information sharing. The issue then became the organization and order of ideas, which was not as simply solved. Another issue was the involvement and interaction of team members with their collocated teams. Because the team members were also involved with other projects at their respective companies, they also altered their protocol to allow for interruptions and multitasking during meetings. This unintentionally resulted in the team performing just-in-time analysis and receiving real-time feedback.

'''Management Practice 3: Work Restructuring'''

The team found that the necessary changes to work structure, in order to accommodate virtual collaboration, should be limited as to prevent complications in the fulfillment of basic creative needs. The team specifically identified these needs as consistent and frequent communication between all team members, rapid creation and deletion of information, and a common ground of the task and solutions. SLICE consequently restructured their work to both meet these requirements and enhance the virtual collaboration experience for all members

'''Results'''

After 10 months of working on this project, with no more than 15% of each member's time dedicated to it and each member working from a different geographic location, the team designed an optimized rocket engine with fewer parts(6 parts instead of the normal ~1,200), a 14-fold decrease in manufacturing cost(from $7 million to $0.5 million), and the highest-ever quality performance in the industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malhotra|first=Arvind|title=Radical innovation without collocation: A case study at Boeing-Rocketdyne|year=2001|publisher=MIS Quarterly|author2=Majchrzak, Ann |author3=Carman, Robert |author4= Lott, Vern }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distance work in the future===
In the future, design improvements and more horsepower will solve a number of current problems that currently cause limitations of distance technologies. Greater [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] will solve the disruptive influence of today’s delays in audio and video transmission. This will also allow for larger, smoother, more life-size displays of remote workers, making their interaction more similar to the flow of face-to-face interactions. In the future, it is possible that technology will provide capabilities that are in some ways superior to face-to-face options. However, it is likely that problems will result from distributed work technologies and from a lack of knowledge to operate the technologies in the future and face-to-face interactions will not be able to be eliminated completely.&lt;ref name="Distributed Work"/&gt;

'''Ferran Soriano i Compte''' (born June 16, 1967 in [[Barcelona]]) is the Chief Executive Officer of the [[Premier League]]'s [[Manchester City F.C.]], [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[New York City F.C.]], and the [[A-League]]'s [[Melbourne City FC]]. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Vice-President and General Manager of [[FC Barcelona]].

==Education==
Ferran Soriano is an MBA and Business studies graduate at [[ESADE]], the New York [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]] and [[Université Catholique de Louvain]] of Belgium.

He speaks Catalan, Spanish, English, French and Portuguese.

==Career==
Soriano has held a number of positions in companies in a variety of industries, such as consumer products, telecommunications and entertainment, and has held senior positions at The Mac Group, [[Reckitt Benckiser]], and Cluster Consulting, a management consulting firm he co-founded in 1993.

Between 2003 and 2008, Soriano was Economy Vice President of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], having been elected with the [[Joan Laporta]]’s [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] to the club's [[Board of Directors]]. He also acted as interim CEO. Barcelona's revenues, during Soriano's tenure, increased from €123 million to €308m, while a €73m loss was turned into an €88m profit.&lt;ref name=nat&gt;{{cite news |title=Ferran Soriano is the man to match Manchester City's ambitions |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/ferran-soriano-is-the-man-to-match-manchester-citys-ambitions |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6th, 2008, Soriano and seven other Board Members resigned, after a vote of non-confidence against the Board, amidst growing disagreement with Laporta’s "leadership style."

In April 2009, Soriano was elected Chairman of the [[Catalonia]]-based  airline [[Spanair]], rescued by the [[Government of Catalonia|Catalan government]] from SAS with the objective of creating a hub in the Barcelona airport. Revenue improved and the company started cutting costs, but, on 27 January 2012, after a deal with [[Qatar Airways]] fell through, the airline ceased operations.&lt;ref name="UPI-Jan28"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2012/01/28/Spanair-shutdown-strands-23000-travelers/UPI-53921327727191/?spt=hs&amp;or=bn|title=Spanair shutdown strands 23,000 travelers |publisher=United Press International |date=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2012, Soriano was appointed [[Manchester City F.C.]] [[CEO]]. In the first year and months of his tenure, Manchester City has cut its losses in half &lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City Halves Annual Loss as Revenue Rises to Record |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-29/manchester-city-halves-annual-loss-as-revenue-rises-to-record.html |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=30 January 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he claims the club will break even in the 2013-14 season.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{cite news |title=City confident they can break even next year and comply with financial fair play rules |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2548265/Manchester-City-confident-break-year-comply-financial-fair-play-rules.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soriano replaced Manager [[Roberto Mancini]] with [[Manuel Pellegrini]] and tasked him to win “five trophies in five years”.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City tell Manuel Pellegrini 'win five trophies in five years' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/24/manchester-city-manuel-pellegrini-trophies |work=[[The guardian]] |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the same period City has bought an MLS franchise in New York to create [[New York City FC]] and an existing football club in Australia ([[Melbourne Heart FC]]) initiating the club’s expansion strategy.&lt;ref name=expansion&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City Football Club to acquire Melbourne Heart FC in partnership with owners of Melbourne Storm |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/news/club-news/2014/january/club-announcement-22-january-2014 |work=[[Manchester city|Manchester City]] |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In January 2013, Barcelona president [[Sandro Rosell]] claimed that "Manchester City have attempted to entice a number of staff from the [[Camp Nou]]", but added "there were no fish left".&lt;ref name=fish&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/01/15/manchester-city-fishing_n_2477802.html "Manchester City 'Fishing' For Barcelona Staff, Says Sandro Rosell"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Rosell alleged that the Manchester club tried, in an "offensive" approach, to sign players "from all levels of Barcelona's structure," and also other employees of the Catalan side.&lt;ref name=fish/&gt; These allegations were not pursued.

In February 2013, Soriano was accused by the FC Barcelona board, led by Rosell, of authorising a £1.7 million e-mail surveillance of club employees suspected of "working against" Barca's then president [[Joan Laporta]].&lt;ref name=spy&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/20/ferran-soriano-spying_n_2722218.html "Ferran Soriano, Manchester City Chief Executive, Accused Of 'Spying' At Barcelona"], ''Huffington Post'', 20 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, a judge cleared Soriano of these allegations.&lt;ref name=cleared&gt;{{cite news |title=City chief Soriano makes leap to clearing name over Barca 'spying' allegations |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2575984/City-chief-Soriano-makes-leap-clearing-Barca-spying-allegations.html |work=[[Daily mail|Daily Mail]] |date=7 March 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosell resigned from the post of Barcelona president in January 2014, one day after a Spanish court opened an investigation into Barca's €57.1 million signing of Brazilian [[Neymar]], for an alleged "misappropriation of funds."&lt;ref name=resigns&gt;{{cite news |title=FC Barcelona president Rosell resigns |url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/24/fc-barcelona-president-rosell-resigns/ |work=[[Euronews]] |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Rosell was jailed without bail after being accused of misappropriation of funds from the €57m signing of Neymar.&lt;ref name="ESPN coverage"&gt;[http://www.espnfc.com/barcelona/story/3133849/ex-barcelona-chief-sandro-rosell-held-without-bail-in-money-laundering-probe Ex-Barcelona chief Sandro Rosell held without bail]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Soriano was found guilty in Spanair’s bankruptcy case and fined with £8.6 million.

'''Frank Bunker Gilbreth''' (July 7, 1868&amp;nbsp;– June 14, 1924) was an American engineer, consultant and author, known as early advocate of [[scientific management]] and a pioneer of [[time and motion study]], and is perhaps best known as the father and central figure of ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.

Both he and his wife [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] were industrial engineers and efficiency experts who contributed to the study of [[industrial engineering]] in fields such as motion study and human factors.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Gilbreth was born in [[Fairfield, Maine]] on July 7, 1868. He was the third child and only son of John Hiram Gilbreth and Martha Bunker Gilbreth. His mother had been a schoolteacher. His father owned a hardware store and was a stockbreeder. When Gilbreth was three and a half years old his father died suddenly from pneumonia.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lancaster |first=Jane |title=Making Time: Lillian Moller Gilbreth, a Life Beyond "Cheaper by the Dozen" |year=2004 |publisher=Northeastern University Press |isbn=978-1-55553-612-1}}--&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004"&gt;{{cite Q|Q28474683}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}}

After his father's death his mother moved the family to [[Andover, Massachusetts]] to find better schools for her children. The substantial estate left by her husband was managed by her husband's family. By the fall of 1878 the money had been lost or stolen and Martha Gilbreth had to find a way to make a living. She moved the family to [[Boston]] where there were good public schools. She opened a boarding house since the salary of a schoolteacher would not support the family.&lt;ref name=Lancaster2004 /&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

Gilbreth was not a good student. He attended Rice Grammar School, but his mother was concerned enough to teach him at home for a year. He attended Boston's [[The English High School|English High School]] and his grades improved when he became interested in his science and math classes. He took the entrance examinations for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], but wanted his mother to be able to give up the boarding house. He decided to go to work rather than to college.&lt;ref name=Lancaster2004 /&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

===Widden Construction Company===
Renton Widden, Gilbreth's old Sunday School teacher, hired him for his building company. He was to start as a laborer, learn the various building trades, and work his way up in the firm. In July 1885 at age 17 he started as a [[bricklayer]]'s helper.&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004" /&gt;{{rp|78}} As he learned [[Brickwork|bricklaying]] he noticed the many variations in the bricklayers' methods and efficiency. This began his interest in finding "the one best way" of executing any task. He quickly learned every part of building work and contracting and advanced rapidly. He took night school classes to learn mechanical drawing.&lt;ref name="Ford1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Daniel N. |editor=Emily J. McMurray |editor2=Jane Kelly Kosek |editor3=Roger M.

Using his observations of workmen laying brick, Gilbreth developed a multilevel [[Scaffolding|scaffold]] that kept the bricks within easy reach of the bricklayer.&lt;ref name="UrwickBrech1949"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Urwick |first1=L.F.|author2=E.F.L.

He developed and patented the "Gilbreth Waterproof Cellar".&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004" /&gt;{{rp|79}} He began to make innovations in concrete construction.&lt;ref name="UrwickBrech1949" /&gt; He also joined the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME). After ten years and at age 27 he was the chief superintendent.&lt;ref name="Sheldrake2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sheldrake |first=John |title=Management Theory |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=59Qi-X9PEgoC&amp;pg=PA27 |edition=2nd |year=2003 |publisher=Thompson Learning |isbn=1-86152-963-5 |pages=27–34 |chapter=The Gilbreths and motion study}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Widden was unwilling to make him a partner, he resigned to start his own company.&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004" /&gt;{{rp|79}}

===Further career===
Gilbreth then became a building contractor, then an inventor with several patents, and finally a management engineer. He eventually became an occasional lecturer at [[Purdue University]], which houses his papers.

Gilbreth discovered his vocation as a young building contractor when he sought ways to make [[Brickwork|bricklaying]] faster and easier. This grew into a collaboration with his wife, [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]], who studied the work habits of manufacturing and clerical employees in all sorts of industries to find ways to increase output and make their jobs easier. He and Lillian founded a management consulting firm, [[Gilbreth, Inc.]], focusing on such endeavors.

They were involved in the development of the design for the [[Simmons Hardware Company]]'s [[Simmons Hardware Company Warehouse|Sioux City Warehouse]]. The architects had specified that hundreds of {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} hardened concrete piles were to be driven in to allow the soft ground to take the weight of two million bricks required to construct the building. The "Time and Motion" approach could be applied to the bricklaying and the transportation. The building was also required to support efficient input and output of deliveries via its own railroad switching facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Simmons Hardware Company Warehouse - National Register of Historic Places Registration Form |url=http://focus.nps.gov/nrhp/GetAsset?assetID=ac2d7bc1-3846-40e4-b2c6-af0aff75b771 |publisher=National Park Service |date=28 February 2008 |accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family ===
Gilbreth married [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Evelyn Moller]] on October 19, 1904, in [[Oakland, California]]; they had 12 children. Their names were Anne Moller Gilbreth Barney (1905-1987), Mary Elizabeth Gilbreth (1906–1912), [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey|Ernestine Moller Gilbreth Carey]] (1908-2006), Martha Bunker Gilbreth Tallman (1909-1968), [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr.]] (1911-2001), William Moller Gilbreth (1912-1990), Lillian Gilbreth Johnson (1914-2001), Frederick Moller Gilbreth (1916-2015), Daniel Bunker Gilbreth (1917-2006), John Moller Gilbreth (1919-2002), [[Robert Moller Gilbreth]] (1920-2007), and Jane Moller Gilbreth Heppes (1922-2006); there was also a stillborn daughter (1915) who was not named.

=== Death ===
Gilbreth died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on June 14, 1924, at age 55. He was at the Lackawanna railway station in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], talking with his wife by telephone. Lillian outlived him by 48 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Maj. Frank B.

== Work ==
=== Motion studies ===
{{Main|Time and motion study|Gilbreth, Inc.}}[[File:Frank Bunker Gilbreth ca1916.jpg|thumb|Gilbreth in about 1916]]
[[File:Original Films Of Frank B Gilbreth (Part I).ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6|''Original Films Of Frank B. Gilbreth (Part I)'']]
Gilbreth served in the U.S. Army during [[World War I]]. His assignment was to find quicker and more efficient means of assembling and disassembling small arms. According to Claude George (1968), Gilbreth reduced all motions of the hand into some combination of 17 basic motions. These included grasp, transport loaded, and hold. Gilbreth named the motions [[therblig]]s&amp;nbsp;— "Gilbreth" spelled backwards with letters ''th'' transposed to their original order. He used a motion picture camera that was calibrated in fractions of minutes to time the smallest of motions in workers.

Their emphasis on the "one best way" and therbligs predates the development of [[Continual improvement process|continuous quality improvement]] (CQI),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|George|1968| p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late 20th century understanding that repeated motions can lead to workers experiencing repetitive motion injuries.

Gilbreth was the first to propose the position of "caddy" (Gilbreth's term) to a surgeon, who handed surgical instruments to the surgeon as needed. Gilbreth also devised the standard techniques used by armies around the world to teach recruits how to rapidly disassemble and reassemble their weapons even when blindfolded or in total darkness.&lt;!-- These innovations have arguably helped save millions of lives. --&gt;

=== Scientific management ===
The work of the Gilbreths is often associated with that of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], yet there was a substantial philosophical difference between the Gilbreths and Taylor. The symbol of Taylorism was the [[stopwatch]]; Taylor was concerned primarily with reducing process times. The Gilbreths, in contrast, sought to make processes more efficient by reducing the motions involved. They saw their approach as more concerned with workers' welfare than Taylorism, which workers themselves often perceived as concerned mainly with profit. This difference led to a personal rift between Taylor and the Gilbreths which, after Taylor's death, turned into a feud between the Gilbreths and Taylor's followers. After Frank's death, Lillian Gilbreth took steps to heal the rift;&lt;ref name=Price1992&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Brian |editor=Daniel Nelson |title=A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=93ydxDfb-RAC&amp;pg=PA58 |year=1992 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |isbn=978-0-8142-0567-9 |pages=58–76 |chapter=Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and the Motion Study Controversy, 1907-1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some friction remains over questions of history and intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com/qv1n2.html The Gilbreth Network&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fatigue study ===
In conducting their Motion Study method to work, they found that the key to improving work efficiency was in reducing unnecessary motions.  Not only were some motions unnecessary, but they caused employee fatigue.  Their efforts to reduce fatigue included reduced motions, tool redesign, parts placement, and bench and seating height, for which they began to develop workplace standards. The Gilbreths' work broke ground for contemporary understanding of ergonomics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com/qv1n2.html The Gilbreth Network&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Frank and Lillian Gilbreth often used their large family (and Frank himself) as [[Guinea pig#Guinea pigs in scientific research|guinea pigs]] in experiments. Their family exploits are lovingly detailed in the 1948 book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'', written by son Frank Jr. and daughter Ernestine ([[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]). The book inspired two films of the same name. The first, in 1950, starred [[Clifton Webb]] and [[Myrna Loy]].&lt;ref name=Saxon2001 /&gt; The second, in 2003, starred [[comedian]]s [[Steve Martin]] and [[Bonnie Hunt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0349205|Cheaper by the Dozen (2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bears no resemblance to the book, except that it features a family with twelve children, and the wife's maiden name is Gilbreth. A 1952 sequel titled ''[[Belles on Their Toes]]'' chronicled the adventures of the Gilbreth family after Frank's 1924 death. A later biography of his parents, ''Time Out For Happiness,'' was written by Frank Jr. alone in 1962.&lt;ref name=Saxon2001&gt;{{cite news |last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang |title=Frank Gilbreth Jr., 89, Author Of 'Cheaper by the Dozen' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/20/arts/frank-gilbreth-jr-89-author-of-cheaper-by-the-dozen.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=20 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''futureSAX''' is the inner [[Saxony]] business plan competition of the [[Free State of Saxony]] in [[Germany]] that has an objective of lending support to start-up businesses and growing enterprises.

==Business plan competition futureSAX==

The competition is possible due to Businessplan-Wettbewerb Sachsen GmbH (BPWS), which is operated by the [[Sachsen Aufbaubank - Förderbank]].

===Conditions for participation===
People with an idea for an [[innovation|innovative]] product or service with high [[Market (economics)|market]] potential is entitled to take part in FutureSAX for free.

A condition is that the enterprise has a need for finances and the instatement of the business idea is intended to be in the state of Saxony. At least one team member must be able to provide proof of residency or work place in Saxony.

==Procedure==
FutureSAX is divided into three competition phases, in which the competing participants are aided under consultation in the development of their own business plans. During the course of the competition, the business ideas continually evolve; the participants profit from free [[seminar]] programs{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} and the opportunity to correspond with others in their industry as well as sponsors of the competition.

On the basis of a business or development idea (phase one), the production of a business and marketing strategy develops (phase two) and a detailed and professional business plan (phase three) is constructed. Each phase ends with a confidential evaluation of the practicality of the business ideas by independent juries.

The business plans that have the most judicial approval are awarded with prize money. For the first two award ceremonies, four teams are awarded - one team each per the industries of [[technology]], ITK, [[biotechnology|bio]]/[[nano-technology]], and [[service industry|service]]. With the third award ceremony, five prizes in the three categories of “start-ups”, “growth”, and “special university prize” are awarded.

Apart from the phase's closing jury vote, the technical support is guaranteed to the competitors by sponsors, such as regularly offered coaching and seminar meetings about start-up relevant information.

Apart from the technical support with the development of business plans through FutureSAX, the opportunity is granted to the competitors to establish contacts to financial sources such as [[venture capital|Venture Capitalists]], etc. at the FutureSAX [[social network|networking]] seminars.

==History==
On 7 November 2002, FutureSAX started as a Saxony industry competition for start-ups and recent growth [[Business|enterprises]]. Thus, it replaced the IT Business Plan Competition, which was exclusive for the [[information technology|IT-industry]] that had existed since 1999 and was also presented by FutureSAX.

Since 2002, more than 490 start-ups and entrepreneurs, as well as 10,000 participants in net-working meetings and workshops, have taken part in FutureSAX. However, in the 2006 competition, 140 teams took part and 188 business ideas, marketing concepts, and business plans were submitted. During the years 2003 through 2005, the competition grew approximately 67 percent.

On October 5, 2006, FutureSAX launched into its fifth open-industry competition, which ran until 18 July 2007. The total prize money amounted to 68,000 [[euro]]s.

'''Geoffrey Morgan Pike''' (who writes as '''Geoff Pike''' and '''Pai Kit Fai''') is an English-born, naturalized Australian writer and cartoonist.
==Early years==
Born in [[Tottenham, Middlesex]] on 17 October, 1929, to parents Mildred and Robert Pike, he has two siblings Anthony  J. Pike and Robert Pike.At age 14 he entered training on the Navy ship [[HMS Indefatigable (R10)|Indefatigable]], and went to sea in 1945 aged 15. In 1949, Pike emigrated to Australia where he worked in the outback breaking horses, felling trees and sailing aboard deep-sea trawlers before he signed on as an artistic director on many popular cartoons such as ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' and ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' with American [[Paramount Studios]]. ''[[Unbearable Bear in T.V. Tours]]'', an animated cartoon series for [[Artransa Park Television]], featured a globe trotting [[koala]] with itchy feet.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Pike, ''Unbearable Bear in Boy Meets Bear'' (Sungravure 1964), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Pike worked with [[Bryce Courtenay]] at [[McCann Erickson]] advertising agency, most notably on the [[Mortein]] advertisement, "[[Louie the Fly]]". Bryce wrote the jingle and Geoff created the cartoon and animation. He also created the animation for the [[McWilliams]]' monk advertisement and the popular [[Yowie (chocolate)|Yowie]] characters featured in children's picture books and [[Cadbury's]] line of confectionery containing small plastic toys.

In 1977 Pike was diagnosed with throat cancer and learned the art of [[Chi Kung]] (also known as Quigong) and traditional Oriental medicine rather than surgery, beating cancer and becoming a master of Chi Kung and creating books and videos teaching others the philosophy and practice of aligning breath, physical activity and awareness for mental, spiritual and corporeal health.

==Writing==

In 1974 he published the first of many books, ''[[Henry Golightly: a novel of the sea]]''. Published by [[Angus and Robertson]], it was the story of a [[Gweilo]] (caucasian foreigner) living in [[Macau]] and building a boat amongst the locals; a youthful search for adventure and love among the post-war wreckage of 1945 and the horror that was [[Hiroshima]].

Pike now writes under the name Pai Kit Fai, which was given to him by his Chinese in-laws. Loosely translated, it means "White Person of Letters and Grand Ambition'. He has written two books under this [[nom de plume]], ''[[The Concubine's Daughter]]'' and ''[[Red Lotus]]''.

In computer science, Identity Intelligence is the application, within the [[Identity Management]] field, of analytical techniques typical of business intelligence and other related tools for analysis and control.

== Terminology ==
The term "Identity Intelligence" has been diffused throughout the course of 2010, also thanks to its adoption by [[Gartner]], and refers mainly to the following set of capabilities:
* the presence, within an organization, of a '''full repository of user accounts''', able to effectively collect every information characterizing the users and their access rights. The difference is substantial if compared to the "standard" repositories used by the [[Identity Management]] solutions, typically simpler and less suited for complex analysis.
* the '''ability to relate information''' from different target and authoritative sources, in order to correctly and efficiently populate the repository. In complex environments, data about users and user accounts are collected from dozens or hundreds of different sources, using different standards, different structures and different technologies. In order to allow quick, detailed and complete analysis, it is essential to have a tool that can collect, relate and homogenize all this data.
* The ability to build complex analysis, based on the principles of business intelligence, providing valuable information in relation with:
** the state of the users within the organization,
** the quality of the user management processes.
** an overview of user identities and their access within the enterprise.
** an ability to relate identity information with various entities within the organization such as assets, resources etc.

:At the same time, monitoring and reporting systems which operate on a complete repository, offer security features and advanced control.

== Why do you need "Intelligence" before "Management"? ==
The need for Identity Intelligence tools and models comes with the awareness, developed in recent years, that an [[Identity Management]] system used for the sole purpose of automating the user account management, exploits its possibilities only in part. In recent years the '[[Identity Management]] solutions are increasingly seen as tools addressed to security '''governance''', tools used increase security, tools used to meet the '''compliance''' requirements that organizations must meet in order to satisfy regulatory constraints, to obtain certifications and to satisfy internal and external audit.
&lt;br /&gt;
The assumption to the adoption of an Identity Intelligence solution is that "''you can not manage what you can not measure''". In order to properly manage user accounts and identities, you must first be able to get to know them in detail.
&lt;br /&gt;
For these reasons, between 2010 and 2011 the evolution trend shows how companies adopt mechanisms and instruments of Identity Intelligence from the early stages of the life cycle of their Identity Management systems. The most innovative approach that provides the Identity Intelligence is introduced in the company even before the '[[Identity Management]], so that it can serve as a support in the definition of requirements and the model of [[Identity Management]] to be performed. This approach, while introducing the cost of a preliminary stage, it increases the chances of success of a project of [[Identity Management]], allows to have information about the status of the User Management useful to ascertain the real need for such a project and gives you a snapshot of the situation to the "time''0'', "to which you can always see in the future to measure the success or failure of projects.

'''Johan Richter''' (Johan Christopher Fredrik Carl Richter, 12 November 1901  – 13 June 1997 in [[Oslo]]) was an engineer, industrialist and  inventor in the area of pulp and paper production. Kamyr in [[Karlstad]] [[Sweden]] (which split in two in 1989 and now is part of  [[Andritz AG]] and [[Metso Paper]]) was created on the basis of his inventions.

==Background==
Richter was born in [[Lier, Norway|Lier]], [[Buskerud]] and grew up at [[Narvik]]  in [[Nordland]], [[Norway]]. His father had a management position at [[LKAB]] who shipped its ore through Narvik. From 1919 he went to school in [[Trondheim]] commuting on the  [[Hurtigruten]] as there was no roads at that time. He graduated as a mechanical engineer [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] in 1924. After a short venue in Narvik he took on a position in [[France]] where is worked on [[turbines]] and advanced pumping equipment. In France he met and  married Astri Rören (1908–1992). Two children:  Ole Johan (1929) Einar Christian (1932–1997). Richter returned to Norway and settled in [[Oslo]] where he joined Thunes Mechanical workshop. He continued to work on turbines but there were as well some new ideas within pulp bleaching. However, due to the [[Great Depression]] he was let go in 1932.

An industrialist, Knud Dahl, at Myrens Verkstäder (Myrens Mechanical Workshop) had heard about Richter and they met. Richter convinced Dahl he had the vision and skills to develop a new technology for pulp bleaching in a continuous process. Myrens Verkstäder and [[Karlstads Mekaniska Verkstad]] (KMW) in [[Sweden]] already had a small joint venture within pulp and paper technology named Kamyr that was located in [[Karlstad]], Sweden. Dahl hired Richer to head up the organisation with the specific task to develop and market new technologies for bleaching and other innovations within pulp and paper.  Richter then moved with his family to Karlstad.

==Inventor and executive==
In the middle on the 1930s, Kamyr launched their new process for continuous bleaching that was developed and patented by Richter. The company had an immediate success initially in Europe and later worldwide.  Kamyr grew quickly and obtained the necessary resources and creditability for innovations to come.
Richter already had a vision to introduce a process for continuous cooking of pulp. So far this had been done in batches, with its drawback in quality variance and being a barrier to rational nonstop production of paper.  So far nobody had even tried to conquer this area and it proved to be way more complicated than with bleaching. It took more than 10 years from the first pilot in 1940 to a fully operational unit. Richter always insisted on full-scale testing. The first installation was able to produce 30 tons per day. A Richter digester of today will produce more than 2500 tons per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.paperindustry.com/paper-digester.php |title=   The Role of the Digester in Paper Making|publisher =   PaperIndustry.com|accessdate= August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the CEO of Kamyr in 1950 while still being directly responsible for Research and Development. In the following years Kamyr obtains more or less a monopoly position as no other supplier was capable of presenting something similar. Paper mills all over the world switched to continuous uninterrupted production of pulp and paper which created considerable savings and a stable quality of the end-product.

==Post CEO activity==
In 1959, Richter decided to step down as CEO of the company in order to re-focus on the technology. He assumed the title Chief Technical Advisor to the Kamyr Group (now based both in Sweden and the US). He stayed in that role until 1993 (being above 90 years old). One of Richter’s strengths was that he did not regard innovation as a one-off event, but rather a process of improvements. Hence he was able to reach more than 750 patents awarded worldwide. During this period Richter had relocated to France and collaborated with his son, Ole Johan, who was the one “on the location”, building and testing equipment and eventually also adding to the patented solutions.

[[Malay titles|Tan Sri Dato Seri]] [[Doctor (title)|(Dr.)]] '''Lim Goh Tong''' ({{zh|c=林梧桐|p=Lín Wútóng|poj=Lîm Ngô͘-tông}}; 28 February 1918 – 23 October 2007) was a prominent wealthy [[Malaysian Chinese]] businessman &amp; entrepreneur. He was renowned for his vision and courage in transforming [[Genting Highlands]] from an unexplored hilltop into one of the world's most successful casino resorts. He was once the richest man in [[Malaysia]] with a net worth of US$4.2billion&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;Net worth from [https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_Lim-Goh-Tong-family_BZLF.html Forbes: The World's Richest People], dated 6 March 2007. He died on 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in 1918 in [[Anxi County|Anxi]], a mountainous county in southeastern [[Fujian]] province, China, Lim Goh Tong was the fifth child in his family. He had an elder brother (Jing Ya), three elder sisters (Lim Zhuang, Lim Bau and Lim See), a younger sister (Lim Mei) and a younger brother (Jing Kun). Lim was born into a rustic environment in a village. During that time, China was in a period of turmoil and unrest after the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 revolution]], but life was relatively sheltered for Lim in the village. He grew up peacefully and had the opportunity of studying in school. However, disaster struck and his father died when he was 16. Lim was forced to leave school and he and his elder brother had to take over the heavy burden of feeding his family.&lt;ref name="ch1"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 1: Beginnings&lt;/ref&gt;

As China's situation was becoming worse, Lim Goh Tong decided to take the plunge in venturing out to [[Malaysia]] (known as Malaya at that time) following in his cousin, Lim Kheng Chong's footsteps. He left China through [[Xiamen]] in early February 1937 at the age of 19. He worked for his uncle as a carpenter in the first two years, learning the [[Malay language]] in the meantime. After gaining experience he went on to become a building sub-contractor and completed his first job of building a two-storey school. He returned to Anxi in 1940, but went back to Malaya the next year amidst a deteriorating war environment.&lt;ref name="ch1"/&gt;

==Career and business==
The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak|invaded Malaya]] in 1942 and caused Lim to have a few near-death experiences. During the early Japanese Occupation, he earned a living as a vegetable farmer, but decided to switch to petty trading for a better living. Later on Lim ventured into scrap-metal and hardware trading. When the Japanese Occupation ended, there was an urgent demand for heavy machinery for resumed operations in mines and rubber plantations. Lim seized the opportunity and engaged in second-hand machinery trading, making his first fortune.&lt;ref name="ch2"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 2: The Formative Years of Business&lt;/ref&gt;

From used machinery trading, Lim strayed into iron mining, joining as a partner in an iron mining company which couldn't settle the outstanding payment of two bulldozers with him. This proved to be a successful venture, and he later went on to form a joint-venture company which was one of the first Chinese tin companies to utilise dredges.&lt;ref name="ch4"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 4: Mining Ventures: Seizing Opportunities&lt;/ref&gt;

While dealing in heavy machinery, Lim accumulated a wide range of reconditioned machines as well as a substantial amount of cash to move into construction and related industries. In the name of his family construction company, Kien Huat Private Limited, Lim began taking on several contracting jobs with help and guidance from his uncles. Kien Huat won accolades and became recognised as one of the leading construction companies, building the Ayer Itam Dam&lt;ref name="ch5"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 5: Building a Name as a Contractor&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kemubu Irrigation Scheme.&lt;ref name="ch6"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 6: The Kemubu Scheme: Brink of Bankruptcy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing Genting Resort===
{{main|Genting Highlands}}
Genting Group's involvement in the property sector can be traced from the initial primary objective of holding land-based assets for long term appreciation and development potential to the current strategic move to develop and market the Group's landed properties mainly held in the plantation subsidiary, by Asiatic Land Development Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Asiatic Development Berhad – which is 54.8% owned by Genting Berhad.
[[File:Genting Highlands.jpg|thumb|250px|The Genting Highlands Theme Park]]

The idea of building a hilltop resort was first conceived when Lim Goh Tong was having a dinner in the [[Cameron Highlands]]. As he was enjoying the soothing cool breeze of the Cameron Highlands, an idea struck him that as the standard of living rose steadily in Malaysia, more and more people would visit mountain resorts for relaxation and recreation, but Cameron Highlands was too far away from the capital city [[Kuala Lumpur]], therefore building a mountain resort nearer to Kuala Lumpur would have great business potential.&lt;ref name="ch7"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 7: Development of Genting Highlands: Labour of Love&lt;/ref&gt;

After doing some research, Lim found Gunung (mountain in Malay) Ulu Kali at a place called Genting Sempah to be an ideal location for his plan. He formed an expedition and explored the place, collecting a wealth of data on the topography, drainage, soil conditions and other relevant aspects of the region, which proved to be very useful in drawing up plans for developing the resort.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

Upon conceiving this idea, many naysayers were sceptical of Lim turning a wilderness into a tourist resort. Most thought it was really risky and reckoned Lim who was financially comfortable to be foolish to invest heavily in money and time to develop Genting, but Lim brushed off all these negativities and went ahead firmly with his plan.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

After getting approvals from the Federal and State governments, Lim began the project in the face of a colossal task. Among the problems were building the access road towards the hilltop, water and electricity supplies, sewerage system and fire safety. Lim managed to build the access road towards the summit in three years when it was estimated to take fifteen years. Several sources of water in the mountain were identified, water supply was secured by building water-collection stations and water filtration plants with treated water stored in reservoirs. Electricity is supplied through a central electricity generation system with 12 big generators.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ch8"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 8: Resort Infrastructure and Beyond&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction, Lim survived six close brushes with death. Meanwhile, Lim had to administer another major project in [[Kelantan]], the Kemubu Irrigation Scheme at the same time. This stretched his physical endurance to the limits as he had to shuttle between Kuala Lumpur and Kelantan and he worked seven days a week.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

During the Genting project, Lim spent all he had without earning any income. He sold an 810-hectare rubber estate to raise RM2.5 million. In addition, he invested all the money he had made from iron mining, sub-contracting and hardware businesses. The project was a heavy drain on Lim's finances. When asked to invest in this project, Lim's friends turned him down and counselled him to drop the entire scheme instead.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

Genting was granted the only casino licence after [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], then prime minister of Malaysia, visited Genting Highlands and commended Lim's effort to develop a resort contributing to Malaysia's tourism industry without government help.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

Lim managed to obtain a pioneer status for Genting Highlands and tax incentives despite its resort development not qualifying for it. He did so by convincing the government that tax incentives in the early stage of development of Genting Highlands were not only vital for them but also profitable to the government later on.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

The whole Genting project was completed in January 1971, but prior to officially commencing business, Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding areas were hit by the worst rainstorms in a century, the road to Genting was closed by landslides at 180 locations, the damaged sections took four months to repair.  Genting opened its door for business on 8 May 1971.&lt;ref name="ch7"/&gt;

In the next 30 years, Lim continued to develop and expand Genting Highlands beyond its original idea of a hotel with basic tourist facilities.  Among the projects were the construction of more hotels, indoor and outdoor theme parks, and a convention centre.  A new road was built to shorten the journey to Genting from the northern states, and RM920 million was invested to widen a 10&amp;nbsp;km stretch of the access road to reduce congestion. Another RM928 million was spent on constructing a cable car system to provide visitors with an alternative mode of transportation.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

In 1993, at the suggestion of [[Tun Mahathir]], the prime minister of Malaysia then, a township was developed on an 81-hectare piece of land around the site of the Genting Skyway cable car station.  It was named Gohtong Jaya after Lim as a token of remembrance for his efforts in the development of Genting Highlands.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ch9"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 9: Genting and the Tourism Industry&lt;/ref&gt;

As of now, Genting Highlands is one of the most successful Casino resorts in the world and is one of the primary tourist attractions in Malaysia. Lim's company, [[Genting Group]] operates Genting Highlands and has diversified into many other industries such as plantations, property, paper, power generation, oil and gas exploration and cruise boat industries. In the process new company brands were created that have become distinctive names in their respective fields, namely Asiatic, [[Genting Sanyen]] (paper manufacturing) and [[Star Cruises]].&lt;ref name="ch10"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 10: Diversification&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2003, Lim handed his chairmanship of Genting Group over to his son, Tan Sri [[Lim Kok Thay]]/ [[Lim Yi Xiang]].&lt;ref name="ch13"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 13: Moving On&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Lim Goh Tong was married to Lee Kim Hua in 1944, together they had six children and nineteen grandchildren.&lt;ref name="ch3"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 3: My Wife – My Family&lt;/ref&gt; The six children are Lim Siew Lay, Siew Lian, Siew Kim, Tee Keong, Kok Thay and Chee Wah.&lt;ref&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong''&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his life Lim has had a few medical crises, among them were a malignant tumour and cardiovascular problems, which he pulled through after several surgeries.&lt;ref name="ch11"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 11: Medical Crises in My Life&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim wrote his autobiography "My Story – Lim Goh Tong" and it was published in 2004. In the book he wrote about his early life, how he started off with nothing to building a world-class casino resort through hard work and perseverance confounding sceptics, and the people he acknowledges.

10 years after Goh Tong’s death, on 25 August 2017, his wife Kim Hua died at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/08/25/lim-goh-tong-widow-passes-away/ Genting tycoon’s widow passes away] ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star Online]]'' (August 25, 2017). Retrieved November 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievement and awards ==
Lim Goh Tong had won many awards together with his company Genting Group for his entrepreneurship and his contribution, among them were:
* Malaysian Entrepreneurs Award 1985
* Manager of the Year Award 1986
* Business Achiever of the Year Award1994
* Number 1 ranking of 10 Malaysian Leading Companies 1999
* The Best Employer Award 1996&lt;ref name="ch12"&gt;''My Story – Lim Goh Tong'', Chapter 12: Acknowledgements&lt;/ref&gt;

He was conferred the title "[[Malay titles|Tan Sri]]" by the government of Malaysia on 6 June 1979 in recognition to the contribution he has made to the country.&lt;ref name="ch12"/&gt;

In 1978 Lim Goh Tong set up Yayasan Lim, a family foundation that donates regularly to educational and medical institutions, old folk's homes, various organisations for the physically handicapped and other charitable causes.&lt;ref name="ch12"/&gt;

"A man died recently who was responsible for the place where we are today. I'd like to ask for a moment of silence to honour his life and legacy," will.i.am said in his tribute.

More than 20,000 people, including royalty, Asia's rich and famous, politicians, friends, business allies and members of the public paid tribute to Goh Tong in their own ways. They either attended the wake, sent wreaths or penned messages of sympathy.

Among those who paid their respect to Lim were

'''Lindsay Stanley Booth''' (30 August 1918 – 27 March 1999) was an Australian businessman and farmer, best known as the founder of LS Booth Wine Transport (now Booth Transport) in 1936.

==Early life==
Lindsay was one of nine children born to Lily and Arthur Booth. Arthur was a grape grower and farmer in [[Reynella]]

Lindsay grew up on a farm and vineyard property just a few minutes away from where [https://web.archive.org/web/20120702200612/http://www.geoffmerrillwines.com.au/winery Mt Hurtle Winery] stands. Lindsay attended [http://www.onkaparingacity.com/libraries/localstudies/view_details.asp?RefID=3199 Reynella Primary School] only up to grade 7, leaving to work.

In 1935 at the age of 17 Lindsay met his sweetheart Gwen, who was 15, at [[Brighton, South Australia|Brighton]] jetty. Gwen would constantly walk up and down the jetty, until Lindsay decided to go up and talk to her. They instantly hit it off and began dating. Lindsay would ride his motorbike to the Windsor Theatre every Saturday for five years before they married in 1940 at the age of 22 and 20.

They had 5 children over the next 10 years; Devron (b. 1941), Brian (b. 1943), Virginia (b. 1944, now deceased), Roslyn (b. 1948) and Lindsay Jr.(b. 1950). Lindsay had a fondness of horse racing throughout his life, getting to the track as often as he could. He also enjoyed overseas travel.

==Career==
Lindsay left school at the age of 14 years in 1932. He worked for his brother Geoffrey who also had a truck &amp; was a share farmer etc.

In 1936 he planted garden peas on approximately four acres of land which he rented from a neighbour Mr Ernie Luxmore. The rent for the land was to clear the old vines that grew there. He borrowed his fathers horses to clear the vines and plant the peas. The horses wondered what was going when after being knocked off for the day Lindsay re harnessed them and put them back for more work. These peas grew a magnificent crop. However, when it was time to pick it rained incessantly. Lindsay paid double wages to pick the peas and was rewarded by getting a very high price. From the profit he was able to buy his first truck. A brand new thirty hundred weight (one and a half ton) Bedford.
[[File:Truck in Penfolds Colours.JPG|thumb|left]]
The Bedford was used to cart firewood, grapes, grain and hay. This was the start of L.S Booth Wine Transport Pty. Lindsay recruited his brother Keith to cart flax for the government to the [http://www.onkaparingacity.com/libraries/localstudies/view_details.asp?RefID=2151 flax mill] in [[Morphett Vale]].
  
Lindsay's first winery customer was [http://www.penfolds.com/en/ Penfold's], for whom he first carted grapes in 1938. For many years his trucks were painted with Penfold's colours &amp; logo. Other customers included [https://web.archive.org/web/20120606171824/http://www.darenberg.com.au/history Osborn Winery, now d'Arenberg, McLaren Vale]. Lindsay worked with and befriended many of the pioneers and notable characters of the Australian wine industry, including [http://www.hardys.com.au/pages/hardys/aboutus/ourhistory.jsp Bob Hardy], the [http://webcat.wtcc.sa.gov.au/hipres/images/lhimages/115-1.pdf Norman family]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} &amp; [[Max Schubert]] just to name a few.

Transport was not Lindsay's only business. Other activities included his Morphett Vale vineyard, sheep, barley, peas, leasing &amp; share farming. L.S. Booth Wine Transport remained a local carrier until his sons Devron, Brian &amp; Lindsay Jr. wished to expand into interstate transport. So in 1968 Lindsay stepped back from day-to-day operations of L.S. Booth Wine Transport to give his sons this opportunity. 
[[File:Lindsay Booth with pup.JPG|thumb|right]]

==Children's careers==
Lindsay Jr. eventually left transport &amp; returned to the vineyards and agricultural activities. He currently owns vineyards at Aldinga.

Virginia was office manager for L.S. Booth Wine Transport for 12 years from the early 70s onwards until she left to start a family.

With [http://www.roadtransporthall.com/b/1149-04-booth-devron-and-brian.html Devron and Brian] at the helm, Booth Transport grew to become the largest wine carrier in Australia. [http://baronsofbarossa.com/?p=5&amp;bid=27 Devron Booth] retired from [http://www.boothtransport.com/ Booth Transport] in 2000, but is still involved in the wine &amp; transport industries with his warehousing &amp; [http://www.boothengineering.com.au/ engineering] activities,

Under Brian Booth, Booth Transport has continued to grow with depots now in every mainland state and with international connections.
[[File:Lindsay Booth holiday snap.JPG|thumb|left]]

==Retirement==
In 1975 at the age of 57, Booth semi-retired to [[McLaren Vale]] with his wife Gwen, to a block of land on Seaview Road, yet retirement was not for him, and a year later he and Lindsay Jr established yet another vineyard. It was fortunate that the soil and location were excellent for grape growing. The vineyard would eventually be classed as "super premium" and its shiraz grapes were used for [http://www.penfolds.com/en/Wines/Icon-Luxury-Range/Grange.aspx Penfolds' flagship wine, Grange] among others. It was another 10 years before Lindsay officially retired. Booth died in 1999 on 27 March.

One of his enduring legacies is the company he started, now renamed Booth Transport, which is still family owned, and now employs Lindsay's son, grandsons and great grandchildren.

The '''Louisiana Association of Business and Industry''', known by the [[acronym]] '''LABI''', is the largest and most successful business [[lobbying]] group in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]]. LABI serves as the state chamber of commerce and manufacturing association. It was founded in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1976, when Louisiana adopted a new [[right-to-work law]] during the administration of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Edwin Washington Edwards]]. The previous law, passed in the 1950s during the [[Robert F. Kennon]] administration, was [[repeal]]ed in 1956 by the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] under Kennon’s successor, [[Earl Kemp Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=James C. |authorlink=James C. Gardner |title=Jim Gardner and Shreveport|volume=I |pages=353–354|publisher=Ritz Publications|year=2004|isbn=1-886032-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teeming from its success with right-to-work, LABI quickly unified the state's business community into a visible, well-financed, fully staffed organization to speak for business year-round as well as during state legislative sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=4447|title=Louisiana Association of Business and Industry|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original long-term executive director was [[Edward J. Steimel]] of Baton Rouge, previously with the Public Affairs Research Council, a "[[good government]]" [[think tank]].

==Education issues==
LABI has been extensively involved in education reform. In 1987, LABI issued the report "Ten Years of Education Reform in Louisiana: A Long Journey to Nowhere".&lt;ref name=education&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAl0z4Ol_JwC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Louisiana+Association+of+Business+and+Industry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qlcd9RjBp_&amp;sig=gqaIC4_S4yMPpJ2T-4IXFMAWkWw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g3H8SsPIJoXjnAfzxNn8Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Louisiana%20Association%20of%20Business%20and%20Industry&amp;f=false|title=School Choice: How You Get It, Why You Need It|last=Harmer|first=David |publisher=Cato Institute|page=58|year=1994|isbn=1-882577-15-9|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most reforms, LABI found, had been "watered down, ignored, not implemented properly, taken to court by the [[Teachers' union|teacher unions]] and others, mired in turf battles, or not funded." Similar reforms pushed by Governor [[Buddy Roemer]] in 1988 met the same opposition from particular constituency groups. LABI maintains that parents in effect must "pay twice" to obtain educational reform—taxes for public schools and their own private tuition.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

LABI issues annual reports with numerical ratings of all state legislators, both for the current year and accumulative totals. A member who scores 50 percent, for instance, will have voted for LABI positions half the time.

Juneau explained LABI's positions on various education issues to be considered by the [[Louisiana Legislature]].]]

==Current leadership==
LABI's address is 3113 Valley Creek Drive, Baton Rouge, LA 70898-0258. In 1989, Daniel Leo "Dan" Juneau (born 1946) was named to succeed Ed Steimel as the LABI president. He wrote a column widely published in Louisiana newspapers and traveled across the state speaking to civic groups on behalf of LABI. Juneau, who resides in Baton Rouge, retires from LABI effective September 16, 2013.

His successor, Stephen Michael Waguespack (born 1974), has been since 2012 special counsel to the law firm Jones Walker. Waguespack previously served in the administration of [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]], most recently as chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130906/BUSINESS/130906013/Former-Jindal-aide-Waguespack-named-head-Louisiana-business-group|title=Former Jindal aide Waguespack named head of Louisiana business group, September 6, 2013|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]|accessdate=September 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130907122755/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130906/BUSINESS/130906013/Former-Jindal-aide-Waguespack-named-head-Louisiana-business-group|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waguespack is married to the former Colleen Guste, granddaughter of the late [[Attorney General of Louisiana|Louisiana Attorney General]] [[William J.

One of his achievements was creating the first (and only) monetary economical system of the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf region]]. 
He also helped lay the new foundation of the Economic system of the Euro and the European Union in co-ordination with the UBS (The World's largest Bank).

'''Mutumwa Dziva Mawere''' (born January 11, 1960 in [[Bindura]], [[Zimbabwe]]), is a Zimbabwean-South African businessman with interests in mining, manufacturing and agro industries, financial services (banking and insurance), telecommunications, publishing, investment holdings, transport and logistics, and international trading, among others. He has created businesses and turned around enterprises that have become Pan African and global players, most notably Africa Resources Limited (ARL) which was one of the most powerful and influential corporations in Zimbabwe’s history.

== Background ==

Mawere was educated in Zimbabwe, [[Swaziland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], obtaining a [[Master of Science]] (Management) and an [[MBA]] (Finance &amp; Investments) degree. Among his first employers were the Industrial Development Corporation of Zimbabwe and the Merchant Bank of Central Africa.&lt;ref name="BlogAbout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanhopes.blogspot.com/2006/09/about-mr-mawere.html|title=Conversations with Mawere: Biography|publisher=Mawere's blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he joined the [[World Bank]], where he rose to become a Senior Investment Officer with the [[International Finance Corporation]]. In 1995, he became a resident of [[South Africa]], obtaining citizenship in 2002.&lt;ref name="MMawShabanie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/mawere9.13166.html|title=Mawere column: How I acquired Shabanie Mine|publisher=New Zimbabwe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business empire ==
In 1996, he acquired Zimbabwe's sole asbestos mining company Shabanie Mashaba Mines (SMM), branching out through all of Zimbabwe's economy. His rise was accompanied by allegations of improper support by politicians from the ruling [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front]] (ZANU-PF), especially in connection with government guarantees for a [[US$]]60 million loan used in the purchase of SMM.&lt;ref name="FinGazette"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fingaz.co.zw/fingaz/2004/September/September16/6521.shtml|title=The rise, escape, and fall of Mawere|publisher=[[The Financial Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mawere denied these claims, saying that purchase payments were guaranteed for by a deposit of shares of the mining company instead.&lt;ref name="MMawShabanie"/&gt;

== Demise of business empire ==
In 2004, Mawere's business empire came under government scrutiny, and allegations of prejudicing the state of more than [[Z$]]300 billion were raised by the authorities. In May, Zimbabwean authorities asked for Mawere's extradition from [[South Africa]], but failed.&lt;ref name="FinGazette"/&gt; Since then, by presidential decree major parts of his businesses came under government control. According to Mawere, his businesses' funds were used to repay due [[International Monetary Fund]] bonds.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/23/AR2006022302257.html |title=A Zimbabwean Businessman, His Firms Seized, Takes On Mugabe|publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | first=Nora | last=Boustany | date=February 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Columnist ==
Since his businesses were seized, Mawere has written a number of articles about the situation in [[Zimbabwe]], starting with his own situation and a vindication of his past business deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200705141486.html |title=Mawere Column: On Mugabe|publisher=allafrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200704270421.html |title=Mawere Column: On Independence|publisher=allafrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His op-eds have appeared in several online news websites that cater to Zimbabweans scattered across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Article by Mawere at [http://www.swradioafrica.com/pages/mawere070108.htm SW Radio Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522013320/http://www.swradioafrica.com/pages/mawere070108.htm |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ND-NOTIS''' was a tightly integrated yet modular office automation suite by [[Norsk Data]] introduced in the early 80s, running on the [[SINTRAN III]] platform on both [[ND-100]] and [[ND-500]] architectures. It was also available on MS Windows running in networks of Norsk Data servers.

It was very successful, and was the main product line of the company for quite a while, cementing its position in the Norwegian government [[office automation]] market. It was also very popular in Germany and in the UK (local municipality, DHSS etc.) 

The NOTIS family of products was presented to the British Computing Society by Jeremy Salter. Roger Tagg et al. (BCS, End User SG, 1985) and endorsed as the BCS model for user interface. The same endorsement was awarded to NOTIS-IR as a model for information storage and retrieval. the European Commission published in 1985 NOTIS-IR as reference model for document and information search and retrieval.

Where it was offered it had no real competitors. There are still features and functionality that no other system supports - such as multilingual input and search.

Norsk Data also sold custom-made [[Tandberg Data]] [[TDV-2200]] terminals as "NOTIS terminals" with special keys for text editing. Other terminals were "endorsed", provided new keycaps and branded as "NOTIS Terminals" - including the Facit "Twist" - that would show a page standing.

Components included:
; NOTIS-WP
: '''NOTIS''' '''W'''ord '''P'''rocessor, a full text editing environment optimized for word processing.
; NOTIS-DS
: '''NOTIS''' '''D'''ocument '''S'''tore, a database of documents based on the [[SIBAS]] database.
; NOTIS-BS
: '''NOTIS''' '''B'''ackup '''S'''ystem, an advanced system used for automated and incremental backups of a DS document store.
; NOTIS-ID
: '''NOTIS''' mail system. Proprietary e-mail system. It was later interfaced to Notis-Mail (see below).
; NOTIS-Mail
: '''NOTIS''' full [[X.400]] e-mail system, including a [[X.500]] based directory service (implemented using [[SIBAS]]) and TCP/IP based SMTP mail. This provided HTML formatted messages in from 1985.
; NOTIS-TF
: '''NOTIS''' '''T'''ext '''F'''ormatter, a text formatting system.
; NOTIS-RG
: '''NOTIS''' '''R'''eport '''G'''enerator, a powerful data extracting and modifying system. Often used together with database systems like SIBAS, Mimer or Oracle.
; NOTIS-RP
: '''NOTIS''' '''R'''eport '''P'''roducer, closely integrated with NOTIS-RG.
; NOTIS-CALC
: '''NOTIS''' Spreadsheet program, similar to VisiCalc and later successors like Microsoft Excel
; NOTIS-ENCRYPT
: '''NOTIS''' Encryption software.
; NOTIS-IR
: '''NOTIS''' '''I'''nformation '''R'''etrieval, a document database with free text search allowing full multi-site search.
; NOTIS-QL
: '''NOTIS''' Database query and application generation program, also called "Access-1" predecessor to MS Access.

==General==

'NOTIS''&lt;ref&gt;NOTIS=http://www.ndwiki.org/wiki/Virtual_library&lt;/ref&gt;''' was unique then and still is. It captured the notion of different user interfaces, or terminals; and managed a common user interface for all applications that used the platform. So a key on the keyboard would in all applications "mean" the same. 

It relied on an interface system "User Environment" to hold in one place all user profile and preferences. That is everything from log-in name and password, language preference, application skills and user rights to see, edit and change document - or data in applications. It came as a full "Document management" package, with full support for workflow - which was used by 3rd party application software. 

Another first was multi-lingual support, - also part of the user interface. Regardless of where you logged on, the system would know of your preferences, and allow you to resume last task. The system also supported full editing from right to left. All deliveries to the Norwegian public sector required capability to use three language, and that in the same office, all three languages would be used, even in the same document. So to sell in its main market, it need multilingual support. That included all messages, error messages and user interaction. The error messages could also be adapter from "novice" to "expert".

An important "first" was the full support for SGML - or "S-code". This allow the text editor to be used to edit and view the first HTML documents created - on hardware running NOTIS. The alternate character set - "T-code" was the CCITT, now ITU T.56 standard character set - used in all television sets to show teletext/"Text TV". So, the systems had full support for semi-graphical input and display, but just a few terminals supported this. Beware that an important customer was CERN, where they at the end of the 1980s worked on what you are now using - the WWW. ND-NOTIS had full support for HTML at that time. 

The main "first" - WYSIWYG - What you see is what you get. In 1983, most text editors used "codes" that had to be inserted in the text, like "^p" meaning "paragraph.Even in the early days of text editors on Windows, most text systems were like that. However, NOTIS-WP, would show where the line ended and a new page started for a long time. The "Symbolic Graphic Markup Language" was developed as an international standard, and version 2 of this is the "Extended SGML" or XML that is approved by ODMA. 

The "back-end" to all these modules were also flexible. You had direct file system exposure - that included network mounted files. However, with ''NOTIS-DS'' it included "Document Storage" and management - a full Electronic Document Management System (as found in systems such as Documentum and OpenText's Livelink today). The EDMS was based on a generic software interface, but only SIBAS was used commercially. This allowed fully localisation transparent document storage and retrieval. That of course demanded NOTIS-IR to search in all the documents. Software today used to power both Google and Altavista.

NOTIS-ID was a "special" NOTIS-DS, with restricted functionality, in that this would interface to "mail" exchanges only. So if you stored a document to an email-recipient, you sent an email. Likewise, if you received an email, this would appear in your mail-count, and you could read it in NOTIS-WP like any other document.

Norsk Data needed ''NOTIS'' to avoid duplicating applications. So the software was used in professional text production systems, for newspaper and magazine production - by "NORTEXT". It was reviewed a number of times here and found to be "best of breed" by e.g. the Seybold Report on newspaper systems. Hence demanding users were close to the developers - which may explain the success.

==Applications beside Text and Document Management==

The list here will become endless since '''NOTIS''' was linked to three application generators - beside the Query part. All of these were fully capable of making large applications system, that could also update databases. The most successful link was to "Unique" - an application package developed outside Norsk Data to support SIBAS but later was enhanced to interface to a number of RDBMS. Unique was successful in the UK, implementing systems for the DHSS and local municipalities. The other platforms were "BIM" (Business Information Systems) and "ABM" (Application Building and Maintenance). A full interface was made to "Systemator" to provide full support to newspaper systems generated by this. Norsk Data marketed and sold the system as integrated with their offerings for the medical sector ("Infomedica") and hospital systems;- for local community in Scandinavia and the UK based on Unique(i.e.DIALOGUE-1); - for engineering documentation in Europe: CAD/CAM as Technovision and even to the F-16 Flight Simulator.

NOTIS-QL - also marketed by Norsk Data as "Access-1" (and presented to Microsoft under this name - so you wonder with very good reason), is still commercially available as "[http://www.sysdeco.no/default.aspx?Main=Products&amp;Sub=QBEVision QBEvision]". It has also been licensed under several names with full product sold by CA.

'''The NOTIS family was fully ported to Microsoft Windows''', but was incredibly difficult to move with its huge customer base. For a time there were plans to include "Ami" into the family, to gain some market momentum - but its very difficult to move when your users do not want to make the change and are so happy with the way things are.

The ''NOTIS'' family was ported to Norsk Data NDIX [[Unix]] line, but here suffered because Unix had problems with coping with the key sequences required ([[terminfo]]/[[termcap]] was incomplete compared to the proprietary "VTM".). This is still used in [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.55/en telecommunication], all SMS messages use this character set.

==External==

The NOTIS way of sorting was included in the first version of Sybase, which was acquired by Microsoft as DS1. This taught Microsoft to arrange sort sequences in Windows according to national character sets ("codepage").

NOTIS-WP was the testbed for SGML and HTML. A very visible remedy of NOTIS-WP is the font size parameter in HTML today: 1 for tiny 5 for huge right out of NOTIS-WP.

There is still no other system available that will grant you "only one user interface and make all into one system". You have to fill in the expense report in Oracle HR and type the letter summarising the reason for the expense in some other text editor. With Notis, you clicked on field for providing the information, and WP would fire up, allowing you to write the letter - not as in Wikipedia where you have to supply own mark-up, but with the document template ready. The complete document would then be stored in the application database, with the expense report data.

== Usage ==
It has been argued that narco-states can be divided into five categories depending on their level of dependence on the narcotics trade and the threat the narcotics trade in said country poses to domestic and international stability. These five categories are: incipient (e.g. [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Iran]] ), developing (e.g. [[Senegal]], [[Thailand]]), serious (e.g. [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Jamaica]]), critical (e.g. [[Tajikistan]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]]), and advanced ([[Afghanistan]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[North Korea]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Myanmar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drug Trafficking and International Security|last=Kan|first=Paul Rexton|date=2016|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|isbn=9781442247581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent use of the term narco-state has been questioned by some for being too widely and uncritically applied, particularly following the widespread media attention given to Guinea-Bissau as "the world's first narco-state" in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/09/drugstrade|title=How a tiny West African country became the world's first narco state|last=Vulliamy|first=Ed|date=2008-03-09|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and should instead refer only to those countries in which the narcotics trade is state-sponsored and constitutes the majority of a country's overall [[GDP]]. &lt;ref name="Chouvy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chouvy|first=Pierre-Arnaud|date=2016|title=The myth of the narco-state|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13562576.2015.1052348?needAccess=true|journal=Space &amp; Polity|volume=20|issue=1|pages=26-38|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Examples==

=== Guinea-Bissau ===
[[Guinea-Bissau]], in West Africa, has been called a narco-state due to government officials often being bribed by traffickers to ignore the illegal trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/guinea-bissau-coup-prime-minister-arrested-for-helping-drug-trade-military-says/2012/04/13/gIQAmy3gFT_blog.html Washington Post newspaper: Guinea-Bissau coup: Prime minister arrested for helping drug trade, military says] 13 April 2012 "Analysts told the AP that in Guinea-Bissau, traffickers have bought off members of the government and military, turning the country into a 'narcostate.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Colombian [[drug cartel]]s used the West African coast as [[Jamaica]] and [[Panama]] increased policing. ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted Guinea-Bissau's lack of prisons, few police, and poverty attracted the traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/09/drugstrade&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' questioned the effectiveness of money from the [[United States]], the [[European Union]] and the [[United Nations]] designated to combat the illegal trade.&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/06/how-not-to-deal-with-an-african-narco-state-guinea-bissau/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Venezuela ===
More recently, [[Venezuela]] has been labeled a narco-state, due to the relations between some Venezuelan government officials to drug cartels and criminal factions all across Latin America. For example, former vice president of Venezuela [[Tareck el Aissami]] has been accused of supporting drug trafficking and helping Mexican drug cartels. El Aissami has been sanctioned by the United States since 2017. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/14/us-accuses-venezuelan-vice-president-of-role-in-global-drug-trafficking&lt;/ref&gt; The nephews and sons of Venezuela's president [[Nicolas Maduro]] are also being accused of financing drug trades and we involved in the [[Narcosobrinos affair]]. In November 2017, the United States's UN ambassador [[Nikki Haley]] accused Venezuela of being a 'dangerous narco-state'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/14/trump-administration-praised-by-democracy-activists-for-calling-venezuela-narco-state.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Network''''' is a real-time, [[two player]] [[business simulation game]] developed by [[David Mullich]] for the [[Apple II]]  in [[1980 in video gaming|1980]].

==Gameplay==
Two players play competitively against the computer, each taking the role of the programming chief for a major [[television network]].  Each side bids on new television shows to add to the season’s line-up, schedules them, monitors the weekly ratings, and then drops shows with poor ratings or reschedules them to recover from mistakes at the end of the thirteen-week season.  The side with the highest ratings is the winner.

==Reception==
Bruce Webster reviewed ''Network'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=Bruce |date=September 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster commented that "Unfortunately, I just could not get interested in the game. It moves slowly and requires (for intelligent play) that the players keep track of a lot of information that is not always easily accessible. One friend I played against quit out of boredom at one point, and I found myself yawning. There is a lack of tension, which means that personal interest must be the overriding factor in playing the game - and I'm just not that interested in network planning. If you are, then this is the game for you; otherwise, I'm afraid you'll just be disappointed."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6382">In [[marketing]] and the social sciences, '''observational research''' (or field research) is a social research technique that involves the direct observation of phenomena in their natural setting. This differentiates it from [[experimental techniques|experimental research]] in which a quasi-artificial environment is created to control for spurious factors, and where at least one of the variables is manipulated as part of the experiment. 
==In context==
Observational research is a method of data  collection that has become associated with qualitative research. &lt;ref&gt;Richie, J and Lewis, J., ''Qualitative Research Practice: A Guide for Social Science Students and Researchers,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage Publications, 2003, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with [[quantitative marketing research|quantitative research]] and [[experimental techniques|experimental research]], observational research tends to be less [[reliability (psychometric)|reliable]] but often more [[validity (psychometric)|valid]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The main advantage of observational research is flexibility. The researchers can change their approach as needed.  Observational research measures behavior directly, rather than the subject's self-reports of behavior or intentions. The main disadvantage is it is limited to behavioral variables. It cannot be used to study cognitive or affective variables.

==Data collection methods==
Generally, there are three methods used to collect data in observational research:&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, Alan (2002), ''Research Design in Clinical Psychology,'' 4th ed., Needham Heights, MA, Allyn &amp; Bacon. {{ISBN|0-205-33292-7}} Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Covert observational research''' – The researchers do not identify themselves. Either they mix in with the subjects undetected, or they observe from a distance. The advantages of this approach are: (1) It is not necessary to get the subjects' cooperation, and (2) The subjects' behaviour will not be contaminated by the presence of the researcher.  Some researchers have ethical misgivings with the deceit involved in this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S.J. and Fisk, R.P., "Observational data collection methods for services marketing: an overview," 
''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 20, No. 3, 1992, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Overt observational research''' – The researchers identify themselves as researchers and explain the purpose of their observations. The problem with this approach is subjects may modify their behaviour when they know they are being watched. They portray their "ideal self" rather than their true self in what is called the [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne Effect]]. The advantage that the overt approach has over the covert approach is that there is no deception (see, for example, [[Parent-Child Interaction Assessment-II (PCIA-II)| PCIA-II]]&lt;ref&gt;Holigrocki, R. J., &amp; Kaminski, P. L., "A structural and microanalytic exploration of parent-child relational psychopathology," ''Constructivism in the Human Sciences,'' Vol. 7, 2002, pp 111-123; Holigrocki, R. J, Kaminski, P. L., &amp; Frieswyk, S. H., "Introduction to the Parent-Child Interaction Assessment," ''Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic,'' Vol. 63, No. 3, 1999, 413–428.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Participant Observation''' – The researcher participates in what they are observing so as to get a finer appreciation of the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, H.S., "Problems of Inference and Proof in Participant Observation," ''American Sociological Review,'' Vol. 23, No. 6, 1958, pp. 652-660 &lt;/ref&gt;

==In marketing research==
In marketing research, the most frequently used types of observational techniques are:
*Personal observation
**observing [[product (business)|products]] in use to detect usage patterns and problems
**[[Automatic number plate recognition|observing license plate]]s in store parking lots
**determining the [[socio-economic status]] of shoppers
**determining the level of package scrutiny
**determining the time it takes to make a purchase decision
*Mechanical observation&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S.J. and Fisk, R.P., "Observational data collection methods for services marketing: an overview," 
''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 20, No. 3, 1992, pp 217-224&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[eye-tracking]] analysis while subjects watch advertisements
***[[oculometer]]s – what the subject is looking at
***[[pupilometer]]s – how interested is the viewer
**[[electronic checkout]] scanners – records purchase behaviour  
**on-site cameras in stores
** people meters (as in monitoring television viewing) e.g.[[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen box]] 
**voice pitch meters – measures emotional reactions
**[[psychogalvanometer]] – measures galvanic skin response
*Audits&lt;ref&gt;Housden, M., ''CIM Coursebook 05/06: Marketing Research and Information,'' Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, 2005 [e-book edition]&lt;/ref&gt;
**retail audits to determine the [[quality of service]] in stores
**inventory audits to determine [[product acceptance]]
**shelf space audits
**scanner based audits 
*Trace Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Kunzli, A., "Empirical Approaches," in ''Handbook of Translation Studies,'' Yves Gambier and Luc van Doorslaer (eds), Volume 4, John Benjamin, 2003, pp 53-98&lt;/ref&gt;
**credit card records
**[[computer cookie]] records
**[[garbology]] – looking for traces of purchase patterns in garbage
**detecting store [[traffic count|traffic pattern]]s by observing the wear in the floor (long term) or the dirt on the floor (short term)
**exposure to advertisements
*Content analysis&lt;ref&gt;Drisko, J. and Maschi, T., ''Content Analysis,'' Oxford University Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
**observe the content of magazines, television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, or newspapers, either articles, programs, or advertisements

'''Paul Hale Bruske''' (November 7, 1877 – September 26, 1956) was an American writer, journalist, advertising executive, and sportsman.

Bruske was a baseball correspondent for ''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' from 1905 to 1914. He also wrote for several Michigan newspapers from 1898 to 1910. He covered the [[Detroit Tigers]] for 14 years, including their [[American League]] championship seasons of [[1907 Detroit Tigers season|1907]], [[1908 Detroit Tigers season|1908]], and [[1909 Detroit Tigers season|1909]].

During the 1910s, he became involved in the automobile business. In 1910, he led the "Under Three Flags" automobile expedition from [[Quebec City]] to [[Mexico City]], and in 1911 he participated in the [[Glidden Tour]], a cross-country automobile race. From 1914 to 1915, he managed the [[Maxwell automobile]] racing team that included [[Barney Oldfield]] and [[Eddie Rickenbacker]].

Bruske also worked in the advertising business for many years. During the 1910s, he was at different times the adverting and publicity director for four of Detroit's leading automobile manufacturers, [[E-M-F Company]], [[Studebaker]], [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell]], and [[Harroun]]. In his later years, he handled the advertising accounts for [[Fisher Body]] and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone/Oldfield Tires]].

==Early years==

==Newspaper career==
After graduating from Alma, Bruske held reporting jobs with the ''[[Lansing State Journal|Lansing State Republican]]'', the Grand Rapids ''Herald'', ''[[The Grand Rapids Press]]'', and the ''[[The Saginaw News|Saginaw Evening News]]''.&lt;ref name=SL&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul H.

In 1901, Bruske joined the ''[[Detroit Tribune]]'' and became the head of its sports department in 1902. He established Michigan's first Sunday sports section while he was with the ''Tribune''.&lt;ref name=SL/&gt;  He also established Michigan's first color newspaper supplement with a green sports section at the ''Tribune''.&lt;ref name=Spink/&gt;  In 1906, Bruske moved to the ''[[Detroit Times]]'' as the sports editor.&lt;ref name=SL/&gt;

In January 1905, Bruske also became the Detroit correspondent for the ''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'', a national weekly founded in 1883 devoted to coverage of the sport of baseball. Bruske's baseball articles were regularly featured in ''Sporting Life'' from January 1905 through April 1914.&lt;ref name=SL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Hale Bruske|title=Detroit Duly Delighted: With Good Reports About the Tigers; The Team More Harmonious and Ambitious Than Heretofore; Recruits Who Have Given Indication of Real Major|newspaper=Sporting Life|date=April 11, 1914|page=8|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1914/VOL_63_NO_06/SL6306008.pdf}}(Bruske's final column for ''Sporting Life'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automobile career==
In May 1910, Bruske left his position as the sporting editor of the ''Detroit Times'' to become the publicity agent for the [[E-M-F Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Many Changes: Newspaperdom of Detroit Has Had Big Shakeup|newspaper=The Evening Record|date=May 16, 1910|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pfc-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fE0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2423,516718&amp;dq=bruske&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was at the time the fourth largest automobile manufacturer in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The E-M-F Company: The Story of Automotive Pioneers Barney Everitt, William Metzger, and Walter Flanders |author=Anthony J.

In June 1910, Bruske led a pioneering automobile expedition known as "Under Three Flags." Bruske and a small crew drove a [[Flanders (automobile company)|Flanders "20"]] roadster (an early offering by E-M-F Company) from [[Quebec City]] to [[Mexico City]] in 58 days from June 6 to August 3, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada To Mexico By Auto: Bruske's Car Arrives from Quebec at Monterey After a Month|date=July 10, 1910|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/07/10/105082962.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Tour From Old Quebec To Mexico On Trip 'Under Three Flags'|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=June 5, 1910|page=C6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=QUEBEC-MEXICO RUN IN 58 DAYS: Flanders 20 Makes Great Record in Matter of Tire Expense|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 12, 1910|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1748577132.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+12%2C+1910&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;desc=QUEBEC-MEXICO+RUN+IN+58+DAYS&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FLAG TO FLAG FLANDERS RUN: SMALL CAR BUMPS THE TIES OVER DEEP RIVER; Nervy Crew Rushes the Trestle and Reaches Opposite Side Just as Big Freight Train Thunders Past--Automobile Penetrates Regions Never Before Visited by Motor|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 10, 1910|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/353166762.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+10%2C+1910&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=VII10&amp;desc=FLAG+TO+FLAG+FLANDERS+RUN.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The E-M-F Company subsequently published a book about the expedition, likely written by Bruske.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Three Flags: Being the Story of the Flanders "20" Car Across Three Countries--Canada, United States, Mexico|publisher=E-M-F Company|year=1910|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/under-three-flags-being-the-story-of-the-flanders-20-car-across-three-countries-canada-united-states-mexico/oclc/023189229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alfred Henry Spink]], the founder of ''[[The Sporting News]]'', called Bruske's "Under Three Flags" expedition "the most remarkable  journey ever placed to the credit of a car of its power."&lt;ref name=Spink/&gt;

In October 1911, Bruske participated in the [[Glidden Tour]], a cross-country automobile race from New York to California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prominent Entrants and two Trophies for Famous Glidden Tour|date=October 15, 1911|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/10/15/110036454.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912, the E-M-F Company had combined with [[Studebaker]], and Bruske was in charge of advertising and publicity for Studebaker. He toured the country arranging exhibitions, overseeing the company's participation in road races, and writing newspaper stories promoting Studebaker automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Hale Bruske Is Guest In City: Studebaker Contest Manager Visiting Local Branch; Notes from Row|author=Leon J.

After two years with Harroun, Bruske joined Power, Alexander &amp; Jenkins Co., an advertising agency in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bruske Back To Advertising|newspaper=Motor Age, Volume 35|year=1919|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruske remained active in the advertising business in his later years, with clients that included [[Fisher Body]] and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone/Oldfield Tires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 28, 1956|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruske married a fellow Alma student, Mary Wheeler Plum.&lt;ref name=Alma/&gt;  They had a son, Paul Wheeler Bruske and a daughter Barbara Plum Bruske.

The '''phases of clinical research''' are the steps in which scientists do experiments with a [[health intervention]] in an attempt to find enough evidence for a process which would be useful as a [[medical treatment]]. In the case of pharmaceutical study, the phases start with [[drug design]] and [[drug discovery]] then proceed on to [[animal testing]]. If this is successful, they begin the clinical phase of development by testing for safety in a few [[Human subject research|human subjects]] and expand to test in many study participants to determine if the treatment is effective.

==Summary==
Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Individual trials may encompass more than one phase. A common example of this is combined phase I/II or phase II/III trials. Therefore, it may be easier to think of early phase studies and late phase studies.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies.

==Pre-clinical studies==
Before pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive [[pre-clinical development|pre-clinical studies]]. These involve [[in vitro]] (test tube or cell culture) and [[in vivo]] (animal) experiments using wide-ranging doses of the study drug to obtain preliminary [[efficacy]], [[toxicity]] and [[pharmacokinetic]] information. Such tests assist pharmaceutical companies to decide whether a drug candidate has scientific merit for further development as an [[investigational new drug]].

==Phase 0==
Phase 0 is a recent designation for optional exploratory trials conducted in accordance with the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration's]] (FDA) 2006 Guidance on Exploratory [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) Studies.&lt;ref name=cder2006&gt;{{cite web
 |author=[[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|CDER]] |date=January 2006 |title=Exploratory IND Studies |series=Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Reviewers |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm078933.pdf |accessdate=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 0 trials are also known as human [[microdosing]] studies and are designed to speed up the development of promising drugs or [[Contrast medium|imaging agent]]s by establishing very early on whether the drug or agent behaves in human subjects as was expected from preclinical studies. Distinctive features of Phase 0 trials include the administration of single subtherapeutic doses of the study drug to a small number of subjects (10 to 15) to gather preliminary data on the agent's  [[pharmacokinetics]] (what the body does to the drugs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase 0 trials: a platform for drug development?|journal=Lancet|volume=374|issue=9685|page=176|year=2009|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61309-X|last1=The Lancet|pmid=19616703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Phase 0 study gives no data on safety or efficacy, being by definition a dose too low to cause any therapeutic effect. Drug development companies carry out Phase 0 studies to rank drug candidates in order to decide which has the best [[pharmacokinetic]] parameters in humans to take forward into further development. They enable go/no-go decisions to be based on relevant human models instead of relying on sometimes inconsistent animal data.

==Phase I==
Phase I trials were formerly referred to as “first-in-man studies” but the field generally moved to the [[gender-neutral language]] phrase "first-in-humans" in the 1990s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=JA|title=Feeding and Bleeding: The Institutional Banalization of Risk to Healthy Volunteers in Phase I Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials.|journal=Science, technology &amp; human values|date=1 March 2015|volume=40|issue=2|pages=199–226|doi=10.1177/0162243914554838|pmid=25914430|pmc=4405793}}&lt;/ref&gt; these trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects.&lt;ref name="ccs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/diagnosis-and-treatment/clinical-trials/phases-of-clinical-trials/?region=on|title=Phases of clinical trials|publisher=Canadian Cancer Society|date=2017|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to test the safety, side effects, best dose, and formulation method for the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/phase-i-clinical-trial | title = NCI Dictionary | publisher = National Cancer Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, a small group of 2–100 healthy volunteers will be recruited.&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt; These trials are often conducted in a clinical trial clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. These clinical trial clinics are often run by [[contract research organization]] (CROs) who conduct these studies on behalf of [[pharmaceutical companies]] or other research investigators. The subject who receives the drug is usually observed until several [[Biological half-life|half-lives]] of the drug have passed. This phase is designed to assess the safety ([[pharmacovigilance]]), tolerability, [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[pharmacodynamics]] of a drug. Phase I trials normally include [[dose-ranging]], also called dose escalation studies, so that the best and safest dose can be found and to discover the point at which a compound is too poisonous to administer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/582554_2 | title = The Myth of Equipoise in Phase 1 Clinical Trials | journal = Medscape J Med | year = 2008 | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 254 | author = Adil E. Shamoo | pmid = 19099004 | pmc = 2605120 }}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tested range of doses will usually be a fraction{{quantify|date=November 2011}} of the dose that caused harm in [[animal testing]]. Phase I trials most often include healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when clinical patients are used, such as patients who have [[terminal illness|terminal]] cancer or [[HIV]] and the treatment is likely to make healthy individuals ill. These studies are usually conducted in tightly controlled clinics called CPUs (Central Pharmacological Units), where participants receive 24-hour medical attention and oversight. In addition to the previously mentioned unhealthy individuals, “patients who have typically already tried and failed to improve on the existing standard therapies"&lt;ref name="DeMets"&gt;{{Cite book | author = DeMets, D., Friedman, L., and Furberg, C. | year = 2010 | title = Fundamentals of Clinical Trials | publisher = Springer | edition = 4th | isbn = 978-1-4419-1585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; may also participate in phase I trials.  Volunteers are paid a variable inconvenience fee for their time spent in the volunteer center.

Before beginning a phase I trial, the sponsor must submit an [[Investigational New Drug]] application to the FDA detailing the preliminary data on the drug gathered from cellular models and animal studies.

Phase I trials can be further divided:

;Single ascending dose (Phase Ia): In single ascending dose studies, small groups of subjects are given a single dose of the drug while they are observed and tested for a period of time to confirm safety.&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt;&lt;ref name="p1ct"&gt;Elizabeth Norfleet, Shayne Cox Gad, "Phase I Clinical Trials", in Shayne Cox Gad, ''Clinical Trials Handbook'', {{ISBN|978-0-470-46635-3}}, 2009, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, a small number of participants, usually three, are entered sequentially at a particular dose.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  If they do not exhibit any [[adverse event|adverse]] side effects, and the pharmacokinetic data are roughly in line with predicted safe values, the dose is escalated, and a new group of subjects is then given a higher dose.  If unacceptable toxicity is observed in any of the three participants, an additional number of participants, usually three, are treated at the same dose.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  This is continued until pre-calculated pharmacokinetic safety levels are reached, or intolerable side effects start showing up (at which point the drug is said to have reached the [[maximum tolerated dose]] (MTD)).  If an additional unacceptable toxicity is observed, then the dose escalation is terminated and that dose, or perhaps the previous dose, is declared to be the maximally tolerated dose.  This particular design assumes that the maximally tolerated dose occurs when approximately one-third of the participants experience unacceptable toxicity.  Variations of this design exist, but most are similar.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;

;Multiple ascending dose (Phase Ib): Multiple ascending dose studies investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of the drug, looking at safety and tolerability. In these studies, a group of patients receives multiple low doses of the drug, while samples (of blood, and other fluids) are collected at various time points and analyzed to acquire information on how the drug is processed within the body. The dose is subsequently escalated for further groups, up to a predetermined level.&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt;&lt;ref name="p1ct"/&gt;

;Food effect: A short trial designed to investigate any differences in absorption of the drug by the body, caused by eating before the drug is given. These studies are usually run as a [[crossover study]], with volunteers being given two identical doses of the drug while [[Fasting|fasted]], and after being fed.

==Phase II==
Once a dose or range of doses is determined, the next goal is to evaluate whether the drug has any biological activity or effect.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  Phase II trials are performed on larger groups (100–300) and are designed to assess how well the drug works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients.  Genetic testing is common, particularly when there is evidence of variation in metabolic rate.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  When the development process for a new drug fails, this usually occurs during Phase II trials when the drug is discovered not to work as planned, or to have toxic effects.

Phase II studies are sometimes divided into Phase IIA and Phase IIB. There is no formal definition for these 2 sub-categories, but generally:
* Phase IIA studies are usually pilot studies designed to demonstrate clinical efficacy or biological activity ('proof of concept' studies);
* Phase IIB studies look to find the optimum dose at which the drug shows biological activity with minimal side-effects (‘definite dose-finding’ studies).

Some trials combine Phase I and Phase II, and test both efficacy and toxicity.

;Trial design: Some Phase II trials are designed as [[case series]], demonstrating a drug's safety and activity in a selected group of patients. Other Phase II trials are designed as [[randomized controlled trial]]s, where some patients receive the drug/device and others receive placebo/standard treatment. Randomized Phase II trials have far fewer patients than randomized Phase III trials.

;Example Cancer Design: In the first stage, the investigator attempts to rule out drugs which have no or little biologic activity.  For example, the researcher may specify that a drug must have some minimal level of activity, say, in 20% of participants.  If the estimated activity level is less than 20%, the researcher chooses not to consider this drug further, at least not at that maximally tolerated dose.  If the estimated activity level exceeds 20%, the researcher will add more participants to get a better estimate of the response rate.  A typical study for ruling out a 20% or lower response rate enters 14 participants.  If no response is observed in the first 14 participants, the drug is considered not likely to have a 20% or higher activity level.  The number of additional participants added depends on the degree of precision desired, but ranges from 10 to 20.  Thus, a typical cancer phase II study might include fewer than 30 people to estimate the response rate.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;

;Efficacy vs Effectiveness: When a study assesses efficacy, it is looking at whether the drug given in the specific manner described in the study is able to influence an outcome of interest (e.g. tumor size) in the chosen population (e.g. cancer patients with no other ongoing diseases). When a study is assessing effectiveness, it is determining whether a treatment will influence the disease. In an effectiveness study it is essential that patients are treated as they would be when the treatment is prescribed in actual practice. That would mean that there should be no aspects of the study designed to increase patient compliance above those that would occur in routine clinical practice. The outcomes in effectiveness studies are also more generally applicable than in most efficacy studies (for example does the patient feel better, come to the hospital less or live longer in effectiveness studies as opposed to better test scores or lower cell counts in efficacy studies). There is usually less rigid control of the type of patient to be included in effectiveness studies than in efficacy studies, as the researchers are interested in whether the drug will have a broad effect in the population of patients with the disease.

Some researchers argue that phase II studies are generally smaller than they ought to be.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;

===Success rate===

Phase II clinical programs historically have experienced the lowest success rate of the four development phases.  In 2010, the percentage of phase II trials that proceeded to phase III was 18%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medcitynews.com/2011/06/new-drug-failure-rates-rising-in-phase-ii-and-iii-clinical-trials/|title=New drugs failing Phase II and III clinical trials|publisher=MedCity News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and only 30.7% of developmental candidates advanced from Phase II to Phase III in a large study of trials from 2006-2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf|title=Clinical Development Success Rates 2006-2015|last=|first=|date=|website=bio.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase III==
This phase is designed to assess the effectiveness of the new intervention and, thereby, its value in clinical practice.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  Phase III studies are randomized controlled [[multicenter trial]]s on large patient groups (300–3,000 or more depending upon the disease/medical condition studied) and are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the drug is, in comparison with current 'gold standard' treatment. Because of their size and comparatively long duration, Phase III trials are the most expensive, time-consuming and difficult trials to design and run, especially in therapies for [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] medical conditions. Phase III trials of chronic conditions or diseases often have a short follow-up period for evaluation, relative to the period of time the intervention might be used in practice.&lt;ref name="DeMets" /&gt;  This is sometimes called the "pre-marketing phase" because it actually measures consumer response to the drug.

It is common practice that certain Phase III trials will continue while the regulatory submission is pending at the appropriate regulatory agency. This allows patients to continue to receive possibly lifesaving drugs until the drug can be obtained by purchase. Other reasons for performing trials at this stage include attempts by the sponsor at "label expansion" (to show the drug works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing), to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the drug. Studies in this phase are by some companies categorized as "Phase IIIB studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/drugsbiologics.html|title=Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators|accessdate=2007-03-27|date=1999-03-16|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not required in all cases, it is typically expected that there be at least two successful Phase III trials, demonstrating a drug's safety and efficacy, in order to obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agencies such as [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] (USA), or the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] (European Union).

Once a drug has proved satisfactory after Phase III trials, the trial results are usually combined into a large document containing a comprehensive description of the methods and results of human and animal studies, manufacturing procedures, formulation details, and shelf life. This collection of information makes up the "regulatory submission" that is provided for review to the appropriate regulatory authorities&lt;ref name="reg-auth"&gt;The regulatory authority in the USA is the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]; in Canada, [[Health Canada]]; in the [[European Union]], the [[European Medicines Agency]]; and in Japan, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]]&lt;/ref&gt; in different countries. They will review the submission, and, it is hoped, give the sponsor approval to market the drug.

Most drugs undergoing Phase III clinical trials can be marketed under FDA norms with proper recommendations and guidelines through a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) containing all manufacturing, pre-clinical, and clinical data. In case of any adverse effects being reported anywhere, the drugs need to be recalled immediately from the market.  While most pharmaceutical companies refrain from this practice, it is not abnormal to see many drugs undergoing Phase III clinical trials in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice: A Practical Approach |last=Arcangelo |first=Virginia Poole |author2=Andrew M. Peterson |year=2005 |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] |isbn=0-7817-5784-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success rate===

As of 2010, about 50% of drug candidates either fail during the Phase III trial or are rejected by the national regulatory agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n2/full/nrd3375.html|title=Trial watch: Phase III and submission failures: 2007–2010|first=John|last=Arrowsmith|date=1 February 2011|publisher=|journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov|volume=10|issue=2|pages=87–87|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/nrd3375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phase II/III cost'''

The amount of money spent on Phase II/III trials depends on numerous factors, with therapeutic area being studied and types of clinical procedures as key drivers; Phase II studies may cost as much as $20 million, and Phase III as much as $53 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26908540|year=2016|author1=Sertkaya|first1=A|title=Key cost drivers of pharmaceutical clinical trials in the United States|journal=Clinical Trials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–26|last2=Wong|first2=H.

==Phase IV==
A Phase IV trial is also known as [[postmarketing surveillance]] trial, or informally as a [[confirmatory trial]]. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance ([[pharmacovigilance]]) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold (e.g. after approval under the [[FDA Accelerated Approval Program]]).&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/what-you-need-to-know/phases-of-clinical-trials.html|title=What Are the Phases of Clinical Trials?|publisher=American Cancer Society|date=2017|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken by the sponsoring company for competitive (finding a new market for the drug) or other reasons (for example, the drug may not have been tested for interactions with other drugs, or on certain population groups such as pregnant women, who are unlikely to subject themselves to trials).&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt; The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials.&lt;ref name=ccs/&gt;&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; Harmful effects discovered by Phase IV trials may result in a drug being no longer sold, or restricted to certain uses; recent examples involve [[cerivastatin]] (brand names Baycol and Lipobay), [[troglitazone]] (Rezulin) and [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx). The minimum time period mandatory for Phase IV clinical trials is 2 years.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Overall cost==
The entire process of developing a drug from preclinical research to marketing can take approximately 12 to 18 years and often costs well over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.5912/jcb588 | title = Fixing a broken drug development process | year = 2013 | last1 = Holland | first1 = John | journal = Journal of Commercial Biotechnology | volume = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.25.2.420 | title = Estimating the Cost of New Drug Development: Is It Really $802 Million? | year = 2006 | last1 = Adams | first1 = C.

'''Richard Magnus Franz Morris''' (15 June 1934 in [[Liberia]] &amp;ndash; 27 June 2012)  was a Liberian business and civic leader.

==Life and family ==
Morris was born in Farmerville, Sinoe County, on June 15, 1934. His parents were descendants of Americo-Liberian families that settled in Sinoe County, Liberia. His father was Jacob Franz Morris, a Liberian who settled in Greenville, Sinoe County, and later became the First Gee-Claw Commandant (an Americo-Liberian group in Sinoe County). His mother was Mary Emma Morris (a granddaughter of the late and former Vice President of Liberia Joseph J. Ross, a niece of the former Vice President of Liberia Samuel Alfred Ross). Mary Emma Morris' father's family had settled in Farmerville, Sinoe County. Richard grew up in Greenville along with his siblings. Richard completed his early education in Greenville, Sinoe County, and traveled to Monrovia to complete his high school education at the Lab High School (now known as William V.S Tubman High School).

==Education==
Morris received his bachelor of science degree in mathematics from the University of Liberia in 1956 (His attendance was from 1952-1956). He left for Mainz, Germany, immediately following graduation on a scholarship to attend [[University of Mainz|Johannes Gutenbeg University of Mainz]]. He obtained a graduate diploma in mathematics (Diplom Vorexamen) in 1963. Morris continued his studies through a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] at the Iowa State University, where he obtained a Master of Science in economics, 1967. His thesis was entitled "An Economic and Institutional Analysis of the Nigerian Economy".

==Marriage and death==
Morris married Lorraine V. Morris in 1964; they had many children. They remained married for 48 years until his death on June 27, 2012.

==Career==
Morris returned to Liberia, where he worked at the Bureau of National Planning in 1967, and  served as director of research, Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs from 1967 to 1970. He was elected to the governing council of the United Nations Institute for Economic and Statistical Planning (IDEP), located in Dakar, Senegal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In addition to his work for the Liberian Government, Morris taught mathematics and economics at the University of Liberia for fifteen years.  He achieved the rank of assistant professor of economics at the University of Liberia.

Morris served the Liberian Government as Principal Deputy Minister of Commerce, Industry and Transportation from 1971 to 1975. Morris became the first director general of National Social Security and Welfare Corporation, 1976 to 1980, but the position was terminated by the coup d'état which occurred on April 12, 1980.

In 1981, Morris left the governmental sector and continued his career as managing director of the Small Enterprise Financing Organization (SEFO). In 1986, he became president of the Small Enterprise Financing Organization.

Morris served as the chairman of the board of directors for the National Social Security and Welfare Corporation in 1989. Beginning in 1992, Morris worked briefly as a consultant in [[Ghana]] before emigrating in 1994 to the [[United States]] to join his family.

Dr '''Tiede Herrema''' (born 21 April 1921) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] businessman. He was born in [[Zuilen]].

==Kidnapping==
In the 1970s, Herrema ran a wire factory, Ferenka, in the city of [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]]. At the time, this was the city's biggest employer, with approximately 1,400 workers. On the morning of 3 October 1975, having just left his home in Castletroy near Limerick, Herrema was abducted by two members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], Eddie Gallagher and [[Marion Coyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4354020.stm|title=IRA kidnap victim returns to city|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-06|date=2005-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnappers demanded the release of three IRA prisoners, including [[Rose Dugdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Hostage Dilemma|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946574,00.html|date=1975-10-20|accessdate=2009-06-06|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescue==
After a massive security operation, the kidnappers were eventually traced on 21 October 1975 to a house in [[Monasterevin]], [[County Kildare]]. After a further two-week-long siege, Herrema was released, shaken but unharmed.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1018/herremat.html|title=Herrema donating papers to UL library|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=2005-10-18|accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Ireland soon after.

==Aftermath==
He eventually returned to present an episode of ''[[Saturday Live (Irish TV series)|Saturday Live]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}{{When|date=June 2009}} He and his wife Elizabeth were made [[Irish nationality law#Honorary Grant of Irish Citizenship|honorary Irish citizens]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20041130.xml&amp;Node=821|title=Parliamentary Debates (Official Report - Unrevised) Dáil Éireann Tuesday, 30 November 2004|publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas|accessdate=2009-06-06|date=2004-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was made a Freeman of the city of Limerick.

In 2005, he donated his personal papers to the [[University of Limerick]].&lt;ref name="rte" /&gt;

'''The Toy Association''' is an American [[trade association]] for the US toy industry.

== Description ==
The Toy Association’s member companies account for roughly 85% of US domestic toy sales. In 2017, US retail sales of toys generated nearly $27 billion. The toy industry’s annual total economic impact in the US is nearly $110.9 billion.&lt;ref name="dallas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.toyassociation.org/ta/research/data/impact/toys/research-and-data/data/economic-impact-data.aspx|title=Economic Impact Data|last=|first=|date=October 15, 2018|work=toyassociation.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average price of a toy is around $10, but the estimated 3 billion units sold across the United States each year generates approximately $27 billion in direct toy sales. From toy inventors to store clerks, the toy industry supports an estimated 691,263 jobs (FTE) generating $35.1 billion in wages for US workers. The toy industry generates $14.98 billion in tax revenue each year.&lt;ref name="dallas"/&gt;

The Toy Association produces two major annual trade fairs: the North American International Toy Fair and the Fall Toy Preview. Other events include conferences and PlayFair, a team-building program offered to schools and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organization Profile |url=http://www.toyassociation.org/App_Themes/tia/pdfs/about/TIAOrganizationalProfile.pdf |publisher=Toy Industry Association |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
