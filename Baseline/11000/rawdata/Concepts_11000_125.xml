[[Image:JO200109337.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

The 2001 '''About-Picard law''' [abu pika:r] (named after French parliament members [[Nicolas About]] and [[Catherine Picard]]), a controversial piece of [[France|French]] legislation, broadly speaking, makes it possible to act against organisations (legal entities) when such organisations have become involved in certain crimes. The law, in its own words, aimed at movements deemed cultic (''mouvements sectaires'') that "undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms".  The law has caused controversy internationally, with some commentators alleging that it infringes [[religious freedom]] while proponents content it reinforces religious freedom.

==Background on Government and Religion in France ==
:{{Main|Status of religious freedom in France}}

[[Freedom of religion]] and [[separation of church and state]] have formed part of the French idea of the state since at least the [[French Revolution]] and in some ways long before, since the 16th century period of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. Separation of religion and state in France takes the form of ''[[laïcité]]'', by which political power avoids interference in the sphere of religious dogma, and religion avoids interference in public policies. The French understand "freedom of religion" primarily as the freedom of the individual to believe or not to believe what any religion teaches. Also, because of a long history of one single dominating church (the [[Catholic Church]]), the French state sees its duty less in protecting religion from state interference than in protecting the individual from interference by religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In the wake of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] murders and suicides, the [[French National Assembly|French Parliament]] established the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]] to investigate cults. In December 1995 the Commission delivered a report on cults which caused much controversy, some of it due to a list extracted from a report by the [[French National Police]] on purported cults.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp
&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission assimilated information and analysis from the French police secret service, the [[Direction centrale des renseignements généraux|Renseignements généraux]].)

Following the recommendations of the report, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] set up in 1996 the "Interministerial board of observation of sects", followed in 1998 by the "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Sects" ([[Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes|MILS]]). In 2002 the "Interministerial Monitoring Mission Against Sectarian Abuses" ([[MIVILUDES]]) replaced MILS.

Other action of the French government against potential abuses by cults resulted in the passing of the About-Picard law.

== The About-Picard law==

Commentators often refer to the Law 2001-504 of June 12, 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX9903887L    &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021114222634/http://religionandpolicy.org/show.php?p=1.1.105 approximate translation into English]&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as the About-Picard law, from the name of its ''[[rapporteur]]s'' (parliamentarians who report upon the draft law), [[French Senate|senator]] [[Nicolas About]] ([[Union pour la Démocratie Française|UDF]] center-right party)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senat.fr/rap/l99-131/l99-131.html
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French National Assembly|deputy]] [[Catherine Picard]] ([[French Socialist Party|PS]] center-left party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208022636/http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |archivedate=2005-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French parliament adopted the law with broad cross-party support under the government of center-right president [[Jacques Chirac]] and socialist prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]].

'''Article 223-15-2 of Penal code:'''&lt;br /&gt;(Act no. 2001-504 of 12 June 2001, article 10 Official Journal of 13 June 2001 ; Ordinance No. 2000-916 of 19 September 2000, article 3 Official Journal of 22 September 2000, into force 1 January 2002) 
       
« Fraudulently abusing the ignorance or state of weakness of a minor, or of a person whose particular vulnerability, due to age, sickness, infirmity, to a physical or psychological disability or to pregnancy, is apparent or known to the offender, or abusing a person in a state of physical or psychological dependency resulting from serious or repeated pressure or from techniques used to affect his judgement, in order to induce the minor or other person to act or abstain from acting in any way seriously harmful to him, is punished by three years' imprisonment and a fine of € 375,000.
Where the offence is committed by the legal or de facto manager of a group that carries out activities the aim or effect of which is to create, maintain or exploit the psychological or physical dependency of those who participate in them, the penalty is increased to five years' imprisonment and to a fine of € 750,000. »

The additional penalties that natural or legal persons may incur are mentioned in the following articles 223-15-3 and 4.

===Main points ===
Notable new points introduced by the law include:
* In the case of certain crimes, the law extends legal responsibility from individuals to organizations (corporations, associations, and other [[Juristic person|legal entities]]...).
* Courts can order the dissolution of organizations if they or their executives have been found guilty of these crimes.
 
The initial draft of the About-Picard law included the criminalization of "mental manipulation". Many organizations criticised this clause for its vagueness.  [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Élisabeth Guigou]] pushed for the removal of this clause, which the legislators excluded from the final version of the law. However, the law makes it a crime to defraud a person weakened by illness, old age, etc., but also of a person in a state of ''psychological or physical subjection resulting from grave or reiterated pressures or techniques able to alter judgement''.

=== Application of the law ===
There was one famous application of the law since its adoption: that of [[Arnaud Mussy]], leader of the tiny ''Néo-Phare'' (New Lighthouse) cult. Mussy, who claims that he is the [[Christ]], had announced imminent [[apocalypse]], resulting in the suicide of one of his followers and the attempted suicides of two others, who were severely wounded in 2001. The criminal court in Nantes sentenced him to three years in prison and 90,000 [[French Franc|FF]] damages in November 2004. It ruled that he had "abused fraudulently the state of ignorance and weakness of several persons in the state of bodily or mental dependence".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0506.htm#6a&lt;/ref&gt; A higher court in Rennes confirmed the sentence in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0507.htm#12
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Law ==
:''See [[Status of religious freedom in France]] for expressed concerns about other aspects of French policies with respect to minority religions.''

The French government, when challenged on issues of religious discrimination, states that it has no concern in any way with religious doctrine ''per se''. The government has taken the position that it will deal with the concrete consequences of cult affiliation, especially with respect to children. The government sees this as particularly important in the light of past abuse committed in some criminal cults, such as [[sexual slavery]] and [[mass suicide]].  According to government sources, none of the criteria listed in related government documents on sects discuss [[theology]]; they only focus on the actions and the methods of the groups.

Critics of the law see this as merely a semantic change &lt;!-- change from what? --&gt; and maintain that no empirical studies support claims of the use of techniques of coercive persuasion by NRMs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theology.homestead.com/Papers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions inside France ===
{{See also|Status of religious freedom in France#Complaints by minority religions and groups|l1=Status of religious freedom in France: Complaints by minority religions}}

The [[Bishop of Soissons]], [[Marcel Herriot]], defended the law on 25 June 2000 asserting it was necessary to protect by law persons, family, society and religions themselves from sects that are violating fundamental freedoms and human dignity.

Some groups claim that the Parliamentary Reports and the controversy surrounding the About-Picard law have created an unhealthy atmosphere, resulting in minority religious groups suffering from excessively strict, uneven, or even abusive discrimination in the application of other laws by local authorities. For example, the group ''Coordination des Associations et Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience'' (Co-ordination of Associations and Individuals for Freedom of Conscience) requested the repeal of the law, asserting laws should not specify groups as "sectarian" or "cultic" as, in a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coordiap.com/Gtemo01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] report has described this group as a partisan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219055614/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |archivedate=2005-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The umbrella association of French [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] sued the French government in the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] in case #53430/99, alleging that the publication of the parliamentary reports and the enactment of the About-Picard law infringed its civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=671525&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected the application.

In other cases (#53934/00), the Court affirmed that the publication of a Parliamentary Report disparaging to some groups did not constitute an infringement of human rights, even though these groups were not given a [[legal recourse]] for the removal of their name from the report.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=682416&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149
&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights activists dubbed the law "un délit d'opinion" (a thought crime).&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements by the Council of Europe ===

Forty different religious and human-rights groups submitted a petition to the [[Council of Europe]]'s Parliamentary Assembly. This petition led to a report (Report 9612 of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of Europe) containing an expert paper by Swiss professor Joseph Voyame, who concluded:
:''"On the basis of the foregoing, I conclude that the French Law of 12 June 2001 is not incompatible with the Council of Europe’s values."''
Voyame deduces that the law clearly responds to a need, that the measure of dissolution appears radical, but also effective and reliable, and that judicial guarantees surround it. He also discusses the title with its mentioning of "cultic groups", but comes to the conclusion that the uncertainty regarding the definition has little importance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The title is undeniably part of the [Act], but has no legislative authority in itself. Although it may be useful for the purposes of interpretation, it cannot be used in making a ruling that runs counter to a clear legal provision [...] As we will see, [Sections] 1, 19 and 20 of this [Act] identify the targeted incorporated organizations and groups with the greatest possible precision. It is these standard-setting texts that are decisive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report discussed several objections regarding the word "secte" (cult):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the word ‘sect’ has taken on an extremely pejorative connotation. In the eyes of the public, it stigmatises movements whose activities are dangerous either for their members or for society. Today, the world contains dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of groups both large and small, all with various beliefs and observances, which are not necessarily dangerous or prejudicial to freedom. It is true that among these groups are some which have committed criminal acts. Nevertheless, the existence of a few dangerous movements is not enough to condemn all the rest (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The act for the most part simply reiterates existing provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have just seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2002, the Council of Europe passed a resolution inviting the Government of France to reconsider the About-Picard Law and to clarify certain terms in the law. It referred, however, to the Recommendation 1412 (1999) on the illegal activities of sects, where it had concluded that it was ''"essential to ensure that the activities of groups, whatever religious, esoteric or spiritual description they adopted, were in keeping with the principles of democratic societies and, in particular, the provisions of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)."'' and it stated that ''"ultimately, should the case arise, it will be for the [[European Court of Human Rights]], and it alone, to say whether or not this law is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights."'' .

=== Reactions outside of France===
In an open letter dated June 2000 to Alain Vivien about religious freedom in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df= 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Rhodes]], Executive Director of the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]] (IHFHR), wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We question ourselves how such a law can claim to guarantee human rights when it goes against the rights of association, expression, religion and conscience; when it puts in danger the right of minorities and maintains prejudices that are so incompatible with the concept of tolerance intrinsic to that of human rights. France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which you propose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alain Vivien responded: "[The IHFHR] seems today to have passed into the hands of [[Scientology|Scientologists]] and perhaps other transnational organizations". [[Aaron Rhodes]] then acknowledged that the Moscow office of the IHFHR had received funding from the [[Church of Scientology]] to print a leaflet about religious freedom in Russia, and voiced his astonishment at the charge. Rhodes voiced his embarrassment: "[...]for you and your fellow French citizens by your recourse to methods of denunciations and insinuations that remind us of those sometimes used by totalitarian and backward regimes."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Reaction of the government of the United States of America ====
Some groups sought the help of their governments to fight what they saw as religious intolerance in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/2000/090500-4.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Church of Scientology]] utilised pressure groups against the French government, and had some success with the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, which repeatedly brought the matter before the French government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193106/http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to pastor [[Jean-Arnold de Clermont]], head of the French Protestant federation and himself a strong critic of the first draft of the law, the complaints originating in the United States concerning religious freedom in France were largely based on biased, poor information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apologeticsindex.org/news1/an010521-20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a newspaper article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; the French government considered American interference regarding religious freedom in France as unwarranted meddling by the US government in France's internal affairs. Paul Webster wrote that President [[Jacques Chirac]] told Clinton that religious freedom would no longer be a subject for bilateral presidential talks, "in the light of what has been officially described as 'shocking' White House support for [[Church of Scientology|Scientologists]] and [[Unification Church|Moonies]]". The French government also described the  [[United States Congress]]'s introduction of laws protecting religious freedom internationally as "an unacceptable intrusion into internal affairs". [[Alain Vivien]], former chairman of the French ministerial mission to combat the influence of cults (MILS), and the president of the ''Centre Contre les Manipulations Mentales'' (Centre Against Mental Manipulation), said many observers believed that Clinton was making his peace with big religious movements, "because they offer an indispensable source of [[campaign finance|political financing]]", and that with the help of Scientologists, cults were infiltrating UN and European human rights associations and collaborating on virulent reports against France's policies.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html "France to crack down on sects"], by Paul Webster; Wednesday June 14, 2000. Retrieved 2007-01-01.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The French did not alter their law following these requests; and the claims and actions of the US government regarding the religious situation in France largely ceased with the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration.

Some critics of French legislation have voiced concerns that countries which do not have the same legal safeguards and constitutional rights as France may emulate this legislation. In the words of a US official:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064332/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |archive-date=2009-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet the law itself remains problematic not only because of the threat the language carries in France, but because it is even now being considered for emulation by countries that lack France’s commitment to [[rule of law]] and human rights. Such a model serves only too well as cover for those nations who persecute under the guise of law enforcement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 15 September 2006 the United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] released a report on religious freedom in France.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71380.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This report noted that "The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice." It reported mostly anonymous concerns over repression of religious freedom in France, notably in regards to what the report referred to in one case as "cult groups", as well as the law banning religious symbols in schools, and rising anti-semitism in France.

'''Andre Bernard Gurode''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|d}}; born March 6, 1978) is a former [[American football]] [[Center (American football)|center]] and [[Guard (American football)|guard]] who played 11 seasons in the NFL. He played [[college football]] for the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], earning consensus [[All-America]]n recognition. The [[Dallas Cowboys]] selected him in the second round of the [[2002 NFL Draft]]. He is a five-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection, and has also played for the [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Oakland Raiders]].

==Early years==
Gurode was born in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name=ProFootballReference.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurode on Pro-Football-Reference |work=fbref.com |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GuroAn20.htm|accessdate=2007-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071229021430/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GuroAn20.htm| archivedate= 29 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played [[high school football]] at [[North Shore Senior High School (Texas)|North Shore High School]] in Houston.  As a senior, ''[[USA Today]]'', [[PrepStar]] and SuperPrep selected him as an honorable mention high school [[All-America]]. He was also named to the '' [[Houston Chronicle]]'' Top 100 List and made the [[Austin American-Statesman]] "Fab 55" team.  He earned All-Area honors as a senior (second team honors as a junior), and was All-District and All-Greater Houston as a junior and senior (when he also was his team's most outstanding offensive lineman).

Gurode lettered three times in [[basketball]] and four times in [[Track and field athletics|track]] with personal bests of 186' 0" in the [[Discus throw|discus]] and 54' 1" in the [[shot put]].

==College career==
Gurode attended the [[University of Colorado]], where he played for the [[Colorado Buffaloes football]] team from 1998 to 2001.  He was a four-year starter for the Buffaloes, playing both [[center (American football)|center]] and [[guard (American football)|guard]] on the [[offensive line]].  He started his first two and a half seasons at center, before moving to guard in the middle of his junior year.  As a junior in 2000, he started the first six games of the year at center and the final five games at guard.  He received the John Mack Award, as selected by the coaches for being Colorado's most outstanding offensive player and was also selected honorable mention All-[[Big 12 Conference]] honors while helping the Buffaloes to a 7–5 record and a win over the [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College Eagles]] in the [[Insight.com Bowl]].  As a senior, he started every game at right guard.

Gurode was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a consensus first-team [[All-America]]n as a senior in 2001.&lt;ref name=ncaarecordsbook&gt;''2011 NCAA Football Records Book'', [http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2011/Awards.pdf  Award Winners], National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 11 (2011).  Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  During his career he allowed just 7.5 sacks in 2,653 plays as a starter for the Buffaloes.

He earned a degree in ethnic studies from the University of Colorado, where he was a member of the school's "Academic Starters" team.

==Professional career==

===2002 NFL Draft===
Gurode initially projected as a [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and was ranked the best available in the [[2002 NFL Draft]], along with [[Kendall Simmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/players.php?genpos=OG&amp;draftyear=2002&amp;sortorder=tsxpos&amp;order=ASC |title=2002 Draft OG Ranking |work=NFLDraftScout.com |accessdate=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded as an early second round pick,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/2002/draft/players/99600.html |title=Andre Gurode Draft Profile |work=Sports Illustrated |date=April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually selected 37th overall by the [[Dallas Cowboys]].

}}

===Dallas Cowboys (2002–2010)===
Gurode was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the second round of the [[2002 NFL Draft]] as a [[Center (American football)|center]]. He started fast by becoming the first rookie in club history to start at [[Center (American football)|center]] on opening day.

It is believed [[2002 NFL season|2002]] was the first time a [[NFL]] franchise had five African-American starters on their [[offensive line]], when the Cowboys lined up Gurode at [[Center (American and Canadian football)|center]], [[Tackle (American and Canadian football)|tackle]]s [[Flozell Adams]] and [[Solomon Page]], [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]]s [[Larry Allen]] and [[Kelvin Garmon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://a.espncdn.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1417470.html&lt;/ref&gt; Gurode also became part of history as the starting [[Center (American and Canadian football)|center]] on the Cowboys [[offensive line]] that helped [[Emmitt Smith]] eclipse [[Walter Payton]] as the [[NFL]]'s all-time leading rusher, playing against the [[Seattle Seahawks]] on October 27. While he started the first six games of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]] at [[Center (American football)|center]], Gurode was moved to help compensate for the number of injuries along the [[offensive line]], compiling another eight starts at [[Guard (American football)|right guard]].

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], [[Bill Parcells]] was hired as the Cowboys [[head coach]] and decided that Gurode's best position was at [[Guard (American football)|guard]], starting 15 games at that position in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and 13 games in [[2004 NFL season|2004]] with mixed results, before getting benched for the final two games.

At the start of the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], Parcells accepted he made a misjudgment by moving Gurode to [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and switched him back to [[Center (American football)|center]], with the Cowboys also signing [[Marco Rivera]] to take his place at [[Guard (American football)|guard]]. That season, he was a versatile backup, playing behind [[Al Johnson (guard)|Al Johnson]] at [[Center (American football)|center]] and Rivera at [[Guard (American football)|right guard]].

In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], he rededicated himself to football and won the starting center job again, over [[Al Johnson (guard)|Al Johnson]]. On October 1, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], in the third quarter of a game against the [[Tennessee Titans]], Titans [[defensive tackle]] [[Albert Haynesworth]] stomped on Gurode's head. Haynesworth's cleats caused a laceration requiring thirty stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsline.com/nfl/story/9700905 |title=Titans DT Haynesworth nailed with five-game suspension |publisher=Associated Press |work=Sportsline.com |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=2008-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628222456/http://sportsline.com/nfl/story/9700905 |archivedate=June 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haynesworth was ejected, and subsequently suspended by the NFL for five games without pay.

Following the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], Gurode was named to his first [[2007 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] as an injury replacement. On February 20, [[2007 NFL season|2007]], the Cowboys re-signed Gurode to a six-year contract worth US$30 million including a $10 million signing bonus.

Gurode developed into one of the league's most respected [[Center (American football)|centers]] since returning to being a full-time starter in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], and has been selected to the [[All-Pro]] Team ([[2007 All-Pro Team|2007]], [[2009 All-Pro Team|2009]]), as well as to five straight [[Pro Bowl]]s ([[2006 Pro Bowl|2006]], [[2007 Pro Bowl|2007]], [[2008 Pro Bowl|2008]], [[2009 Pro Bowl|2009]], [[2010 Pro Bowl|2010]])

He had offseason left knee surgery and missed the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]] training camp and three out of four preseason games.  With the emergence of second-year player [[Phil Costa (American football)|Phil Costa]], he was released after the preseason following failed negotiations regarding a restructured contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurode's departure shows Garrett means business |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/08/29/3321072/gurodes-departure-shows-garrett.html?storylink=digger-topic |author=Jaime Aron |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltimore Ravens (2011)===
Gurode reportedly visited the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[New England Patriots]] [http://bleacherbumsports.net/2011/09/02/pats-to-work-out-gurode/] before signing a 1-year, $3 million contract with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on September 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravens sign Pro Bowl center Andre Gurode to one-year contract |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/sports/football/other_nfl/view/20110905ravens_sign_pro_bowl_center_andre_gurode_to_one-year_contract/srvc=home&amp;position=recent |author=Jamison Hensley |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago Bears (2012)===
On November 27, 2012, the [[Chicago Bears]] signed Gurode after losing guards [[Lance Louis]] and [[Chris Spencer (American football)|Chris Spencer]] to injuries sustained in a game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on November 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bears add veteran lineman Gurode |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-chicago-bears-sign-andre-gurode-20121127,0,2615470.story |author=Brad Biggs |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2012-11-27 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was waived by the Bears on December 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Gould-among-three-Bears-played-on-injured-reserve/12d03969-41b4-4d61-8eda-d89419979835|title=Gould among three Bears played on injured reserve|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=2012-12-11|accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oakland Raiders (2013)===
On July 26, 2013, Gurode signed with the [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=McDonald |title=Oakland Raiders sign veteran lineman Andre Gurode |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/raiders/ci_23742202/oakland-raiders-sign-veteran-lineman-andre-gurode |work=San Jose Mercury News |date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the 2013 NFL season Gurode became a free agent.

[[Human Rights Watch]] has stated in their reports that the differences between Haitians and Dominicans can be based on colonial times from linguistic, cultural, and racial differences. For instance, the [[Dominican Republic]] was governed by the Spanish, and thus acquired part of their culture from the Spanish, mixed with African and Native American. [[Haiti]], on the other hand, was governed by the French, and its culture is a mixture of French, African and Native American. The majority of Haiti's population is descended almost entirely from [[African diaspora|African]] slaves, while [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominicans]] possess a [[multiracial]] mix of Spanish, African and to a lesser extent, Native American ancestry. It is evident that historical background is related between the two countries, however, there are major cultural divisions.
 
''Antihaitianismo'' can be traced back to a policy of [[racial segregation]] instituted by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] in the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]] (present-day Dominican Republic).&lt;ref name="sagas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagás |first=Ernesto |title=A Case of Mistaken Identity: Antihaitianismo in Dominican Culture |publisher=Webster University |url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/antihaiti.htm |accessdate=2007-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008042155/http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/antihaiti.htm |archivedate=2007-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the arrival of Europeans, [[Hispaniola|the island]] was split into absolutist [[Chiefdoms of Hispaniola|chiefdoms]], three where modern-day Santo Domingo now exists, and two where modern-day Haiti now exists (albeit also including some territory which is currently part of Santo Domingo).  [[Island Caribs|Carib people]] from islands further south were often at war with the [[Taíno people]]. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] reached the island in 1492 (slaves imported from Africa arrived from 1503 onwards&amp;mdash;many natives were also soon enslaved), and within a few decades the Spanish controlled most of the island. During the 17th century, however, the French also began maneuvering for control, and in 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick|acquired the western portion]] (now part of Haiti&amp;mdash;whereas the Spanish portion encompassed the modern Dominican Republic). During the 1790s and early 19th century, the French and Spanish battled back and forth across the island; by 1809 the [[Haitian Revolution]] had resulted in the overthrow of both French and Spanish control.  The [[Reconquista (Santo Domingo)|Spanish briefly retook]] the eastern portion that same year, but in 1821 [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|lost control again]] in another rebellion. Shortly afterwards, Haitian forces [[Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo|again briefly controlled the entire island]], from 1822 to 1844. In 1844 the secret revolutionary movement called "La Trinitaria" took place and the Dominican Republic declared its independence defeating the Haitian forces. After several tumultuous decades, the Spanish [[Dominican Restoration War|briefly acquired nominal control]] of the Dominican Republic in the 1860s, setting off another war. By the late 19th century, over three hundred years of European control was ended; the modern history of [[Haiti#20th century|west Hispaniola (Haiti)]] and [[Dominican Republic#20th century|east Hispaniola (Dominican Republic)]] had begun.

===Under Trujillo: 1930s and 1940s===
''Antihaitianismo'' was strongly institutionalized during the regime of [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]]. Border disputes under Trujillo culminated in the order of a military intervention and to massacre Haitians accused of practicing [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] or [[witchery]], practices that were against the religious beliefs of the time. Claims range "from several hundred to 26,000"&lt;ref name="sagas2" /&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=May 2018}} or even "recorded as having a death toll reaching 30,000"&lt;ref name="Cambeira'96"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Cambeira |title=Quisqueya la bella |edition=October 1996 |page=182 |publisher=M.E.

During later diplomacy, Trujillo agreed to pay hundreds of thousands in reparations,&lt;ref name="sagas2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagás|first=Ernesto|title=An apparent contradiction?

Dominican intellectuals [[Manuel Arturo Peña Batlle]], [[Joaquín Balaguer]], [[Manuel de Jesús Troncoso de la Concha]], among others, led the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/antihaiti.htm|title=Haiti:  Antihaitianismo in Dominican Culture|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoy.com.do/la-agresion-contra-lescot/|title=La agresión contra Lescot|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day: 1990s===
Trujillo's policies served to perpetuate antihaitianismo within the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name="sagas2"/&gt;  In the 1996 Dominican presidential election, [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (historical leader of the [[Right-wing populism|populist Right]] and former right-hand of dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo|Trujillo]]) united in a "National Patriotic Front" with PLD candidate [[Leonel Fernández]] in order to prevent [[José Francisco Peña Gómez|Peña Gómez]] from becoming President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/world/dominican-republic-holds-runoff-capping-fierce-race.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Dominican Republic Holds Runoff, Capping Fierce Race | first=Larry | last=Rohter | date=1996-07-01 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43/051.html James Ferguson, Two Caudillos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ars Poetica,''''' or "'''The Art of Poetry'''", is a poem written by [[Horace]] c. 19 [[Before Christ|BC]],&lt;ref&gt;The dating of the poem is uncertain. Different sources give various dates ranging from 19–10 BC. The date 19 BC is given by ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature,'' p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he advises poets on the art of writing poetry and drama. The ''Ars Poetica'' has "exercised a great influence in later ages on European literature, notably on French drama"&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, M.C. ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature,'' 3rd ed. Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and has inspired poets and authors since it was written.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the Ars Poetica and related poems, see: Poets.org – http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20035&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had been familiar since the [[Middle Ages]], it is used in [[literary criticism]] since the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism: Volume 3, The Renaissance|last=Norton|first=Glyn|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0521300088|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The poem was written in [[hexameter]] verse as an Epistle (or Letter) to [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]] (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons, and is sometimes referred to as the ''Epistula Ad Pisones'', or "Epistle to the Pisos". The first mention of its name as the ''"Ars Poetica"'' was c. 95 by the classical literary critic [[Quintilian]] in his ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Institutio Oratoria'' 8.60 (Also known as ''Institutes of Oratory'' in its Dedication to Trypho). See: ''Horace: Epistles Book II and Epistle to the Pisones (Ars Poetica),'' ed. by [[Niall Rudd]]. Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and since then it has been known by that name. The translations of the original epistle are typically in the form of prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69381/ars-poetica|title=Ars Poetica by Horace|date=2018-11-23|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Written, like Horace's other epistles of this period, in a loose conversational frame, ''Ars poetica'' consists of 476 lines containing nearly 30 maxims for young poets."&lt;ref&gt;Article on ''Ars Poetica.'' Encyclopædia Britannica Academic Edition, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;   But ''Ars Poetica'' is not a systematic treatise of theory, and it wasn't intended to be. It is an inviting and lively poetic letter, composed for friends who appreciate poetic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Horace. Rudd, Niall, editor. ''Horace: Epistles Book II and Ars Poetica''. Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics. Cambridge University Press. (January 26, 1990). {{ISBN|978-0521312929}} page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace approaches poetry from a practical standpoint—as a craft, or ''ars''—rather than the theoretical approach of his predecessors, Aristotle and the philosopher [[Plato]]. He also holds the poet in high regard, as opposed, for instance, to Plato, who distrusts ''[[mimesis]]'' and who has philosopher [[Socrates]] say in Book 10 of the ''Republic'' that he would banish poets from the ideal state.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' ed. by Vincent B. Leitch et al. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2001, p. 121 and p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The following is a brief outline of the main subjects of the work:&lt;ref&gt;This summary is taken from: ''Horace: Satires; Epistles and Ars Poetica,'' translated and edited by H.R. Fairclough. Harvard: Loeb Classical Library, 1926, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

::(a) A poem demands unity, to be secured by harmony and proportion, as well as a wise choice of subject and good [[diction]]. Meter and style must be appropriate to theme and to character. A good model will always be found in Homer (ll, 1–152).
::(b) Dramatic poetry calls for special care – as to character drawing, propriety of representation, length of a play, number of actors, use of the chorus and its music, special features for the satyric type, verse-forms, and employment of Greek models (ll. 153–294).
::(c) A poet's qualifications include common sense, knowledge of character, adherence to high ideals, combination of the ''dulce'' with the ''utile,'' intellectual superiority, appreciation of the noble history and lofty mission of poetry, and above all a willingness to listen to and profit by impartial criticism (ll. 295–476).

:''(For a more detailed summary of Horace's '''Ars Poetica''', see the article on [[Epistles (Horace)|Horace's ''Epistles'']] – Epistle II.3).''

== Literary phrases ==
"Many of...[the] apt phrases [of the Ars Poetica]...have passed into common literary parlance."&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four quotations in particular are associated with the work:

* "''[[in medias res]]'' (l. 148)", or "into the middle of things". This describes a narrative technique of starting the story from its middle point. According to Horace, this entices the audience into the plot by making everyone curious about the characters' previous paths and their future destinies. The technique appeared frequently in ancient epics, and remains popular in modern narratives.
* "''[[ab ovo]]'' (l. 147)", or "from the beginning". As Homer did not initiate his epics about the Trojan War from the conception (thus, the egg – "ovo" in Latin) of Helen, poets and other story tellers should do something likewise: in other words, starting a story from its commencement will bore and fatigue audiences that may not be interested in a plot that is tediously inclusive. For another explanation of this mention of an egg, see [[Leda (mythology)]].
* "''quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus'' (l. 359)" or "sometimes even good Homer nods off". Today this expression is used to indicate that 1. even the most skilled poet can make continuity errors and 2. long works, usually epics (such as the [[Iliad]] or the [[Odyssey]]), may have their faults without that detracting significantly from their general quality. In context, however, Horace even censures Homer for such lapses. It reads "et idem | indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus"; (I even castigate the good Homer for the same [fault of technical errors] whenever he nods off). 
* "''[[ut pictura poesis]]'' (l. 361)", or "as is painting so is poetry", by which Horace meant that poetry, in its widest sense meaning "imaginative texts", merits the same careful interpretation that was in his day reserved for painting.

:(The latter two phrases occur one after the other near the end of the poem).

== Key concepts ==
The work is also known for its discussion of the principle of [[decorum]] (the use of appropriate vocabulary and diction in each style of writing) (l.81–106), and for Horace's criticisms of [[purple prose]] ''(purpureus pannus,'' l.15–16), a term coined by him to mean the use of flowery language.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is considered a core component of Horatian poetics as it principally aimed to achieve verisimilitude in artistic representation, guiding everything from the choice of genre to diction, dramatic characterization, meter, poetic invention, and the intended effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poetics of Conduct: Oral Narrative and Moral Being in a South Indian Town|last=Prasad|first=Leela|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2007|isbn=0231139203|location=New York|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cited that decorum enforces subordination such as of parts to whole, woman to man, desire to reason, and individual to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horace: Odes and Epodes|last=Lowrie|first=Michele|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199207695|location=Oxford|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line 191, Horace warns against ''[[deus ex machina]]'', the practice of resolving a convoluted plot by having an [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian god]] appear and set things right. Horace writes "Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus": "That a god not intervene, unless a knot show up that be worthy of such an untangler".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.emory.edu/DRAMA/ArsPoetica.html Ars Poetica, line 191] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209203746/http://www.english.emory.edu/DRAMA/ArsPoetica.html |date=February 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps it can even be said that the quotability of Horace's ''Ars Poetica'' is what has given it a distinguished place in literary criticism: ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'' says: 
::It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of Horace's ''Ars Poetica (Art of Poetry)'' for the subsequent history of literary criticism. Since its composition in the first century BCE, this epigrammatic and sometimes enigmatic critical poem has exerted an almost continual influence over poets and literary critics alike – perhaps because its dicta, phrased in verse form, are so eminently quotable. Horace's injunction that poetry should both "instruct and delight" has been repeated so often that it has come to be known as the Horatian platitude.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horatian platitude is usually given as "instruct ''and'' delight", but sometimes as "instruct ''or'' delight".  The first reading implies that all literature must be instructive. A related ambiguity is that "instruct" might be better translated as "help", "advise", or "warn". Horace repeats this maxim in different wordings: "Aut prodesse uolunt aut delectare poetae aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere uitae" (The poet wishes to benefit or please, or to be pleasant and helpful at the same time), "miscuit utile dulci" (a mix of useful and sweet), and "delectando pariterque monendo" (delighting and advising).

The ''Ars Poetica'' was first translated into English in [[1566 in poetry|1566]] by [[Thomas Drant]].&lt;ref&gt;See the article on Thomas Drant by Fred Schurink in ''The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature, Vol.1.'' Blackwell Publishing, 2012, pp.290–292.&lt;/ref&gt; A translation by [[Ben Jonson]] was published posthumously in [[1640 in poetry|1640]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art critics]] usually criticise art in the context of [[aesthetics]] or the theory of beauty.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marty.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/marty_kaplan/article/the_curious_case_of_criticism "The curious case of criticism."] ''Jewish Journal''.  23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of [[Art movement|artistic movements]] has resulted in a division of art criticism into different disciplines which may each use different criteria for their judgements.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; The most common division in the field of criticism is between historical criticism and evaluation, a form of art history, and contemporary criticism of work by living artists.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;

Despite perceptions that art criticism is a much lower risk activity than making art, opinions of current art are always liable to drastic corrections with the passage of time.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Critics of the past are often ridiculed for either favouring artists now derided (like the [[Academic art|academic painters]] of the late 19th century){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} or dismissing artists now venerated (like the early work of the [[Impressionists]]).&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rewald1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=James S.|title=Art History and the Problems of Criticism|journal=Daedalus|date=Winter 1960|volume=89|issue=1 – The Visual Arts Today|pages=253–263|jstor=20026565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art movements themselves were named disparagingly by critics, with the name later adopted as a sort of badge of honour by the artists of the style (e.g., [[Impressionism]], [[Cubism]]), with the original negative meaning forgotten.&lt;ref name="rewald1973"&gt;Rewald, John (1973).

Artists have often had an uneasy relationship with their critics. Artists usually need positive opinions from critics for their work to be viewed and purchased; unfortunately for the artists, only later generations may understand it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seenan|first=Gerard|title=Painting by ridiculed but popular artist sells for £744,800|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/20/arts.artsnews1|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art is an important part of being human and can be found through all aspects of our lives, regardless of the culture or times. There are many different variables that determine one's judgment of art such as aesthetics, cognition or perception. Art can be objective or subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form. It can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance. Art is a basic human instinct with a diverse range of form and expression. Art can stand-alone with an instantaneous judgment or can be viewed with a deeper more educated knowledge. Aesthetic, pragmatic, expressive, formalist, relativist, processional, imitation, ritual, cognition, mimetic and postmodern theories are some of many theories to criticize and appreciate art. Art criticism and appreciation can be subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form, or it can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Definition==
Art criticism has many and often numerous subjective viewpoints which are nearly as varied as there are people practising it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; It is difficult to come by a more stable definition than the activity being related to the discussion and interpretation of art and its value.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Depending on who is writing on the subject, "art criticism" itself may be obviated as a direct goal or it may include [[art history]] within its framework.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Regardless of definitional problems, art criticism can refer to the [[history of art|history of the craft]] in its essays and art history itself may use critical methods implicitly.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; According to art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], "The borders between art history and art criticism... are no more as firmly drawn as they once used to be.

==Methodology==
Art criticism includes a descriptive aspect,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; where the work of art is sufficiently translated into words so as to allow a case to be made.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of a work of art that follows the description (or is interspersed with it) depends as much on the artist's output as on the experience of the critic.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6" /&gt; There is in an activity with such a marked subjective component a variety of ways in which it can be pursued.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; As extremes in a possible spectrum,&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5" /&gt; while some favour simply remarking on the immediate impressions caused by an artistic object,&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; others prefer a more systematic approach calling on technical knowledge, favoured [[aesthetic theory]] and the known sociocultural context the artist is immersed in to discern their intent.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of art criticism}}
Critiques of art likely originated with the origins of art itself, as evidenced by texts found in the works of [[Plato]], [[Vitruvius]] or [[Augustine of Hippo]] among others, that contain early forms of art criticism.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Also, wealthy [[patron]]s have employed, at least since the start of [[Renaissance]], intermediary art-evaluators to assist them in the procurement of commissions and/or finished pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton E.|title=What Did the Renaissance Patron Buy?|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Summer 1998|volume=51|issue=2|pages=392–450|url=http://classroom.kleinisd.net/users/1243/docs/what_did_the_renaissance_patron_buy.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Renaissance Society of America|doi=10.2307/2901572|jstor=2901572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Alexander|title=Negotiating the Gift: Pre-Modern Figurations of Exchange|year=2003|pages=319–360|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/nagel_PDFs/Art_as_Gift_lq.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|chapter=Art as Gift: Liberal Art and Religious Reform in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Jonathan Richardson by Jonathan Richardson.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] coined the term 'art criticism' in 1719.]]
Art criticism as a genre of writing, obtained its modern form in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; The earliest use of the term art criticism was by the English painter [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] in his 1719 publication ''An Essay on the Whole Art of Criticism''. In this work, he attempted to create an objective system for the ranking of works of art. Seven categories, including drawing, composition, invention and colouring, were given a score from 0 to 18, which were combined to give a final score. The term he introduced quickly caught on, especially as the English middle class began to be more discerning in their art acquisitions, as symbols of their flaunted social status.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and England in the mid 1700s, public interest in art began to become widespread, and art was regularly exhibited at the Salons in Paris and the [[Summer Exhibition]]s of London. The first writers to acquire an individual reputation as art critics in 18th-century France were [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] with his ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'' (1718)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubos|first=Jean-Baptiste|title=Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture|year=1732|publisher=E. Neaulme|location=Utrecht|url=https://archive.org/details/reflexionscriti03jeagoog|edition=3rd|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; which garnered the acclaim of [[Voltaire]] for the sagacity of his approach to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire |title=Le Siècle de Louis XIV|year=1874|publisher=Charpentier et C&lt;sup&gt;ie&lt;/sup&gt;, Libraires-Éditeurs|location=Paris|page=581|url=https://archive.org/details/sicledelouisxiv00voltgoog|editor=Charles Louandre|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Étienne La Font de Saint-Yenne]] with ''Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France'' who wrote about the Salon of 1746,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Font de Saint-Yenne|first=Étienne|title=Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France : avec un examen des principaux ouvrages exposés au Louvre le mois d'août 1746|year=1747|publisher=Jean Neaulme|location=The Hague|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting on the socioeconomic framework of the production of the then popular [[Baroque]] art style,&lt;ref name="saisselin1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saisselin|first=Rémy G.|title=The Enlightenment Against the Baroque: Economics and Aesthetics in the Eighteenth Century|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–50|url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0779n6fb/|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a perception of anti-monarchist sentiments in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Walter |first=Nancy Paige Ryan |title=From Armida to Cornelia: Women and Representation in Prerevolutionary France |type=MA |page=11 |url=http://repositories.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/15694 |year=1995 |publisher=Texas Tech University |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century French writer [[Denis Diderot]] greatly advanced the medium of art criticism. Diderot's "The Salon of 1765"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diderot|first=Denis|title=Essais sur la peinture|year=1795|publisher=François Buisson|location=Paris|pages=118–407|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_000033125010886956|editor=François Buisson|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first real attempts to capture art in words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morley|first=John|authorlink=John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|editor=Hugh Chisholm, Franklin Henry Hooper|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=DIDEROT, DENIS|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_08.djvu/222|accessdate=10 December 2012|edition=11th|year=1911|volume=8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Thomas E. Crow]], "When Diderot took up art criticism it was on the heels of the first generation of professional writers who made it their business to offer descriptions and judgments of contemporary painting and sculpture. The demand for such commentary was a product of the similarly novel institution of regular, free, public exhibitions of the latest art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Thomas E.|title=Diderot on Art, Volume I: The Salon of 1765 and Notes on Painting|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=x|editor=Denis Diderot|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in England an exhibition of the [[Society of Arts]] in 1762 and later, in 1766, prompted a flurry of critical, though anonymous, pamphlets. Newspapers and periodicals of the period, such as the ''[[London Chronicle]]'', began to carry columns for art criticism; a form that took off with the foundation of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.
In the 1770s, the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' became the first newspaper to systematically review the art featured at exhibitions.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:John Ruskin - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]], the preeminent art critic of 19th century England.]]
From the 19th century onwards, art criticism became a more common vocation and even a profession,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; developing at times formalised methods based on particular [[aesthetic theory|aesthetic theories]].&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a rift emerged in the 1820s between the proponents of traditional [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] forms of art and the new [[romanticism|romantic]] fashion. The Neoclassicists, under [[Étienne-Jean Delécluze]] defended the classical ideal and preferred carefully finished form in paintings. Romantics, such as [[Stendhal]], criticized the old styles as overly formulaic and devoid of any feeling. Instead, they championed the new expressive, Idealistic, and emotional nuances of Romantic art. A similar, though more muted, debate also occurred in England.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the prominent critics in England at the time was [[William Hazlitt]], a painter and essayist. He wrote about his deep pleasure in art and his belief that the arts could be used to improve mankind's generosity of spirit and knowledge of the world around it. He was one of a rising tide of English critics that began to grow uneasy with the increasingly abstract direction [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s landscape art was moving in.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the great critics of the 19th century was [[John Ruskin]]. In 1843 he published ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in which he robustly defended the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] from his critics, who charged Turner with being unfaithful to nature. Through painstaking analysis and attention to detail, Ruskin was able to demonstrate the very opposite, in what the art historian [[E. H. Gombrich]] called "the most ambitious work of scientific art criticism ever attempted." Ruskin became renowned for his rich and flowing prose, and later in life he branched out to become an active and wide-ranging critic, publishing works on architecture and [[Renaissance art]], including the ''[[Stones of Venice]]''.

[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''Salon of 1845'' art review shocked its audience with its ideas.]]
Another dominating figure in 19th-century art criticism, was the French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], whose first published work was his art review ''Salon of 1845'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Curiosités esthétiques: Salon 1845–1859|year=1868|publisher=M. Lévy|pages=5–76|url=https://archive.org/details/curiositsesthti00baudgoog|accessdate=10 December 2013|chapter=Salon de 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attracted immediate attention for its boldness.&lt;ref name="eb1911bau"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

He tried to move the debate from the old binary positions of previous decades, declaring that "the true painter, will be he who can wring from contemporary life its epic aspect and make us see and understand, with colour or in drawing, how great and poetic we are in our cravats and our polished boots".&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

In 1877, [[John Ruskin]] derided ''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'' after the artist, [[James McNeill Whistler]], showed it at [[Grosvenor Gallery]]:&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Linda, ''After Whistler: The Artist and His Influence on American Painting.''

===Turn of the twentieth century===
[[File:Roger Fry self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Self portrait of [[Roger Fry]], described by the [[art historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]] as "incomparably the greatest influence on taste since [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]... In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry".&lt;ref&gt;IAN CHILVERS. "Fry, Roger." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists. 2003. Encyclopedia.com. 9 March 2009 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.Retrieved 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Towards the end of the 19th century a movement towards abstraction, as opposed to specific content, began to gain ground in England, notably championed by the playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. By the early twentieth century these attitudes formally coalesced into a coherent philosophy, through the work of [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, as art critic &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_artcritic.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Group Profiles &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/group.htm#bellc|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an art historian in the 1890s, Fry became intrigued with the new modernist art and its shift away from traditional depiction. His 1910 exhibition of what he called [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] art attracted much criticism for its iconoclasm. He vigorously defended himself in a lecture, in which he argued that art had moved to attempt to discover the language of pure imagination, rather than the staid and, to his mind, dishonest scientific capturing of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, ideas &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_ideas.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, modern art &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_modernart.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's argument proved to be very influential at the time, especially among the progressive elite. [[Virginia Woolf]] remarked that: "in or about December 1910 [the date Fry gave his lecture] human character changed."&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

Independently, and at the same time, [[Clive Bell]] argued in his 1914 book ''Art'' that all art work has its particular 'significant form', while the conventional subject matter was essentially irrelevant. This work laid the foundations for the [[formalism (art)|formalist]] approach to art.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tekiner|first=Deniz|title=Formalist Art Criticism and the Politics of Meaning|journal=Social Justice|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2 (104) – Art, Power, and Social Change|pages=31–44|jstor=29768369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Fry argued that "it’s all the same to me if I represent a Christ or a [[saucepan]] since it's the form, and not the object itself, that interests me." As well as being a proponent of [[formalism (art)|formalism]], he argued that the value of art lies in its ability to produce a distinctive aesthetic experience in the viewer. an experience he called "aesthetic emotion". He defined it as that experience which is aroused by significant form. He also suggested that the reason we experience aesthetic emotion in response to the significant form of a work of art was that we perceive that form as an expression of an experience the artist has. The artist's experience in turn, he suggested, was the experience of seeing ordinary objects in the world as pure form: the experience one has when one sees something not as a means to something else, but as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4XeRgAACAAJ|title=Art|author=Clive Bell|year=2010|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=9781770451858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Read]] was a champion of modern British artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] and became associated with Nash's contemporary arts group Unit One. He focused on the [[modernism]] of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and published an influential 1929 essay on the meaning of art in ''The Listener''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Paul Nash (1889–1946)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/paul-nash|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Ben Nicholson (1894–1982)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/ben-nicholson|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Henry Moore (1898–1986)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/henry-moore|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/barbara-hepworth|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the trend-setting ''Burlington Magazine'' (1933–38) and helped organise the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
As in the case of Baudelaire in the 19th century, the poet-as-critic phenomenon appeared once again in the 20th, when French poet [[Apollinaire]] became the champion of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Katharine |title=The Cubist Painters by Guillaume Apollinaire; Peter Read|journal=French Forum|date=Spring 2005|volume=30|issue=2|pages=139–141|jstor=40552391|doi=10.1353/frf.2005.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Timothy|title=Apollinaire and Cubism?|journal=Style|date=Summer 1988|volume=22|issue=2|pages=275–298|url=http://mlpa.nottingham.ac.uk/archive/00000033/01/Rec_Mathews.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, French writer and hero of the Resistance [[André Malraux]] wrote extensively on art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Derek|title=Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi}}&lt;/ref&gt; going well beyond the limits of his native Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudek|first=Antony|title=The Vocal Turn|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|year=2012|volume=10|issue=1|pages=64–65|doi=10.5334/jcms.1011210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction that the vanguard in Latin America lay in [[Mexican Muralism]] ([[José Clemente Orozco|Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]]){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} changed after his trip to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1958. After visiting the studios of several Argentine artists in the company of the young Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Buenos Aires [[Rafael Squirru]], Malraux declared the new vanguard to lie in [[Argentina]]'s new artistic movements.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Squirru, a poet-critic who became Cultural Director of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] in [[Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], during the 1960s, was the last to interview [[Edward Hopper]] before his death, contributing to a revival of interest in the American artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Gail|title=Edward Hopper : an intimate biography|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]]) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the [[New York Vanguard]].&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=The Art Story: Gallery – The Art of This Century Gallery|url=http://www.theartstory.org/gallery-art-of-this-century.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]] who functioned as critics as well.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-robert-motherwell-13286 |title=Oral history interview with Robert Motherwell, 1971 Nov. 24-1974 May 1 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Motherwell|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-motherwell-1673|publisher=Tate|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Chronology of the Artist's Life page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although New York and the world were unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury" /&gt; by the late 1940s most of the artists who have become household names today had their well established patron critics.&lt;ref name="oxfordart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Painters in Postwar New York City|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/public/page/benz/themes/PostwarNYC|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Barnett Newman, [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Abstract Expressionism|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-abstract-expressionism.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uima.uiowa.edu/mural/ Jackson Pollock, ''Mural'' (1943)] [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]], Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenberg55"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Clement|title=American-Type Painting|journal=[[Partisan Review]]|year=1955|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Abstract Expressionism: Painting Action and Colorfields|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/abstract-expressionism.html|work=Color Vision &amp; Art|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php|publisher=The Barnett Newman Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibitions – Adolph Gottlieb|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/home/content/exhibitions/special/gottlieb/gottlieb.html|publisher=The Jewish Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Hofmann: Biography|url=http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|publisher=The Estate of Hans Hofmann|accessdate=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129075738/http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de&amp;nbsp;Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Mark|author2=Annalyn Swan|title=When de Kooning Was King|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=8 November 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/10248/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Harold Rosenberg|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-rosenberg-harold.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas B. Hess]], the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Thomas B. Hess|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hess-thomas.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers" or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.:13&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, in 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] "became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Biennale of Venice. New York's two leading art magazines were not interested. ''Arts'' mentioned the historic event only in a news column and ''Art News'' (Managing editor: Thomas B. Hess) ignored it completely. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' printed feature articles".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/5750568&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]] wrote catalogue forewords and reviews and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Session at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pgs.: 240–241, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter to [[Sidney Janis]] on 9 April 1955: {{quotation|It is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, p.: 201, University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York [[Trotskyist]], [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordart"/&gt; As long time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; Artist [[Robert Motherwell]], well-heeled, joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Robert Motherwell, Master of Abstract, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/obituaries/robert-motherwell-master-of-abstract-dies.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement Greenberg proclaimed [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. Greenberg supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever "purer" and more concentrated in what was "essential" to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:154–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New,'' Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", Da Capo Press, 1959 pp.:23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Abstract Expressionism at the time was ''New York Times'' art critic [[John Canaday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=John Canaday|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-canaday-john.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] were also important postwar art historians who voiced support for Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|title=A Critic Turns 90; Meyer Schapiro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/magazine/a-critic-turns-90-meyer-schapiro.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Kristi|title=Remembering Leo Steinberg (1920–2011)|url=http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2011/03/15/remembering-leo-steinberg-1920-2011.html|work=The Chicago Blog|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early to mid sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Michael Fried|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-fried-michael.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Robert Hughes|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hughes-robert.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art criticism===
[[Feminist art criticism]] emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=N.paradoxa|date=September 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of art criticism.

==Today==

Art critics today work not only in print media and in specialist art magazines as well as newspapers. Art critics appear also on the internet, TV, and radio, as well as in museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="ntifotva"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Criticism|url=http://art.unt.edu/ntieva/pages/teaching/tea_comp_artcriticism.html|work=Comprehensive Art Education|publisher=North Texas Institute For Educators on the Visual Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gratza|first=Agnieszka|title=Frieze or faculty?

Art critics curate exhibitions and are frequently employed to write exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Art critics have their own organisation, a [[UNESCO]] non-governmental organisation, called the [[International Association of Art Critics]] which has around 76 national sections and a political non-aligned section for refugees and exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association of Art Critics|url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100031328|work=UNESCO NGO – db|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art blogs===

[[File:Barycentric_subdivision_of_a_3-simplex.png|thumb|right|A 3-simplex, with barycentric subdivisions of 1-faces (edges) 2-faces (triangles) and 3-faces (body).]]
In [[geometry]], the '''barycentric coordinate system''' is a [[coordinate system]] in which the location of a point of a [[simplex]] (a triangle, [[tetrahedron]], etc.) is specified as the [[center of mass]], or barycenter, of usually unequal [[mass]]es placed at its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]. Coordinates also extend outside the simplex, where one or more coordinates become [[negative number|negative]]. The system was introduced (1827) by [[August Ferdinand Möbius]].&lt;ref name=Hille&gt;Hille, Einar. "Analytic Function Theory, Volume I", Second edition, fifth printing. Chelsea Publishing Company, New York, 1982,  {{ISBN|0-8284-0269-8}}, page 33, footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n&lt;/math&gt; be the vertices of a [[simplex]] in an [[affine space]] ''A''. If, for some point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; in ''A'',

:&lt;math&gt; ( a_1 + \cdots + a_n ) \mathbf{p} = a_1 \, \mathbf{x}_1 + \cdots + a_n \, \mathbf{x}_n &lt;/math&gt;

and at least one of &lt;math&gt;a_1, \ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt; does not vanish
then we say that the coefficients (&lt;math&gt;a_1, \ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt;) are ''barycentric coordinates'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n&lt;/math&gt;. The vertices themselves have the coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1=(1, 0, 0, \ldots, 0), \mathbf{x}_2=(0, 1, 0, \ldots, 0), \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n=(0, 0, 0, \ldots, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. Barycentric coordinates are not unique: for any ''b'' not equal to zero, (&lt;math&gt;b a_1, \ldots, b a_n&lt;/math&gt;) are also barycentric coordinates of ''p''.

When the coordinates are not negative, the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; lies in the [[convex hull]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n&lt;/math&gt;, that is, in the simplex which has those points as its vertices.

Barycentric coordinates, as defined above, are a form of [[homogeneous coordinates]]: indeed, the "usual" homogeneous coordinates are the barycentric coordinates defined in the extended affine n-space on the simplex whose vertices are the points at infinity on the coordinate axes, plus the origin. Sometimes values of coordinates are restricted with a condition 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum a_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;
which makes them [[unique (mathematics)|unique]]; then, they are [[affine coordinates]]. The classical terminology in this case is that of '''absolute barycentric coordinates'''.&lt;ref name=Deaux&gt;Deaux, Roland. "Introduction to The Geometry of Complex Numbers". Dover Publications, Inc., Mineola, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-486-46629-3}}, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barycentric coordinates on triangles==
{{see also|Ternary plot|Triangle center}}
[[Image:TriangleBarycentricCoordinates.svg|thumb|320px|Barycentric coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \lambda_{3})&lt;/math&gt; on an equilateral triangle and on a right triangle.]]
In the context of a [[triangle]], barycentric coordinates are also known as '''area coordinates''' or '''areal coordinates''', because the coordinates of ''P'' with respect to triangle ''ABC'' are equivalent to the (signed) ratios of the areas of ''PBC'', ''PCA'' and ''PAB'' to the area of the reference triangle ''ABC''.  Areal and [[trilinear coordinates]] are used for similar purposes in geometry.

Barycentric or areal coordinates are extremely useful in engineering applications involving [[triangulation (geometry)|triangular subdomains]]. These make analytic [[integral (mathematics)|integrals]] often easier to evaluate, and [[Gaussian quadrature]] tables are often presented in terms of area coordinates.

Consider a triangle &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; defined by its three vertices, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Each point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; located inside this triangle can be written as a unique [[convex combination]] of the three vertices.  In other words, for each &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique sequence of three numbers, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3=1&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \lambda_{1} \mathbf{r}_{1} + \lambda_{2} \mathbf{r}_{2} + \lambda_{3} \mathbf{r}_{3},&lt;/math&gt;

The three numbers &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; indicate the "barycentric" or "area" coordinates of the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the triangle.  They are often denoted as &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta,\gamma&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that although there are three coordinates, there are only two [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], since &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus every point is uniquely defined by any two of the barycentric coordinates.

To explain why these coordinates are '''signed ratios of areas''', let us assume that we work in the [[euclidean space|Euclidean]] space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}^{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, consider the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] &lt;math&gt;Oxyz&lt;/math&gt; and its associated [[standard basis|basis]], namely &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{i},\mathbf{j},\mathbf{k}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Consider also the [[orientation (vector space)|positively oriented triangle]] &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt; lying in the &lt;math&gt;Oxy&lt;/math&gt; [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. It is known that for any [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{e},\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g}\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}^{3}&lt;/math&gt; and any [[euclidean vector|free vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}&lt;/math&gt; one has&lt;ref name=Danby&gt;Danby, J.M.A. "Fundamentals of Celestial Mechanics", Second edition, revised &amp; enlarged, fifth printing. Willmann-Bell, Inc., Richmond, 2003,  {{ISBN|0-943396-20-4}}, page 26, problem 11&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}=\frac{1}{(\mathbf{e},\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g})}\cdot\left[(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g})\mathbf{e}+(\mathbf{e},\mathbf{h},\mathbf{g})\mathbf{f}+(\mathbf{e},\mathbf{f},\mathbf{h})\mathbf{g}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e},\mathbf{f},\mathbf{g})=(\mathbf{e}\times\mathbf{f})\cdot\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[triple product|mixed product]] of these three vectors.

Take &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}=\vec{AB},\,\mathbf{f}=\vec{AC},\,\mathbf{g}=\mathbf{k},\,\mathbf{h}=\vec{AP}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary point in the plane &lt;math&gt;Oxy&lt;/math&gt;, and remark that

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e},\mathbf{f},\mathbf{h})=(\vec{AB}\times\vec{AC})\cdot\vec{AP}=(\vert\vec{AB}\times\vec{AC}\vert\mathbf{k})\cdot\vec{AP} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

A subtle point regarding our choice of free vectors: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt; is, in fact, the [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence class]] of the [[euclidean vector|bound vector]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.

We have obtained that

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{AP}=m_B\cdot\vec{AB}+m_C\cdot\vec{AC},\,\mbox{ where }\,m_B=\frac{(\vec{AP},\vec{AC},\mathbf{k})}{(\vec{AB},\vec{AC},\mathbf{k})},\,m_C=\frac{(\vec{AB},\vec{AP},\mathbf{k})}{(\vec{AB},\vec{AC},\mathbf{k})}.&lt;/math&gt;

Given the positive ([[clockwise|counterclockwise]]) orientation of triangle &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt;, the [[fraction (mathematics)|denominator]] of both &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_C&lt;/math&gt; is precisely the double of the [[triangle|area of the triangle]] &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt;. Also,

:&lt;math&gt;(\vec{AP},\vec{AC},\mathbf{k})=(\vec{PC},\vec{PA},\mathbf{k})\,\mbox{ and }\,(\vec{AB},\vec{AP},\mathbf{k})=(\vec{PA},\vec{PB},\mathbf{k})&lt;/math&gt;

and so the [[fraction (mathematics)|numerators]] of &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_C&lt;/math&gt; are the doubles of the '''signed areas''' of triangles &lt;math&gt;APC&lt;/math&gt; and respectively &lt;math&gt;ABP&lt;/math&gt;.

Further, we deduce that

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{OP}=(1-m_B-m_C)\cdot\vec{OA}+m_B\cdot\vec{OB}+m_C\cdot\vec{OC}&lt;/math&gt;

which means that the numbers &lt;math&gt;1-m_B-m_C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_C&lt;/math&gt; are the barycentric coordinates of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the third barycentric coordinate reads as

:&lt;math&gt;m_A = 1 - m_B - m_C = \frac{(\vec{PB},\vec{PC},\mathbf{k})}{(\vec{AB},\vec{AC},\mathbf{k})}.&lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-letter notation of the barycentric coordinates comes from the fact that the point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; may be interpreted as the [[center of mass]] for the masses &lt;math&gt;m_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_C&lt;/math&gt; which are located in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

Switching back and forth between the barycentric coordinates and other coordinate systems makes some problems much easier to solve.

=== Conversion between barycentric and Cartesian coordinates ===

Given a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; in a triangle's plane one can obtain the barycentric coordinates &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{3}&lt;/math&gt; from the [[Cartesian coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; or vice versa.

We can write the Cartesian coordinates of the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the Cartesian components of the triangle vertices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_3&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i = (x_i, y_i)&lt;/math&gt; and in terms of the barycentric coordinates of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x = \lambda_{1} x_{1} +  \lambda_{2} x_{2} +  \lambda_{3} x_{3} \\
y = \lambda_{1} y_{1} +  \lambda_{2} y_{2} +  \lambda_{3} y_{3} \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the Cartesian coordinates of any point are a weighted average of the Cartesian coordinates of the triangle's vertices, with the weights being the point's barycentric coordinates summing to unity.

To find the reverse transformation, from Cartesian coordinates to barycentric coordinates, we first substitute &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{3} = 1 - \lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}&lt;/math&gt; into the above to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x = \lambda_{1} x_{1} +  \lambda_{2} x_{2} + (1 - \lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}) x_{3} \\
y = \lambda_{1} y_{1} +  \lambda_{2} y_{2} + (1 - \lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}) y_{3} \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging, this is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\lambda_{1}(x_{1} - x_{3}) + \lambda_{2}(x_{2} - x_{3}) + x_{3} - x = 0 \\
\lambda_{1}(y_{1} - y_{3}) + \lambda_{2}(y_{2} - y_{3}) + y_{3} - y = 0 \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This [[linear transformation]] may be written more succinctly as

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{T} \cdot \lambda = \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_3
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coordinate space|vector]] of the first two barycentric coordinates, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of [[Cartesian coordinates]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{T} = \left(\begin{matrix}
x_1-x_3 &amp; x_2-x_3 \\
y_1-y_3 &amp; y_2-y_3 \\
\end{matrix}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Now the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is [[invertible matrix|invertible]], since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_2-\mathbf{r}_3&lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly independent]] (if this were not the case, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_3&lt;/math&gt; would be [[Line (geometry)|collinear]] and would not form a triangle).  Thus, we can rearrange the above equation to get

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\begin{matrix}\lambda_1 \\ \lambda_2\end{matrix}\right) = \mathbf{T}^{-1} ( \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_3 )
&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the barycentric coordinates has thus been reduced to finding the [[Matrix inversion#Inversion of 2×2 matrices|2×2 inverse matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, an easy problem.

Explicitly, the formulae for the barycentric coordinates of point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of its Cartesian coordinates (''x, y'') and in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of the triangle's vertices are:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=\frac{(y_2-y_3)(x-x_3)+(x_3-x_2)(y-y_3)}{\det(T)}=\frac{(y_2-y_3)(x-x_3)+(x_3-x_2)(y-y_3)}{(y_2-y_3)(x_1-x_3)+(x_3-x_2)(y_1-y_3)}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_2=\frac{(y_3-y_1)(x-x_3)+(x_1-x_3)(y-y_3)}{\det(T)}=\frac{(y_3-y_1)(x-x_3)+(x_1-x_3)(y-y_3)}{(y_2-y_3)(x_1-x_3)+(x_3-x_2)(y_1-y_3)}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_3=1-\lambda_1-\lambda_2\, .&lt;/math&gt;

Another way to solve the conversion from Cartesian to barycentric coordinates is to rewrite the problem in matrix form so that

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{R} \boldsymbol{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \left(\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{r}_1 |
\mathbf{r}_2 |
\mathbf{r}_3
\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\lambda} = \left(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3\right)^\top&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, the condition &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
reads &lt;math&gt;\left(1,1,1\right) \boldsymbol{\lambda} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
and the barycentric coordinates can be solved as the solution of
the linear system

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\begin{matrix}
x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; x_3\\
y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; y_3\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{matrix}\right)
\boldsymbol{\lambda} =
\left(\begin{matrix}
x\\
y\\
1
\end{matrix}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

===Conversion between barycentric and trilinear coordinates===
A point with [[trilinear coordinates]] ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' has barycentric coordinates ''ax'' : ''by'' : ''cz'' where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the side lengths of the triangle.  Conversely, a point with barycentrics &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 : \lambda_2 : \lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; has trilinears &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1/a:\lambda_2/b:\lambda_3/c.&lt;/math&gt;

===Equations in barycentric coordinates===

The sides ''a, b, c'' respectively have equations&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=0, \quad \lambda_2=0, \quad \lambda_3=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of a triangle's [[Euler line]] is&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{vmatrix} \lambda_1 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; \lambda_3 \\1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\tan A &amp; \tan B &amp; \tan C \end{vmatrix} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the previously given conversion between barycentric and trilinear coordinates, the various other equations given in [[Trilinear coordinates#Formulas]] can be rewritten in terms of barycentric coordinates.

===Distance between points===
The displacement vector of two normalized points &lt;math&gt;P=(p_1,p_2,p_3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q=(q_1,q_2,q_3)&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref name=Olympiad/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{P Q}=(p_1-q_1,p_2-q_2,p_3-q_3).&lt;/math&gt;

The distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, or the length of the displacement vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{P Q}=(x,y,z),&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olympiad/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d^2=\left | P Q \right |^2 = -a^2yz - b^2zx - c^2xy =\frac{1}{2}[x^2(b^2+c^2-a^2)+y^2(c^2+a^2-b^2)+z^2(a^2+b^2-c^2)].&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a, b, c'' are the sidelengths of the triangle. The equivalence of the last two expressions follows from &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=0,&lt;/math&gt; which holds because &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=(p_1-q_1)+(p_2-q_2)+(p_3-q_3)=(p_1+p_2+p_3)-(q_1+q_2+q_3)=1-1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The barycentric coordinates of a point can be calculated based on distances ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to the three triangle vertices by solving the equation
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\begin{matrix}
-c^2 &amp; c^2 &amp; b^2-a^2\\
-b^2 &amp; c^2-a^2 &amp; b^2\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{matrix}\right)
\boldsymbol{\lambda} =
\left(\begin{matrix}
d^2_A - d^2_B\\
d^2_A - d^2_C\\
1
\end{matrix}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Applications===

====Determining location with respect to a triangle ====

Although barycentric coordinates are most commonly used to handle points inside a triangle, they can also be used to describe a point outside the triangle.  If the point is not inside the triangle, then we can still use the formulas above to compute the barycentric coordinates.  However, since the point is outside the triangle, at least one of the coordinates will violate our original assumption that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{1...3}\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.  In fact, given any point in cartesian coordinates, we can use this fact to determine where this point is with respect to a triangle.

If a point lies in the interior of the triangle, all of the Barycentric coordinates lie in the [[open interval]] &lt;math&gt;(0,1).&lt;/math&gt;  If a point lies on an edge of the triangle but not at a vertex, one of the area coordinates &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{1...3}&lt;/math&gt; (the one associated with the opposite vertex) is zero, while the other two lie in the open interval &lt;math&gt;(0,1).&lt;/math&gt; If the point lies on a vertex, the coordinate associated with that vertex equals 1 and the others equal zero. Finally, if the point lies outside the triangle at least one coordinate is negative.

Summarizing,
:Point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; lies inside the triangle [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \lambda_i &lt; 1 \;\forall\; i \text{ in } {1,2,3}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; lies on the edge or corner of the triangle if &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \lambda_i \leq 1 \;\forall\; i \text{ in } {1,2,3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i = 0\; \text {, for some i in } {1, 2, 3}&lt;/math&gt;.

:Otherwise, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; lies outside the triangle.

In particular, if a point lies on the opposite side of a sideline from the vertex opposite that sideline, then that point's barycentric coordinate corresponding to that vertex is negative.

====Interpolation on a triangular unstructured grid ====

If &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r}_1),f(\mathbf{r}_2),f(\mathbf{r}_3)&lt;/math&gt; are known quantities, but the values of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; inside the triangle defined by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,\mathbf{r}_3&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, we can approximate these values using [[linear interpolation]].  Barycentric coordinates provide a convenient way to compute this interpolation.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is a point inside the triangle with barycentric coordinates &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{3}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r}) \approx \lambda_1 f(\mathbf{r}_1) + \lambda_2 f(\mathbf{r}_2) + \lambda_3 f(\mathbf{r}_3)&lt;/math&gt;

In general, given any [[unstructured grid]] or [[polygon mesh]], we can use this kind of technique to approximate the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at all points, as long as the function's value is known at all vertices of the mesh.  In this case, we have many triangles, each corresponding to a different part of the space.  To interpolate a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, we must first find a triangle that contains it.  To do so, we first transform &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; into the barycentric coordinates of each triangle.  If we find some triangle such that the coordinates satisfy &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \lambda_i \leq 1 \;\forall\; i \text{ in } 1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;, then the point lies in that triangle or on its edge (explained in the previous section).  We can then interpolate the value of &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; as described above.

These methods have many applications, such as the  [[finite element method]] (FEM).

====Integration over a triangle ====

The integral of a function over the domain of the triangle can be annoying to compute in a cartesian coordinate system.  One generally has to split the triangle up into two halves, and great messiness follows.  Instead, it is often easier to make a [[Integration by substitution|change of variables]] to any two barycentric coordinates, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Under this change of variables,

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{T} f(\mathbf{r}) \ d\mathbf{r} = 2A \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{1 - \lambda_{2}} f(\lambda_{1} \mathbf{r}_{1} + \lambda_{2} \mathbf{r}_{2} +
(1 - \lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}) \mathbf{r}_{3}) \ d\lambda_{1} \ d\lambda_{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Triangle#Using coordinates|area]] of the triangle.  This result follows from the fact that a rectangle in barycentric coordinates corresponds to a quadrilateral in cartesian coordinates, and the ratio of the areas of the corresponding shapes in the corresponding coordinate systems is given by &lt;math&gt;2A&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples of special points===

==Barycentric coordinates on tetrahedra==

Barycentric coordinates may be easily extended to [[coordinate space|three dimensions]].  The 3D [[simplex]] is a [[tetrahedron]], a [[polyhedron]] having four triangular faces and four vertices.  Once again, the barycentric coordinates are defined so that the first vertex &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt; maps to barycentric coordinates &lt;math&gt;\lambda = (1,0,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_2 \to (0,1,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

This is again a linear transformation, and we may extend the above procedure for triangles to find the barycentric coordinates of a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a tetrahedron:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\begin{matrix}\lambda_1 \\ \lambda_2 \\ \lambda_3\end{matrix}\right) = \mathbf{T}^{-1} ( \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_4 )
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is now a 3×3 matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{T} = \left(\begin{matrix}
x_1-x_4 &amp; x_2-x_4 &amp; x_3-x_4\\
y_1-y_4 &amp; y_2-y_4 &amp; y_3-y_4\\
z_1-z_4 &amp; z_2-z_4 &amp; z_3-z_4
\end{matrix}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Once again, the problem of finding the barycentric coordinates has been reduced to inverting a 3×3 matrix.  3D barycentric coordinates may be used to decide if a point lies inside a tetrahedral volume, and to interpolate a function within a tetrahedral mesh, in an analogous manner to the 2D procedure.  Tetrahedral meshes are often used in [[finite element analysis]] because the use of barycentric coordinates can greatly simplify 3D interpolation.

== Generalized barycentric coordinates ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}

Barycentric coordinates (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) that are defined with respect to a [[polytope]] instead of a simplex are called ''generalized barycentric coordinates''. For these, the equation

:&lt;math&gt;(a_1 + \cdots + a_n) p = a_1 x_1 + \cdots + a_n x_n&lt;/math&gt;

is still required to hold where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the vertices of the given polytope. Thus, the definition is formally unchanged but while a simplex with ''n'' vertices needs to be embedded in a vector space of dimension of at least ''n-1'', a polytope may be embedded in a vector space of lower dimension. The simplest example is a quadrilateral in the plane. Consequently, even normalized generalized barycentric coordinates (i.e. coordinates such that the sum of the coefficients is 1) are in general not uniquely determined anymore while this is the case for normalized barycentric coordinates with respect to a simplex.

More abstractly, generalized barycentric coordinates express a polytope with ''n'' vertices, regardless of dimension, as the ''image'' of the standard &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex, which has ''n'' vertices – the map is onto: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{n-1} \twoheadrightarrow P.&lt;/math&gt; The map is one-to-one if and only if the polytope is a simplex, in which case the map is an isomorphism; this corresponds to a point not having ''unique'' generalized barycentric coordinates except when P is a simplex.

[[Dual linear program|Dual]] to generalized barycentric coordinates are [[slack variable]]s, which measure by how much margin a point satisfies the linear constraints, and gives an [[embedding]] &lt;math&gt;P \hookrightarrow (\mathbf{R}_{\geq 0})^f&lt;/math&gt; into the ''f''-[[orthant]], where ''f'' is the number of faces (dual to the vertices). This map is one-to-one (slack variables are uniquely determined) but not onto (not all combinations can be realized).

This use of the standard &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex and ''f''-orthant as standard objects that map to a polytope or that a polytope maps into should be contrasted with the use of the standard vector space &lt;math&gt;K^n&lt;/math&gt; as the standard object for vector spaces, and the standard [[affine hyperplane]] &lt;math&gt;\{(x_0,\ldots,x_n) \mid \sum x_i = 1\} \subset K^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; as the standard object for affine spaces, where in each case choosing a [[linear basis]] or [[affine basis]] provides an ''isomorphism,'' allowing all vector spaces and affine spaces to be thought of in terms of these standard spaces, rather than an onto or one-to-one map (not every polytope is a simplex). Further, the ''n''-orthant is the standard object that maps ''to'' cones.

=== Applications ===
Generalized barycentric coordinates have applications in [[computer graphics]] and more specifically in [[geometric model]]ling. Often, a three-dimensional model can be approximated by a polyhedron such that the generalized barycentric coordinates with respect to that polyhedron have a geometric meaning. In this way, the processing of the model can be simplified by using these meaningful coordinates. Barycentric coordinates are also used in [[geophysics]] &lt;ref&gt;ONUFRIEV, VG; DENISIK, SA; FERRONSKY, VI,  BARICENTRIC MODELS IN ISOTOPE STUDIES OF NATURAL-WATERS. NUCLEAR GEOPHYSICS, 4, 111-117 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">'''Bossnapping''' is a form of [[Lockout (industry)#Lock-in|lock-in]] where employees detain management in the workplace, often in protest against lay-offs and redundancies, and has especially been carried out in France. The term gained wide usage in the media following a series of bossnapping incidents in the spring of 2009 in France where workers used the tactic in the context of widespread labor unrest resulting from the [[late 2000s recession]].

These incidents resulted in a public call for an end to the practice by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], despite public opinion polling which showed widespread sympathy for the protesters.

==Description==
The term 'bossnapping' began receiving widespread use in the media following a series of high-profile incidents in [[France]] in the spring of 2009 where managers were detained by their workers. In early March, 2009, workers in southwestern France held the Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Director of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony France]] overnight, demanding a better [[severance package]] for workers who had been laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Amble | first = Brian | title = Bossnapping | publisher = Management Issues | date = 2009-03-26 | url = http://www.management-issues.com/2009/3/26/blog/bossnapping.asp | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091228112909/http://www.management-issues.com/2009/3/26/blog/bossnapping.asp | archivedate = 2009-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They barricaded the entrance to the facility with tree trunks, and held their hostages until the CEO agreed to a renegotiation of the severance package that laid-off workers were to receive. Later that month, workers at a pharmaceutical factory owned by [[3M]] in [[Pithiviers]] held their boss in his office demanding similar concessions for laid-off workers as well as protections for remaining workers whose jobs had not been cut. The workers claimed their actions were not intended to be aggressive, but were rather their "only currency." [[French police]] did not intervene in either the Sony or 3M incidents, in the expectation that each would be resolved peacefully, as they were in the end.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Sacked French workers take to 'bossnapping' | publisher = Agence France-Presse | date = 2009-03-25 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jIIM90WyRdtmDowkRXClzkxsM7Xg | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers in the 3M incident provided a dinner of mussels and French Fries to their kidnapped boss while he was being held.&lt;ref name="jacard"/&gt;

In May 2010, workers of a [[Caterpillar Inc.]] plant in Grenoble took five managers as hostages to enforce negotiations about 733 job losses.&lt;ref&gt;sueddeutsche.de 17. May 2010: [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/frankreich-manager-als-geisel-ab-jetzt-ein-trend-1.406947 Ab jetzt ein Trend ]&lt;/ref&gt; They ended their doing after 10 hours when policemen began to record the names of the participating people.&lt;ref name="sz1"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/arbeitnehmeraufstand-in-frankreich-flammender-protest-1.389727 Flammender Protest]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same month, about 300 workers of a Toyota factory in [[Onnaing]] (Northern France) blocked all entrances and hindered all trucks to leave the premises.&lt;ref name="sz1" /&gt;

Further bossnappings took place in a worksite of [[Hewlett-Packard]] in France and a lock-in of managers occurred at market research firm [[Synovate]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] as a part of a labor dispute during a contract renegotiation there.&lt;ref name="jacard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Locked out call-centre staff lock managers in | publisher = New Zealand Herald | date = 2009-04-14 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10566554 | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wave of high-profile incidents led to publication of advice for managers who might be bossnapped, although news reports made clear that the hostages had been treated well by their bossnappers. This advice included the preparation of special bossnapping kits that included a change of clothes and a cell phone pre-programmed with numbers of family members, police, and a psychologist who might assist with the psychological stress caused by being the hostage in such an incident.&lt;ref name="jacard"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Jacard | first = Alain | title = Bossnapping Wave Sweeps France | publisher = Agence France-Presse | date = 2009-04-23 | url = http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/23/bossnapping_wave_sweeps_france | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These incidents took place in the context of wider French labor unrest related to the [[Late-2000s recession|recession of the late 2000s]], in which many companies in France and across the globe laid off workers during restructuring the companies did in response to falling profits or rising losses. Other labor incidents in France during this period included one in which laid-off workers threw eggs at their manager and burned effigies of him and another in which workers at a car parts factory threatened to blow it up after the factory was closed completely.&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Bon, Gerard  |author2=Michelson, Marcel  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = French workers threaten to blow up factory | publisher = Reuters | date = 2009-07-12 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSLC42677020090712 | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2009, in response to the ongoing series of bossnapping incidents, French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] pledged to end the practice, saying, "We are a nation of laws. I won't allow this sort of thing." However, [[public opinion poll]]s in France at the time showed significant support for those using the strategy, a majority who disapproved of the tactic but sympathized with those practicing it, and only a small minority who completely opposed it. Thus, observers suggested that any strong action on the part of Sarkozy government to end bossnappings, included more proactive action by police to rescue hostages and arrest bossnappers, might lead to further unrest in other forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Matlack | first = Carol | title = Sarkozy's "Bossnapping" Dilemma | newspaper = Business Week | date = 2009-04-08 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/europeinsight/archives/2009/04/sarkozys_bossna.html | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''close-ratio transmission''' is a vehicle [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] in which the difference between the [[gear ratio]]s of the gears is minimized relative to other transmissions used in similar vehicles. The use of "close" describes nearness rather than open-ness (i.e. open vs close).

There is no industry standardization between manufacturers as to what constitutes a close-ratio transmission.  Therefore, a transmission that one manufacturer terms close-ratio may not necessarily be considered close-ratioed by another manufacturer.

==Comparison with ordinary transmission==
This table compares the ratios of three [[Porsche 911]] vehicles from 1967 to 1971, the first being the standard 901/75 transmission, the second being the 901/76 transmission denoted "For hill climbs", and the third being the 901/79 transmission denoted "Nurburgring ratios".

|}

Mathematically, this closeness can be represented by the cumulative average spacing between, or [[geometric mean|geometric average]] of, gears. For the above series transmission, each successive gear's ratio is on average 75% of that of the preceding gear (e.g. (0.82 / 2.64)&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.747). The Hill Climb transmission has successive gear ratios 81% of that of the preceding gear, and the Nuerburgring transmission has successive gear ratios 77% of that of the preceding gear. Thus, the Hill Climb transmission's gears are "closer" in numerical ratio to the preceding gear than that of the standard or Nuerburgring transmission, making it a close-ratio transmission.

There is no specific figure that is used to denote whether the steps between gears constitute a normal or close-ratio transmission. Often, manufacturers use this term when offering a standard manual transmission and an optional, sportier transmission, one with closer ratios than the other, such as Porsche above did. But this close ratio transmission is not necessarily closer in ratios than another manufacturer's normal manual transmission.

==Application==
To maximize acceleration, the engine speed of an automobile must be kept near the engine speeds where maximum power is developed. For this reason, vehicles utilize [[Automotive transmission|transmissions]]; as the vehicle's speed increases to the point that the engine speed exceeds the speed at which maximum power is developed, the driver shifts to a higher (numerically lower ratio) gear, which reduces engine speed and allows continued acceleration.

Internal combustion engines found in passenger automobiles are able to operate over a relatively wide range of speeds. A close-ratio type of transmission is designed to allow an engine to remain in a relatively narrow operating speed. Alternately, a wide-ratio transmission requires the engine to operate over a greater speed range, but requires less shifting and allows a wider range of output speeds.  Close-ratio transmissions are generally offered in [[sports car]]s, in which the engine is tuned for maximum power in a narrow range of operating speeds and the driver can be expected to enjoy shifting often to keep the engine in its [[power band]].

It is possible for the next higher gear to be such that upshifting lowers the engine speed excessively, resulting in the engine being operated outside its "power band". For example, the 1967 Porsche 911 S produced 160 hp at 6600/min and 179 Nm of torque at 5200/min. Using the Standard transmission gear ratios above, assuming the driver shifts from 2nd to 3rd gear at 6,600/min, the engine speed would fall to 4,990/min (which is 6600 x 1.27 / 1.78). In this case, shifting up to 3rd gear causes the engine speed to be slightly below the speed at which maximum torque is produced. By using a close-ratio gearbox, such as the Hill Climb example above, shifting to 3rd gear would drop engine speed to 5,110/min (6600 x 1.55 / 2.00), which almost coincides with the maximum torque output of the engine.

Likewise, the Nuerburgring gearset above is also slightly numerically closer than the Standard gearset, making it more useful for sporting applications. However, the Nuerburgring specification has a "taller" (numerically lower) 5th gear ratio than the Hill Climb gearbox, allowing for higher top speeds necessary for this faster racing circuit.

The Standard gearset with its numerically lower 5th gear, will allow even lower engine speeds at highway speeds, thereby reducing engine noise and fuel consumption, but compromises acceleration performance at very high speeds.

==Pseudo close-ratio transmissions==
One way to create a close-ratio transmission is to install more gears into the transmission without altering the lowest and highest gear ratios. In this manner, some six-speed transmissions available in consumer vehicles are labelled as "close-ratio". Again, the defining issue is the overall spacing of gears between 1st and in this case 6th gear.

Whether a six-speed transmission can be legitimately called "close-ratio" depends on whether it keeps the top gear unchanged relative to that of a comparable 5-speed model, thus causing the change in ratios from low to high gear to occur in smaller steps (i.e. closer ratios) between gears. Alternatively, some six-speed transmissions have ratios essentially the same as a 5-speed transmission, and add an even higher (numerically lower) 6th gear that allows even lower engine speeds at highway speeds. In this case, the transmission would be considered a "double" [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] transmission, depending upon the 5th and 6th gear ratios.&lt;ref&gt;"Overdrive" ''in a gearbox'' is technically defined as when the output shaft rotates faster than the input shaft; in other words it is "over driven". Thus, a true overdrive gear ratio must be less than 1:1. If both 5th and 6th gear have ratios less than 1.00:1, then both are overdrives. The series BMW transmission above has a "5 speed overdrive" transmission; the optional close-ratio transmission does not have an overdrive 5th gear.

In the overall [[drivetrain]], 'overdrive' is more complex and there are several definitions in use, including that of the simple gearbox. See [[Overdrive (mechanics)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an automatic transmission could also be called close-ratioed. With the advent of 6-, 7-, and 8-speed automatic transmissions, the ratios become closer and closer together, which meets the mathematical conception of what constitutes a close-ratio transmission.

==Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) ==
Prior to the 1970s, manufacturers' [[manual transmission]]s generally had three or four gears. To meet requirements to maximize fuel economy, manufacturers began offering 5- and, in the 1990s, 6- speed manual transmissions. Likewise, 3-speed [[automatic transmission]]s were the norm until fairly recently, but now 6-, 7-, and 8-speed automatic transmissions are being offered.

By reducing the spacing between ratios allowed by having more gears, a vehicle's engine speed can be kept in a narrow band. With a 5-speed transmission, the power range must be relatively wide, which requires compromising the [[Engine efficiency|engine's efficiency]]. With an 8-speed transmission, the power range can be kept relatively narrow, which allows the engineer to optimize engine efficiency at a particular engine speed, and the transmission attempts to keep the engine operating at that speed.

(Engine efficiency improves greatly when the load on the engine is maximized; hence, automatic transmissions also upshift whenever possible in an attempt to lower the engine's speed as much as possible, which increases load and efficiency.)

The recent introduction of [[continuously variable transmission]]s (CVTs) attempts to push this strategy to its logical conclusion. This allows a near infinite "number" of gear ratios, which this implies an infinitely close-ratioed transmission. However, given that there are no gears or specific gear ratios, one would not really consider such a transmission close-ratioed.

'''Common employment''' was an historical defence in [[English tort law]] that said workers implicitly undertook the risks of being injured by their co-workers, with whom they were in "common employment". The [[US labor law]] terminology was the "'''fellow servant rule'''".

==Development==
The operation of the doctrine [[Precedent|was seen first]] in ''[[Priestly v Fowler]]'' in the United Kingdom. In the United States the doctrine was seen in ''[[Farwell v. Boston &amp; Worcester R.R. Corp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;45 Mass. 49 (1842)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fellow-Servant+Rule freedictionary.com's article].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bunker Hill Mining Company]] operated by the fellow servant doctrine.  According to Katherine Aiken, "persons engaged in the same common pursuit for the same employer were fellow servants and companies were not liable for injuries where a fellow servant was at fault.  Thus, either the miner himself or his coworker was ultimately responsible for accidents."  Between March 1893 and Feb. 1894, 15 fatalities occurred at the mine.&lt;ref name="Aiken"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aiken |first1=Katherine |title=Idaho's Bunker Hill: the rise and fall of a great mining company, 1885-1981 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman |isbn=9780806138985 |pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was abolished altogether by the [[Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948]] in the United Kingdom.

The doctrine has been superseded in the United States by [[worker's compensation]] laws, by which a worker can file for a [[quasi-tort]], regardless of their co-worker's fault.

Scotty James Butters and David Nikos Pillatos pled to [[first-degree murder]], accepted a plea agreement and testified against Monschke in exchange for being able to request that their imprisonment be no more than approximately 30 years. in June 2004, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled "a sentence longer than the standard range could not be ordered by a judge without action by a jury, meaning Butters and Pillatos could face no more than 31 years in prison."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3348">The '''Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict''' was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1974 and went into force the same year. It was proposed by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], on the grounds that women and children are often the victims of wars, civil unrest, and other emergency situations that cause them to suffer "inhuman acts and consequently suffer serious harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: A Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Declaration states that women and children suffer victimization during armed conflict due to "suppression, aggression, colonialism, racism, 
alien domination and foreign subjugation". The Declaration specifically 
prohibits attacks and bombing of civilian populations (Article 1) and 
the use of chemical and biological weapons on civilian populations 
(Article 2). Article 3 requires states to abide by the Geneva 
Protocol of 1925 and the [[Geneva Convention]] of 1949. The 
Declaration also requires countries to take measures to end 
"persecution, [[torture]], punitive measures, degrading treatment and 
violence" especially when they are targeted against women and children, 
as well as recognizing "imprisonment, torture, shooting, mass arrests, 
[[collective punishment]], destruction of dwellings, and forcible evictions" as criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: A Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain inalienable rights are also enshrined in the Declaration, such as 
access to food, shelter, and medical care, which are to be provided to 
women and children caught in emergency situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: A Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the Declaration cites the binding nature of other international law 
instruments, naming the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the 
[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], 
[[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], 
[[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Anuradha V.|title=Encyclopaedia of Human Rights Development of Under Privileged, Volume 2|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|year=2002|isbn=9788176253246|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delayed judgment''' is a [[Keyword (linguistics)|keyword]] mentioned in [[Sean Covey|Sean Covey's]] [[self-help]] book, ''[[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Covey|first=Sean|title=The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens|year=1998|publisher=Fireside|location=New York, NY 10020|isbn=0-684-85609-3|pages=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the our [[paradigm]]s of other people and situations, delayed judgment is a tool that can be used to make our paradigms more accurate.
"We too often judge people without having all of the facts... Out paradigms are often incomplete, inaccurate or completely messed up. Therefore, we shouldn't be so quick to judge."

'''Jewish Disabilities''' were legal restrictions, limitations and obligations placed on [[European Jews]] in the [[Middle Ages]], somewhat analogous to [[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|those imposed on Jews in the Muslim world]]. In Europe, the disabilities imposed on Jews included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the [[Jewish hat]] and the [[yellow badge]], paying [[Jewish tax|special taxes]], swearing [[Jewish oath|special oaths]], living certain [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|neighbourhoods]], and forbidding Jews to enter certain [[Trade (occupation)|trades]] (for example selling new clothes in medieval Sweden).  Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and outright [[Expulsions and exoduses of Jews|expelled Jews]], for example [[Edict of Expulsion|England]] in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|Spain]] in 1492 (readmitted in 1868).

The disabilities began to be lifted with [[Jewish emancipation]] in the late 18th and the 19th century. In 1791, [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by [[Prussia]] in 1848. [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]] was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237923/Sir-Isaac-Lyon-Goldsmid-1st-Baronet#ref213807 |title=Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, 1st Baronet| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the [[Jews Relief Act 1858]].  The newly united [[German Empire]] in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany.

The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1654. They were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue.  When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 [[Asser Levy]] was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/amsterdam.html |title=New Amsterdam's Jewish Crusader |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History of the Jews in Russia#Russian Empire|Russian Empire]] Jewish disabilities were completely abolished after the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, in which Jews had a prominent role. Soviet Russia had the largest population of Jews in the whole of Europe. However, extralegal [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|antisemitic feelings and policies remained]].

'''Discrete trial training''' ('''DTT'''; also called '''discrete trial instruction''' or '''DTI''') is a technique used by practitioners of [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) that was developed by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas|Ivar Lovaas]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). DTT is a practitioner-led, structured instructional procedure that breaks tasks down into simple subunits to [[shaping (psychology)|shape]] new skills. Often employed up to 6–7 hours per day for children with [[autism]], the technique relies on the use of [[Applied behavior analysis#Prompting|prompts]], [[observational learning|modeling]], and [[positive reinforcement]] strategies to facilitate the child's learning. It is also noted for its previous use of [[aversives]] to [[Punishment (psychology)|punish]] unwanted behaviors.

Lovaas spent most of his career conducting groundbreaking research on the use of this methodology to teach [[autism|autistic]] children. As of 2005,&lt;ref name=LOI /&gt;&lt;ref name=SGO /&gt; two studies have shown that most children with autism under the age of 5 who received structured '''early intensive behavioral intervention''' (EIBI), or 35–40 hours per week of DTT, had gained significant language, intellectual, and adaptive skills. The first, a seminal{{weasel inline|date=November 2017}} study by Lovaas (1987) reported that 47% of such children acquired typical language and academic skills, and were placed into mainstream classrooms at age 7. Follow-up measures in 1993 showed that nearly each "were indistinguishable from average children on tests of [social], intelligence, and adaptive behavior."&lt;ref name=Lovaas1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=CambridgeCenter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.behavior.org/item.php?id=147|title=Behavioral Treatment of Autistic Children with O.

&lt;/ref&gt; The study, later, received praise in a mental health report by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|US Surgeon General]] in 1999.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Since 2009, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] identified EIBI and the early start denver model (ESDM)&amp;mdash;a comprehensive early intervention that consists of both developmental, play therapy and [[Pivotal response treatment|naturalistic ABA]]&amp;mdash;as the only evidence-based clinical interventions for the population. While EIBI is "well-established," the ESDM is "emerging."{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

==Implementation==
The Lovaas approach is a highly structured comprehensive program that relies heavily on discrete trial training (DTT) methods. Within Lovaas therapy, DTT is used to reduce stereotypical autistic behaviours through extinction and the provision of socially acceptable alternatives to self-stimulatory behaviors.  Intervention can start when a child is as young as three and can last from two to six years.  Progression through goals of the program are determined on an individual basis and are not determined by which year the client has been in the program.  The first year seeks to reduce self-stimulating ("[[stimming]]") behavior, teaches imitation, establishes playing with toys in their intended manner, and integration of the family into the treatment protocol.  The second year teaches early expressive and abstract linguistic skills, peer interaction, basic socializing skills, and strives to include the individual's community in the treatment to optimize mainstreaming while eliminating any possible sources of stigmatization.  The third year focuses on emotional expression and variation in addition to observational learning, and pre-academic skills such as reading writing, and arithmetic.  Rarely is the technique implemented for the first time with adults.&lt;ref name=LOI&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lovaas OI |title=Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young children with autism |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |date=February 1987 |pmid=3571656 |doi= 10.1037/0022-006X.55.1.3|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ccp/55/1/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SGO&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sallows GO, Graupner TD |title=Intensive behavioral treatment for children with autism: four-year outcome and predictors |journal=Am J Ment Retard |volume=110 |issue=6 |pages=417–38 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16212446 |doi=10.1352/0895-8017(2005)110[417:IBTFCW]2.0.CO;2 |url= |issn=0895-8017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lovaas method is ideally performed five to seven days a week with each session lasting from five to seven hours, totaling an average of 35–40 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobson JW, Mulick JA, Green G | year = 1998 | title = Cost-benefit estimates for early intensive behavioral intervention for young children with autism: General model and single state case | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 201–226 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-078x(199811)13:4&lt;201::aid-bin17&gt;3.0.co;2-r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each session is divided into trials with intermittent breaks.  The trials do not have a specified time limit to allow for a natural conclusion when the communicator feels the child is losing focus. Each trial is composed of a series of [[prompt (psychology)|prompt]]s ([[Words|verbal]], [[gesture|gestural]], physical, etc.) that are issued by the "communicator" who is positioned directly across the table from the individual receiving treatment.
These prompts can range from "put in"," put on"," show me"," give to me" and so on, in reference to an object, color, simple imitative [[gesture]], etc.  The concept is centered on [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] the child to correctly respond to the prompts, increasing the attentive ability of the individual, and mainstreaming the child for academic success.  Should the child fail to respond to a prompt, a "prompter," seated behind the child, uses either a partial-, a simple nudge or touch on the hand or arm or a full-, hand over hand assistance until the prompt has been completed, physical guide to correct the individual's mistake or non-compliance.  Each correct response is [[reinforce]]d with verbal praise, an edible, time with a preferred toy, or any combination thereof.&lt;ref name=LOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=SGO/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovaas1993&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McEachin JJ, Smith T, Lovaas OI |title=Long-term outcome for children with autism who received early intensive behavioral treatment |journal=Am J Ment Retard |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=359–72; discussion 373–91 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8427693 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DTT is often used in conjunction with the [[Picture Exchange Communication System]] (PECS) as it primes the child for an easy transition between treatment types.  The PECS program serves as another common intervention technique used to mainstream individuals with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howlin P, Gordon RK, Pasco G, Wade A, Charman T |title=The effectiveness of Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) training for those who teach children with autism: a pragmatic, group randomised controlled trial |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=473–81 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17501728 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01707.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As many as 25% of individuals with autism have no functional speech, the remainder typically display pronounced phonological and grammatical deficits in addition to a limited vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar FR, Lord C, Baily A, Schultz RT, Klin A.

(2002). The Picture Exchange Communication System Training Manual, Second Edition. Newark, DE: Pyramid Educational Products Inc&lt;/ref&gt;  PECS operates on a similar premise to DTT in that it uses systematic [[chaining]] to teach the individual to pair the concept of expressive speech with an object.  It is structured in a similar fashion to DTT, in that each session begins with a preferred reinforcer survey to ascertain what would most motivate the child and effectively facilitate learning.&lt;ref name=FLA/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
More than 500 articles have been published showing the effectiveness of the Lovaas technique for children with autism.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lovaas O.I. |author2=Wright Scott | year = 2006 | title = A Reply to Recent Public Critiques… | url = | journal = JEIBI | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 221–229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|reason=Not a review paper|date=November 2017}} Questions concerning the effectiveness of the method involve reports of recovery from autism, based on the intervention.

The Lovaas technique was developed based on research performed by Ivar Lovaas and his assistants.&lt;ref name=SGO /&gt; This research reported that 47% of those children who had received the Lovaas treatment protocol of an average of 40 hours of intensive therapy, were mainstreamed into regular classrooms, and were classified as "indistinguishable" from their peers in follow-up studies.  Although subsequent studies have shown that intensive behavioral therapy clearly benefited children with autism, it has been claimed that Lovaas's original claims of effectiveness were overstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2005 |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=493–99 |title= Autism interventions: a critical update |author= Francis K |pmid=15991872 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=313204 |format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0012162205000952}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 California study found that early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), the Lovaas technique used for very young children, was substantially more effective for preschool children with autism than the mixture of methods provided in many programs.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howard JS, Sparkman CR, Cohen HG, Green G, Stanislaw H |title=A comparison of intensive behavior analytic and eclectic treatments for young children with autism |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=359–83 |year=2005 |pmid=15766629 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2004.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study did not use random assignment or a uniform assessment protocol, and provided limited information about the intervention, making it difficult to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schoneberger T |year=2006 |title=EIBT research after Lovaas (1987): a tale of two studies |journal=J Speech-Lang Pathol Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=210–217 |url=http://www.baojournal.com/SLP-ABA%20WEBSITE/Volume-indexes.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320170056/http://baojournal.com/SLP-ABA%20WEBSITE/Volume-indexes.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith et al. (2002)&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith T, Lovaas NW, Lovaas OI | year = 2002 | title = Behaviors of children with high-functioning autism when paired with typically developing versus delayed peers: A preliminary study | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 129–143 | doi = 10.1002/bin.114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; performed a preliminary study of nine high-functioning children with autism, all of whom were previous recipients of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), of ages five to seven in free play settings.  The purpose was to assess the effects of EIBI on solitary activities, ritualistic behaviors, and social activity when exposed to the two experimental groups. Each child participated in four one-hour sessions consisting of 15 minute periods of play with either a typically developing peer or a lower functioning child with autism who had major deficits in pragmatic communication, social interaction and self-care.  The children had never met prior to these experimental sessions.  The period of play began with 15 minutes of play with either the typically developed (TD) peer or the developmentally disabled (DD) peer, and alternated accordingly in one of two variations: TD-DD-TD-DD or DD-TD-DD-TD.  Observers rated play on five criteria: i. interactive toy play, ii. interactive speech, iii. solitary toy play, iv. solitary speech, and v. self-stimulation.  Data showed the high-functioning children displayed significantly more instances of interactive play and interactive speech when paired with the typically developed peer.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=November 2017}}

The Lovaas technique is best generalized when paired with natural settings, and the implementation is clearly structured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferraioli | first1 = Suzannah | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Carrie | last3 = Smith | first3 = Tristram | year = 2005 | title = A Model for Problem Solving in Discrete Trial Training for Children With Autism | url = | journal = JEIBI | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 224–229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A good sense of direction is needed when planning for intervention.  Although this is one approach, many children on the autism spectrum learn differently and this needs to be taken into account to ensure the Lovaas approach is effective for all. It has been shown that, for some children with autism, typical peer interaction can increase the chance of leading a normal life. Lovaas techniques are cost effective for administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = J. W. | year = 2000 | title = Converting to a Behavior Analysis Format for Autism Services: Decision-Making for Educational Administrators, Principals, and Consultants | url = | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 6–16 | doi=10.1037/h0099889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aversives==
While the therapy has always relied principally on [[positive reinforcement]] of preferred behavior, Lovaas's original technique also included more extensive use of [[aversives]] such as striking, shouting, or using electrical shocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |vauthors=Moser D, Grant A |title= Screams, slaps and love |date=1965-05-07 |work= Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures have been widely abandoned for over a decade.  A review of literature by autistic [[activist]] [[Michelle Dawson]] asserts that the method has become less effective since these stimuli were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_aba.html | title = The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists: Ethical Challenges to the Autism-ABA Industry | accessdate = 2007-06-10 | last = Dawson | first = Michelle | authorlink = Michelle Dawson | date = 2004-01-18}} Note that this is a self-published document, and has not been subject to a [[peer review]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  Only one institution, the [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center|Judge Rotenberg Center]], still employs electric shocks as aversives—a practice that continues to cause them considerable legal and political controversy.&lt;ref name="MJ2007"&gt;{{cite news | url  =https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock.html | title = School of Shock|first =Jennifer | last = Gonnerman|publisher=[[Mother Jones Magazine]]|date=20 August 2007|accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some to question whether the use of aversives by those in behavioral institutions should be limited to those who are licensed (see [[licensed behavior analyst]]). {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Cost of care==
A concern that parents have brought up regarding Lovaas is the cost, which in April 2002 amounted to about US$4,200 per month ($50,000 annually per child).&lt;ref name="examining"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Elder | first = Jennifer Harrison | year = 2002 | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Nursing | url = http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1827603/Current-treatments-in-autism-examining.html | title = Current treatments in autisms: Examining scientific evidence and clinical implications | volume = 34 | issue =  2 | pages = 67–73 | accessdate = 2007-07-23 | doi = 10.1097/01376517-200204000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the 20–40 hours per week intensity of the program, often conducted at home, may place additional stress on already challenged families.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;

Another study estimated the expenses of a three-year period of DTT to total a conservative cost of $20,000 and the extreme cost of $60,000, with a yearly average of $40,000.  These costs were based on a sliding scale model that would be adjusted accordingly to socio-economic status and parental involvement.  Yearly expenditures were predicted to drop to an average of $22,500 a year when parents and family became involved in the process.  Additional family involvement would subsequently alleviate case manager and paraprofessional hours by assuming their roles in the process.  The upfront costs of DTT for the state of Texas would initially amount to $67,500 for three years compared to the currently state budgeted $33,000 for Special Education.  The difference is predicted to be recovered within five years of the initial implementation of the program.  Texas would experience a 72% reduction in expenses in the 15 year offset following the conclusion of DTT, amounting to a total savings of $84,300 per child.&lt;ref name=CGS&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chasson GS, Harris GE, Nealy WT | year = 2007 | title = Cost comparison of early intensive behavioral intervention and special education for children with autism | url = | journal = Journal of Family Studies | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 401–441 | doi = 10.1007/s10826-006-9094-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TKC/&gt;

However, in the United States, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) requires school districts to provide a Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) to ''all'' children over the age of three.  Many administrative rulings{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} and court decisions{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} have found 35–40 hours per week of EIBI to be FAPE.  Parents may wish to consider hiring an attorney or advocate if their school district denies EIBT.

Thomas et al. (2007)&lt;ref name="TKC"/&gt; conducted a survey study that involved 383 families with children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder from North Carolina.  Three quarters of these families reported using a major treatment plan.  Of these, college or graduate degree holding parents were two to four times more likely to use a neurologist and/or PECS.  Annual incomes of $50,000 or more had higher rates of using developmental pediatricians and speech/language therapists.  Racial and ethnic minorities were half as likely to see a case manager.  These families also had a quarter of the odds of seeing a psychologist, developmental pediatrician, or implementing sensory integration.&lt;ref name=TKC/&gt; This supports several other national studies that concluded racial and ethnic families, parents with a low degree of education, and those not residing in a metropolitan area were more likely to receive limited care, utilize a less diverse range of services and less likely to follow a major treatment plan.&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hurth J, Shaw E, Izeman S, Whaley K, Rogers S | year = 1999 | title = Areas of agreement about effective practices among programs serving young children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Infants and Young Children | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 17–26 | doi=10.1097/00001163-199910000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; Both the national studies and the North Carolinian study yielded a correlation between high stress levels and amount of services sought.&lt;ref name="TKC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rogers S | year = 1998 | title = Neuropsychology of autism in young children and its implications for early intervention | url = | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 104–112 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2779(1998)4:2&lt;104::aid-mrdd7&gt;3.3.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families that did not identify with a major treatment approach had one fifth to one half the odds of using support of friends and family in providing care.  Therapeutic support services (PECS, parent support classes, sensory integration, casein- and gluten-free diets) were also one fifth to one half as likely to be used compared to families identifying with major treatment plans.&lt;ref name=TKC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = KC | last2 = Ellis | first2 = AR | last3 = McLaurin | first3 = C | last4 = Daniels | first4 = J | last5 = Morrissay | first5 = JP | year = 2007 | title = Access to care for autism related Services | url = | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1902–1912 | doi = 10.1007/j10803-006-0323-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance coverage is another major determinant in the amount of support services received.  Recipients of Medicaid or other forms of public health insurance have 2-11 times the odds of using services that are considered medically necessary.  Utilization of respite, PECS, case managers, speech or language therapists also increases markedly in this bracket compared to families with private insurance.&lt;ref name="TKC"/&gt;

Rising costs in education and the provision of adequate care for developmentally disabled individuals have been a continuing concern for state policy makers and tax payers alike.  A study was conducted on cost comparison of 18 years of traditional Special Education on [[Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention]] (EIBI) for children with autism.  The Texas state budget for the year 2002 allotted $11,000 per child for Special Education.  The study suggested the state would save an average of $208,500 per child over an 18-year period by implementing DTT in early childhood, effectively curbing or eliminating future special needs costs by preparing the child academically for mainstreaming.  This amounted to a potential total savings of $2.9 billion over an 18-year period for a cohort consisting of 10,000 children with autism.&lt;ref name=CGS /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Gresham and MacMillar (1998)&lt;ref name=GRE&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gresham FM, MacMillar DL | year = 1998 | title = Early intervention project: Can its claims be substantiated and its effects replicated? | doi = 10.1023/A:1026002717402 | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 5–13 | pmid = 9546297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically cite a lack of a true experimental design in Lovaas' (1987) experiment on early intervention.  They charge that he instead implemented a [[quasi-experiment]]al design of matched pairs regarding the distribution of subjects within the experimental and control groups.  Gresham and MacMillar (1998)&lt;ref name="GRE"/&gt; also state a lack of a true representation of autism in that the subjects were neither randomly sampled from the population of individuals with autism nor were they randomly assigned to treatment groups.  The [[internal validity]] of the study was also called into question due to the possibility of skewed data resulting from three influential threats.  Instrumentation, changes or variations in measurement of procedures over time, was argued to have been altered in both the pre-test and post-test conditions which were confounded by a differentiation in ascertaining cognitive abilities and intelligence of the subjects.  The pre-test utilized four measures of cognitive ability and mental development.  Five of the subjects' intelligence was determined through a parent-reported measure of adaptive behavior.  All of the subjects were post-tested three years later using five other measures of intelligence and cognitive ability.  Long-term follow-up was assessed with three measurements of (1) intelligence, (2) nonverbal reasoning, and (3) receptive language.  The original three measurements during the testing phase were determined by (1) IQ score, (2) class placement, and (3) promotion/retention.&lt;ref name="GRE" /&gt;  External validity was called into question concerning sample characteristics.  Lovaas' (1987) criteria for acceptance into the program required a psychological mental age greater than 11 months and a chronological age less than 46 months in the case of [[echolalia|echolalic]] children.  Schopler et al. (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schopler E, Short A, Meisbov G | year = 1989 | title = Relation of behavioral treatment to "normal functioning": Comment on lovaas | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 162–164 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.57.1.162}}&lt;/ref&gt; purport that if both the intellectual and echolalia criteria were rigidly adhered to at the North Carolina institute, approximately 57% of the referrals would have been excluded from the program.

Other criticisms include a failure to [[operationalize|operationally]] define the use of the term 'reinforcement' for compliance, the use of a [[Pro-rated Mental Age]], and the [[statistical regression]] of the child's IQ over time.&lt;ref name="GRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EIS&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eikeseth S | year = 2001 | title = Recent critiques of the ucla young autism project | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 249–264 | doi = 10.1002/bin.095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd (1998)&lt;ref name=BYD&gt;{{cite journal | author = Boyd RD | year = 1998 | title = Sex as possible source of group inequivalence in Lovaas (1998) | doi = 10.1023/A:1026065321080 | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 211–215 | pmid = 9656132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed the potential impact of a disproportionate [[sex ratio]] of females to males on the control group's mean IQ score. One study showed females with autism displayed slightly lower levels of functioning in comparison to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lord C, Schopler E | year = 1982 | title = Sex differences in autism | url = | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 317–330 | doi=10.1007/bf01538320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rejoinder to Boyd's (1998)&lt;ref name="BYD"/&gt; article that cited an unequal sex ratio as a source of error, Lovaas (1998)&lt;ref name=LLL&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovaas OI | year = 1998 | title = Sex and bias: Reply to Boyd | url = | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 343–344 | doi=10.1023/a:1026020905266}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed three reasons as to why the disproportionate ratio's influence on the data was negligible.  The autistic population at the time had a ratio of 4:1.  Lovaas (1998)&lt;ref name="LLL"/&gt; argued that the ratios for the experimental group, control group 1, and control group 2 of 16:3, 11:8, and 16:5, respectively, were in fact near the expected ratio scale of the general population with the exception of control group 1.  The second argument lay in the studies Boyd (1998)&lt;ref name="BYD"/&gt; referenced in regards to low intellectual performance in females diagnosed with autism.  One of the studies admitted to having a female subject with [[Rett disorder]], a condition that showed little responsiveness to intensive early behavioral intervention.  Lovaas (1998)&lt;ref name="LLL"/&gt; concluded by proposing that males may more readily meet diagnostic criteria for autism because of certain salient characteristics inherent in the sex while the subtleties in their female counterparts may be overlooked.

:''See also [[Exhaustion of intellectual property rights]] for a general introduction not limited to U.S. law.''

The '''exhaustion doctrine''', also referred to as the first sale doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;The term "exhaustion doctrine" is used in patent cases. The term "first sale doctrine" is used in copyright cases. Compare [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]] (patent) with [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] (copyright).&lt;/ref&gt; is a U.S. [[common law]] [[patent]] doctrine that limits the extent to which patent holders can control an individual article of a patented product after a so-called authorized sale. Under the doctrine, once an authorized sale of a patented article occurs, the patent holder's exclusive rights to control the use and sale of that article are said to be "exhausted," and the purchaser is free to use or resell that article without further restraint from patent law. However, under the repair and reconstruction doctrine, the patent owner retains the right to exclude purchasers of the articles from making the patented invention anew (i.e., making another article), unless it is specifically authorized by the patentee to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 377 U.S. 476 (1964); ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 365 U.S. 336 (1961); ''Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Co.'', 152 U.S. 425 (1894); ''Cotton-Tie Co. v. Simmons'', 106 U.S. 89 (1882). See also ''Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther'', 377 U.S. 422 (1964) (purchaser may modify article to improve or alter functionality).&lt;/ref&gt;

Procedurally, the patent exhaustion doctrine operates as an [[affirmative defense]], shielding authorized purchasers from infringement claims concerning the sale or use (including repair and modification) of a patented product after the patent owner authorized its sale.

Because only an "authorized" sale triggers the doctrine, it may be difficult or at least controversial to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine applies in a particular case: for example, when the patentee purports to restrict or condition the use or resale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user ([[post-sale restraint|post-sale restrictions]]); or when the patentee licenses another to manufacture and use or sell the patented product only in a particular field. The 2008 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'', arguably leaves unclear the extent to which patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by means of so-called limited licenses (licenses limited to a specified field of use). Since its development by the courts in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Adams v. Burke'', 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873).&lt;/ref&gt; the patent exhaustion doctrine has raised questions regarding the scope of exclusive rights granted by patents and the extent to which a patent owner may extend those rights to control downstream use and sales of patented articles.

== Overview ==

A patent gives the patent owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing into the U.S. the patented invention (i.e., a product embodying the invention) during the term of the patent.&lt;ref&gt;35 U.S.C. § 271(a)(2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutional rationale behind providing these exclusive rights is to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 8&lt;/ref&gt; by providing inventors the incentive to invest their time, labor, and funds in researching and developing innovative technology.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Landes &amp; Richard A. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 294 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Providing these protections, however, comes with social costs (monopoly rents) and limits the public's ability to freely alienate patented goods. Thus, public policy dictates that the patent owner's exclusive rights be limited in scope. Generally, when a patent owner receives compensation for the use of his or her invention through sale of a patented product, the purpose of patent law is fulfilled with respect to that product.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co.'', 157 U.S. 659, 666-67 (1895) ("The conclusion reached does not deprive a patentee of his just rights, because no article can be unfettered from the claim of his monopoly without paying its tribute. The inconvenience and annoyance to the public that an opposite conclusion would occasion are too obvious to require illustration.").&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving compensation, the patent owner's rights to exclude others are exhausted and "the patent law affords no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the thing sold."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', 316 U.S. 241, 251 (1942).&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, a patent owner's voluntary introduction of a patented product into commerce without restriction prevents the patent owner from exercising any claimed right to exclude others from using or reselling the sold product.&lt;ref&gt;Exhaustion occurs also when a product is given away. ''Lifescan Scotland, Ltd. v. Shasta Technologies'', 734 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the analogous [[first-sale doctrine]] in copyright, the patent exhaustion doctrine has not been codified into the patent statute, and is thus still a [[common law]] doctrine. It was first explicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in 1873 in ''[[Adams v. Burke]]''.&lt;ref&gt;84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873). The ''Adams'' decision referred to earlier 19th century decisions whose language supported the proposition, but in slightly different contexts. In [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]], a 2013 copyright decision, the Supreme Court termed the exhaustion principle "a common-law doctrine with an impeccable historic pedigree," and cited 15th and 17th century exhaustion precedents.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the patentee Adams assigned to another the right to make, use, and sell patented coffin lids only within a ten-mile radius of Boston. Burke (an undertaker), a customer of the assignee, bought the coffin lids from the manufacturer-assignee within the ten-mile radius, but later used (and effectively resold) the patented coffin lids outside of the ten-mile radius, in his trade in the course of burying a person. The patentee Adams sued the undertaker Burke for patent infringement, but the Supreme Court found no infringement liability: Once the coffin lids were lawfully made and sold, "there is no restriction on their use to be implied for the benefit of the patentee or his assignees or licensees." Because the sale was authorized (bought from an authorized seller within the ten-mile radius), the defendant acquired the right to use the coffin lids free from any claim of the patentee, even though he carried it outside the ten-mile radius to use it.

==Limitations==

The exhaustion doctrine is triggered only by a sale authorized by the patent holder.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]], 316 U.S. at 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there are circumstances where it may be difficult to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine is triggered, in light of restrictions that the patentee has purported to place on the sale or use of the patented invention. Two general questions arise in these situations: (1) Was the sale authorized by the patentee? This can often be a complex factual question. (2) Regardless of whether authorized by the patentee, are those restrictions valid and recognizable under the law?

Generally, these cases involve one or more of the following scenarios: the patent owner: (1) sells one or more components of a multi-component patented product;&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', 316 U.S. 241 (1942) (sale of incomplete lens blank embodying essential features of invention exhausts patent rights in finished, patented lens); ''[[Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States]]'', 309 U.S. 436 (1940) (sale of fuel additive exhausts patent rights in fuel).&lt;/ref&gt; (2) licenses another to make and sell patented product with certain restrictions on field in which the sale may be made;&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co.]]'', 304 U.S. 175, 179 (1937) (license limited to making and selling in "noncommercial" field held effective).&lt;/ref&gt; or (3) sells the article with restrictions directly on the purchasers or end-users ([[post-sale restraint]]).&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'', 553 U.S. 617 (2008) (holding "downstream" restraint legally ineffective).; ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]'', 976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (permitting post-sale restraint).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of incomplete articles===

One scenario in which the exhaustion doctrine may or may not be triggered is when the patent holder sells an incomplete article or precursor or ingredient that does not directly practice or embody the patent in suit. In this situation, exhaustion is triggered by the authorized sale of the incomplete article if: (1) its "only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent, and (2) it "embodies essential features" of the patented invention.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]], 316 U.S. 241 (1942); [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]], 553 U.S. 617, 631-32 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the exhaustion doctrine is applicable to the sale of an incomplete article, however, there is a separate analysis of whether the sale of that article was actually authorized, and therefore whether exhaustion was actually triggered.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''id.'' at 635-37 (first considering whether exhaustion applies, then separately analyzing whether the sale actually triggered exhaustion).&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicability of exhaustion to the sale of an incomplete article was recognized by the Supreme Court in 1942 in ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]''. In that case, the patent holder sold lens blanks which had to be ground into finished lenses — the patented invention. The Court held that this sale exhausted the patents on the finished lenses because the lens blanks substantially "embodi[ed] essential features of the patented device and [were] without utility until . . . ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent."&lt;ref&gt;''Univis'', 316 U.S. at 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted that the grinding process was standard (conventional) and not central to the patents, indicating further that the lens blanks constituted a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practiced the patent, since only conventional further processing steps were needed to complete the invention.

In ''Quanta'', the Supreme Court applied the same test to determine whether exhaustion is triggered by the licensing of a portfolio of product and [[Method (patent)|method patents]]. In that case, the patent holder ([[LG Electronics|LGE]]) authorized the licensee ([[Intel]]) by cross-license to manufacture and sell microprocessors and chipsets that (unless licensed) would infringe LGE product and method patents, as well as patents on computer systems containing the licensed microprocessors and chipsets. The Court found that, even though these Intel products did not directly practice the system patents, they sufficiently embodied the inventions of those patents, making the exhaustion doctrine applicable. First, the Court found that there was no reasonable use for the Intel products other than incorporating them into a computer system that practiced the LGE system patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Quanta'', 553 U.S. at 631-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Intel products embodied essential features of the patented processes because the only necessary step to practice the patents was the addition of such standard computer parts as memories and buses.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 632-33.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there was nothing inventive about the systems other than that they contained the inventive microprocessors and chipsets.&lt;ref&gt;Under present U.S. patent law it is possible to obtain a patent on a superset of elements simply because a subset within it is patentable. See Richard H. Stern, ''Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc—Comments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States'', [2008] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 527, 529-30. See also [[Exhausted combination doctrine]].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, under the ''Univis'' test, the Intel products sufficiently embodied the patents, making the exhaustion doctrine applicable.

===Limitations on sale===

Another scenario in which it may be difficult to determine if the sale of a patented article was authorized, and therefore if exhaustion is triggered, occurs when the patentee grants a license to make and sell with specific limitations on the field in which the seller may operate, such as sales to particular types of customer, specified territories, or other [[field-of-use limitation]]s. If these limitations (or "restrictions") have been imposed, the licensee's sale to a purchaser exhausts only the patentee's rights to restrict use and resale when the restrictions have not been exceeded ("violated").&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the terms "restrict" and "violate" are inappropriate in the context of such field-of-use limitations pursuant to the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine, because the Supreme Court has held that the presence of a field-of-use limitation does not imply a promise not to exceed the field limitation without a further, special promise to that effect. ''Automatic Radio Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc''., 339 U.S. 827, 836 (1950) ("This limited license for 'home' use production contains neither an express nor implied agreement to refrain from production for 'commercial' or any other use as part consideration for the license grant.").&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that if Alice owns Blackacre but not Whiteacre, she cannot convey good title to Bob by purporting to sell him Whiteacre. She can sell only what she owns.&lt;ref&gt;''General Talking Pictures'', 304 U.S, 175, 181 ("The Transformer Company could not convey to petitioner what both knew it was not authorized to sell.").&lt;/ref&gt; If the license limitations ("restrictions") are exceeded ("violated"), then exhaustion cannot occur and therefore is not triggered, and the patentee can successfully sue the licensee and any downstream customers for patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''General Talking Pictures''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court in ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.]]'' has specifically upheld the legitimacy of field-of-use limitations in patent licenses to manufacture patented products.  A licensee who exceeds ("violates") a field-of-use limitation by selling an article outside of the permissible field commits patent infringement. The exhaustion doctrine would provide no protection because the "violation" makes the sale "unauthorized" for the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''General Talking Pictures'', 304 U.S. at 181-82 ("The Transformer Company could not convey to petitioner what both knew it was not authorized to sell. By knowingly making the sales to petitioner outside the scope of its license, the Transformer Company infringed the patents embodied in the amplifiers.") (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

The field-of-use limitations on sale (those imposed on the licensee in selling the patented articles) are different from post-sale restrictions or limitations (those that purpose to restrict the use or sale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user). Patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by imposing the former, but it is questionable that patentees can do so through the latter.&lt;ref&gt;''Compare'' [[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]] ''with'' [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]. A case in now pending before the Federal Circuit, to be reargued ''en banc'', in which the court directed the parties to brief and argue the issue whether ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt''. [http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/14-1617enbanc.pdf ''Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc''.], Nos. 2014-1617 and 1619, Order of Apr. 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations on sale must very explicitly bind the licensee or seller. For example, in ''Quanta'', LGE licensed Intel to make products using LGE's patents. The license expressly stated that LGE was not licensing third parties to combine licensed products with any non-Intel products (i.e., microprocessors and chipsets purchased from a third party), and LGE required Intel to notify customers of that. Intel sold products to Quanta, who combined the Intel products with non-Intel products. LGE sued Quanta for patent infringement. The Supreme Court found that the licensing agreement failed to explicitly impose a field-of-use limitation, and therefore found that there were no conditions limiting to whom Intel could sell. The sale was thus "authorized," and exhaustion was triggered. In the Court's words, "The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the patents. No conditions limited Intel's authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents. . . . Intel's authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta."&lt;ref&gt;''Quanta'', 553 U.S. at 637. This point is discussed in Richard H. Stern, [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/EIPR'Quanta.pdf ''Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc — Comments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States'', &amp;#91;2008&amp;#93; Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 527].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the contractual documents in the ''Quanta'' case were insufficiently explicit, the Court applied the exhaustion doctrine, finding the sale "authorized" and unconditional, even though LGE attempted to impose some restrictions on use of the products. Therefore, purchasers of the patented product were free to use them without restrictions that the patentee sought to have imposed on them. The Court found that the licensing agreement did not impose any limitations on whom the licensee could sell to. The ''Quanta'' Court did not address, however, whether the restriction in the licensing agreement could be enforced by contract. In fact, the Court pointedly said it was not addressing that issue.

===Post-sale limitations===

The most difficult and unsettled area of the law regarding patent exhaustion involves cases in which a patentee purports to impose [[post-sale restraint|post-sale restrictions]]. Post-sale restrictions are those that purport to restrict the use or sale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user customer, rather than similar limitations on a manufacturer-licensee. Common post-sale restrictions include "single use only" and "refill only with proprietary ink" notices. Whether violations of such restrictions make a sale "unauthorized," and therefore make patent exhaustion inapplicable, is still unclear or at least controversial.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]], 553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Federal Circuit]] approved the use of post-sale restrictions in ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]''. Specifically, the court held that patent owners could condition the sale of patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the exception of such antitrust law violations as price-fixing and tie-in restrictions, or violations of "some other law or policy."&lt;ref&gt;976 F.2d 700, 708 (Fed. Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff in the case owned a patent on a medical device, which it sold to hospitals with a "single use only" notice label. The defendant purchased the used devices from hospitals, refurbished them, and resold them to hospitals. The Federal Circuit held that the single-use restriction was enforceable in accordance with the 1926 ''General Electric'' case,&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. General Electric Co''., 272 U.S. 476 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt; because the restriction was "reasonably within the patent grant. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 708.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court did not discuss the ''Mallinckrodt'' case in ''Quanta''. As one commentator noted: "The Supreme Court, in ''Quanta'', was widely expected to rule on whether ''Mallinckrodt'' was good law. But the Court sidestepped the issue by narrowly interpreting the license agreement so that it was not a conditional license. . . . Because the Supreme Court sidestepped the issue, it remains unclear to what extent a patentee can use a conditional license to impose restrictions on downstream purchasers."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Seidenberg, [http://www.insidecounsel.com/2008/09/01/patent-predicament- Patent Predicament], Sept. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two district courts have concluded that ''Mallinckrodt'' is no longer good law after ''Quanta''.&lt;ref&gt;''See Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l'', Inc., 615 F. Supp. 2d 586 (E.D. Ky. 2009); accord ''Egrowerx Int'l, LLC v. Maxell Corp''., 18 F. Supp. 3d 430 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) ("[A] majority of commentators have adopted the view that Quanta overturned the conditional sales doctrine.").&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.'', the court concluded that the Supreme Court's ''Quanta'' decision implicitly overruled ''Mallinckrodt''. At issue in ''Static Control'' was Lexmark's so called "prebate" program, in which customers could buy cartridges that were subject to a single use for a 20 percent discounted price. In its original order, before ''Quanta'' was decided, the court rejected Static Control's argument that Lexmark's patent rights were exhausted as a result of the authorized sale of the cartridges. Relying heavily on ''Mallinckrodt'', the court found that the sales were valid post-sale restrictions that avoided exhaustion. After ''Quanta'' was decided, however, the court reversed its original order and concluded that Lexmark's single use restriction was not enforceable under patent law because the court was "persuaded that Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt sub silentio."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 585.&lt;/ref&gt; The court explained, "The Supreme Court's broad statement of the law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the ''Quanta'' holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on ''Mallinckrodt'' in reaching its decision in ''LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc.'', 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court reversed in ''Quanta''. It is also worth noting that the ''Quanta'' decision did not mention a single Federal Circuit case."&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court's conclusion, however, that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt'' reflects the ambiguity in ''Quanta'' itself. The ''Static Control'' court noted that "[s]ales of Lexmark Prebate cartridges were unconditional" because "[n]o potential buyer was required to agree to abide by the Prebate terms before purchasing a cartridge. Thus, sales of Lexmark's Prebate toner cartridges were authorized and unconditional, just like sales of LGE's patented products in ''Quanta''."&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 584.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, both ''Quanta'' and ''Static Control'' can be seen as either cautionary tales&lt;ref&gt;See Vincent Chiapetta, Patent Exhaustion: What's It Good For?, 51 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1087, 1089 (2011) (stating that some view ''Quanta'' as holding that the exhaustion doctrine "absolutely prohibits patent enforcement of post-sale conditions. Others view the decision as a cautionary tale, with exhaustion operating as a default contract term placing the burden on patent owners (and their lawyers) to incorporate any waiver explicitly into the sale agreement. Many practitioners and scholars, myself included, are not sure what the correct interpretation may be.").&lt;/ref&gt; about failed attempts to comply with the [[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.|General Talking Pictures]] doctrine&lt;ref&gt;Actually, Lexmark could not have complied with the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine because it was not imposing a limitation on the field in which a manufacturer-licensee of Lexmark could operate, which is all that the doctrine addresses. Instead, Lexmark imposed a restriction on what its own customers might do with the product that Lexmark sold them.&lt;/ref&gt; or to explicitly condition sales, without need to rule on whether the post-sale restrictions were valid, or as overruling ''Mallinckrodt'''s approval of post-sale restrictions. Which interpretation is correct remains to be seen. The Federal Circuit's decision in the ''en banc'' reargument of ''Lexmark Int'l v. Impression Prods.'' should provide a more definitive answer, subject of course to possible further review in the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;See supra note _.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International exhaustion==

An emerging issue is whether U.S. patent exhaustion is international or strictly national. Until recently, or at least since the formation of the Federal Circuit in 1982 until recently,&lt;ref&gt;There are many earlier cases, however, holding that a U.S. patentee can trigger domestic exhaustion by making or authorizing a foreign sale. E.g., ''Dickerson v. Matheson'', 57 F. 524, 527 (2d Cir. 1893) ("A purchaser in a foreign country, of an article patented in that country and also in the United States, from the owner of each patent, or from a licensee under each patent, who purchases without any restrictions upon the extent of his use or power of sale, acquires an unrestricted ownership in the article, and can use or sell it in this country."); accord ''Curtiss Aeroplane &amp; Motor Corp. v. United Aircraft Eng'g Corp.'', 266 F. 71, 77 (2d Cir. 1920); ''Seiko v. Refac Tech. Dev. Corp.'', 690 F. Supp. 1339, 1342 (S.D.N.Y. 1988); ''Holiday v. Mattheson'', 24 F. 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1885).&lt;/ref&gt; most U.S. courts simply assumed that a sale outside the United States, even if made by the U.S. patent owner or its parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, or by the U.S. patent owner's licensee, did not trigger the exhaustion doctrine within the United States. Usually, the basis for the assumption was (1) the Supreme Court allegedly so held in ''Boesch v. Graff'',;&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; (2) a foreign patent is a different property right that is not the same as a corresponding U.S. patent because foreign patent law is different from U.S. patent law and gives different scope to such a foreign patent;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Griffin v. Keystone Mushroom Farm, Inc''., 453 F. Supp. 1283, 1285 (E.D. Pa. 1978) ("The sale or use of each machine in both countries represents potentially two separate torts against the plaintiff and infringes potentially on two separate sets of rights held by him .... The non-tortiousness of defendant's conduct in Italy cannot enter into an adjudication of the plaintiffs rights in this country.").&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) many cases hold that U.S. patent law has no "extraterritorial" application.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Jazz Photo Corp. v. ITC,'' 264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001). See also ''Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. v. Jazz Photo Corp.'', 394 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (in response to Jazz's argument that Fuji had already been adequately rewarded by its earnings on its sale of the product in Japan, the Federal Circuit said: "The patentee's authorization of an international first sale does not affect exhaustion of that patentee's rights in the United States. ...Moreover, Fuji's foreign sales can never occur under a United States patent because the United States patent system does not provide for extraterritorial effect.");accord ''Minebea Co., Ltd. v. Papst'', 444 F. Supp. 2d 68, 140-41 (D.D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these points is on firm, sound ground. In the ''Boesch'' case, a seller entirely unrelated to the U.S. patent owner made the sale in Germany; the German seller had a right to sell the product under German law because it had begun preparation to manufacture the product before the U.S. patent owner applied for its German patent.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, the German seller, had the right to make and sell the patented burners in Germany because under German law one "who, at the time of the patentee's application, ha[d] already commenced to make use of the invention in the country..." had the right to continue selling the product despite the subsequent issuance of a German patent to Boesch. ''Boesch'', 133 U.S. at 701.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. company (the patentee) had no complicity in the sale and did not profit from it, and could not possible be accused of "double dipping."&lt;ref&gt;This "double dipping" point is the basis of the current Japanese position on international exhaustion. In ''BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG v. Rashimekkusu Japan Co. Ltd. and JAP Auto Prod. Co., Ltd.'' (Sup. Ct. Japan July 1, 1997) (translated in 29 Int'l. Rev. Indus Prop &amp; Copy. 331), the Japanese Supreme Court held that an overseas sale of hubcaps exhausted the seller's Japanese patent rights in Japan. BBS, a German manufacturer of aluminum hubcaps and the owner of the hubcap patent rights in both Germany and Japan, sold the hubcaps in Germany. Jap Auto Products and Raximex, Japanese companies, purchased the products in Germany and then imported them into Japan. The intermediate appellate patent court (Tokyo High Court) said, in reference to "double dipping": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he opportunity of the patent holder to receive compensation for the disclosure of the invention is limited to one opportunity. ...[I]t does not make any particular difference whether the putting into circulation takes place within the country or abroad. For the mere fact that national borders are crossed does not constitute a sound reason why a second opportunity for compensation for the disclosure of the invention should be allowed." &lt;/blockquote&gt;''Jap Auto Products Kabushiki Kaisha and Another v. BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG; BBS v. Rashimex Japan Co. et al.'', Hanrei Jiho 3 (No. 1524) (March 23, 1995), reproduced in 27 IIC 550 (1996) - BBS Wheels H and 21 AIPPI (Japanese Gr. Journal) 36 (1/1996).&lt;/ref&gt; This is quite unlike the usual U.S. situation, such as that in the ''Lexmark'' and ''Jazz'' cases, in which the U.S. patent owner was responsible for the foreign sale, and therefore profited from it. The ''Boesch'' case is therefore not a proper precedent to support the general international exhaustion situation.

Whether foreign patents are comparable to U.S. patents is a factual issue that may differ from case to case, or nation to nation, and cannot be assumed one way or the other. Furthermore, 35 U.S.C. § 119(a), the U.S. patent statute governing when a U.S. patent can be based on a filing of a foreign patent application, provides that the U.S. patent and the corresponding foreign patent must be "for the same invention." Therefore, there may be far more similarity than the cases assume.

Finally, the statement that U.S. patent law is without extraterritorial application occurs universally in cases holding that liability for patent infringement under U.S. law should not be based on acts and conduct occurring outside the United States. And even that generality is suspect, for sometimes patent infringement liability in the United States is based on conduct outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., 35 U.S.C. § 271(f) and (g); ''Honeywell, Inc. v. Metz Aparatewerkex'', 509 F.2d 1137, 1141 (7th Cir. 1975) ("although the patent laws of the United States do not have extra-territorial effect, 'active inducement' may be found in events outside the United States if they result in a direct infringement here."); ''Akzona Inc. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.'', 662 F. Supp. 603, 613 (D. Del. 1987) ("inducing activity may take place outside of the United States, so long as the direct infringement occurs within the United States").&lt;/ref&gt; Applying exhaustion on an international basis does not regulate acts and conduct performed outside the United States; it defines infringement remedies against importation into and sale in the United States on the basis of acts and conduct performed outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See John A. Rothchild, ''Exhausting Extraterritoriality'', 51 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1187, 1238-39 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The point is now pending decision in the Federal Circuit, because that court has ordered ''en banc'' rehearing on that issue in the ''Lexmark'' case.&lt;ref&gt;Supra note _.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason that the issue has come to the fore is that the Supreme Court, in its recent copyright decision in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;133 S. Ct. 1351 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; held that a foreign sale authorized by the copyright owners exhausts U.S. copyright. The Supreme Court rested its decision mainly on common-law authority, quoting extensively from [[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Coke's Institutes]] (Coke on Littleton), and saying that this stated the general rule from which any exception must be proved. Some have thought, therefore, that the same principle applies at least as forcefully in patent law as in copyright law, so that patent exhaustion should be international just as copyright exhaustion is.

In Europe&lt;ref&gt;International patent exhaustion in Europe is discussed in Christopher Stothers, ''Patent Exhaustion: the UK perspective'', 16th Annual Conference on Intellectual Property Law and Policy, Fordham University School of Law, 27 March 2008 [http://fordhamipconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Christopher-Sothers-Patent-Exhaustion.pdf]. In the EU, member states recognize international exhaustion on a regional basis: a product first sold in an EU member state will exhaust the patent owner's rights in all other EU member states; but a sale in a non-EU country will not exhaust rights in any EU country. See ''Centrafarm BV v. Sterling Drug Inc'', Case 15/74, 1974 E.C.R. 1147 ("[O]bstacles to free movement may. be justifiable for reasons of
protection of industrial property when the protection is invoked against a product coming from a Member State in which it is not patentable and has been manufactured by third parties without the consent of the patentee or where the original patentees are legally and economically independent of-each other; the derogation to the principle of free movement of goods is not justified when the product has been lawfully put by the patentee himself or with his consent, on the market of the Member State from which it is being imported, e.g. in the case of a holder of parallel patents.").&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan, a regime of absolute or modified international exhaustion of patent rights is followed. Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Australia recognizes international exhaustion only if there is no contractual restriction against imports. Christopher J. Clugston, International Exhaustion, Parallel Imports, and the Conflict between the Patent and Copyright Laws of the United States, 4 Beijing L. Rev. 95, 97 (2013), [https://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=37387] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724185436/https://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=37387 |date=July 24, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand, and Norway also adopt international patent exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 96. See also T. Syddall, ''Parallel Imports get Go-Ahead in New Zealand'', MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (Oct. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) explicitly leaves to each member state the freedom to address exhaustion of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;TRIPS: Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Apr. 15, 1994, Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, Annex 1C, THE LEGAL TEXTS: THE RESULTS OF THE URUGUAY ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS 320 (1999), 1869 U.N.T.S. 299, 33 I.L.M. 1197 (1994), at Art. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) report&lt;ref&gt;WIPO Committee on Development and Intellectual Property (CDIP), ''Patent Related Flexibilities in the Multilateral Legal Framework and Their Legislative Implementation at the National and Regional Levels'', (5th Sess.), CDIP/5/4 (Mar. 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 provides a listing of various countries' statutory provisions on international exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;According to the WIPO report, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Jordan, Kenya, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines (for drugs and medicines), Singapore (with the exception of pharmaceutical products under certain conditions), South Africa, Uruguay, and Vietnam have statutory international exhaustion provisions. Id., ¶58 and Annex II(2). The Andean Community, like the EU, has exhaustion within the community. Id., Annex II(2). National exhaustion, however, obtains in "Ghana, Liberia, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Tunisia, Uganda, and a certain number of Asian countries, such as the Philippines."

==Standing or right to assert exhaustion==

Another emerging issue under the exhaustion doctrine is what persons may assert the exhaustion doctrine as a defense to a claim of patent infringement. In most of the exhaustion cases discussed earlier in this article, the facts of the case follow what may be termed a "straight line" pattern: A patentee ''A'' (or its licensee) makes and sells a product ''a'' covered by patent ''P1'' to customer ''C''. ''C'' then does something with ''a'' that ''A'' has ordered (by some sort of agreement or putative agreement) ''C'' not to do. A patent infringement suit, ''A v. C'', follows. Diagrammatically, this fact pattern may be represented as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' '''A → a (P1) → C''' ''
*where ''a(P1)'' means that patent ''P1'' covers product ''a'' and the → indicates a sale
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New information-technology inventions can lead to exhaustion suits following a different fact pattern, because of peculiarities of information technology and present U.S. patent law. An information-technology invention may involve several aspects each of which has a separate stakeholder. For example, a smartphone, TV set, or [[set-top box]] may be economically important to both equipment manufacturers and content providers, as well as the end user public (i.e., consumers). A license or sale to one stakeholder may or may not trigger the exhaustion doctrine with respect to conduct by another stakeholder, perhaps depending on how relevant business transactions are structured.

Under present U.S. patent law, a method claim of a patent is infringed only when a single actor performs each step of the claim.&lt;ref&gt;''Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp.'', 532 F. 3d 1318, 1329 (2008) (direct infringement under § 271(a) requires a single party to perform every step of a claimed method); see ''Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc.'', 134 S. Ct. 2111 (2014) (Court said it was "assuming, but not deciding" that the Federal Circuit's rule requiring that all steps of a method patent be attributable to a single direct infringer was correct).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, induced infringement of a method claim has the same requirement.&lt;ref&gt;''Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc.'', 134 S. Ct. 2111 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; System claims raise more complicated issues. One can make the system only by placing each element into combination with the others, but it is possible to be liable for using a system invention merely by commercially exploiting the system.&lt;ref&gt;''Centillion Data Sys. LLC v. Qwest Comm. Int'l Inc.'', 631 F.3d 1279 (2011). Direct ''use'' infringement occurs when a part "put[s] the invention into service, i.e., control[s] the system as a whole and obtain[s] benefit from it," even though different persons operate the different components of the system. ''Id''. at 1284.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when both the relevant equipment manufacturer and content provider utilize aspects of the invention in a method claim, whether infringement liability attaches to them may depend on both how the relevant claim is written and how licenses or sales are structured. This is illustrated in pending smartphone litigation, in which structure dictated the legal outcome.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dorsey.com/eu-post-limelight-akamai-multi-actor-patent-claims/   ''Post Limelight v. Akamai, Are Multi-actor Method Patent Claims D.O.A.?''] (June 3, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC v. New York Times Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;778 F.3d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Circuit overturned a district court's summary dismissal on exhaustion grounds of a patent infringement suit against content providers. The invention concerns methods and systems for alerting smartphone users to content that may be of interest to them, for example, breaking news stories. The way the invention works is along these lines: A content provider such as the New York Times sends a text message to its online subscribers' smartphones. The message might consist of a headline and the lead to a story, together with a hyperlink to the story as stored in the online database of the New York Times. A subscriber interested in reading the story clicks on the link and thus causes the browser for the smartphone to retrieve and display the story.

The way the claims were drafted is very important to the outcome. There are two relevant types of claim, One set considers only smartphone manufacturers, and the claims describe only acts performed in the smartphone (receiving signals, clicking on hyperlinks, etc.). The other set of claims considers only acts that the content providers perform (sending the text message alert, storing the news story, sending it out over the Internet in response to a hyperlink click, etc.). Thus, it is possible to infringe one set of these single-actor claims without infringing the other.

The patentee licensed substantially all smartphone manufacturers in the United States under the first set of patents. It then sought to license content providers. When some content providers, including the New York Times, refused to take licenses under the second set of patents, claiming that under the exhaustion doctrine they needed no licenses, the patentee sued them. Instead of the "straight line" fact pattern described above for prior exhaustion cases, this case has a different, bi-directional pattern. Diagrammatically, the fact pattern of this type of case is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' '''P → lic (P1) → A, a''' ''
*Patentee ''P'' licenses manufacturer ''A'' under patent ''P1'' (the smartphone patents) to make smartphones ''a'' embodying the patented invention. ''A'' then sells smartphones ''a'' to consumers ''C''.

'' '''A → a (P1) → C ← i (P2) ← B''' ''
*Content provider ''B'' sends news alerts and content ''i'' to consumers ''C'', thus practicing the method claimed in patent ''P2'' (the content provider patents).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On appeal from the district court's summary judgment ruling, the Federal Circuit held that the structure of the patent licensing arrangement avoided the exhaustion doctrine. The court ruled that the exhaustion doctrine may be asserted only by an "authorized acquirer" — one who purchases the patented article from the patentee or its authorized seller. The court further explained this, using slightly different terminology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[It is a] core notion that exhaustion lifts legal restrictions on an authorized acquirer. The doctrine has never applied unless, at a minimum, the patentee's allegations of infringement . . . entail infringement of the asserted claims by authorized acquirers . . . Here, as noted, that is not so, because infringement of the content claims has not been . . . shown to require that [the authorized] handset acquirers are practicing those claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the patentee put it in its brief, and the court accepted, "the exhaustion doctrine protects only the ability of a purchaser (or other lawful possessor) of an article to use and sell the article."&lt;ref&gt;Main Br. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The content providers were not parties to the transaction that triggered whatever exhaustion there was — that transaction was the sale of smartphones by manufacturers to consumers. The exhaustion doctrine exists to protect the interests of purchasers, not third parties.&lt;ref&gt;But see the speech of Lord Bridges in ''British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.'', [1986] 1 All ER 850, [1986] AC 577 (H.L.), in which he said: "What the owner needs, if his right to repair is to be of value to him, is the freedom to acquire a previously manufactured replacement exhaust system in an unrestricted market." See also the similar US ruling in ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 365 U.S. 336 (1961). in which the US Supreme Court permitted a spare parts supplier to defend against a charge of patent infringement by asserting the right of automobile purchasers to refurbish their automobiles, a right deriving from the exhaustion doctrine. See ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 377 U.S. 476, 484 (1964) (citing ''Univis'' and ''Adams v. Burke'', 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873). to support the right of repair).&lt;/ref&gt; The patentee told the Federal Circuit, and it apparently agreed, that the exhaustion doctrine does not immunize the conduct of the content providers, "regardless of the effect on the amount of licensed content available to their subscribers' handsets."&lt;ref&gt;Reply Br. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the patent claims licensed to the manufacturers (the ''P1'' of the diagram above) are not infringed by the conduct of the content providers accused of infringement. Their conduct infringes the ''P2'' patent claims that were not licensed to the manufacturers. The only sale in the case was by the licensed smartphone manufacturers to the consumer end users, and that sale exhausted only the ''P1'' claims. The Federal Circuit said exhaustion cannot occur as to unrelated patent claims. The court added that the content providers had not shown that the licensed ''P1'' claims embodied substantially the same invention as the ''P2'' patent claims under which the content providers were sued, so that the doctrine of the ''Univis'' and ''Quanta'' cases did not apply to expand the scope of the exhaustion.

There is another possible way to analyze cases of this type, but the parties did not raise it and the court did not address it. That would be to make an equitable estoppel analysis as to whether smartphone purchasers had reasonable expectations at the time of purchase and whether the result reached in the case unfairly and substantially derogated from the rights the purchasers expected to enjoy, as a result of conduct by the plaintiff. That is an approach similar to one of those that the House of Lords considered in the ''British Leyland'' case.&lt;ref&gt;''[[British Leyland Motor Corp v Armstrong Patents Co]]'', [1986] 1 All ER 850, [1986] AC 577 (H.L.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparable doctrines outside U.S.==

Other countries recognize legal doctrines comparable to the exhaustion doctrine of U.S. patent law.

===Canada===
In ''Eli Lilly and Co. v. Apotex Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[1998] 2 S.C.R. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the principle that sale of a patented article exhausts the patentee's right in that article.&lt;ref&gt;The court said: "If the patentee sells the patented article that he made, he transfers the ownership of that article to the purchaser. This means that, henceforth, the patentee no longer has any right with respect to the article which now belongs to the purchaser who, as the new owner, has the exclusive right to possess, use, enjoy, destroy or alienate it."&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Eli Lilly'' case the Supreme Court also took the position that subsequent purchasers are not bound by any contractual limitations imposed by the patentee, unless they are brought to their attention at the time of sale: "restrictive conditions imposed by a patentee on a purchaser or licensee do not run with the goods unless they are brought to the attention of the [subsequent] purchaser at the time of their acquisition." This principle appears to differ somewhat from U.S. patent law, in which bringing the restriction to the attention of the purchaser is generally immaterial.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Quanta'' case, discussed earlier in this article, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held the purported restriction ineffective despite notice.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Approximately 60 percent of European patent litigation is in German courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2008/licensing--andpatent-exhaustion W. von Meibom and M. Meyer], ''Licensing and Patent Exhaustion'' (Nov. 5, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; German law has long recognized the exhaustion doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;In 1902 the Reichsgericht held, "The proprietor who has manufactured the product and has put it on the market under this protection which excludes competition from other parties, has enjoyed advantages which the patent confers upon him and has thus exhausted his right." ''Guajakol Karbont''51 RGZ 129 (Mar. 26, 1902).&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Fullplastverfahren'' case, the German Federal Supreme Court stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The doctrine [of exhaustion] finds its justification in the argument that the holder of the rights who puts into circulation the product produced under the application of the protected procedure has had the opportunity to avail himself of the advantages granted by the patent.&lt;ref&gt;GRUR 1980, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A commentator asserts that the decision of the German Federal Supreme Court in the ''Brochure Rock'' case&lt;ref&gt;GRUR 1997, 116, 117 (English translation published in IIC 1998, 207).&lt;/ref&gt; would require a contrary result as to the fact pattern of the U.S. ''Quanta'' case (discussed above). The sale of the chips would ''not'' exhaust the patent rights to the computer systems containing the chips, so that LG in that case would have been entitled to a further royalty payment from Quanta despite LG's license to the chip manufacturer Intel.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2008/licensing--andpatent-exhaustion W. von Meibom and M. Meyer], ''Licensing and Patent Exhaustion'' (Nov. 5, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent decision of the Düsseldorf District Court,&lt;ref&gt;Decision of Dec. 12, 2013 – Case 4b O 88/12 (''Datenübertragungssystem''/Data memory system).&lt;/ref&gt; however, perhaps points to greater similarity between German and U.S.; patent law. The case had facts almost identical to those of the ''Quanta'' case. The court held that the sale of the component did not exhaust the patent rights on the system because, among other things, the components sold by the suppliers did not make use of the teachings of the system patent.

As for using the doctrine of the U.S. ''Quanta'' case, the Düsseldorf District Court stated that the rationale for such an "extended exhaustion doctrine" could only be to prevent the patent owner from enjoying the advantages of the patent more than once, that is, "double dipping" or "double charging." The court said that such a danger of double charging at different stages of the distribution chain and, thus, a rationale for an "extended exhaustion doctrine," might exist if, in one and the same patent, there is a claim to the overall device and a claim to an individual component of the overall device. That was not the case here.

A second basis for an "extended exhaustion doctrine" ''might'' exist if the overall device and its individual components are protected by different patents (as here), but only when the inventive concept of the two patents is the same and is substantially embodied in the component. But that was not true here, as it was in the ''Quanta'' case. This is the point of possible similarity to ''Quanta,'' but it is entirely in the form of ''obiter dicta'',

The court ruled that the fact that the component had no reasonable use except in making the patented system (which was so in the ''Quanta'' case) did not matter, because that raised an implied license issue rather than an exhaustion issue. The component manufacturer's license expressly disclaimed any such implied license as to the system (as in the ''Quanta'' case).

'''Fabel''' is a critical term and a [[Dramaturge|dramaturgical]] technique pioneered by the twentieth-century [[Germany|German]] [[theatre practitioner]] [[Bertolt Brecht]].

''Fabel'' should not be confused with '[[fable]]', which is a form of short narrative (hence the retention of the original German spelling in its adoption into English usage). Elizabeth Wright argues that it is "a [[term of art]] which cannot be adequately translated".&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright, Elizabeth. 1989. ''Postmodern Brecht: A Re-Presentation''. Critics of the Twentieth Century Ser. London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02330-0}}. p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A critical term==

As a critical term, ''fabel'' refers to an analysis of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[Play (theatre)|play]]. This includes three interrelated but distinct aspects: firstly, an analysis of the events portrayed in the story. In an [[Epic Theater|epic]] production, this analysis would focus on the [[social interaction]]s between the [[Fictional character|characters]] and the [[causality]] of their [[Behavior|behaviour]] from a [[Historical materialism|historical materialist]] perspective; the ''fabel'' summarizes "the moral of the story not in a merely ethical sense, but also in a [[Political theatre|socio-political]] one".&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; For example, in relation to Brecht's play ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' (1926), Wright argues that "[t]he ''fabel'' of this play centres on the transformation of an individual through his insertion into a collective."&lt;ref name="Wright2"&gt;Wright, Elizabeth. 1989. ''Postmodern Brecht: A Re-Presentation''. Critics of the Twentieth Century Ser. London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02330-0}}. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, a ''fabel'' analyzes the plot from a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] and [[Semiotics|semiotic]] perspective. This includes the play's [[dramatic structure]] and its formal shaping of the events portrayed. It also includes an analysis of the semiotic fabric of the play, recognizing that it "does not simply correspond to actual events in the collective life of human beings, but consists of invented happenings [and that t]he stage figures are not simple representations of living persons, but invented and shaped in response to ideas."&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

Thirdly, a ''fabel'' analyzes the attitudes that the play appears to embody and articulate (in the sense of the author's, the characters' and, eventually, the company's). Brecht refers to this aspect of a play as its ''[[Gestus]]''. Analyzing a play in this way presupposes Brecht's recognition that ''every'' play encodes such attitudes; "for art to be 'unpolitical'", he argued in his "[[Little Organum for the Theater|Short Organum for the Theatre]]" (1949), "means only to ally itself with the 'ruling' group".&lt;ref name="Brecht1"&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertolt]]. 1949. "[[Little Organum for the Theater|A Short Organum for the Theatre]]". In John Willett, ed. ''Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic''. London: Methuen, 1964. {{ISBN|0-413-38800-X}}. p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A practical tool==

As a practical tool, ''fabels'' form part of the process of engaging with a play-text undertaken by a company when mounting a production of a play. A ''fabel'' is a piece of creative writing, usually made by a [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]] or the [[Theatre director|director]], that summarizes the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a play in such a way as to emphasize the production’s interpretation of that play-text. It is produced in order to make clear the company's ''particular way'' of understanding and rendering the story. In this respect, it is related to the concept of [[Gestus]] (insofar as this renders an action and an attitude towards that action simultaneously); a ''fabel'' indicates the sequence of [[Gestus|gestic]] episodes that constitute the dramatic or theatrical [[narrative]].

[[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]], who worked as a director with [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] at his [[Berliner Ensemble]], explains that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[w]hat he [Brecht] called ''fabel'' was the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the play told as a sequence of interactions, describing each event in the [[dialectic]] fashion developed by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and, in Brecht’s last years, also by [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]. This may sound quite theoretical, but in Brecht’s practice the ''fabel'' was something utterly concrete and practical. Acting, music, the visual elements of the staging, in short, everything an audience perceived, had to contribute to the storytelling and make it lucid, convincing, entertaining and ‘elegant’--as Brecht liked to put it. One result was that the [[Berliner Ensemble|Ensemble’s]] productions were quite well understood by international audiences who could not follow the German text. Brecht insisted that the [[Blocking (stage)|configuration and movement of actors]] and objects on stage should clearly ‘tell the ''fabel''’. If they were to watch a play through a glass wall blocking all sound, the audience should still be able to follow the essential story. He also insisted that each of the performance elements: acting, design, music and so forth, should remain a recognisable [[Separation of the Elements|separate entity]] while it contributed to the ''fabel''’s presentation.  Brecht liked to speak of a 'storytelling arrangement', which meant the specific [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] of actors and all props employed in a scene. He regarded this arrangement as the most important means to achieve a clear presentation of the ''fabel'', and the term 'scenic writing' may best convey what he was aiming for. [. . .] The thorough and extremely detailed preparation included countless discussions in which a text was dissected to determine which ''fabel'' it might yield."&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;[[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Weber, Carl]]. 1994. “Brecht and the Berliner Ensemble - the making of a model.” In Peter Thomson and Glendyr Sacks, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Brecht''. Cambridge Companions to Literature Ser. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-42485-2}}. p.181, 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Weber's reference here to 'scenic writing' suggests, a director or other company member may produce multiple ''fabels'' during the course of a production, each detailing and clarifying a different aspect of the process: a dramatic analysis; an interpretive proposal; an initial springboard position from which to initiate a process of exploration and experiment in rehearsals; a description of individual production aspects (the lighting ''fabel'', the sound ''Fabel'', the visual or scenic design ''fabel'', etc.); an account of progress made at different stages of the rehearsal process; individual actor performance and character behaviour ''fabels''. Virtually any aspect of the theatrical process of production may be explored through the use of a specific ''fabel''.

[[John Willett]], Brecht's English translator, suggests that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[t]he primary principle which [Brecht] taught his collaborators was that of the ''fabel'' or story. The chain of events must be clearly and strongly established not just in the production, but beforehand in the actual play. Where it was not clear it was up to the ‘[[Dramaturge|Dramaturg]]’ to alter the text, in order to cut unnecessary entanglements and come to the point. The play itself might be by [[George Farquhar|Farquhar]] or [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz|Lenz]] or [[Molière]], but ‘the writer’s words are only sacred insofar as they are true’. This went for Brecht’s own words as well, and his plays were subject to continual small changes even in the course of a single run. Atmosphere and ‘psychology’ did not matter as such; everything  would emerge given a clear and credible sequence of concrete events. ‘Each scene,’ says a writer in ''Theaterarbeit'',
::is subdivided into a succession of episodes. Brecht produces as though each of these little episodes could be taken out of the play and performed on its own. They are meticulously realized, down to the smallest detail.
The chain of events had become his substitute for the tidy, comprehensive ‘[[Plot (narrative)|plot]]’. Thus the "[[A Short Organum for the Theatre|Short Organum]]":
::As we cannot invite the public to fling itself into the story as if it were a river, and let itself be swept vaguely to and fro, the individual events have to be knotted together in such a way that the knots are easily seen. The events must not succeed one another indistinguishably but must give us a chance to interpose our judgment.
‘Playing according to the sense’, the [[Berliner Ensemble|Ensemble]] calls it; and the sense is what Brecht tried to get clear in any play, first for himself and his collaborators, then for the audience too.Hence, for example, his emphasis on that side of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare’s]] work which is so often neglected: the actual story. ‘It is a long time,’ he found, ‘since our theatre played these scenes for the events contained in them; they are played only for the outbursts of temperament which the events allow.’ [. . . ]
In such conferences Brecht would get his colleagues to make a written or verbal précis of the play, and later they would have to write descriptions of an actual performance. Both were practice in distilling the incidents that count.&lt;ref name="willett"&gt;[[John Willett|Willett, John]]. 1959. ''The Theatre of Bertolt Brecht: A Study from Eight Aspects''. Rev. Ed. London: Methuen, 1977. {{ISBN|0-413-34360-X}}. p.152-153,154)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A ''fabel'' specifies, narrativizes, and objectifies the attitudes and activities involved in the process of producing a play. In doing so, it enables company members to [[Dialectics|dialecticize]] that process—in the sense that a particular ''fabel'' provides a fixed 'snapshot' of a transitory and constantly developing process in a form that enables comparisons to be made. These comparisons may be between the description in the ''Fabel'' and the reality of the production as it stands or between different ''fabels'' (which have been generated by the production either at different stages of the process or in relation to different aspects—lighting, sound, blocking, etc.---of it); for example, having produced a ''Fabel'' at the beginning of the rehearsal process, the director may return to it near the end of rehearsals to check that the production is 'telling the story' intended (or, alternatively, to clarify the ways in which that story has changed as a result of rehearsal exploration and development).

The use of ''fabels'' does not predetermine the style of production nor does it necessarily require an [[Epic theater|epic]] [[Dramatic structure|dramaturgy]] or aesthetic (the elimination of [[suspense]] and mystery,&lt;ref name="suspense"&gt;[[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin, Walter]]. 1939. "What is Epic Theatre? [Second Version]". In ''Understanding Brecht''. Trans. Anna Bostock. London: Verso, 1973. {{ISBN|0-902308-99-8}}. p.17: "[T]he suspense concerns less the ending than the separate events".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alienation effect|defamiliarization effects]], etc.), despite having originated in [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] practice. The creation of ''Fabels'' is an attempt to achieve clarity for the ''producers'' (actors, director, designers) rather than the ''audience'' (which would characterize an epic production). One may create [[psychological fiction|psychological]] (in a [[Konstantin Stanislavsky|Stanislavskian]] approach) or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] (in an [[Antonin Artaud|Artaudian]] approach) ''fabels'' as well as the [[Sociology|social]] ones that Brecht explored.

'''Factor Ten''' is a social and economic policy program developed by the Factor Ten institute with the stated goal of reducing human resource turnover by 90% on a global scale within the next 30 to 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factor10-institute.org/ |title=Factor 10 Institute |publisher=Factor 10 Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, from the [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]], first proposed the Factor 10 and [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] concepts in the early 1990s. He concluded in his studies that 80% of the world’s resources are distributed among [[First World]] nations, which contribute 20% of the global population, so those nations are promoting an unsustainable system of development. The goal of Factor 10 is to assure that nations do not exceed the planet’s [[carrying capacity]] but leave sufficient resources for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/factor-10 |title=Factor 10 : Dictionary of Sustainable Management |publisher=Sustainabilitydictionary.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factor 4 ==
Factor 10 evolved from the less dramatic '''Factor 4''' was originally proposed by [[L. Hunter Lovins]] and [[Amory Lovins]] of the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] and [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker|Ernst von Weizsäcker]], the founder of the [[Wuppertal Institute]] for Climate, Environment &amp; Energy. Their book ''Factor 4'' explains how simple it is for nations to achieve Factor 4 results with existing technologies. The concept attempts to reduce resource and energy use by 75 % by doubling output and halving input of production.

== Goals ==
Factor 10 requires the creation of new technologies, policies, and manufacturing processes along with sociocultural change to create a [[global economy]] that is sustainable for a long period of time. The long-term goal of Factor 10, many governments and firms aspiring toward shortIterm relief have difficulty achieving the massive reductions proposed by factor 10. [[Eco-efficiency]], environmental purchasing design for environment, policies and [[environmental taxes]] have already been used by business and governments implementing the Factor 10 theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/sustdev/concepts/11-f10.html |title=Sustainability Concepts: Factor 10 |publisher=Gdrc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factor 10 goes farther as a response to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] call for a tenfold reduction in resource consumption in industrialised countries as a necessary long-term target if adequate resources are to be released for the needs of the [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[UNEP]], Global Environmental Outlook 2000, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; With the predicted rise in population and economic growth to maintain the level of [[pollution]] we have today, we need to be able to produce the same output for 10% of the impact.

Factor X concept is the direct way of using metric and various activities that can reduce the throughput of resources and energy in the given process. The essential question is by what factor can or should certain flows be reduced. It is a useful tool to monitor the performance of business in terms of [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert, K.H., Schmidt-Bleek, B., et al. (2002).

A '''figure of thought''' ({{lang-la|figurae sententiarum}}, {{lang-el|schemata dianoias}}) is a [[rhetorical device]] sometimes distinguished from [[figure of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;Gideon O. Burton, [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/Figures%20of%20Speech-Thought.htm "Figures of speech/figures of thought"], ''Silva Rhetoricae'', Brigham Young University&lt;/ref&gt; In another sense the term has been used in the study of diagrams and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Dirmoser, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-0803-1_12#page-1 "Figures of Thought: The Use of Diagrams in Science and Art"], in "Drawing a Hypothesis", pp. 153-160&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be difficult to draw the distinction between figures of speech and figures of thought, especially when the primary area of inquiry is [[poetry]] rather than a prose composition, which adheres to the rules of rhetorical theory that were for the most part created in their fullest articulation in the age of [[Quintilian]] (c. 35 – c. 100). In their approach to language, the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poets ([[Horace]], [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]]) did not distinguish between ''[[inventio]]'' and ''[[elocutio]]'', which explains somewhat our confusion between figures of thought and figures of speech. The latter are exemplified most immediately by conceptual substitutions, such as [[metaphor]] or [[synecdoche]], but if we consider not just the mere ''linguistic'' aspect of the substitution and focus most closely on the concepts themselves, then we may perceive the comprehensiveness of the conceptual for the poet, who operates with words to extend and amplify the potential semantics of poetic output.

==Uses of the term==
[[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] used the term in relation to the philosophy of [[Plato]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Plato’s dialectic makes continual use of figures of speech, which are really figures of thought."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/A_Figure_of_Speech_or_a_Figure_of_Thought_Part_1-by_Ananda_Coomaraswamy.aspx "A Figure of Speech, or a Figure of Thought?"], Studies in Comparative Religion, Vol. 6, No. 1, Winter 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scholar of [[Latin literature]] Gordon Williams (died 2010)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2744529.ece "Gordon Williams: Scholar who introduced many to the pleasures of Latin poetry" (obituary)], The Times (London), 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; published a study titled ''Figures of Thought in Roman Poetry'' (1980), stating in the introduction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Language]] was subject to ordering by exhaustive description of vocabulary, syntax, and figures. The content was likewise subject to ordering by the rules of ''[[inventio]]'' (the technique by which all the latent or inherent possibilities in a given idea or cluster of ideas could be 'discovered' and exploited)."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A collection of drawings by Nikolaus Gansterer (2011) was titled "Drawing a Hypothesis: Figures of Thought".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.a-n.co.uk/reviews/drawing-a-hypothesis-figures-of-thought "Drawing a Hypothesis: Figures of thought"], a-n The Artists Information Company, 19 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System''' ("GRI") are the rules that govern the classification of goods under the [[Harmonized System|Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System]] (HS). 

== Application ==

There are 6 General Rules in all, which must be applied in consecutive order.

# GRI 1 prescribes how to classify products at the 4-digit Heading level, based on the wording of the headings and the relative HS Section and Chapter Notes.
# GRI 2 prescribes how to classify both incomplete and unassembled goods, and mixtures and combinations of goods.
# GRI 3 prescribes how to classify products that are, prima facie, classifiable under two different HS headings.
# GRI 4 prescribes how to classify products that cannot be classified according to GRI’s 1, 2, and 3.
# GRI 5 prescribes how to classify packaging.
# GRI 6 prescribes how to classify products at the 6-digit subheading level, based on the wording of the subheadings and the relative HS Section and Chapter Notes.

On 10 November 1998, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the [[International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

Since 2001, some national NGOs coalitions promoting the Decade have been established in several countries, including Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands. 
These national coalitions along with international organizations decided to found the '''International Coalition for the Decade''' for the Culture of Peace and Nonviolence in June 2003.

Its office is based in [[Paris]] and its president is [[Christian Renoux]] ([[France]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8657">{{Robotic laws}}
'''Laws of [[Robotics]]''' are a set of laws, rules, or principles, which are intended as a fundamental framework to underpin the behavior of [[robot]]s designed to have a degree of [[autonomy]]. Robots of this degree of complexity do not yet exist, but they have been widely anticipated in [[science fiction]], [[movie|films]] and are a topic of active [[research and development]] in the fields of [[robotics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

The best known set of laws are [[Three Laws of Robotics|those written]] by [[Isaac Asimov]] in the 1940s, or based upon them, but other sets of laws have been proposed by researchers in the decades since then.

==Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics" ==

{{main|Three Laws of Robotics}}
The best known set of laws are [[Isaac Asimov]]'s "[[Three Laws of Robotics]]". These were introduced in his 1942 short story "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]", although they were foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws are:

# A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# A robot must obey the orders &lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt;{{sic|given it|expected=given to it|hide=y}}&lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt; by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=I, Robot|date=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his book ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', a zeroth law was introduced:
:0. A robot may not injure humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

Adaptations and extensions exist based upon this framework. As of 2011 they remain a "[[fictional device]]".&lt;ref name="revolution"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Jon|title=Ready for the robot revolution?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15146053|accessdate=2011-10-03|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPSRC / AHRC principles of robotics ==
In 2011, the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC) and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC) of [[Great Britain]] jointly published a set of five ethical "principles for designers, builders and users of robots" in the [[wikt:real world|real world]], along with seven "high-level messages" intended to be conveyed, based on a September 2010 research workshop:&lt;ref name="revolution" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of robotics:  Regulating Robots in the Real World|url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/|publisher=[[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]]|accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winfield|first=Alan|title=Five roboethical principles – for humans|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028111.100-five-roboethical-principles--for-humans.htm|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans.
# Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots are tools designed to achieve human goals.
# Robots should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security.
# Robots are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response or dependency. It should always be possible to tell a robot from a human.
# It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a robot.

The messages intended to be conveyed were:
# We believe robots have the potential to provide immense positive impact to society. We want to encourage responsible robot research.
# Bad practice hurts us all.
# Addressing obvious public concerns will help us all make progress.
# It is important to demonstrate that we, as roboticists, are committed to the best possible standards of practice.
# To understand the context and consequences of our research, we should work with experts from other disciplines, including: social sciences, law, philosophy and the arts.
# We should consider the ethics of transparency: are there limits to what should be openly available?
# When we see erroneous accounts in the press, we commit to take the time to contact the reporting journalists.
The EPSRC principles are broadly recognised as a useful starting point. In 2016 Tony Prescott organised workshop to revise these principles, e.g. to differentiate ethical from legal principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|last2=|first2=|date=2017|year=|title=Legal vs. ethical obligations – a comment on the EPSRC’s principles for robotics|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MLLLVE|journal=Connection Science|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=10.1080/09540091.2016.1276516|via=|author=Müller, Vincent C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial development==
Another  comprehensive terminological codification for the legal assessment of the technological developments in the robotics industry has already begun mainly in Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;bcc.co.uk: Robot age poses ethical dilemma. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6425927.stm Link]&lt;/ref&gt; This progress represents a contemporary reinterpretation of the law (and ethics) in the field of robotics, an interpretation that assumes a rethinking of traditional legal constellations. These include primarily legal liability issues in civil and criminal law.

== Satya Nadella's laws ==
In June 2016, [[Satya Nadella]], a CEO of [[Microsoft Corporation]] at the time, had an interview with the ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine and roughly sketched five rules for artificial intelligences to be observed by their designers:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/06/microsoft_ceo_satya_nadella_humans_and_a_i_can_work_together_to_solve_society.html|title=The Partnership of the Future|last=Nadella|first=Satya|date=2016-06-28|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/29/12057516/satya-nadella-ai-robot-laws|title=Satya Nadella's rules for AI are more boring (and relevant) than Asimov's Three Laws|last=Vincent|first=James|date=2016-06-29|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "A.I. must be designed to assist humanity" meaning human autonomy needs to be respected.
# "A.I. must be transparent" meaning that humans should know and be able to understand how they work.
# "A.I. must maximize efficiencies without destroying the dignity of people".
# "A.I. must be designed for intelligent privacy" meaning that it earns trust through guarding their information.
# "A.I. must have algorithmic accountability so that humans can undo unintended harm".
# "A.I. must guard against bias" so that they must not discriminate against people.

==Tilden's "Laws of Robotics" ==
[[Mark W. Tilden]] is a robotics physicist who was a pioneer in developing simple robotics.&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.09/tilden.html?pg=1&amp;topic= | work=Wired | first=Fred | last=Hapgood | title=Chaotic Robotics | issue = 2.09 | date = September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; His three guiding principles/rules for robots are:&lt;ref name=wired1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Dunn. "[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/0605surf.html Machine Intelligence, Part II: From Bumper Cars to Electronic Minds]" ''[[The New York Times]]'' 5 June 1996. Retrieved 26 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://makezine.com/06/beam/ makezine.com: A Beginner's Guide to BEAM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] (Most of the article is subscription-only content.)&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''A robot must protect its existence at all costs.''
# ''A robot must obtain and maintain access to its own power source.''
# ''A robot must continually search for better power sources.''

What is notable in these three rules is that these are basically rules for "wild" life, so in essence what Tilden stated is that what he wanted was "proctoring a silicon species into sentience, but with full control over the specs. Not plant. Not animal. Something else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.09/tilden.html?pg=2&amp;topic= | work=Wired | first=Fred | last=Hapgood | title=Chaotic Robotics (continued) | issue = 2.09 | date = September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''local flatness''' is a property of a [[submanifold]] in a [[topological manifold]] of larger [[dimension]]. In the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of topological manifolds, locally flat submanifolds play a role similar to that of [[Submanifold#Embedded submanifolds|embedded submanifolds]] in the category of [[smooth manifolds]]. Local flatness and the [[topology]] of ridge networks is of importance in the study of [[Crumpling|crumpled structures]] with importance in materials processing and [[mechanical engineering]].

Suppose a ''d'' dimensional manifold ''N'' is embedded into an ''n'' dimensional manifold ''M'' (where ''d'' &amp;lt; ''n'').  If &lt;math&gt;x \in N,&lt;/math&gt; we say ''N'' is '''locally flat''' at ''x'' if there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt; U \subset M&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' such that the [[topological pair]] &lt;math&gt;(U, U\cap N)&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt;, with a standard inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; as a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. That is, there exists a homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;U\to R^n&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;U\cap N&lt;/math&gt; coincides with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

The above definition assumes that, if ''M'' has a [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]], ''x'' is not a boundary point of ''M''. If ''x'' is a point on the boundary of ''M'' then the definition is modified as follows. We say that ''N'' is '''locally flat''' at a boundary point ''x'' of ''M'' if there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U\subset M&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' such that the topological pair &lt;math&gt;(U, U\cap N)&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n_+,\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_+&lt;/math&gt; is a standard [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is included as a standard subspace of its boundary. In more detail, we can set 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_+ = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^n\colon y_n \ge 0\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^n\colon y_{d+1}=\cdots=y_n=0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

We call ''N'' '''locally flat''' in ''M'' if ''N'' is locally flat at every point. Similarly, a map &lt;math&gt;\chi\colon N\to M&lt;/math&gt; is called '''locally flat''', even if it is not an embedding, if every ''x'' in ''N'' has a neighborhood ''U'' whose image &lt;math&gt;\chi(U)&lt;/math&gt; is locally flat in ''M''.

Local flatness of an embedding implies strong properties not shared by all embeddings.  Brown (1962) proved that if ''d'' = ''n'' &amp;minus; 1, then ''N'' is collared; that is, it has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to ''N'' &amp;times; [0,1] with ''N'' itself corresponding to ''N'' &amp;times; 1/2 (if ''N'' is in the interior of ''M'') or ''N'' &amp;times; 0 (if ''N'' is in the boundary of ''M'').

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Thaana.png|thumb|300px|Thaana alphabet]] --&gt;
Several [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]] scripts have been used by [[Maldivians]] during [[History of the Maldives|their history]]. The early Dhivehi scripts fell into the [[abugida]] category, while the more recent Taana has characteristics of both an abugida and a true alphabet. An ancient form of [[Nagari script]], as well as the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts, have also been extensively used in the Maldives, but with a more restricted function. Latin was official only during a very brief period of the [[Maldives|Islands']] history.

The language of the [[Maldives]] has had its very own script since very ancient times. It is likely that the first Dhivehi script appeared in association with the expansion of Buddhism throughout South Asia. This was over two millennia ago, in the [[Mauryan]] period, during emperor [[Ashoka]]'s time. Manuscripts used by Maldivian Buddhist monks were probably written in a script that slowly evolved into a characteristic Dhivehi form. None of those ancient documents have been discovered yet and the early forms of the Maldivian script are only found etched on a few coral rocks and copper plates.

{{See also|Dhivehi language|History of the Maldives}}

[[Image:Div ak01.PNG|thumb|right|The most ancient Dhivehi script]]
''Divehi Akuru'' "island letters" is a script formerly used to write the Dhivehi language. Unlike the modern Thaana script, Divehi Akuru has its origins in the [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] script and thus was written from left to right.

Divehi Akuru was separated into two variants, a more recent and an ancient one and christened "Dives Akuru" and "Evēla Akuru" respectively by [[Harry Charles Purvis Bell]] in the early 20th century. Bell was [[United Kingdom|British]] and studied Maldivian [[epigraphy]] when he retired from the colonial government service in [[Colombo]].

Bell wrote a monograph on the archaeology, history and epigraphy of the Maldives. He was the first modern scholar to study these ancient writings and he undertook an extensive and serious research on the available epigraphy. The division that Bell made based on the differences he perceived between the two types of Dhivehi scripts is convenient for the study of old Dhivehi documents.

The Divehi Akuru developed from the [[Grantha alphabet]]. The letters on old inscriptions resemble the southern Grantha of the [[Pallava dynasty]] and [[Chola dynasty]] periods of [[South India]]. However, this does not mean that the Maldives were dependent on those kingdoms, for the Maldives have been an independent nation for practically all their history. There has been very little interference, cultural or otherwise, from other neighboring kingdoms in South India and [[Sri Lanka]].

The early form of this script was also called Divehi Akuru by Maldivians, but it was renamed Evēla Akuru "ancient letters" in a tentative manner by H. C. P. Bell in order to distinguish it from the more recent variants of the same script. This name became established and so the most ancient form of the Maldive script is now known as Evēla Akuru. The ancient name of the Evēla Akuru was ''Dīvī Grantha''. This is the script that evolved at the time when the Maldives was an independent kingdom and it was still in use one century after the conversion to [[Islam]].
  
[[Image:Standard indic table8.PNG|thumb|right|Standard Indic ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]). This table is provided as a reference for the position of the letters on all the tables.]]

Evēla can be seen in the [[Lōmāfānu]] (copper plate grants) of the 12th and 13th centuries and in inscriptions on coral stone (hirigā) dating back from the Maldive Buddhist period. Two of the few copper plate documents that have been preserved are from [[Haddhunmathi Atoll]].

The oldest inscription found in the Maldives to date is an inscription on a [[coral]] stone found at an archaeological site on [[Landhoo (Noonu Atoll)|Landhū Island]] in [[Southern Miladhunmadulu Atoll]], where there are important Buddhist archaeological remains including a large [[stupa]]. The Landhū inscription is estimated to be from the 8th century A.D. Even though long before that time Maldivian Buddhist monks had been writing and reading manuscripts in their language, older documents have not yet been discovered yet.

The reason why even at that time the local script was known as "Divehi Akuru" by Maldivians was because another non-Maldivian script was used in the country. This was a [[Devanagari]] script related to the form used by [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and it had a ceremonial value. The oldest paleographically-datable inscription found in the Maldives is a [[Prakrit]] inscription of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] dating back to the 9th or 10th century AD. This inscription is written in an early form of the Nagari script. Thus the name "Divehi Akuru" was used historically by Maldivians to distinguish their own writing system from foreign scripts. Foreign scripts were learned and introduced at that time when Maldivian monks visited the Buddhist learning centers of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom'', Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Dhivehi or ''Dhives Akuru''==
{{main|Dhives Akuru}}
[[Image:Div ak02.PNG|thumb|right|The last version of the Dhivehi script used after the conversion to Islam]]

Among the ''Divehi Akuru'' scripts, the later form of the Dhivehi script was the script that evolved from the ancient Dhivehi script or Evēla Akuru after the conversion of the Maldives to [[Islam in the Maldives|Islam]]. It was still used in some atolls in the South Maldives as the main script until around 70 years ago. Since then it is rarely used, not even having a ceremonial role in scrolls of [[coats-of-arms]] or badges of government entities and associations, where [[Arabic]] is favoured.

This script can be found on gravestones, old grants in paper and wood, and in some monuments, including the stone base of the pillars supporting the main structure of the ancient Friday Mosque in [[Malé]]. 
British researcher H. C. P. Bell obtained an astrology book written in Divehi Akuru in [[Addu Atoll]], in the south of Maldives, during one of his trips. This book is now kept in the National Archives of [[Sri Lanka]] in Colombo.

Apparently, the Dhivehi script was abandoned in other parts of the [[Maldives]] in favour of the modern Thaana script about 200 years earlier, perhaps at the beginning of the 18th century. Some modern Dhivehi historians want to believe that the Thaana script was introduced a few centuries before that. But the claim that the Thaana letters were devised in the 16th century is not supported by historical documents, for the oldest writing specimens in the Thaana script, interspersed with Arabic, are from the 18th century.

==The modern script==
{{main|Thaana}}
[[Image:Tana table b.PNG|thumb|right|Thaana, the contemporary official Dhivehi script]]

[[Thaana]] is the first Dhivehi script written from right to left. It was inspired by numbers. It uses numerals as consonants and adds the diacritical (vowel) marks of the Arabic language.

The first Thaana manuscripts are written in a crude early version of this script called Gabulhi Thaana (incipient Thaana), where the Arabic numerals have not yet been slanted 45 degrees and still look like numbers. Since no ancient writings in Thaana written before the 18th century have been found, it is doubtful that this script could be much older.

The main reason why the Divehi Akuru were abandoned in favour of the Thaana script was owing to the need the learned Maldivians had to include words and sentences in Arabic while writing in the [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]] language.

The most intriguing fact about the Thaana alphabet is its order (hā, shaviyani, nūnu, rā, bā, etc.). Its sequence does not follow the ancient order of the other [[Indic scripts]] (like [[Sinhala alphabet|Sinhala]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) or the order of the [[Arabic alphabet]]. In fact, the order of the Thaana alphabet has no logic at all. This points to a likely esoteric origin of Thaana, namely to a script that was scrambled on purpose in order to keep it secret from average islanders. At their origin the Thaana characters, which are based on Arabic numerals and other symbols, were used in ''fandita'' (local magic or sorcery) to write magical spells. Many of these arcane incantations included Arabic quotations, which were written from right to left. Maldivian learned men, who were all well versed in sorcery, eventually saw the advantages of writing in this simplified hidden script. Hence, with the passing of time, Thaana came out of the shadows and was gradually adopted for everyday use.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

This script is currently in use as the sole Dhivehi writing system. While at their origin documents written in Thaana were full of Arabic words and quotations, the tendency is now to include as little Arabic script as possible, especially since special Thaana letters with dots were introduced to replace Arabic letters. The Thaana script is widely used nowadays by Maldivians both in official and unofficial documents, for the literacy rate of the Maldive society is very high by South Asian standards.

===Abolishment of the letter naviyani===
The letter [[naviyani]] '''ޱ''', representing the retroflex nasal]] {{IPA|/ɳ/}} sound common to all Indic languages ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi]], etc.), was abolished from official documents in 1950 by Muhammad Amin, the ruler of Maldives. The reason why this particular retroflex sound was abolished and not others like Lhaviyani, Daviyani or Taviyani is not known.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Letter Naviyani's former position in the Thaana alphabet was the nineteenth, between letters Daviyani and Zaviyani. It is still seen in reprints of traditional old books like the Bodu Tartheebu. It is also used by people of [[Addu Atoll|Addu]] and [[Fuvahmulah]] when writing songs or poetry in their language variants.

===The letter ''Shaviyani''===
Letter [[Sha viyani|Shaviyani]] ('''ށ''') is the second letter of the [[Thaana alphabet]]. It represents the [[voiceless retroflex fricative]] {{IPA|[ʂ]}}, and is only found at the ends of words.

==The ''Divehi Akuru'' book==
In 1959, during Sultan Mohammed Farid’s reign, former Prime Minister (and later President) [[Ibrahim Nasir]] expressed a wish to have a book written about the former Dhivehi script which by that time was largely ignored by Maldivians. Thus, he contacted As-Sayyid [[Bodufenvalhuge Sidi]], an eminent Maldivian scholar, who swiftly obliged. 
[[Image:Div Akuru F21.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cover of the "Divehi Akuru" book written by Bodufenvalhuge Sidi]]
By means of this small book Bodufenvalhuge Sidi (1888–1970) wanted to clearly show the fact that in ancient times Maldivians were writing from left to right in their own script. Hence ''Divehi Akuru'' is perhaps the only book ever written in Thaana that opens from the left side.

As-Sayyid Bodufenvalhuge Sidi was one of the very few Maldivian people of modern times who understood the now-forgotten ancient Dhivehi letters in which parts of royal grants, warrants and deeds were written. He learnt this ancient script in [[Addu Atoll]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Until early in the twentieth century, all government correspondence to and from Addu Atoll was written using these ancient Dhivehi letters.
 
The last chapter of this book shows a text where the Divehi Akuru are coming along with Arabic script. As the reader acquainted with Dhivehi writing can see, this book is Volume 1 (evvana bai). Perhaps Bodufenvalhuge Sidi had the intention of publishing a second, or perhaps even a third volume on the subject. But he died before being able to do so.

Even though H. C. P. Bell undertook very careful and thorough research on the Dhivehi documents, Prime Minister [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s intention was to have a book on the ancient script of the Maldives written by a Maldivian. Prime Minister Nasir's request to Bodufenvalhuge Sidi was done in order to clarify Bell's misinterpretations, no matter how few. A staunch Maldivian nationalist, Nasir took this issue as a matter of national pride.

Present day members of Maldivian cultural institutions are aware of the lacunae in Bell's research and of Bodufenvalhuge Sidi's valuable contribution to mend matters, but little has been done to correct those inaccuracies. Still, Bell's broad and valuable contributions to the study of the Dhivehi language and scripts should not be underestimated.

==Latin transliteration==
Towards the mid 1970s, during President [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s tenure, [[Telegraphy|Telex]] machines were introduced by the Maldivian Government in the local administration. The new telex equipment was viewed as a great progress, however the local Thaana script was deemed to be an obstacle because messages on the [[Teleprinter|telex machines]] could only be written in the [[Malé Latin|Latin script]].
Following this, ''Dhivehi Letin'', an official Latin transliteration, was swiftly approved by the Maldivian government in 1976 and was quickly implemented by the administration. Booklets were printed and dispatched to all Atoll and Island Offices, as well as schools and merchant liners. This was seen by many as the demise of the Thaana script.

Clarence Maloney, the American anthropologist who was in the Maldives at the time of the change, lamented the crude inconsistencies of ''Dhivehi Letin'' and wondered why the modern [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST Standard Indic]] transliteration had not been considered. Standard Indic is a consistent script system that is well adapted to writing practically all languages of South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Maloney; People of the Maldive Islands&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thaana script was reinstated by President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] shortly after he took power in 1978. There was widespread relief in certain places, especially rural areas, where the introduction of Latin had been regarded as a preliminary to the introduction of infidel mores. However, the substandard Latin transcription of 1976 continues to be widely used.

== Devanagari script for Mahl ==
[[Image:Mahldevanagari.png|thumb|300px|Devanagari script for Mahal]]
Although the Mahl dialect of the Dhivehi language spoken in the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], [[India]] is also written mainly using the [[Thaana]] alphabet, in the 1950s a Devanagari script was modified to write the Maldivian dialect.

[[File:Media_independence_trends.pdf|thumb|421x421px|Media independence trends, UNESCO's World Trends Report 2018]]
'''Media independence''' is the absence of external control and influence on an institution or individual working in the [[Media (communication)|media]]. It is a measure of one's capacity to "make decisions and act according to its own logic,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and distinguishes [[independent media]] from [[state media]].

The concept of media independence has often been contested as a normative principle in media policy and [[journalism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title="What We Talk About When Talk About "Media Independence".", Javnost - The Public. Journal of the European Institute for Communication and Culture.|last=Karppinen|first=Kari|last2=Moe|first2=Hallvard|publisher=Routledge Taylor and Francis Group|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://doi.org/10.1080/13183222.2016.1162986|pages=105–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Couldry (2009) considers that [[digital transformation]]s tend to compromise the press as a common good (with a blurring of the difference between journalism and advertising, for example) by the technological, political and social dynamics that it brings.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} For this reason, authors such as Daniel Hallin,&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, Daniel C. 2006. “The Passing of the ‘High Modernism’ of American Journalism Revisited.” Political Communication Report 16 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kelly McBride]], and [[Tom Rosenstiel]]&lt;ref&gt;McBride, Kelly, and Tom Rosenstiel. 2013. “Introduction: New Guiding Principles for a New Era of Journalism.” In The New Ethics of Journalism. Principles for the 21st Century, edited by KellyMcBride and Tom Rosenstiel, 1–6. London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; consider other norms (such as [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participation]]) to be more relevant. Karppinen and Moe state that "what we talk about when we talk about media independence, then, are the characteristics of the relations between, on the one side, specific entities ranging from media institutions, via journalistic cultures, to individual speakers, and, on the other, their social environment, including the state, political interest groups, the market or the [[Popular culture|mainstream culture]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Two factors tend to influence media independence. The disruption and crisis in [[business model]]s that have supported print and [[Broadcasting|broadcast media]] for decades have left [[Old media|traditional media]] outlets more vulnerable to external influences as they seek to establish new revenue sources. In many regions, [[Austerity|austerity measures]] have led to large-scale budget cuts of [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]], dislocating employees and limiting innovation in programming.

An indicator of a lack of independence is the level of [[public trust]] in the credibility of [[journalism]]. According to the [[Edelman Trust Barometer]], trust in media seems to be declining, reflecting declines of trust in government, business and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]].&lt;ref&gt;Edelman. 2017. Trust Barometer. Edelman. Available at https://www.edelman.com/trust2017/. Accessed 11 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, [[Digital media|online media]] has become more and more popular, gaining trust throughout the world, but for Mindi Chahal, awareness on the risk of "[[Fake news|fake-news]]", [[filter bubble]]s and [[algorithm]]s has begun to change perceptions of the credibility of online information.&lt;ref&gt;Chahal, Mindi. 2017. The fake news effect and what it means for advertisers. Marketing Week. Available at https://www.marketingweek.com/2017/03/27/the-fake-news-effect/. Accessed 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anya Schiffrin]] says that despite the initial optimism that [[social media]] would reduce such tendencies by enabling broader [[Digital citizen|citizen participation in media]], there are growing signals that social media are similarly susceptible to [[Regulatory capture|political capture]] and [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]], further impacting on the trust that users may have towards information on these platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Schriffen, Anya. 2017b. In the Service of Power: Media Capture and the Threat to Democracy. Washington, DC: Center for International Media Assistance. Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/resource/service-power-media-capture-threat-democracy/&lt;/ref&gt;

Media regulators impact on the [[editorial independence]] of the media, which is still deeply entwined with political and economic influences and pressures. Private media - functioning outside of governments' control and with minimum official regulation - are still dependent on advertising support, risking potential misuse of advertisers as a political tool by larger advertisers such as governments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emerging technologies|New technologies]] has added new meaning to what constitutes media independence. The collection, selection, aggregation, synthesis and [[Data processing|processing of data]] are now increasingly delegated to forms of [[automation]]. While the sharing of social media posts is crucial in elevating the importance of certain news sources or stories, what appears in individual news feeds on platforms such as [[Facebook]] or news aggregators such as [[Google News]] is the product of other forces as well. This includes algorithmic calculations, which remove professional editorial judgement, in favor of past consumption patterns by the individual user and his/her social network. In 2016, users declared preferring algorithms over editors for selecting the news they wanted to read.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, David, Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, Nic Newman, and Richard Fletcher. 2016. Reuters Institute Digital News Report. Digital News Report. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Available at http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/. Accessed 22 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite apparent neutrality algorithms may often compromise editorial integrity, and have been found to lead to discrimination against people based on their race, socio-economic situation and geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;Turow, Joseph. 2013.

Algorithmic Accountability: Journalistic investigation of computational power structures. Digital Journalism 3 (3): 398–415.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
The role of [[Regulatory agency|regulatory authorities]] (license broadcaster institutions, content providers, platforms) and the resistance to political and commercial interference in the autonomy of the media sector are both considered as significant components of media independence. In order to ensure media independence, [[Regulatory agency|regulatory authorities]] should be placed outside of governments' directives. this can be measured through legislation, agency statutes and rules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Government regulations ===

==== Licensing ====
The process of issuing licenses in many regions still lacks transparency and is considered to follow procedures that are obscure and concealing. In many countries, regulatory authorities stand accused of political bias in favor of the government and [[ruling party]], whereby some prospective broadcasters have been denied licenses or threatened with the withdrawal of licenses. In many countries, diversity of content and views have diminished as [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fostered directly or indirectly by States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This not only impacts on [[competition]] but leads to a concentration of power with potentially excessive influence on [[public opinion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanretty, Chris. 2014. Media outlets and their moguls: Why concentrated individual or family ownership is bad for editorial independence. European Journal of Communication 29 (3): 335–350.&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley et al. cite failure to renew or retain licenses for editorially critical media; folding the regulator into government ministries or reducing its competences and mandates for action; and lack of due process in the adoption of regulatory decisions, among others, as examples in which these regulators are formally compliant with sets of legal requirements on independence, but their main task in reality is seen to be that of enforcing [[political agenda]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Steve, Kreszentia Duer, Toby Mendel, and Sean O. Siochru. 2008. Broadcasting, Voice, and Accountability : A Public Interest Approach to Policy, Law, and Regulation. Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Government endorsed appointments ====
State control is also evident in the increasing politicization of regulatory bodies operationalized through transfers and appointments of party-aligned individuals  to senior positions in regulatory authorities.

==== Internet regulation ====
Governments worldwide have sought to extend regulation to internet companies, whether [[Internet providers|connectivity providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, and whether domestically or foreign-based. The impact on journalistic content can be severe, as internet companies can err too much on the side of caution and take down news reports, including algorithmically, while offering inadequate opportunities for redress to the affected news producers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Self-regulation ===

==== Regional ====
In [[Western Europe]], [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] provides an alternative to state regulatory authorities. In such contexts, [[newspaper]]s have historically been free of licensing and regulation, and there has been repeated pressure for them to self-regulate or at least to have in-house [[Ombudsman|ombudsmen]]. However, it has often been difficult to establish meaningful self-regulatory entities.

In many cases, self-regulations exists in the shadow of state regulation, and is conscious of the possibility of [[Interventionism (politics)|state intervention]]. In many countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], self-regulatory structures seems to be lacking or have not historically been perceived as efficient and effective.&lt;ref&gt;Fengler, Susanne, Tobias Eberwein, Salvador Alsius, Olivier Baisnée, Klaus Bichler, Boguslawa Dobek-Ostrowska, Huub Evers, et al. 2015. How effective is media self-regulation? Results from a comparative survey of European journalists. European Journal of Communication 30 (3): 249–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of satellite delivered channels, delivered directly to viewers, or through cable or online systems, renders much larger the sphere of unregulated programing. There are, however, varying efforts to regulate the access of [[programmer]]s to satellite transponders in parts of the [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]n region, the [[Arab world|Arab region]] and in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]]. The Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter was an example of efforts to bring formal standards and some regulatory authority to bear on what is transmitted, but it appears to not have been implemented.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;UNESCO. 2014. World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development. Paris: UNESCO Available at https://en.unesco.org/world-media-trends-2017/previous-editions&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International organizations and NGO's ====
Self-regulation is expressed as a preferential system by journalists but also as a support for media freedom and development organizations by intergovernmental organizations such as [[UNESCO]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s. There has been a continued trend of establishing self-regulatory bodies, such as press councils, in conflict and post-conflict situations.

Major internet companies have responded to pressure by governments and the public by elaborating self-regulatory and complaints systems at the individual company level, using principles they have developed under the framework of the [[Global Network Initiative]]. The Global Network Initiative has grown to include several large telecom companies alongside internet companies such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and others, as well as [[Civil society|civil society organizations]] and academics.&lt;ref&gt;Global Network Initiative (GNI). 2017. Global Network Initiative Adds Seven Companies in Milestone Expansion of Freedom of Expression and Privacy Initiative. Available at https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/global-network-initiative-adds-seven-companies-in-milestone-expansion-of-freedom-of-expression-and-privacy-initiative/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]]’s 2013 publication, ICT Technology Sector Guide on Implementing the [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]], impacts on the presence of independent journalism by defining the limits of what should or should not be carried and prioritized in the most popular digital spaces.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. Shift and Institute for Human Rights and Business, 2013. https://www.ihrb.org/pdf/eu-sector-guidance/EC-Guides/ICT/EC-Guide_ICT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Private sector ====

Public pressure on technology giants has motivated the development of new strategies aimed not only at identifying ‘[[fake news]]’, but also at eliminating some of the structural causes of their emergence and proliferation. Facebook has created new buttons for users to report content they believe is false, following previous strategies aimed at countering [[Online hate speech|hate speech and harassment online]]. These changes reflect broader transformations occurring among tech giants to increase their transparency. As indicated by the [[Open Technology Institute|Ranking Digital Rights]] Corporate Accountability Index, most large internet companies have reportedly become relatively more forthcoming in terms of their policies about transparency in regard to third party requests to remove or access content, especially in the case of requests from governments.&lt;ref&gt;Ranking Digital Rights. 2015. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/.

Ranking Digital Rights. 2017. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2017/.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, the study signaled a number of companies that have become more opaque when it comes to disclosing how they enforce their own terms of service, in restricting certain types of content and account.&lt;ref&gt;Ranking Digital Rights. 2017. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2017/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fact-checking and news literacy ====
[[File:Ranking_Digital_Rights_2015.jpg|thumb|217x217px|Ranking Digital Rights indicator scores for policy transparency in regard to their terms of service enforcement (which impact upon content or account restrictions)]]
In addition to responding to pressure for more clearly defined self-regulatory mechanisms, and galvanized by the debates over so-called ‘fake news’, internet companies such as Facebook have launched campaigns to educate users about how to more easily distinguish between ‘fake news’ and real news sources. Ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|United Kingdom national election in 2017]], for example, Facebook published a series of advertisements in newspapers with ‘Tips for Spotting False News’ which suggested 10 things that might signal whether a story is genuine or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/188118808357379|title=Tips to Spot False News {{!}} Facebook Help Center {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been broader initiatives bringing together a variety of donors and actors to promote [[Fact checking|fact-checking]] and [[Information and media literacy|news literacy]], such as the News Integrity Initiative at the [[City University of New York]]’s School of Journalism. This 14 million USD investment by groups including the [[Ford Foundation]] and Facebook was launched in 2017 so its full impact remains to be seen. It will, however, complement the offerings of other networks such as the International Fact-Checking Network launched by the [[Poynter Institute]] in 2015 which seeks to outline the parameters of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poynter.org/international-fact-checking-network-fact-checkers-code-principles|title=International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers’ code of principles|website=Poynter|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences in media systems ==
The media systems around the world are often put under pressure by the widespread [[delegitimisation]] by political actors of the media as a venerable institution along with the profession of [[journalism]], and the growing efforts made towards media capture, particularly [[Digital media|online media]], which has often been regarded as more resistant to such form of control than other types of media.

=== Delegitimisation of models ===
[[File:Effect_of_deligitimisation_of_media_on_society.png|thumb|379x379px|Effect of deligitimisation of media on society]]

==== Discreditation ====
Powerful actors such as [[government]]s have often been seen to initiate and engage in the process of systematic attacks on the media by trivializing it, or sometimes characterizing it as an ‘enemy’ has widespread implications for the independence and well-being of the sector. This can be particularly apparent during [[election]]s. A common tactic is to blur the distinction between [[Mainstream media|mainstream news media]], and the mass of unverified content on [[social media]]. [[Delegitimisation]] is a subtle and effective form of [[propaganda]], reducing the public’s confidence in the media to perform a collective function as a check on government. This can be seen as being linked [[Polarization (politics)|political]] and [[social polarization]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Attacks on media ====
In some regions, delegitimisation is reportedly combined with wider attacks on independent media:  key properties have been closed down or sold to parties with ties to the government. Newer entrants linked to state power and vast resources gain sway. Opposition to these pressures may strengthen the defense of the press as civil society and mobilize the public in protest, but in some cases, this conflict leads to fear-induced [[apathy]] or withdrawal. Advertisers and investors may be scared-off by delegitimisation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Criminal defamation ====
Efforts to curtail [[Defamation|criminal defamation]] are still ongoing in many regions but the dangers from civil law suits with high costs and high risk are also rising, leading to a greater likelihood of [[bankruptcy]] of media outlets. Independence is weakened where the right of journalists to criticize public officials is threatened. A general assault on the media can lead to measures making [[Safety of journalists|journalists]] more frequently liable for publishing state secrets and their capacity to shield sources can be reduced. Delegitimizing the media makes it easier to justify these legal changes that make the news business even more precarious.

=== Media capture ===
Media capture refers to the full range of forces that can restrict or skew coverage. It has been defined as "a situation where the media have not succeeded in becoming autonomous in manifesting a will of their own, nor able to perform their main function, notably of informing people. Instead, they have persisted in an intermediate state, with vested interests, and not just the government, using them for other purposes."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engaging in Polarized Society: Social Media and Political Discourse in Ethiopia. In Digital Activism in the Social Media Era|last=Gagliardone|first=Iginio|last2=Matti|first2=Pohjonen|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40949-8_2|pages=25–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mungiu-Pippidi considers that capture corrupts the main role of the media: to inform the public, with media outlets instead opting to trade influence and manipulate information.&lt;ref&gt;Mungiu-Pippidi, Alina. 2013. Freedom without Impartiality: The Vicious Circle of Media Capture. In Media Transformations in the Post-Communist World, edited by Peter Gross and Karol Jakubowicz. Plymouth: Lexington Books.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinguishing feature of media capture is the collaboration by the private sector. Cases abound across all regions of [[blog]]gers and [[Citizen journalism|citizen journalists]] putting a spotlight on specific issues and reporting on the ground during [[protest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, Stuart, and Einar Thorsen, eds. 2009.

Full capture can also be complicated to achieve. Paid [[Internet troll|trolls]] leading to phenomena such as paid [[Twitter]] and mob attacks, along with [[fake news]] and [[rumor]]s, are reportedly able to widely disseminate their attacks on independent journalists with the aid of bots. Across much of [[Africa]], a trend of "serial callers" has become increasingly common. Also observed in other regions, such as in North America where the phenomenon is commonly referred to as "[[astroturfing]]", serial callers are often individuals commissioned by political actors to constantly phone in to popular radio call in programmes with the intention of skewing or influencing the program in their interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In some cases, the programme might be structurally biased towards such actors (e.g., there will be a dedicated phone for those that have planned to phone in with particular political sympathies) but in other cases the process is more ad hoc with sympathetic callers flooding particular radio programs.

=== Financial regulations and business models ===

==== Concentration of media ownership ====
Financial threats on media independence can be [[Concentration of media ownership|concentrated ownership]] power, bankruptcy, or unsustainable funding for [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]]. Capital controls for media are in place in all regions to manage foreign direct investment in the media sector. Many governments in Africa, [[Latin America]] and [[Caribbean]], and the Asia and Pacific regions have passed stringent laws and regulations that limit or forbid foreign media ownership, especially in the broadcasting and telecom sectors, with mixed impact on editorial independence. In Latin America, almost two thirds of the 15 countries covered by a [[World Bank]] study on foreign direct investments impose restrictions on foreign ownership in the newspaper-publishing sector. Almost all countries specify a cap on the foreign investment in media sector, although increasingly the strategy in the region has been to absorb private and foreign capital and experience of media management without losing ownership and political control of the media sector.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more complex to regulate ownership issues when the companies are internet platforms spanning multiple jurisdictions, although [[European Union|European]] competition and tax law has responded to some of the challenges in this regard, with unclear impact on the issue of independence of journalistic content on Internet companies.

==== New business models ====
Across the industry, media outlets have been re-evaluating where the value in media content lies, with a corresponding increase in government development programs, corporate benefactors and other special interests funding or cross-funding media content. These kinds of funding have been common historically in [[international broadcasting]], and they typically influence actual media content, framing, and the ‘red lines’ different from professional principles that reporters feel unable to cross. While larger media companies have relied on attracting their own advertisers online, many online intermediaries such as Google Ads now exist, which effectively has meant that small online media companies can get some revenues without having to have dedicated facilities—although the requirements of platforms like Facebook for video content, and the power to change news feeds without consultation do compromise editorial autonomy. In addition, the media organization concerned can no longer exert strong control over what [[Advertising|advertisements]] are shown, nor can it benefit from accessing full audience data to strengthen its own revenue prospects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Journalist perceptions ===
[[File:Trends_in_journalists_percetion_of_the_credibility_of_journalism.svg|thumb|481x481px|Trends in journalists perception of the credibility of journalism]]
According to the Worlds of Journalism Study, journalists in 18 of the 21 countries surveyed in Western Europe and North America perceived their freedom to make editorial decisions independently to have shrunken in the past five years. In all other regions, a plurality of journalists in most countries reported their editorial freedom to have strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Worlds of Journalism Study 2016. The Worlds of Journalism Study is an academically driven project that was founded to regularly assess the state of journalism throughout the world. Its most recent wave brought together researchers from 67 countries, who interviewed 27,500 journalists between 2012 and 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While there remains a marked decline in print advertising sales in these States, some [[newspaper]]s are reporting an increase in [[Online advertising|digital advertising]] revenues and subscriptions that have enabled expansions of newsrooms that previously faced significant financial difficulty. This development partly reflects the relationship between major news brands and electoral cycles but it may also signal a growing willingness on the part of readers to pay for quality digital content.&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, Lahiri. 2017. New York Times tops revenue estimates as digital subscriptions jump. Reuters. New York, United States edition, sec. Business. Available at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-times-results-idUSKBN17Z1E0. Accessed 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doctor, Ken. 2016. ‘Profitable’ Washington Post adding more than five dozen journalists. Politico Media. Available at https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/12/the-profitable-washington-post-adding-more-than-five-dozen-journalists-004900. Accessed 8 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mitigating political and economic interference ===
Several tools and organizations commit to mitigate political and economic interference in the media system.

==== Regulatory bodies ====
In some countries, the rise of [[Trade association|trade bodies]] as a dominating site of [[advocacy]] seems to limit the plurality of voices involved or consulted to those representing mainly owner interests in decision-making. This has occurred as the [[lobbying]] power of media elites has increased with ownership consolidation, particularly in North America. In some cases, the relative formal independence of the media regulator from government may have made it more vulnerable to capture by commercial interests. Some of the board members from these trade bodies and associations sit on government working groups and are members of committees. Such members often facilitate the associations’ indirect participation in the drafting of media laws and [[policy]].

==== Professionalization of regulatory bodies ====
According to the [[World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018]], there is a strong societal demand for the professionalization of regulatory and media bodies:

* Governmental alliances such as the [[Freedom Online Coalition]] and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] such as [[IFEX (organization)|IFEX]] and the [[Media Legal Defence Initiative]]
* [[Training]] of lawyers and judges are gaining popularity. UNESCO has provided training in this vein to 5,000 employees of the judicial sector in Latin America, and is commencing a similar initiative in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/courier/2017-april-june/training-judges-online-safeguard-journalists|title=Training Judges Online to Safeguard Journalists|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* There is also an increase in [[Educational technology|online training]] for journalism. [[Massive open online course|Massive Open Online Courses]] (MOOCs) and increased [[internet access]] in all regions of the world: There are a number of distance learning programs based in the United States and United Kingdom, such as the [[Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas|Knight Centre for Journalism in the Americas]], which also offers courses in Spanish serving countries in Latin America. The [[BBC Academy]] is another prominent example. The [[University of South Africa]] offers online degrees and short courses, including in media, to a global audience.
*[[Technology company|Technology companies]] are demonstrating a growing interest in these activities, particularly as they attempt to influence policy at a domestic level. [[Google]], [[Facebook]], and others have recently established policy offices also in Africa and the Arab region with a mandate to support the development of conducive policies and legal frameworks, as well as informed lawyers and policymakers, for their products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Journalistic standards ====

*[[Ethical code|Codes of ethics]] are a common way to promote journalistic standards. While there have been a number of codes of ethics for journalists that aspire to universal status, and even some for ‘[[Digital journalism|online journalists]]’ and [[blog]]gers, most transnational news agencies and broadcasters adhere to their own codes, although not all are publicly available.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* In most regions, newspapers have developed their own [[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]] with consistent values and standards that publishers and journalists should observe. Some newspapers have also appointed an [[ombudsman]] or readers’ representative to handle complaints from the public.
* In many countries, press councils and associations function like trade unions for journalists seeking to improve working conditions and to remove barriers journalists face when gathering news. 
* Depending on the country, independent press councils are formed on a non-statutory basis and in some cases, they are mandated by law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Donor priorities ====
[[File:Donors_priorities_in_media_development.png|thumb|313x313px|Donors priorities in media development, UNESCO]]
Donor support of [[media development]] and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] non-governmental organizations can vary widely. A report by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]]’s [[Center for International Media Assistance]] (CIMA) highlighted the swings in funding by tracking [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) funding to different regions over the past three years.&lt;ref&gt;Kalathil, Shanthi. 2017. A Slowly Shifting Field: Understanding Donor Priorities in Media Development. CIMA Digital Report. Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA). Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/publication/slowly-shifting-field/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Private foundation]]s based in the [[North–South divide|Global North]] are increasingly providing grants to media organizations in the Global South. Such funds are often directed to cover specific topics of interest, such as health or education, and these donations can either support or weaken [[editorial independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffrin, Anya. 2017a. Same Beds, Different Dreams? Charitable Foundations and Newsroom Independence in the Global South. Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA) &amp; National Endowment for Democracy. Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/resource/beds-different-dreams-charitable-foundations-newsroom-independence-global-south/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender equality ==

=== The media workplace ===
In the newsroom, women sometimes face hostility. This can be partly explained by the lack of organizational policies relating to [[gender equality]] and reporting mechanisms for [[harassment]]. The [[International Women's Media Foundation|International Women’s Media Foundation]]’s 2011 global study of [[Women in media|women in the news media]], found that more than half of the news media organizations surveyed had a company-wide policy on gender equality, but with significant variations between regions. More than two-thirds of organizations based in Western Europe and Africa had such policies, compared with a quarter in the Middle East and North Africa and less than 20 per cent in Central and Eastern European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF). Available at https://www.iwmf.org/resources/global-report-on-the-status-of-women-in-the-news-media/. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Institute for Gender Equality]]’s 2013 report, which looked at 99 major media houses across [[Europe]], found that a quarter of organizations had policies that included a provision for gender equality, often as part of broader equality directives in the society. It was notable that of the 99 organizations, public service bodies were much more likely than commercial ones to have equality policies in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/4d10b3c9-c97f-45a6-842c-c4003f743e70/language-en|title=European Institute for Gender Equality annual report 2013.|date=2015-03-17|website=publications.europa.eu|language=en|others=European Institute for Gender Equality|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media monitoring and advocacy ===

==== Regional organizations ====
Several regional gender monitoring initiatives exist. The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote "gender equality in and through the media" in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://genderlinks.org.za/what-we-do/sadc-gender-protocol/about-the-alliance-2/|title=About the Alliance - Gender Links|work=Gender Links|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender Links promotes media [[Advocacy journalism|advocacy]] through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gamag.net/|title=GAMAG – Global Alliance on Media and Gender|website=gamag.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender Links is currently developing [[Center of excellence|Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media]] in 108 newsrooms across Southern Africa and has established eight Centres of Excellence for Gender in Media Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://genderlinks.org.za/program/centres-of-excellence/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC), the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The ‘End News Media Sexism’ campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary approach]] and uses a variety of different tools to promote [[awareness]], including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://waccglobal.org/articles/wacc-launches-end-news-media-sexism-campaign|title=WACC Launches "End News Media Sexism" campaign|website=waccglobal.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FEMNET|African Women’s Development and Communication Network]] (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote [[Women's empowerment|women’s empowerment]] in Africa, prioritizes women’s development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local [[capacity building]] initiatives, such as facilitating women’s access to [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://femnet.org/|title=FEMNET - The African Women's Development and Communication Network|website=FEMNET - The African Women's Development and Communication Network|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, the South Asia Women’s Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled "Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia". Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO’s [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swaninterface.net/|title=South Asia Women's Network|website=www.swaninterface.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National organizations ====
A number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women’s representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its Arabic acronym TAM) is a [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter [[stereotype]]s of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women’s access to decision-making positions and civic participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tam.ps/en/|title=.:: TAM ::.|website=tam.ps|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional associations ===
Formal and informal networks of women media professionals support women in media. The [[Alliance for Women in Media]] (AWM), established in 1951 participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents. In 1975, it began its annual programme of awards to recognize the work of programme-makers and content-providers in promoting women and women's issues.

Marie Colvin Journalists' Network - a bilingual Arabic-English [[online community]] of women journalists working in the Arab world - aims to assist vulnerable women journalist who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or psychological care. The network links experienced journalists with new or isolated journalists for mentoring and peer-to-peer support, while also working closely with experts in media law, [[digital security]], and health and safety to ensure specialized advice and assistance.&lt;ref&gt;n.d. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Available at https://mariecolvinnetwork.org/en/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women’s representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women’s union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifj.org/press-room/publications-reports/browse/4/|title=Publications &amp; Reports: IFJ|website=www.ifj.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molecular drive''' is a term coined by [[Gabriel Dover]] in 1982 to describe [[evolution]]ary processes that change the genetic composition of a [[population]] through DNA turnover mechanisms.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/299111a0| title = Molecular drive: A cohesive mode of species evolution| journal = Nature| volume = 299| issue = 5879| pages = 111| year = 1982| last1 = Dover | first1 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trends&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(86)90211-8| title = Molecular drive in multigene families: How biological novelties arise, spread and are assimilated| journal = Trends in Genetics| volume = 2| pages = 159| year = 1986| last1 = Dover | first1 = G.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular drive operates independently of [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]].

The best-known such process is the [[concerted evolution]] of [[gene]]s present in many tandem copies, such as those for [[ribosomal RNA]]s or [[Bombyx mori|silk moth]] egg shell [[chorion]] proteins, in [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species. The concept has been proposed to extend to the diversification of [[Protein family|multigene families]].&lt;ref name=trends/&gt; The mechanisms involved include [[gene conversion]], [[unequal crossing-over]], [[Transposon|transposition]], [[slipped strand mispairing|slippage replication]] and RNA-mediated exchanges. Because [[mutation]]s changing the sequence of one copy are less common than [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Gene duplication|duplications]] and replacement of one copy by another, the copies gradually come to resemble each other much more than they would if they had been evolving independently.

Concerted evolution can be unbiased, in which case every version has an equal probability of being the one that replaces the others.  However, if the molecular events have any bias favouring one version of the sequence over others, that version will dominate the process and eventually replace the others.  The name 'molecular drive' reflects the similarity of the process with what was originally the better-known process of [[meiotic drive]].

Molecular drive can also act in [[bacteria]], where parasexual processes such as natural [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] cause DNA turnover.

== TRAM ==
According to [[Gabriel Dover|Dover]], '''TRAM''' is a genetic system that has features of [[Non-mendelian inheritance]] '''T'''urnover, copy number and functional '''R'''edundancy '''A'''nd '''M'''odulatory. To date all regulatory regions ([[promotor (biology)|promoter]]s) and [[gene]]s, that have been examined in detail at the molecular level, have TRAM characteristics. As such, part of their evolutionary history will have been influenced by the molecular drive process.

== Adoptation ==
According to [[Gabriel Dover|Dover]], '''Adoptation''' is an evolved feature of an organism that contributes to its viability and reproduction (established by molecular drive) and that adopts some previously inaccessible component of the environment.

In [[Hindu iconography]], '''Mukhalinga''' or '''Mukhalingam''' (literally "''linga with a face''", {{IAST|mukhaliṅga}}) is a [[linga]] with one or more human faces. The linga is an aniconic representation of the Hindu god [[Shiva]]. Mukhalingas may be of stone or can be made of a metal sheath, which covers the normal linga.

The mukhalinga generally has one, four or five faces. Mukhalingas having four faces are also regarded to have an invisible fifth face at the top of the linga. The four- and five-faced mukhalingas represent the five aspects of Shiva, which also relate to the classical elements and the cardinal directions.

The omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient God Siva for facilitating the individual souls to worship him has manifested himself into different forms.Among them the formless form of Sivalinga is classified as "Nishkala". And the Shivalingas with the head of Shiva on their face are called as Mukhalinga and are classified as "Sakala nishkala" form.&lt;ref name="alayam"&gt;ALAYAM : The Hindu Temple;An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.Venkataramana Reddy; Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Ramakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}} ; Page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography of stone Mukhalingas in texts==
The iconography and making of the mukhalinga is prescribed in the [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and the [[Tantras]].&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"&gt;Rao pp. 86-88&lt;/ref&gt; These sculptured lingas fall under the classification of ''manusha-linga'' ("man-made lingas"), the other category being [[Swayambhu]] or naturally occurring lingas.&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"/&gt; A ''manusha-linga'' has three parts: the ''Brahma-bhaga'', the lowest part of the linga which is a square platform; ''Vishnu-bhaga'' - the middle section of the linga with a pedestal or ''pitha'' and ''Rudra-bhaga'', the topmost part of the central shaft with a rounded tip.&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"/&gt; Mukhalinga should be ''sarvasama'' ("all-equal"), where the three parts are equal. On the topmost ''rudra-bhaga'' or ''puja-bhaga'', one face and a maximum of five faces may be carved. If the sanctum (''[[garbhagriha]]'') has only one door, then the linga should have only one face on the front (the east), facing the door. In case of two doors, it should have two faces - front and back - facing the doors in the east and the west. In case of three doors, the linga should have three faces, except in the west. When the shrine has four doors, the linga may have four or five faces. The four faces should face the doors in the four cardinal directions; in addition if a fifth face exists, it should be carved on the top and face the front, the east. When mukhalinga is four-faced, instead of only faces, the [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]]s of the deities are carved on the four side; each having two arms.&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"/&gt;

The stone mukhalingas may be depicted comprising just of the central shaft, but may be part of the full assemble, where the shaft is embedded in the ''pitha'' pedestal, denoting the [[yoni]], the female sexual organ.&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kossak143"&gt;Kossak p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

==Mukhalingas as metal sheaths==

A normal linga may be converted into a mukhalinga by covering with a ''kavacha'' ("armour"), a metal (generally gold) covering carved in the shape of the head of Shiva. It has displays the [[third eye]] of Shiva on the forehead, the crescent moon over his head and a crown.&lt;ref name="Daniélou1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Alain Daniélou]]|title=The Phallus: Sacred Symbol of Male Creative Power|date=1995|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-1-59477-731-8|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The covering or sheath is also known as a ''kosha'' or ''linga-kosha'', and can be called of metal alloys, gold or silver or&lt;ref name="HardyCucarzi2009"/&gt; copper.&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt; Another form of cover is carved in shape of a linga, with a rounded top, with four faces carved on four sides.&lt;ref name="Pal1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pratapaditya Pal|title=Art of Nepal: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zt9e6Ttr_IcC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 January 1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05407-3|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-faced Mukhalinga==
The one-faced mukhalinga is called ''eka-mukhalinga'', "linga with a single face". The face is created in high relief. He wears his hair piled on his head like a bun, while longer hair flow over his shoulders.&lt;ref name="Kossak94"&gt;Kossak p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; He may also wear earrings and a necklace and have the crescent moon on his head and the third eye on the forehead.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; The faces of Shiva are carved generally from the ear onwards, emerging from the linga.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch178"&gt;Kramrisch  p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four/Five-faced Mukhalinga==

[[File:Mukhalingam from Kunnath Thali mahadeva TempleDSC 2043.jpg|Mukhalinga from Kunnath Thali Mahadeva Temple Kerala|thumb|right]]
The five-faced mukhalinga is called ''pancha-mukhalinga''. The five faces relate Shiva to the classical elements, the directions, the five senses and five parts of the body. These represent Shiva's five aspects: [[Sadyojata]], [[Vamadeva]], [[Bhairava|Aghora]], [[Tatpurusha]] and [[Ishana]].&lt;ref name="Daniélou1995"/&gt; A four-faced linga is said also to represent the five aspects of Shiva, the fifth aspect is center, the shaft itself or is assumed to be emerging from the top of the shaft and denotes the [[Nirguna Brahman|formless Absolute]].&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal1985"/&gt; Thus, a four-faced mukhalinga can be also called a ''pancha-mukhalinga'' ("linga with five faces" of Shiva).&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt; These four-faced lingas are the most commonly found mukhalingas.

The 13th Century A.D. pancha mukha sivalinga is in Kalahasti, [[Andhra Pradesh]].The fifth face would not be shown to highlight the Nishkala character of Sivalinga.&lt;ref&gt;ALAYAM : The Hindu Temple;An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.Venkataramana Reddy;  Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Ramakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}} ; Page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The top face is known as Ishana or Sadashiva, who is rarely depicted and governs zenith and the sky ([[Akasha]]). The east face is Sadyojata or Mahadeva, the regent of the earth ([[Prithvi]]). The west face is Tatpurusha or [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] (Shiva's bull mount) or Nandivaktra (the face of Nandi), denoting the wind, [[Vayu]]. While Vamadeva or Uma ([[Parvati]], Shiva's consort) or Umavaktra (the face of Parvati) or Tamreshvara (water, [[Ap (water)|Ap]]) faces north, Aghora or [[Bhairava]] looks south (fire, [[Agni]]). In some texts, the east face is called Tatpurusha and the western one Sadyojata.&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kossak139"&gt;Kossak p.139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal1985"/&gt; The icon of the five aspects represents the entire universe.&lt;ref name="Pal1985"/&gt;

In Nepal, the four aspects have similar faces. They wear similar crowns and hairstyles and have Shiva's third eye. Mahadeva may have a moustache and has matted hair piled up on his head. Nandi bears on the forehead the sectarian mark ([[tilaka]]) of the [[Shaiva]]s (worshippers of Shiva) and floral earrings. The face of [[Uma (goddess)|Uma]] also bears the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] mark and depicts Shiva as [[Ardhanarishvara]], the composite androgynous form of Shiva and Parvati. The right half is the male Shiva with a moustache, while the left half is the female Parvati; the eyes, the lips, the earrings (a serpent and floral earring) as well as the sides of the crown may differ in the halves. [[Bhairava]], the terrible form of Shiva, is generally depicted angry; however may have a gentler expression. He wears serpent-earrings or asymmetrical earrings and has curled hair. All of them are depicted with two hands, carrying a [[akshamala]] (rosary) in the right and a water pot in the left. The rosary-bearing hand is held in [[abhayamudra]], gesture of assurance. The rosary signifies Death or Time, while the water-pot stands for its antithesis, ''[[amrita]]'', the elixir of life. The hands indicates that Shiva will lead his devotees to [[moksha]], emancipation.&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal1985"/&gt;

Eight faced shivalinga is located at Mandsaur (Madhya Pradesh) along the banks of River Shivana locally known as "Ashtamukhi Pashupatinath" which is claimed to be unique in terms of its sculpture. The eight faces carved on the lingam exhibit eight moods / facial expressions facing the four directions , two each in one direction placed one above the other.

==Evolution==
Mukhalingas are found throughout India&lt;ref name="Daniélou1995"/&gt; and Nepal.&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt; They also appear in the former [[Champa]] kingdom, presently in [[Vietnam]] as well as [[Cambodia]] and [[Borneo]] in the south east Asia&lt;ref name="HardyCucarzi2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew David Hardy|author2=Mauro Cucarzi|author3=Patrizia Zolese|title=Champa and the Archaeology of Mỹ Sơn (Vietnam)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fj8l8v_yP5oC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2009|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=978-9971-69-451-7|pages=138, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1961/JSS_054_1e_OConnor_EkamukhalingaFromPeninsularSiam.pdf | title=AN EKAMUKHALINGA FROM PENINSULAR SIAM | publisher=The Siam Society | work=The Journal of the Siam Society | date=1961 | accessdate=2 July 2014 | author=O'Connor, S.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Afghanistan to the west of India.&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philippe De Montebello|title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide|year=1994|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-710-5|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of earliest specimen of a mukhalinga is a five-faced one in Bhita, which is dated to second century BCE.

[[Alain Daniélou]] says that mukhalingas of Shiva resemble similar depictions of phalluses with carved faces from Greece and those from [[Celts|Celtic]] Europe. He also notes the phalluses with full human figures are also found in France and India, citing the second-century icon of [[Gudimallam]] as an early example.&lt;ref name="Daniélou1995"/&gt;

'''Nanowood''' is heat-insulating material made from wood that is considered a slightly better insulator than [[Styrofoam]]. Unlike Styrofoam, the material is more environmentally friendly and [[biodegradable]]. It is considered light, strong and created entirely from stripped-down wood fibers.&lt;ref name="phys_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' an invention that could reduce humanity's carbon footprint| author = Khan, Amina| work = phys.org| date = 2018-03-12| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://phys.org/news/2018-03-nanowood-humanity-carbon-footprint.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The material was invented by engineer, Liangbing Hu and his team at [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. The material "when exposed to the solar spectrum" reflected approximately 95% of radiation energy absorbing only approximately 2%. Silica aerogel "absorbed approximately 20% and transmits approximately 60% of the radiative heat" according to study authors.&lt;ref name="lati_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' a new invention that could greatly reduce humanity's carbon footprint| last = Khan | first = Amina| work = latimes.com| date = 10 March 2018| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-nanowood-20180309-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanowood could potentially save "billions in energy costs" according to Tian Li, a team member.&lt;ref name="smit_Coul"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Could 'Nanowood' Replace Styrofoam?| last = Matchar | first = Emily| work = Smithsonian| date = 2018-03-26| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/could-nanowood-replace-styrofoam-180968575/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''no-win situation''', also called a “'''lose-lose situation'''”, is one where a person has choices, but no choice leads to a net gain. For example, if an executioner offers the condemned the choice of death by being hanged, shot, or poisoned, all choices lead to death; the condemned is in a no-win situation. This bleak situation gives the chooser no room: whichever choice is made the person making it will lose their life. Less drastic situations may also be considered no-win situations - if one has a choice for lunch between a [[ham]] [[ham sandwich|sandwich]] and a [[roast beef]] [[roast beef sandwich|sandwich]], but is a [[vegetarian]] or has a [[wheat allergy]], that might also be considered a no-win situation.

==In game theory==
In [[game theory]], a "no-win" situation is one in which no player benefits from any outcome. This may be because of any or all  of the following:
* Unavoidable or unforeseeable circumstances causing the situation to change after decisions have been made. This is common in [[text adventure]]s.
* [[Zugzwang]], as in [[chess]], when any move a player chooses makes him worse off than before.
* A situation in which the player has to accomplish two mutually dependent tasks [[Deadlock|each of which must be completed before the other]] or that are mutually exclusive (a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]).
* Ignorance of other players' actions, meaning the best decision for all differs from that for any one player (as in the [[prisoner's dilemma]]).

==In history==
[[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s advice (never to launch a [[war]] that one has not already won) characterizes war as a no-win situation. A similar example is the [[Pyrrhic victory]], in which a military victory is so costly that the winning side actually ends up worse off than before it started. Looking at the victory as a part of a larger situation, the situation could either be no-win, or more of a win for the other side than the one that won the "victory", or victory at such cost that the gains are outweighed by the cost and are no longer a source of joy.

For example, the "victorious" side may have accomplished their objective, but the objective may have been worthless, or they may lose a strategic advantage in manpower or positioning. (One example is Great Britain in WWII, where Britain was one of the victorious powers, but found itself so exhausted in the process as to no longer be able to maintain its great power status in a world now dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union.) A related concept is sometimes described as winning the battle but losing the war, where a lesser (sub-) objective is won but the true objective beyond it is not well pursued and is lost.

In past [[Europe]], those accused of being [[witches]] were sometimes bound and then thrown or dunked in water to test their innocence. A witch would float (by calling upon the Devil to save her from drowning), and then be executed; but a woman not a witch would drown (proving her innocence but causing her death).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A6358926 BBC - h2g2 - Matthew Hopkins, 'Witchfinder General' of East Anglia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In video games ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2015}}
'''Unwinnable''' is a state in many [[text adventure]]s, graphical [[adventure game]]s and [[role-playing video game]]s where it is impossible for the player to win the game (either due to a [[Software bug|bug]] or by design), and where the only options are restarting the game, loading a previously saved game, wandering indefinitely, or a [[game over]] (negative game end, such as death). It is also known as a '''dead end''' situation. Usually, this is the result of the player's previous choices, and not due to the game itself lacking a path to victory. For example, in games such as ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Goldeneye 007]]'', ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', and ''[[TimeSplitters (video game)|TimeSplitters]]'', the level does not end once a player fails an objective short of being killed, but it is impossible to progress to the next level no matter what the player does afterwards. Other games take steps to ''avoid'' unwinnable situations; for example, a game may not allow players to drop items which are necessary to continue.

''Unwinnable'' should not be confused with ''unbeatable'', which is used to describe a character, monster, or puzzle that is too powerful or difficult to be overcome by the player or character at a lower standing, and is normally found in [[role-playing video game]]s. In many cases, "unbeatable" gamestates occur because of [[integer overflow]] or other errors programmers did not take into account, called a [[kill screen]]. In this situation, the game may also crash.

== In other media ==
In the film ''[[WarGames]]'', the supercomputer [[WOPR]] simulates all possible games of [[tic-tac-toe]] as a metaphor for all possible scenarios of a [[nuclear war]], each of them ending in a [[nuclear holocaust]] ([[mutual assured destruction]]). The computer then exclaims, "A strange game; the only winning move is not to play."

In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' canon, the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' simulation is a no-win scenario designed as a character test for command track cadets at [[Starfleet Academy]]. It first appears in the film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. In the film, Admiral [[James T. Kirk]] states that he does not believe in the no-win scenario.

In the TV show ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]'', the agents are put in a terrorist hijack flight simulation mission that is unbeatable.

where ''h'' is the vertical displacement from the top of the dome to a point on the dome, ''r'' is the [[geodesic]] distance from the dome's apex to that point (in other words, a radial coordinate ''r'' is "inscribed" on the surface),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/Goodies/Dome/ John Norton's webpage for the Norton dome problem]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''g'' the acceleration due to gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''Causal Determinism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton shows that there are two classes of mathematical solutions to the system under Newtonian physics. In the first, the particle stays sitting at the apex of the dome forever. In the second, the particle sits at the apex of the dome for a while, and then after an arbitrary period of time starts to slide down the dome in an arbitrary direction. The apparent paradox in this second case is that this would seem to occur for no discernible reason, and without any radial force being exerted on it by any other entity, apparently contrary to both physical intuition and normal intuitive concepts of [[causality|cause and effect]], yet the motion is still entirely consistent with the mathematics of [[Newton's laws of motion]].

While many criticisms have been made of Norton's thought experiment, such as it being a violation of the principle of [[Lipschitz continuity]] (the 2nd solution type, where the ball starts rolling after an arbitrary period of time, is not Lipschitz continuous), or in violation of the principles of [[symmetry (physics)|physical symmetry]]{{cn|date=February 2018}}, or that it is somehow in some other way "unphysical"{{cn|date=February 2018}}, there is no consensus among its critics as to why they regard it as invalid.

A '''nuisance fee''' is a [[fee]], [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], or [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]] which is [[Security interest|charged]] to deter an action, rather than to compensate for the costs of that action.  For example, a five-dollar penalty for submitting an application late does not compensate for costs associated with processing late submissions, but rather encourages people to submit on time.

The '''Open Energy Modelling Initiative''' ('''openmod''') is a [[Grassroots|grass roots]] community of [[energy system]] modellers from universities and research institutes across Europe and elsewhere.  The initiative promotes the use of [[open-source software]] and [[open data]] in [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|modelling]] for research and policy advice.  The Open Energy Modelling Initiative documents a variety of open-source energy models and addresses practical and conceptual issues regarding their development and application.  The initiative runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]], an [[internet forum]], and a [[wiki]] and hosts occasional academic workshops.  A statement of aims is available.&lt;ref name="openmod-manifesto"/&gt;

== Context ==

The application of [[open-source software development|open-source development]] to energy modelling dates back to around 2010.  This section provides some background for the growing interest in open methods.

=== Growth in open energy modelling ===

Just two active open energy modelling projects were cited in a 2011 paper: OSeMOSYS and TEMOA.&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  Balmorel was also open at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
NEMO was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}
{{as of|November 2016}}, the openmod wiki lists 24 such undertakings.&lt;ref name="openmod-models-page"/&gt;

=== Academic literature ===

An innovative 2012 paper presents the case for using "open, publicly accessible software and data as well as [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to develop robust energy analysis tools".&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|149}}  The paper claims that these techniques can produce high-quality results and are particularly relevant for developing countries.

There is an increasing call for the energy models and [[dataset]]s used for [[energy policy]] analysis and advice to be made public in the interests of transparency and quality.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;  A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010b"/&gt;  One 2012 study argues that the [[source code]] and datasets used in such models should be placed under publicly accessible [[version control]] to enable third-parties to run and check specific models.&lt;ref name="DeCarolisEtal2012"/&gt;  Another 2014 study argues that the public trust needed to underpin a rapid transition in energy systems can only be built through the use of transparent open-source energy models.&lt;ref name="wiese-etal-2014"/&gt;  The UK TIMES project (UKTM) is open source, according to a 2014 presentation, because "energy modelling must be replicable and verifiable to be considered part of the scientific process" and because this fits with the "drive towards clarity and quality assurance in the provision of policy insights".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|8}}  In 2016, the [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) is seeking to improve its modelling methodologies, a key motivation being "the intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility."&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"/&gt;{{rp|S27}}  A 2016 paper argues that model-based energy scenario studies, wishing to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a checklist of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors note however that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  An editorial from 2016 opines that closed energy models providing public policy support "are inconsistent with the open access movement [and] {{sic|public|ally|expected=publicly}} funded research".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.  The paper makes a number of recommendations for projects wishing to transition to a more open approach.  The authors also conclude that, in terms of openness, energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;  Moreover:

{{quote|Given the importance of rapid global coordinated action on climate mitigation and the clear benefits of shared research efforts and transparently reproducible policy analysis, openness in energy research should not be for the sake of having some code or data available on a website, but as an initial step towards fundamentally better ways to both conduct our research and engage decision-makers with [our] models and the assumptions embedded within them.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|214}}}}

A one-page opinion piece in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature News]]'' from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for scrutiny, currently only ''[[Energy Economics (journal)|Energy Economics]]'' makes this practice mandatory within the energy domain.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

=== Copyright and open energy data ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  Most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources, for example, [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  The doctrine of open data requires that these datasets be available under [[Copyright#Free licenses|free licenses]] (such as [[Creative Commons license|{{nowrap|CC BY 4.0}}]]) or be in the [[public domain]].  But most published energy datasets carry proprietary licenses, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped because the associated information is normally licensed to preclude downstream usage.  Recent transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"/&gt; and a 2016 amendment to the German Energy Industry Act{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="enwg-111d-2016"/&gt; to establish a nation energy information platform, slated to launch on 1{{nbsp}}July 2017.  Energy databases are protected under general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the copyright status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;

In December 2017, participants from the Open Energy Modelling Initiative and allied research communities made a written submission to the [[European Commission]] on the {{nowrap|re-use}} of [[public sector information]].&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"/&gt;  The document provides a comprehensive account of the data issues faced by researchers engaged in open energy system modeling and energy market analysis and quoted extensively from a German legal opinion.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;

=== Public policy support ===

In May 2016 the [[European Union]] announced that "all scientific articles in Europe must be freely accessible as of 2020".&lt;ref name="hendrikx-2016"/&gt;  This is a step in the right direction, but the new policy makes no mention of open software and its importance to the scientific process.&lt;ref name="albers-2016"/&gt;  In August 2016, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] announced a new federal [[source code]] policy which mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government be released as [[open-source software]] (OSS).&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] (DOE) is participating in the program.  The project is hosted on a dedicated website and subject to a three-year pilot.&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="code-gov-website"/&gt;  Open-source campaigners are using the initiative to advocate that European governments adopt similar practices.&lt;ref name="new-2016"/&gt;  In 2017 the [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE) issued a [[position paper]] calling for free software and open standards to be central to European science funding, including the flagship [[European Union|EU]] program [[Horizon 2020|Horizon{{nbsp}}2020]].  The position paper focuses on open data and open data processing and the question of open modeling is not traversed per{{nbsp}}se.&lt;ref name="gkotsopoulou-etal-2017"/&gt;

'''Participatory justice''', broadly speaking, refers to the direct participation of those affected most by a particular decision, in the decision-making process itself: this could refer to decisions made in a court of law or by policymakers. Popular participation has been called "the ethical seal of a democratic society" by [[Friedhelm Hengsbach]], a professor of Christian Social Science and Economic and Social Ethics at the Philosophical-Theological College Sankt Georgen in Frankfurt&lt;ref name="Hengsbach"&gt;Hengsbach, Friedhelm (S.J.), "Participatory Justice", essay, n.d., found at [http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2004/03/282037.shtml Portland Independent Media website]. Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the politics of the future" by Gene Stephens, professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina.&lt;ref name="stephens19862"&gt;Stephens, Gene, "Participatory justice: The politics of the future," ''[[Justice Quarterly]]'', March 1986, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 67-82(16), [[Abstract (law)|abstract]] found at [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rjqy/1986/00000003/00000001/art00005 Ingenta Connect website].

Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authors have claimed that examples of participatory justice date back to civilizations as old as that of the Canadian Aboriginals and Ancient Athenians, even if the terminology had not been in use then.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=Peter|date=May 1977|title=The Administration of Justice in Ancient Athens and in Plato's Laws- Some Comparisons|url=|journal=Politics|volume=12:1|pages=116–120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-crowdjury/the-crowdjury-a-crowdsourced-court-system-for-the-collaboration-era-66da002750d8|title=The Crowdjury, a Crowdsourced Judicial System for the Collaboration Era|last=Ast|first=Federico|last2=Sewrjugin|first2=Alejandro|date=November  2015|website=The Crowdjury: A Judicial System for the Internet Era|publisher=A Medium Corporation|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giuduce|first=Michael|date=2006|title=Asymmetrical Attitudes and Participatory Justice|url=|journal=Cardozo Public Law, Policy and Ethics Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Myth of Moral Justice: Why Our Legal System Fails to do What's Right|last=Rosenbaum|first=Thane|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the society of Canadian Aboriginals, citizens were given the opportunity to give their own account of a dispute in public and determine the proper course of action, which sometimes involved issuing a public apology.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Elders were viewed as authorities due to their unique knowledge of the circumstances of community members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In ancient Athens, large popular courts, made up of 200 to 1000 randomly selected male citizens, shared in both functions of forming and of applying the law.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The term "participatory justice" itself, however, was first used by Bellevue, Washington-based attorney Claire Sherman Thomas in 1984 to describe the process by which people act as responsible participants in the law making process, thereby contributing to causes of social justice.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Claire Sherman|date=1984|title=The Common Law Jury: An Essential Component of Participatory Social Justice|url=|journal=ALSA F.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Gene Stephens first used the term to describe an alternative to the adversarial model of justice system used in court.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;

Both definitions of participatory justice relate to the concept of [[participatory democracy]], which shares similar aspirations: to provide the government with democratic legitimacy and make for a more inclusive, transparent, equal society, by allowing citizens to participate directly in political decision-making and lawmaking processes that affect their lives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Gene|date=1996|title=The Future of Policing: From a War Model to a Peace Model.|url=|journal=The Past, Present, and Future of Criminal Justice|volume=|pages=77–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare cases, it also refers to the use of [[the Internet]] or a [[television]] [[reality show]] to catch a [[perpetrator]].&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;"Participatory justice," review, February 19, 2008, found at [http://www.connectsafely.org/nfn/netfamilynews/participatory-justice.html Connect Safely website]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, citing Ganzer, Tony, "YouTube's Crime-Fighting Potential Put to Test," [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), found at [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18334702 NPR story from NPR official website].

==Judicial system==

===Overview===

Participatory justice can refer to the use of [[alternative dispute resolution]], such as [[mediation]], [[conciliation]], and [[arbitration]], in criminal and civil courts, instead of, or before, going to court.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barreaudemontreal.qc.ca/en/avocats/participatory-justice|title=Participatory justice {{!}} Barreau de Montréal|website=www.barreaudemontreal.qc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called "community dispute resolution".&lt;ref name="NYCourts"&gt;New York State Unified Court System, "Alternative Dispute Resolution: Community Dispute Resolution Centers: Frequently Asked Questions", found at [http://www.nycourts.gov/ip/adr/faq.shtml New York State Unified Court System government website].  Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs ([[Non-governmental organizations]]) may get involved in the administration of criminal justice.&lt;ref name="NYCourts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conference20032"&gt;Conference brochure, "Participatory Justice in a Global Economy: The New Rule of Law?", October 2003, Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, found at Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice (CIAJ) website Archived 2004-11-21 at the Wayback Machine.. Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Advisory Commission of Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, delays in sentencing and lack of protection of rights of the accused contribute to attitudes of legal cynicism.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; According to a large cohort of citizens, the guilty are freed while the innocent, and often the black and poor, are harassed.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; The participatory justice model, in turn, attempts to restore public confidence in the legal system.

Whereas the adversarial and disposition system is often slow-functioning, expensive, and inconsistent, the participatory justice model is a cheap and efficient way of resolution-making.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYCourts" /&gt; Rather than rely on expensive attorneys and expert witnesses, the model relies on volunteers from the community, who are trained in mediation and counseling techniques.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; The resolution is often achieved quicker, because, by reaching a consent agreement implemented by all parties involved, there is no possibility of re-litigation.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; In the participatory justice model, cooperation is valued instead of competition and reconciliation instead of winner-take-all. The need to protect the public and to respect the rights of ordinary citizens to a free but secure society are considered.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; This in turn helps preserve positive relationships between the parties involved.&lt;ref name="NYCourts" /&gt; In modern-day Canada, for instance, community members are involved in almost every step of the judicial process, even before people are arrested and sent to court; community organizations establish working partnerships with police to focus attention on growing social problems, like child abandonment or housing code violations, and prevent crime.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Not only does the participatory justice model promote inclusion, according to several authors, but also socioeconomic equality. The adversarial/dispositional system requires enforcing laws that often represent the will of those with the most educational and monetary resources.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; As Stephens points out, most people who are perpetrators in a particular incident, whether civil or criminal, had also been victims at some point, so every person’s circumstances should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; Stahn mentions the importance of consulting victims at the reparation stage to determine whether they really believe the person who committed the crime against them is deserving of incarceration.&lt;ref name="stahn20152"&gt;“Reparative Justice after the Lubanga Appeal Judgment: New Prospects for Expressivism and Participatory Justice or ‘Juridified Victimhood’ by Other Means?” Journal of International Criminal Justice, 13(4), pgs. 801-813&lt;/ref&gt; Once used primarily in [[Scandinavia]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]], participatory justice has been "exported" to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Prison&gt;[[Nils Christie|Christie, Nils]], "Limits to Pain", "Chapter 11. Participatory justice," found at [http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/limits_to_pain/chapter11.html Prison Policy website]. Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Peter, and Alice Pell, "North-South partnerships," presentation, SEDPU (Sufficiency Economy, Participatory Development, and Universities), 2003 conference, found at [http://www.sepdu.com/powerpoint/Session5_Calkins.pdf SEDPU website]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, participatory justice serves as a crucial check on state power, that legitimizes the rule of law itself. As long as citizens believe in their ability to contribute to the law making and evaluation process, public consensus supports the rule of law.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Without consensus, the government must rely on the letter of the law and threat of prosecution to maintain order; the government might resort to censorship and surveillance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The law becomes "instead of a vehicle of justice, the instrument of a bureaucratic, institutionalized, dehumanized government."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Therefore, by reducing legal cynicism in communities, participatory justice effectively decreases the likelihood that the state will respond to this cynicism through use of overly punitive justice.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Once used primarily in Scandinavia, Asia, and Africa, participatory justice has been "exported" to the United States and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Dal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIAJ"&gt;Conference brochure, "Participatory Justice in  a Global Economy: The New Rule of Law?", October 2003, Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, found at [http://www.ciaj-icaj.ca/english/community/Banff2003E.pdf Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice (CIAJ) website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121002822/http://www.ciaj-icaj.ca/english/community/Banff2003E.pdf |date=2004-11-21 }}.  Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used in a variety of cases, including between                   "[[Landlord]]s and Tenants, Neighbours, Parents and Children, Families and Schools, Consumers and Merchants ... [and] [[Victimology|victims of crime]] and offenders."&lt;ref name="NYCourts" /&gt; For war-torn countries, participatory justice can promote coexistence and reconciliation, through an emphasis on universal participation.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stahn20152" /&gt;

An online and self-financed form of participatory justice, called the crowdjury system, has been promoted as an improved way of managing trials in the future.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Witnesses to a crime can upload evidence online into a secure vault.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Data can then be organized into useful knowledge by groups of 9 to 12 self-selected volunteers with expertise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If a defendant pleads guilty, they can propose a form of restoration, as a way to avoid harsher punishment; if they do not plead, an online trial will be held with a massive randomly-selected jury.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Participants in the evidence review process will receive monetary compensation through Bitcoin or alt coin.  According to crowdjury's proponents, this will help the government cut costs and create a more transparent judicial process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Critics of the participatory justice model cite its purpose to often humiliate a particular party.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Inkiko-Gacaca, a system of community courts established in 2002 to respond to the large number of suspected perpetrators imprisoned after the 1994 Rwandan genocide, is a famous example.&lt;ref name="Waldorf2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldorf|first=LT|date=2006|title=Rwanda's Failing Experiment in Restorative Justice|url=|journal=Handbook of Restorative Justice: A Global Perspective|volume=|pages=422-434|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cobban2002a&gt;“The legacies of collective violence: the Rwandan genocide and the limits of the law,” Boston Review, 27(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Meant to achieve lasting peace through the promotion of restorative justice, Gacaca, according to several authors, has only become more retributive and coercive.&lt;ref name="Waldorf2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cobban2002a/&gt;&lt;ref name=cobban2002b&gt;“Helena Cobban Replies”, Boston Review, 27(3-4), online&lt;/ref&gt; Through the process, Tutsi genocide survivors allegedly impose guilt on the Hutu, asking them to confess their deeds, express apologies to all victims and kin, and repay them tangibly, through public shaming.&lt;ref name=cobban2002a/&gt;&lt;ref name=cobban2002b/&gt; The participatory justice model has also been critiqued for its lack of checks and balances and lack of participation of professional experts.&lt;ref name= Williams1987&gt;C Williams, Victim-Offender Mediation in New Law Journal, London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Because the negotiators are usually not trained in the collection of evidence and are not privy to the criminal background of the alleged offender, the resolution may be made without full facts and knowledge. Furthermore, the offender's motivation is difficult to assess if the alternative is more formal punishment.

==Legislative system==
===Overview===

Participatory justice can also refer to the rights of individuals and groups to actively participate in policy-making and engage in debates about social justice.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tikly|first=Leon|last2=Barrett|first2=Angeline M.|date=2011|title=Social Justice, Capabilities and the Quality of Education in Low Income Countries|url=|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=31 |issue=1|pages=3–14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a participatory justice model, rule makers rely on the participation of affected interests rather than on administrators, politicians, and the general population. This often leads to the redistribution of resources and recognition of those whose voices have historically been excluded, due in part to a lack of financial and educational resources to contribute.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

The Negotiated Rulemaking Act made it a priority to ensure that people most affected by a particular issue, particularly poor people, would be able to take part in the negotiation process; the government provides agency funding to defray costs of participation in rulemaking.&lt;ref name="farrell19912"&gt;"Doing Unto Others: A Proposal for Participatory Justice in Social Security's Representative Payment Program. U. Pitt. L. Rev, 1991, 53, 883.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving marginalized groups the chance to participate in the decision making process can help ensure they participate in the community more generally as well. For example, during the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), disabled peoples organizations (DPOs) were engaged in and consulted during the drafting of a comprehensive program that would enable the disabled to participate in the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural life of the community.&lt;ref name="stein20072"&gt;Stein, M.A., &amp; Lord, J.E. "Jacobus TenBroek, Participatory Justice, and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities." Tex. J. on CL &amp; CR, 2007, 13, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, within the CRPD, states were encouraged to involve DPOs when preparing reports for the body meant to monitor the implementation of the program.&lt;ref name="stein20072" /&gt;

Arguments supporting various participatory justice models in the U.S. have also cited the equal protection clause 14th amendment, protection of individual legal rights, upholding of autonomy, integrationism, and democratic principles in their support.&lt;ref name="farrell19912" /&gt; Participatory justice models are seen as a way to fight against the paternalistic approach of the government in which legislators choose for citizens, without their input.&lt;ref name="stein20072" /&gt;&lt;ref name="farrell19912" /&gt; When affected individuals can participate in the policymaking process, they become viewed as subjects rather than objects.&lt;ref name="stein20072" /&gt;

Consensus rule is more administratively efficient in the long run because it avoids lengthy post-enactment litigation. The legislature or administrative body using the participatory justice model also gains legitimacy, since it implies accountability. Participatory justice models have long been used by environmental justice movements. Often times, participation was originally denied not because of institutional or political failure, but because those in question aren’t recognized as in the domain of justice.&lt;ref name="jamieson20072"&gt;Jaieson, D."The heart of environmentalism." Environmental Justice and Environmentalism: The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement, MIT Press, Cambridge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Young argues that participatory justice rather than distributive justice was the primary demand of communities like Afton, North Carolina. People objected that they were being subjected to risks and exposure without their consent and without mechanisms to articulate their opposition. The unfortunate reality is that those people who live in countries that will be destroyed first due to rising sea levels will not be included in decisions about when decisions are made.

===Criticisms===

One of the common criticisms of participatory justice models is that they might reduce efficiency, like in the environmental justice model discussed.&lt;ref name="Kaswan20092"&gt;Kaswan, A. "Justice in a Warming World." Environmental Forum, 26(4), 2009, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating the voices of all affected interests is a difficult and long process, especially when the issue being decided upon is significantly controversial.&lt;ref name="farrell19912" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaswan20092" /&gt; Another disadvantage is that, even when you have a negotiating body and it does include affected interests, it might be difficult for all interests to be equally represented.&lt;ref name="farrell19912" /&gt; This problem, however, can be fixed by providing those negotiating with negotiation skills, as well as development of relevant information and payment of expenses involved in participation, like in the PJ model employed SSA's representative payment program.  Another disadvantage of using a participatory justice model is the inexperience of those participating. The participants may not have as much respect for the wide number of legal and ethical considerations that need to be made when writing policy proposals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For this reason, some critics argue that policy experts should be able to mediate the conversations on various policies, especially when modern laws are much more complex than those in places like ancient Athens, where laws were inscribed on panels all over the city and set up in the agora.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Kihchwey. pp. 40+.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lyman, Hamilton Wright Mabie, Ernest Hamlin Abbott, and Francis Rufus Bellamy. ''The Outlook''. New York: Outlook Co, 1898. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=rkUAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA465 Expansion not Imperialism]" p. 465. (''cf''. [...] Felix Adler [states ...] "if, instead of establishing the Pax Americana so far as our influence avails throughout this continent, we should enter into' the field of Old World strife, and seek the sort of glory that is written in human blood." Here it is assumed that we have failed in establishing self-government, and propose to substitute, at least in other lands, an Old World form of government. This sort of argument has no effect on the expansionist, because he believes that we have magnificently succeeded in our problem, in spite of failures, neglects, and violations of our own principles, and because what he wishes to do is, not to abandon the experiment, but, inspired by the successes of the past, extend the Pax Americana over lands not included in this continent.")&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin for "American Peace", modeled after ''[[Pax Romana]]'', ''[[Pax Britannica]]'', and ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'') is a term applied to the concept of relative [[peace]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and later the world beginning around the middle of the 20th century, thought to be caused by the preponderance of power enjoyed by the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Pax+Americana|title=Definition of PAX AMERICANA|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used with different meanings and eras, such as the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era in [[North America]],&lt;ref name="LalorCyclopaedia"&gt;Lalor, John J., ''Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States''. Chicago: Rand, McNally, 1884. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=OC0QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA959 The Union]", p. 959.&lt;/ref&gt; and regionally in the Americas at the start of the 20th century.

''Pax Americana'' is primarily used in its modern connotations to refer to the peace among [[great powers]] established after the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, also called [[Long Peace|the Long Peace]]. In this modern sense, it has come to indicate the military and economic position of the United States in relation to other nations.  For example, the [[Marshall Plan]], which spent $13 billion to rebuild the economy of Western Europe, has been seen as "the launching of the pax americana".&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Mee, ''The Marshall Plan: The launching of the pax americana'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term derives from ''[[Pax Romana]]'' of the [[Roman Empire]]. The term is most notably associated with ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' (1815–1914) under the [[British Empire]], which served as the global hegemon and constabulary from the late 18th century until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Magazine''. 1885. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=bPEvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA413#v=onepage&amp;q=pax%20britannica&amp;f=false The Federal Union]", p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early period ==
{{Main|Gilded Age}}
{{See also|History of the United States (1865–1918)|Territorial changes of the United States|Overseas expansion of the United States}}
The first articulation of a ''Pax Americana'' occurred after the end of the [[American Civil War]] with reference to the peaceful nature of the North American geographical region, and was abeyant at the commencement of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Its emergence was concurrent with the development of the idea of [[American exceptionalism]]. This view holds that the U.S. occupies a special niche among [[developed nation]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |title=sagehistory.net |publisher=sagehistory.net |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629043938/http://sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |archivedate=June 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of its national [[credo]], historical evolution, political and religious institutions, and unique origins. The concept originates from [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref name="politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225014354/http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-25|title=American Exceptionalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who asserted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations because it was a country of [[immigrants]] and the first [[modern democracy]]. From the establishment of the United States after the [[American Revolution]] until the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[foreign policy of the United States]] had a regional, instead of global, focus. The Pax Americana, which the Union enforced upon the states of central North America, was a factor in the United States' national [[prosperity]]. The larger states were surrounded by smaller states, but these had no anxieties: no standing armies to require taxes and hinder labor; no wars or rumors of wars that would interrupt trade; there is not only peace, but security, for the Pax Americana of the Union covered all the states within the [[Federation|federal]] constitutional republic.&lt;ref name="LalorCyclopaedia" /&gt; According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first time the phrase appeared in print was in the August 1894 issue of ''Forum'': "The true cause for exultation is the universal outburst of patriotism in support of the prompt and courageous action of President Cleveland in maintaining the supremacy of law throughout the length and breadth of the land, in establishing the ''pax Americana''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00344727?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Pax+Americana&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|title=Help – Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|1906 political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the Monroe Doctrine to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]].]]
With the [[rise of the New Imperialism#New Imperialism and the emerging empires|rise of the New Imperialism]] in the Western hemisphere at the end of the 19th century, debates arose between [[imperialism|imperialist]] and [[isolationism|isolationist]] factions in the U.S. Here, ''Pax Americana'' was used to connote the peace across the United States and, more widely, as a Pan-American peace under the aegis of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Those who favored traditional policies of avoiding foreign entanglements included labor leader [[Samuel Gompers]] and steel tycoon [[Andrew Carnegie]]. American politicians such as [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], [[William McKinley]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] advocated an aggressive foreign policy, but the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] was unwilling to pursue such actions. On January 16, 1893, U.S. diplomatic and military personnel conspired with a small group of individuals to [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow the constitutional government]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] and establish a [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government]] and then a [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]]. On February 15, they presented a treaty for annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but opposition to annexation stalled its passage. The United States finally opted to annex Hawaii by way of the [[Newlands Resolution]] in July 1898.

After its victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898 and the subsequent acquisition of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Guam]], the United States had gained a [[colonial empire]]. By ejecting Spain from the Americas, the United States shifted its position to an uncontested regional power, and extended its influence into [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were relatively small, these colonies were strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly [[China]]. In the Caribbean area, the United States established a [[sphere of influence]] in line with the Monroe Doctrine, not explicitly defined as such, but recognized in effect by other governments and accepted by at least some of the republics in that area.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar"&gt;Kirkpatrick, F. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XtFCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 ''South America and the War'']: Being the Substance of a Course of Lectures Delivered in the University of London, King's College Under the Tooke Trust in the Lent Term, 1918. Cambridge [England]: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The events around the start of the 20th century demonstrated that the United States undertook an obligation, usual in such cases, of imposing a "Pax Americana".&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt; As in similar instances elsewhere, this Pax Americana was not quite clearly marked in its geographical limit, nor was it guided by any theoretical consistency, but rather by the merits of the case and the test of immediate expediency in each instance.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt; Thus, whereas the United States enforced a peace in much of the lands southward from the Nation and undertook measures to maintain internal tranquility in such areas, the United States on the other hand withdrew from interposition in Mexico.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickWar" /&gt;

European powers largely regarded these matters as the concern of the United States. Indeed, the nascent Pax Americana was, in essence, abetted by the policy of the United Kingdom, and the preponderance of global [[sea power]] which the [[British Empire]] enjoyed by virtue of the strength of the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Bernard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=m38uhldLcGsC ''Empire and Superempire: Britain, America and the World'']. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Preserving the [[freedom of the seas]] and ensuring naval dominance had been the policy of the British since victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As it was not in the interests of the United Kingdom to permit any European power to interfere in Americas, the Monroe Doctrine was indirectly aided by the Royal Navy. British commercial interests in South America, which comprised a valuable component of the [[Informal Empire]] that accompanied Britain's imperial possessions, and the economic importance of the United States as a trading partner, ensured that intervention by Britain's rival European powers could not engage with the Americas.

The United States lost its Pacific and regionally bounded nature towards the end of the 19th century. The government adopted [[protectionism]] after the [[Spanish–American War]] and built up the navy, the "[[Great White Fleet]]", to expand the reach of U.S. power. When Theodore Roosevelt became [[President of the United States|President]] in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from isolationism towards foreign intervention which had begun under his predecessor, [[William McKinley]]. The [[Philippine–American War]] arose from the ongoing [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html|author=John M. Gates|title=War-Related Deaths in the Philippines|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=53|issue=3|date=August 1984|pages=367–78|publisher=wooster.edu|accessdate=2014-07-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805061319/http://www3.wooster.edu/history/jgates/book-ch3.html|archivedate=2010-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interventionism found its formal articulation in the 1904 [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine, proclaiming the right of the United States to intervene in the affairs of weak states in the Americas in order to stabilize them, a moment that underlined the emergent U.S. regional [[hegemony]].

== Interwar period ==
{{Main|Interwar period}}
The United States had been criticized for not taking up the hegemonic mantle following the disintegration of ''Pax Britannica'' before the First World War and during the interwar period due to the absence of established political structures, such as the [[World Bank]] or [[United Nations]] which would be created after World War II, and various internal policies, such as protectionism.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Harold. The Interwar Depression in an International Context. München: R. Oldenbourg, 2002.

Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO, 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3DE4P7NdaycC&amp;pg=PA135 Great Depression]'' pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Though, the United States participated in the Great War, according to Woodrow Wilson:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observance of those principles.&lt;br /&gt;
[...] for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:The Gap in the Bridge.png|thumbnail|left|The Gap in the Bridge. Cartoon about the absence of the U.S. from the League of Nations, depicted as the missing keystone of the arch.]]

The United States' entry into the Great War marked the abandonment of the traditional American policy of isolation and independence of world politics. Not at the close of the Civil War, not as the result of the Spanish War, but in the [[Interwar period]] did the United States become a part of the international system.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; With this global reorganization from the Great War, there were those in the American populace that advocated an activist role in international politics and international affairs by the United States.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; Activities that were initiated did not fall into political-military traps and, instead, focused on economic-ideological approaches that would increase the American Empire and general worldwide stability.&lt;ref name="ParchamiHegemonic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parchami|first=Ali|title=Hegemonic Peace and Empire: The Pax Romana, Britannica and Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQPEdl_cGHEC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=181|chapter=The Pax Americana Debate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the prior path, a precursor to the United Nations and a league to enforce peace, the League of Nations, was proposed by Woodrow Wilson.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt; This was rejected by the American Government in favor of more economic-ideological approaches and the United States did not join the League. Additionally, there were even proposals of extending the Monroe Doctrine to Great Britain put forth to prevent a second conflagration on the European theater.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Ultimately, the United States' proposals and actions did not stop the factors of  European nationalism spawned by the previous war, the repercussions of Germany's defeat, and the failures of the Treaty of Versailles from plunging the globe into a Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John (1998), The First World War, Hutchinson, {{ISBN|0-09-180178-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between World War I and World War II, America also sought to continue to preserve ''Pax America'' as a [[corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy"&gt;Einstein, Lewis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gpUMAAAAYAAJ A Prophecy of the War (1913–1914)]. New York: Columbia University Press, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sought the peaceful and orderly evolution of existing conditions in the western hemisphere and nothing by immediate changes.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Before 1917, the position of the United States government and the feelings of the nation in respect to the "Great War" initially had properly been one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; Its interests remained untouched, and nothing occurred of a nature to affect those interests.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt;

The average American's sympathies, on the other hand, if the feelings of the vast majority of the nation had been correctly interpreted, was with the Allied (Entente) Powers.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The population of the United States was revolted at the ruthlessness of the Prussian doctrine of war, and German designs to shift the burden of aggression encountered skeptical derision.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The American populace saw themselves safeguarding liberal peace in the Western World. To this end, the American writer Roland Hugins stated:&lt;ref&gt;Roland Hugins, ''The Possible Peace'', New York, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The truth is that the United States is the only high-minded Power left in the world. It is the only strong nation that has not entered on a career of imperial conquest, and does not want to enter on it. [...] There is in America little of that spirit of selfish aggression which lies at the heart of militarism. Here alone exists a broad basis for "a new passionate sense of brotherhood, and a new scale of human values." We have a deep abhorrence of war for war's sake; we are not enamored of glamour or glory. We have a strong faith in the principle of self-government. We do not care to dominate alien peoples, white or colored; we do not aspire to be the Romans of tomorrow or the "masters of the world." The idealism of Americans centers in the future of America, wherein we hope to work out those principles of liberty and democracy to which we are committed This political idealism, this strain of pacifism, this abstinence from aggression and desire to be left alone to work out our own destiny, has been manifest from the birth of the republic. We have not always followed our light, but we have never been utterly faithless to it.&lt;ref name="HummelAnnal" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was observed during this time that the initial defeat of Germany opened a moral recasting of the world.&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt; The battles between Germans and Allies were seen as far less battles between different nations than they represent the contrast between [[Liberalism]] and [[reactionary|reaction]], between the aspirations of [[democracy]] and the [[Wilhelminism]] [[Blood and Iron (speech)|gospel of iron]].&lt;ref name="EinsteinProphecy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bismarck introduced this in the era of force.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern period ==
[[File:Superpower map 1945.png|240px|thumb|A world map of 1945 with three [[superpower]]s: the [[United States]] (in blue), the [[Soviet Union]] (in red), and the [[British Empire]] (in teal).]]

The modern ''Pax Americana'' era is cited by both supporters and critics of [[Foreign relations of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] after World War II. However, from 1946 to 1992 ''Pax americana'' is considered a partial international order, as it applied only to capitalist bloc countries, being preferable for some authors to speak about a ''Pax americana et sovietica''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibañez Muñoz, Josep, "El desafío a la Pax americana: del 11 de septiembre a la guerra de Irak" in C.

El orden internacional tras el conflicto de Irak", Madrid: Tecnos, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators and critics focus on American policies from 1992 to the present, and as such, it carries different connotations depending on the context. For example, it appears three times in the 90 page document, ''[[Project for the New American Century#Rebuilding America's Defenses|Rebuilding America's Defenses]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |title=Rebuilding America's Defenses Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century |publisher=Newamericancentury.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923154604/http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |archivedate=September 23, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Project for the New American Century]], but is also used by critics to characterize American dominance and [[hyperpower]] as imperialist in function and basis. From about the mid-1940s until 1991, U.S. foreign policy was dominated by the [[Cold War]], and characterized by its significant international military presence and greater diplomatic involvement. Seeking an alternative to the isolationist policies pursued after World War I, the United States defined a new policy called [[containment]] to oppose the spread of [[communism]].

The modern ''Pax Americana'' may be seen as similar to the period of peace in [[Roman Empire|Rome]], ''[[Pax Romana]]''. In both situations, the period of peace was 'relative peace'.  During both ''Pax Romana'' and ''Pax Americana'' wars continued to occur, but it was still a prosperous time for both Western and Roman civilizations. It is important to note that during these periods, and most other times of relative tranquility, the peace that is referred to does not mean complete peace.  Rather, it simply means that the civilization prospered in their [[military]], [[agriculture]], [[trade]], and [[manufacturing]].

=== ''Pax Britannica'' heritage ===
{{Main|Pax Britannica}}

From the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 until [[World War I]] in 1914, the [[United Kingdom]] played the role of [[Offshore balancing|offshore-balancer]] in Europe, where the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was the main aim. It was also in this time that the British Empire became the largest empire of all time.  The global superiority of [[British Armed Forces|British military]] and commerce was guaranteed by dominance of a Europe lacking in strong [[nation-state]]s, and the presence of the [[Royal Navy]] on all of the world's oceans and seas. In 1905, the Royal Navy was superior to any two navies combined in the world. It provided services such as suppression of [[piracy]] and [[slavery]]. In this era of peace, though, there were several wars between the major powers: the [[Crimean War]], the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]], the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], as well as numerous other wars. ''[[La Belle Époque]]'', [[William Wohlforth]] argued, was rather ''Pax Britannica'', ''Russica'' and later ''Germanica'', and between 1853 and 1871 it was not ''Pax'' of any kind.&lt;ref name="Unipolar World 1999 p 39"&gt;"The Stability of a Unipolar World,"' ''International Security'', 24/1, (1999): p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British hegemony, America developed close ties with Britain, evolving into what has become known as a "[[special relationship]]" between the two. The many commonalities shared with the two nations (such as language and history) drew them together as allies. Under the managed transition of the British Empire to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], members of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]], such as [[Harold Macmillan]], liked to think of [[Anglo-American relations|Britain's relationship with America]] as similar to that of a progenitor [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] to America's [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2002/09/06/do0602.xml  Labour's love-in with America is nothing new] [[Daily Telegraph]] 6 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, both have been active in [[North America]]n, [[Middle East]]ern, and [[Asia]]n countries.

=== Late 20th century ===
{{Main|American Century}}
{{See also|History of the United States (1945–1964)|History of the United States (1964–1980)}}

After the Second World War, no [[war|armed conflict]] emerged among major Western nations themselves, and no [[nuclear weapon]]s were used in open conflict.  The [[United Nations]] was also soon developed after World War II to help keep peaceful relations between nations and establishing the veto power for the permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]], which included the United States.

In the second half of the 20th century, the USSR and US superpowers were engaged in the Cold War, which can be seen as a struggle between hegemonies for global dominance. After 1945, the United States enjoyed an advantageous position with respect to the rest of the industrialized world. In the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]], the US was responsible for half of global industrial output, held 80 percent of the world's [[gold]] reserves, and was the world's sole [[list of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear power]]. The catastrophic destruction of life, infrastructure, and capital during the Second World War had exhausted the imperialism of the [[Old World]], victor and vanquished alike. The largest economy in the world at the time, the United States recognized that it had come out of the war with its domestic [[infrastructure]] virtually unscathed and its [[Military of the United States|military forces]] at unprecedented strength. Military officials recognized the fact that Pax Americana had been reliant on the effective United States [[air power]], just as the instrument of Pax Britannica a century earlier was its [[sea power]].&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, Robert Frank, "Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine: Basic Thinking in the United States Air Force 1907–1960". DIANE Publishing, 1989. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kps2EhXM-lwC&amp;pg=PA239 p. 239].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a ''[[New world order (politics)|unipolar moment]]'' was seen to have occurred following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|collapse]] of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Patrick P.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=RQ-jjUbxveUC&amp;pg=PA213 p. 213].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Pax Americana'' was explicitly used by [[John F. Kennedy]] in the 1960s, who advocated against the idea, arguing that the Soviet bloc was composed of human beings with the same individual goals as Americans and that such a peace based on "American weapons of war" was undesirable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a ''Pax Americana'' enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children—not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E.

Beginning around the [[Vietnam War]], the 'Pax Americana' term had started to be used by the critics of American Imperialism. Here in the late 20th century conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, the charge of ''[[Neocolonialism]]'' was often aimed at Western involvement in the affairs of the [[Third World]] and other developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Anuradha M.

{{See also|History of the United States (1980–1991)|History of the United States (1991-present)}}
Currently, the ''Pax Americana'' is based on the military preponderance beyond challenge by any combination of powers and projection of power throughout the world's ''commons''—neutral sea, air and space. This projection is coordinated by the [[Unified Command Plan]] which divides the world on regional branches controlled by a single command. Notably, "the right to command" translated into Latin renders ''imperium''. Integrated with it are global network of military alliances (the [[Rio Pact]], [[NATO]], [[ANZUS]] and bilateral alliances with Japan and several other states) coordinated by Washington in a hub-and-spokes system and worldwide network of several hundreds of military bases and installations. Neither the Rio Treaty, nor NATO, for [[Robert J. Art]], "was a regional collective security organization; rather both were regional imperia run and operated by the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Robert J., Art, "Geopolitics Updated: The Strategy of Selective Engagement", ''International Security'', 23/3 (1998–99), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Security Advisor Zbignew Brzezinski drew an expressive summary of the military foundation of ''Pax Americana'' shortly after the ''[[New world order (politics)|unipolar moment]]'':
{{quote|
In contrast [to the earlier empires], the scope and pervasiveness of American global power today are unique. Not only does the United States control all the world's oceans, its military legions are firmly perched on the western and eastern extremities of Eurasia&amp;nbsp;... American vassals and tributaries, some yearning to be embraced by even more formal ties to Washington, dot the entire Eurasian continent&amp;nbsp;... American global supremacy is&amp;nbsp;... buttered by an elaborate system of alliances and coalitions that literally span the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], ''[[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives]]'', (Perseus Books, New York, 1997, p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Besides the military foundation, there are significant non-military international institutions backed by American financing and diplomacy (like the [[United Nations]] and [[WTO]]). The United States invested heavily in programs such as the [[Marshall Plan]] and in the reconstruction of [[Japan]], economically cementing defense ties that owed increasingly to the establishment of the [[Iron Curtain]]/[[Eastern Bloc]] and the widening of the [[Cold War]].

[[File:Antiimperialismo caracas.jpg|thumb|left|Street art in [[Caracas]], depicting [[Uncle Sam]] and accusing the American government of [[imperialism]]]]

Being in the best position to take advantage of free trade, culturally indisposed to traditional empires, and alarmed by the rise of [[communism]] in [[China]] and the detonation of the first Soviet [[atom bomb]], the historically [[Noninterventionism|non-interventionist]] U.S. also took a keen interest in developing multilateral institutions which would maintain a favorable world order among them. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (World Bank), part of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of [[international financial system|international financial management]] was developed and, until the early 1970s, the existence of a [[fixed exchange rate]] to the US dollar. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was developed and consists of a protocol for normalization and reduction of trade [[tariff]]s.

With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], the demise of the notion of a ''[[Pax Sovietica]]'', and the end of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. maintained significant contingents of armed forces in Europe and [[East Asia]]. The institutions behind the Pax Americana and the rise of the United States unipolar power have persisted into the early 21st century. The ability of the United States to act as "the world's [[police]]man" has been constrained by its own citizens' historic aversion to foreign wars.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfield, H. Bradford. ''The Instruments of America's Foreign Policy''. New York: Crowell, 1963. p. 138. (''cf''. "the traditional American aversion to foreign wars, but also related to some recent disillusionment with the fruits of total wars&amp;nbsp;...")&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been calls for the continuation of military leadership, as stated in "Rebuilding America's Defenses":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The American peace has proven itself peaceful, stable, and durable. It has, over the past decade, provided the geopolitical framework for widespread economic growth and the spread of American principles of liberty and democracy. Yet no moment in international politics can be frozen in time; even a global ''Pax Americana'' will not preserve itself. [... What is required is] a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibilities.&lt;ref name=RAD2000&gt;{{Cite news

This is reflected in the research of American exceptionalism, which shows that "there is some indication for [being a leader of an 'American peace'] among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of [[unilateral]] attitudes".&lt;ref name="politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de" /&gt; It should be noted that resentments have arisen at a country's dependence on American military protection, due to disagreements with United States foreign policy or the presence of American military forces.
In the ''[[post-communism]]'' world of the 21st-century, the French Socialist politician and former Foreign Minister [[Hubert Védrine]] describes the US as a hegemonic [[hyperpower]], while the U.S. political scientists [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Joseph Nye]] counter that the US is not a "true" hegemony, because it does not have the resources to impose a proper, formal, global rule; despite its political and military strength, the US is economically equal to Europe, thus, cannot rule the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Sr., ''Understanding International Conflicts: An introduction to Theory and History'', pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries are either emerging or re-emerging as powers, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of India|India]], and the [[European Union]].

Joseph Nye discredited the United States as not a "true" hegemony in his 2002 article titled "The New Rome Meets the New Barbarians".&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', 23/3, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}} His book of the same year he opens: "Not since Rome has one nation loomed so large above the others."&lt;ref&gt;''The Paradox of American Power'', (Oxford University Press, New York, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; And his 1991 book he titled ''Bound to Lead''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bound To Lead: The Changing Nature Of American Power'' (Basic Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leadership'', translated into Greek, renders ''[[hegemony]]''; an alternative translation is ''archia'' – Greek common word for ''empire''. Having defined the US hegemony as "not true", Nye looks for an analogy to the true empire: Decline, he writes, is not necessarily imminent. "Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the peak of its power&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2010-11-01/future-american-power The Future of American Power: Dominance and Decline in Perspective]", ''Foreign Affairs'' (November–December  2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are striking parallels with the early ''Pax Romana'' (especially between 189 BC when the supremacy over the Mediterranean was won and the first annexation in 168 BC). Under that ''Pax Romana'' other states remained formally independent and very seldom were called "clients". The latter term became widely used only in the late medieval period. Usually, other states were called "friends and allies"—a popular expression under the ''Pax Americana''.

One of the first to use the term ''Pax Americana'' was the [[Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy]]. In 1942, the Committee envisaged that the United States may have to replace the British Empire. Therefore, the United States "must cultivate a mental view toward world settlement after this war which will enable us to impose our own terms, amounting perhaps to a Pax Americana".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Michio Kaku and David Axelrod, ''To Win a Nuclear War: The Pentagon Secret War Plans'', Boston: South End Press, 1987, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swen Holdar, the founder of [[geopolitics]] [[Rudolf Kjellen]] (1864–1922) predicted the era of US global supremacy using the term ''Pax Americana'' shortly after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ideal State and the Power of Geography. The Life Work of Rudolf Kjellen", ''Political Geography Quarterly'', 11/3 (1992): p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=What is this "11/3"? A date? Who wrote it?|date=July 2018}} Writing in 1945, [[Ludwig Dehio]] remembered that the Germans used the term ''Pax Anglosaxonica'' in a sense of Pax Americana since 1918:
{{quote|
Now [1918] the [American colonial] cutting had grown into a tree that bade fair to overshadow the globe with its foliage. Amazed and shaken, we Germans began to discuss the possibility of a Pax Anglosaxonica as a world-wide counterpart to the Pax Romana. Suddenly the tendency toward global unification towered up, ready to gather the separate national states of Europe together under one banner and blanket in a larger cohesion&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Dehio, ''The Precarious Balance: Four Centuries of the European Power Struggle'', 1945 (tr. Fullman, Charles, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The United States, Dehio associates on the same page, withdrew to isolation on that occasion. "Rome, too, had taken a long time to understand the significance of her world role." Two years earlier, with the war still at its peak, the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], invoked the example of the two-centuries long "Pax Romana" which, he suggested, could be repeated if based on the preponderant US air power:
{{quote|
During the third century BC the Mediterranean world was divided on five great powers—Roma and Carthage, Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt. The balance of power led to a series of wars until Rome emerged the queen of the Mediterranean and established an incomparable era of two centuries of peace and progress, the 'Pax Romana'&amp;nbsp;... It may be that America's air power could again assure our world, now much smaller than the Mediterranean at that period, two hundred years of peace&amp;nbsp;... This is the only realistic hope for a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade for Pan-Europe'' (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), pp. 299–304.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One of the first criticisms of "Pax Americana" was written by [[Nathaniel Peffer]] in 1943:
{{quote|
It is neither feasible nor desirable&amp;nbsp;... Pax Americana can be established and maintained only by force, only by means of a new, gigantic imperialism operating with the instrumentalities of militarism and the other concomitants of imperialism&amp;nbsp;... The way to dominion is through empire and the price of dominion is empire, and empire generates its own opposition.&lt;ref&gt;"America’s Place in the Postwar World", ''Political Science Quarterly'', 58/1 (1943): pp. 12, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=What is "58/1"? Who is the author?|date=July 2018}}}}
However, Peffer was not certain that this would not happen: "It is conceivable that&amp;nbsp;... America might drift into empire, imperceptibly, stage by stage, in a kind of power-politics gravitation." He also noted that America was heading precisely in that direction: "That there are certain stirrings in this direction is apparent, though how deep they go is unclear."&lt;ref&gt;"America’s Place in the Postwar World", ''op. cit.'', pp. 12, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depth soon became clarified. Two later critics of Pax Americana, [[Michio Kaku]] and [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], interpreted the outcome of Pax Americana: "[[Gunboat diplomacy]] would be replaced by Atomic diplomacy. [[Pax Britannica]] would give way to Pax Americana." After the war, with the German and British militaries in tatters, only one force stood on the way to Pax Americana: the Red Army.&lt;ref name="To Win a Nuclear War, p 64"&gt;''To Win a Nuclear War'', ''op. cit.'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after this criticism was written, the Red Army withdrew, paving the way for the [[Unipolarity|unipolar moment]]. [[Joshua Muravchik]] commemorated the event by titling his 1991 article, "At Last, Pax Americana". He detailed:
{{quote|
Last but not least, the Gulf War marks the dawning of the Pax Americana. True, that term was used immediately after World War II. But it was a misnomer then because the Soviet empire—a real competitor with American power—was born at the same moment. The result was not a "pax" of any kind, but a cold war and a bipolar world&amp;nbsp;... During the past two years, however, Soviet power has imploded and a bipolar world has become unipolar.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Muravchick, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/24/opinion/at-last-pax-americana.html At Last, Pax Americana]", ''The New York Times'' (January 24, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following year, in 1992, a US strategic draft for the post-Cold War period was leaked to the press. The person responsible for the confusion, former Assistant Secretary of State, [[Paul Wolfowitz]], confessed seven years later: "In 1992 a draft memo prepared by my office at the Pentagon&amp;nbsp;... leaked to the press and sparked a major controversy." The draft's strategy aimed "to prevent any hostile power from dominating" a Eurasian region "whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power". He added: "Senator Joseph Biden ridiculed the proposed strategy as 'literally a ''Pax Americana''&amp;nbsp;... It won't work&amp;nbsp;...' Just seven years later, many of these same critics seem quite comfortable with the idea of a ''Pax Americana''."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wolfowitz, "Remembering the Future", ''National Interest'', 59: (2000), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War period, concluded [[William Wohlforth]], much less ambiguously deserves to be called ''Pax Americana''. "Calling the current period the true Pax Americana may offend some, but it reflects reality".&lt;ref name="Unipolar World 1999 p 39" /&gt;

The ‘’Pax Americana’’ motif reached its peak in the context of the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. The phrase "American Empire" appeared in one thousand news stories over a single six-month period in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Go, ''Patterns of Empire: The British and American Empires, 1688 to the Present'' (New York: Cambridge University Press,  2011), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Freedland]] observed:

Rome and America both expanded in order to achieve security. Like concentric circles, each circle in need of security demanded the occupation of the next larger circle. The Romans made their way around the Mediterranean, driven from one challenger to their security to the next. The struggles&amp;nbsp;... brought the Americans to Europe and East Asia; the Americans soon wound up all over the globe, driven from one attempt at containment to the next. The boundaries between security and power politics gradually blurred.

{{American Empire}}

''American imperialism'' is a term referring to outcomes or ideological elements of United States foreign policy. Since the start of the [[cold war]], the United States has economically and/or diplomatically supported friendly foreign governments, including many that overtly violated the civil and human rights of their own citizens and residents.  American imperialism concepts were initially a product of capitalism critiques and, later, of theorists opposed to what they take to be aggressive United States policies and doctrines. Although there are various views of the imperialist nature of the United States, which describe many of the same policies and institutions as evidence of imperialism, explanations for imperialism vary widely. In spite of such literature, the historians Archibald Paton Thorton and Stuart Creighton Miller argue against the very coherence of the concept. Miller argues that the overuse and abuse of the term "imperialism" makes it nearly meaningless as an analytical concept.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Stuart Creighton  | title="Benevolent Assimilation" The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899–1903 | publisher=Yale University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-300-02697-8 | url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/4300.html#miller}} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="785">A '''pseudo-photograph''' is "an [[image]], whether made by computer-graphics or otherwise howsoever, which appears to be a photograph".{{cite quote|date=October 2018}}

Although the term '''''pseudo-photograph''''' can be applied regardless of what it depicts, in law its meaning is especially relevant regarding [[child pornography]].

In the UK, the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] amended the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]] so as to define the concept of an "indecent pseudo-photograph of a child".

Michael Ryan|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;pg=PA409|accessdate=15 November 2012|date=2 February 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched by a joint effort of three of the leading European sociologists — [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Scott Lash]]. The introduction of this concept served a double purpose: to reassess sociology as a science of the present (moving beyond the early 20th century conceptual framework); and to provide a counterbalance to the [[Postmodernity|postmodernist paradigm]] offering a re-constructive view alongside [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref name="Ulrich-2003"&gt;[http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/20/2/1.abstract Ulrich Beck Wolfgang Bonss Christoph Lau (2003) "The Theory of Reflexive Modernization: Problematic, Hypotheses and Research Programme." ''Theory, Culture &amp; Society,'' Volume: 20 issue: 2, page(s): 1-33,  April 1, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept built upon previous notions such as [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]) and [[Post-materialism|postmaterial society]], but stresses how in [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] modernization, [[modernity]] directs its attention to the process of [[modernization]] itself.&lt;ref name="Ulrich-2003"/&gt;

==Completion of modernity==

The main thesis deals with the changes brought on by the realisation of modernity's ideals, such as [[universal suffrage]] and education, the [[welfare state]], [[civil and political rights]], changes that marked the shift to the [[second modernity]]. The authors consider it a reflexive modernity because it opposes its earlier version, in the same way as the first modernity opposed feudal traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Chanqi He, ''Modernization Science'' (2012) p. 111 and p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the institutions of the first modernity are beginning to crumble in the face of [[Economic globalization|economic]] and [[cultural globalization]]. The state is starting to lose its importance with the rise of [[Transnationalism|transnational]] forces (corporations, NGOs), the family is splitting apart with rising divorce rates favoured by the flexibility of work and the women's liberation, losing its supportive function in the process, religion is reduced to a cultural artifact, traditional political action is boycotted because of a lack of identification with the parties' goals. Therefore all previous sources of [[solidarity]] lose momentum with the rise of [[Individuation|individualization]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry J. Ray, ''Globalization and Everyday Life'' (2007) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Consequences==

Ulrich Beck focuses on the dissolution of traditional institutions and the rise of transnational forces, while promoting a new type solidarity in the face of the human made dangers of the [[risk society]], exacerbated by the inherent limits being discovered to all forms of social knowing.&lt;ref&gt;U. Bech, ''World at Risk'' (2009) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Giddens proposes a [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] of social policies aimed at tackling the new challenges to identity and life choices created by the biographical risks and uncertainties of reflexive modernity.&lt;ref&gt;P. Daniel-Smith, ''Cultural Theory'' (2001) p. 145-6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zygmunt Bauman]] talks about the social effects of globalization, as it seems to create new divisions between the people connected to the global flux of information (the 'tourists') and those excluded from them, not needed as workforce anymore (the 'bums').&lt;ref&gt;P. Jones et al, ''Introducing Social Theory'' (2011) p. 202-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Inglehart]] studies the shift of human values from material to post-material in the Western societies by analyzing the [[World Values Survey]] databases;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Inglehart, ''Culture Shift in Advanced Industrial Society'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pippa Norris]] stresses the importance of cultural globalization over economical globalization,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hopper, ''Understanding Cultural Globalization'' (2007) p. 177-8&lt;/ref&gt; while also talking about the new divisions, such as the [[digital divide]].

==Characteristics==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
Reflexive modernization is a process of modernization that is characteristic of risk society whereby progress is achieved through reorganization and "reform". Science and technology as it is used for the purpose of reflexive modernization is less concerned with expanding the [[natural resource|resource base]], but rather with re-evaluating that which is already being used by society. There is a constant [[Information flow|flow of information]] between [[science]] and [[industry]], and progress is achieved through the resulting reforms, [[optimization]]s and [[adaptation]]s. Examples of reflexive modernization that have recently gained political momentum are [[sustainability]] and the [[precautionary principle]]. The [[new social movements]] (feminist, green, and pirate parties) are also considered to be an expression of reflexive modernization.

The '''relational theory of space''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory according to which [[space]] is composed of relations between objects, with the implication that it cannot exist in the absence of matter. Its opposite is the [[container space|container]] theory. A [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[physics|physical]] theory implies a [[relation (philosophy)|relational metaphysics]], but not the other way round: even if space is composed of nothing but relations between [[observer (relativity)|observer]]s and [[event (relativity)|event]]s, it would be conceptually possible for all observers to agree on their measurements, whereas relativity implies they will disagree. [[Newtonian physics]] can be cast in [[Galilean invariance|relational terms]], but Newton insisted, for philosophical reasons, on [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] (container) space. The subject was famously debated by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and a supporter of Newton's in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

An absolute approach can also be applied to [[time]], with, for instance, the implication that there might have been vast epochs of time before the first [[event (philosophy)|event]].&lt;ref&gt;''Physics and Metaphysics: Theories of Space and Time'' by Jennifer Trusted, Routledge, 1991 {{ISBN|0-415-05948-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, having such and such essential properties is a necessary condition for membership in a given natural kind. For example, tigers are tigers in virtue of possessing a particular set of genetic properties, but identifying (or appearance-based) properties are nonessential properties. If a tiger lost a leg, or didn't possess stripes, we would still call it a tiger. They are not necessary for being a member of the class of tigers.

It is important, however, that the set of essential properties of an object not be used to identify or be identified with that object because they are not ''necessary and sufficient'', but only necessary. Having such and such a genetic code does not suffice for being a tiger. We wouldn't call a piece of tiger tail a tiger, even though a piece of tiger tail contains the genetic information essential to being a tiger.

The '''distinction between sex and gender''' differentiates a person's [[biological sex]] (the anatomy of an individual's [[reproductive system]], and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s) from that person's [[gender]], which can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person ([[gender role]]) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness ([[gender identity]]).&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;Prince, Virginia. 2005.

In some circumstances, an individual's [[assigned sex]] and gender do not align, and the person may be [[transgender]].&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt; In other cases, an individual may have biological [[sex characteristics]] that complicate sex assignment, and the person may be [[intersex]].

Among scientists, the term ''sex differences'' (as compared to ''gender differences'') is typically applied to [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] traits that are hypothesized to be evolved consequences of [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Mealey, L. 2000"&gt;Mealey, L.

== Sex ==
[[Anisogamy]], or the size differences of [[gamete]]s (sex cells), is the defining feature of the two sexes. By definition, males have small, mobile gametes ([[sperm]]); females have large and generally immobile gametes ([[Egg cell|ova]] or eggs).&lt;ref&gt;Daly, M. &amp; Wilson, M. (1983). Sex, evolution and behavior. Monterey: Brooks Cole&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, typical male or female [[sexual differentiation]] includes the presence or absence of a [[Y chromosome]], the type of [[gonad]]s ([[ovary]] or [[testes]]), the balance of [[sex hormone]]s ([[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]), the [[Human reproductive system|internal reproductive anatomy]] (e.g. [[uterus]] or [[prostate gland]]), and the external genitalia (e.g. [[penis]] or [[vulva]]).&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline.

People whose internal psychological experience differs from their [[Sex assignment|assigned sex]] are [[transgender]], [[transsexual]], or [[Genderqueer|non-binary]].

The consensus among scientists is that all behaviors are [[phenotype]]s—complex interactions of both biology and environment—and thus [[nature vs. nurture]] is a misleading categorization.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D., &amp; Kaufer, D.

''Sex'' is annotated as different from ''gender'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', where it says ''sex'' "tends now to refer to biological differences".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50221203?query_type=word&amp;queryword=sex&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=a4MJ-RwfyiP-2884&amp;hilite=50221203 ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (draft revision (online) Jun., 2010)], as accessed Aug. 22, 2010, ''sex'', noun 1, sense 2a.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) similarly states that "'sex' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women" and that "'male' and 'female' are sex categories".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;[http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/ ''What do we mean by "sex" and "gender"?''

The ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]'' (5th ed.), however, lists ''sex'' as both "Either of the two divisions, designated female and male, by which most organisms are classified on the basis of their reproductive organs and functions" and "One's identity as either female or male," among other definitions.&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com, 5th ed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=sex |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018005502/http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=sex |archivedate=2013-10-18 |df= }}''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 5th ed. 2011, ''sex'', senses 2a and 4, accessed Jun 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Historian [[Thomas W. Laqueur]] suggests that from the Renaissance to the 18th century, there was a prevailing inclination among doctors towards the existence of only one biological sex (the [[one-sex and two-sex theories|one-sex theory]], that women and men had the same fundamental reproductive structure).&lt;ref&gt;Lacqueur, Thomas Walter, ''Making Sex: Body and Gender From the Greeks to Freud'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Univ. Press, 1st Harvard Univ. Press pbk. ed. [5th printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-674-54355-6}}), © 1990), p.&amp;nbsp;134 (author prof. history Univ. Calif., Berkeley).&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[discourse]]s, this view persisted into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;[149] (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur asserts that even at its peak, the one-sex model was supported among highly educated Europeans but is not known to have been a popular view nor one entirely agreed upon by doctors who treated the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;68 &amp; 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex and gender took center stage in America in the time of wars, when women had to work and men were at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last = Lindsey|first = Linda.

== Gender ==
In the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', ''gender'' is defined as, "[i]n mod[ern] (esp[escially] feminist) use, a euphemism for the sex of a human being, often intended to emphasize the social and cultural, as opposed to the biological, distinctions between the sexes.", with the earliest example cited being from 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50093521?query_type=word&amp;queryword=gender&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=a4MJ-mHKT13-2771&amp;hilite=50093521 ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2d ed. (online) 1989)], as accessed Aug. 22, 2010, ''gender'', noun, sense 3b.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' (5th edition), in addition to defining gender the same way that it defines biological sex, also states that ''gender'' may be defined by identity as "neither entirely female nor entirely male"; its ''Usage Note'' adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people maintain that the word ''sex'' should be reserved for reference to the biological aspects of being male or female or to sexual activity, and that the word ''gender'' should be used only to refer to sociocultural roles. ... In some situations this distinction avoids ambiguity, as in ''gender research'', which is clear in a way that ''sex research'' is not. The distinction can be problematic, however. Linguistically, there isn't any real difference between ''gender bias'' and ''sex bias'', and it may seem contrived to insist that ''sex'' is incorrect in this instance.&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com, 5th ed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A working definition in use by the World Health Organization for its work is that "'[g]ender' refers to the [[social constructionism|socially constructed]] roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women" and that "'masculine' and 'feminine' are gender categories."&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) used to use ''gender'' instead of ''sex'' when referring to physiological differences between male and female organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|title=Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs|author=|date=|website=hhs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170913082514/https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they reversed their position on this and began using ''sex ''as the biological classification and ''gender'' as "a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm283453.htm|title = Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Evaluation of Sex Differences in Medical Device Clinical Studies|date = December 19, 2011|accessdate = August 3, 2014|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140809152800/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm283453.htm|archivedate = August 9, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gender'' is also now commonly used even to refer to the physiology of non-human animals, without any implication of social gender roles.&lt;ref name="haig"/&gt;

[[GLAAD]] (formerly the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) makes a distinction between sex and gender in their most recent Media Reference Guide: Sex is "the classification of people as male or female" at birth, based on bodily characteristics such as chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, and genitalia. Gender identity is "one's internal, personal sense of being a man or woman (or a boy or a girl)".&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. [http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender ‘’GLAAD Media Reference Guide, 8th Edition.

Retrieved on 2011-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]] maintain that gender is totally undetermined by sex. See, for example, ''[[The Dialectic of Sex|The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution]]'', a widely influential feminist text.&lt;ref&gt;Benewick, Robert and Green, Philip, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oWYbQkVyGMcC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Shulamith+Firestone&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Shulamith%20Firestone&amp;f=false Shulamith Firestone 1945–], ''The Routledge dictionary of twentieth-century political thinkers'' (2nd Edition), Routledge, 1998, pp. 84-86. {{ISBN|0-415-09623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of [[David Reimer]], who was, according to studies published by [[John Money]], raised as a girl after a botched circumcision, was described in the book ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl''. Reimer was in fact not comfortable as a girl and later changed gender identity back to male when discovered the truth of his surgery. He eventually committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Rosario, Vernon. 2009.

=== History ===
Gender in the sense of social and behavioral distinctions, according to archaeological evidence, arose "at least by some 30,000 years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., Olga Soffer, &amp; Jake Page, ''The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory'' (Smithsonian Books &amp; Collins (HarperCollinsPublishers), 1st Smithsonian Books ed. 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-06-117091-1}})), p. [277].&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence was found as of  "26,000 years ago",&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. 170 &amp; see pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; at least at the archeological site [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Dolní Věstonice I]] and others, in what is now the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. [169].&lt;/ref&gt; This is during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, power and privilege in modern Europe|author1=Richard, penny  |author2=Jessica Munna |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Pearson/ Longman|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic meaning of ''gender'', ultimately derived from Latin ''genus'', was of "kind" or "variety". By the 20th century, this meaning was obsolete, and the only formal use of ''gender'' [[Grammatical gender|was in grammar]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt; This changed in the early 1970s when the work of John Money, particularly the popular college textbook ''Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl'', was embraced by [[feminist theory]]. This meaning of ''gender'' is now prevalent in the social sciences, although in many other contexts, ''gender'' includes ''sex'' or replaces it.&lt;ref name=haig /&gt; Gender was first only used in languages to describe the feminine and masculine words, up until around the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mikkola|first=Mari|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jemima Repo has in her doctoral thesis ''The biopolitics of gender'' (2011) criticized the use of the term gender among feminists, because it has been used to justify [[biopolitics|biopolitical]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-biopolitics-of-gender-9780190256913?cc=fi&amp;lang=en&amp; |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508090149/https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-biopolitics-of-gender-9780190256913?cc=fi&amp;lang=en&amp; |archivedate=2018-05-08 |df= }} (accessed 2016-11-01)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/28267 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215957/https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/28267 |archivedate=2016-11-03 |df= }} (accessed 2016-11-01)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction in linguistics ==

Since the social sciences now distinguish between biologically defined ''sex'' and socially constructed ''gender'', the term ''gender'' is now also sometimes used by linguists to refer to social gender as well as grammatical gender. Traditionally, however, a distinction has been made by linguists between ''sex'' and ''gender'', where ''sex'' refers primarily to the attributes of  real-world entities – the relevant extralinguistic attributes being, for instance,  male, female, non-personal, and indeterminate sex – and [[grammatical gender]] refers to a category, such as  masculine, feminine, and neuter (often based on sex, but not exclusively so in all languages), that determines the [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between nouns of different genders and associated words, such as articles and adjectives.&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=484–486|last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston|last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey |authorlink2=Geoffrey Pullum|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterfield on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fowler|first1= Henry Watson | editor1-link=Jeremy Butterfield|editor1-last=Butterfield|editor1-first=Jeremy|edition=4th|date=2015|title=[[Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''|publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-966135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language]]'', for instance, states {{Quote|text=By GENDER is meant a grammatical classification of nouns, pronouns, or other words in the noun phrase according to certain meaning-related distinctions, especially a distinction related to the sex of the referent.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=314–316|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph|authorlink1=Randolph Quirk|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Sidney

Nouns referring to people and animals of known sex are ''generally''  referred to by nouns with the equivalent gender. Thus ''Mann'' (meaning man) is masculine and is associated with a masculine definite article to give ''der Mann'', while ''Frau'' (meaning woman) is feminine and is associated with a feminine definite article to give ''die Frau''. However the words for inanimate objects are commonly masculine (e.g. ''der Tisch'', the table) or feminine (''die Armbanduhr'', the watch), and grammatical gender can diverge from biological sex; for instance the feminine noun ''[die] Person'' refers to a person of either sex, and the neuter noun ''[das] Mädchen'' means "the girl".

In modern English, there is no true grammatical gender in this sense,&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"/&gt; though the differentiation, for instance, between the pronouns "he" and "she", which in English refers to a difference in sex (or social gender), is sometimes referred to as a gender distinction. ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', for instance, refers to the semantically based "covert" gender (e.g. male and female, not masculine and feminine) of English nouns, as opposed to the "overt" gender of some English pronouns; this yields ''nine'' gender classes: male, female, dual, common, collective, higher male animal, higher female animal, lower animal, and inanimate, and these semantic gender classes affect the possible choices of pronoun for coreference to the real-life entity, e.g. ''who'' and ''he'' for ''brother'' but ''which'' and ''it'' or ''she'' for ''cow''.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"/&gt;

==West and Zimmerman's "Doing gender"==
{{Main|Doing gender}}
Used primarily in sociology and gender studies, "''[[doing gender]]"'' is the socially constructed performance which takes place during routine human interactions, rather than as a set of essentialized qualities based on one's biological sex.&lt;ref name=west1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225165833/https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf |date=2015-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first appeared in Candace West and Don Zimmerman’s article “Doing Gender”, published in the peer-reviewed journal, ''[[Gender &amp; Society|Gender and Society]]''.&lt;ref name=jurik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jurik | first1 = Nancy C. | last2 = Siemsen | first2 =  Cynthia | title = Doing gender as canon or agenda: A symposium on West and Zimmerman | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 72&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326677 | jstor = 20676750 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326677 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987,&lt;ref name=wz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Accounting for doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 112&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326529 | jstor = 20676758 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326529 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doing Gender'' is the most cited article published in ''Gender and Society''.&lt;ref name=jurik/&gt;

West and Zimmerman state that to understand gender as activity, it is important to differentiate between sex, sex category, and gender.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} They say that sex refers to the socially agreed upon specifications that establish one as male or female; sex is most often based on an individual's genitalia, or even their chromosomal typing before birth.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They consider sex categories to be dichotomous, and that the person is placed in a sex category by exhibiting qualities exclusive to one category or the other. During most interactions, others situate a person's sex by identifying their sex category; however, they believe that a person's sex need not align with their sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; West and Zimmerman maintain that the sex category is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one’s membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} Gender is the performance of attitudes and actions that are considered socially acceptable for one's sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}}

West and Zimmerman suggested that the interactional process of ''doing gender'', combined with socially agreed upon gender expectations, holds individuals accountable for their gender performances.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They also believe that while "doing gender" appropriately strengthens and promotes social structures based on the gender dichotomy, it inappropriately does not call into question these same social structures; only the individual actor is questioned.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; The concept of "doing gender" recognizes that gender both structures human interactions and is created through them.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;

== Criticism of the "sex difference" versus "gender difference" distinction ==

The current distinction between the terms ''sex difference'' versus ''gender difference'' has been criticized as misleading and counterproductive. These terms suggest that the behavior ''of an individual'' can be partitioned into separate biological and cultural factors. (However, behavioral differences between individuals can be statistically partitioned, as studied by [[behavioral genetics]].) Instead, all behaviors are phenotypes—a complex interweaving of both nature and nurture.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D., &amp;  Kaufer, D. (2011).  [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31233/title/Beyond-Nature-vs--Nurture/ Beyond Nature vs. Nurture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104094323/http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view%2FarticleNo%2F31233%2Ftitle%2FBeyond-Nature-vs--Nurture%2F |date=2014-01-04 }}.  The Scientist.  October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diane F. Halpern|Diane Halpern]], in her book ''[[Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities]],'' argued problems with ''sex'' vs. ''gender'' terminology:  "I cannot argue (in this book) that nature and nurture are inseparable and then... use different terms to refer to each class of variables.  The  ...biological manifestations of sex are confounded with psychosocial variables.... The use of different terms to label these two types of contributions to human existence seemed inappropriate in light of the biopsychosocial position I have taken."  She quotes [[Steven Pinker]]'s summary of the problems with the terms sex and gender: "Part of it is a new prissiness -- many people today are as squeamish about sexual dimorphism as the Victorians were about sex. But part of it is a limitation of the English language. The word 'sex' refers ambiguously to copulation and to sexual dimorphism..."&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D. (2012). Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities (4th Ed.). NY: Psychology Press. p. 35 - 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Lippa writes in ''Gender, Nature and Nurture'' that "Some researchers have argued that the word ''sex'' should be used to refer to (biological differences), whereas the word ''gender'' should be used to refer to (cultural differences). However, it is not at all clear the degree to which the differences between males and females are due to biological factors versus learned and cultural factors. Furthermore, indiscriminate use of the word ''gender'' tends to obscure the distinction between two different topics: (a) differences between males and females, and (b) individual differences in maleness and femaleness that occur within each sex."&lt;ref&gt;Lippa, R. (2005). Gender, Nature and Nurture. NJ: LEA, p 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that more useful distinctions to make would be whether a behavioral difference between the sexes is first due to an evolved [[adaptation]], then, if so, whether the adaptation is sexually dimorphic (different) or sexually monomorphic (the same in both sexes). The term ''sex difference'' could then be re-defined as between-sex differences that are manifestations of a sexually dimorphic adaptation (which is how many scientists use the term),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|title=Standards of evidence for designed sex differences|author=|date=|website=ucsb.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223410/http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bourke CH |author2=Harrell CS |author3=Neigh GN |title=Stress-induced sex differences: adaptations mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=210–8 |date=August 2012  |pmid=22426413 |pmc=3384757 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term ''gender difference'' could be re-defined as due to differential socialization between the sexes of a monomorphic adaptation or byproduct. For example, greater male propensity toward physical aggression and risk taking would be termed a "sex difference;" the generally longer head hair length of females would be termed a "gender difference."&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M.E.

== Feminism ==
{{Main|Feminism}}
{{See also|Feminist views on transgender topics}}

===General===
Many feminists consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For example, Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, states that "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., The Gender and Science Reader, New York: Routledge. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the sex/gender distinction, also known as the Standard Model of Sex/Gender, is criticized by feminists who believe that there is undue emphasis placed on sex being a biological aspect, something that is fixed, natural, unchanging, and consisting of a male/female dichotomy. They believe the distinction fails to recognize anything outside the strictly male/female dichotomy and that it creates a barrier between those that fit as 'usual' and those that are 'unusual'. In order to prove that sex is not only limited to two categories [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s ''Sexing the Body'' addresses the birth of children who are intersex. In this case, the standard model (sex/gender distinction) is seen as incorrect with regard to its notion that there are only two sexes, male and female. This is because "complete maleness and complete femaleness represent the extreme ends of a spectrum of possible body types."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne "Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 44-77].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Fausto-Sterling argues that there are multitudes of sexes in between the two extremes of male and female.

Rather than viewing sex as a biological construct, there are feminists who accept both sex and gender as a social construct. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of 'intersex' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex."&lt;ref&gt;ISNA."Frequently Asked Questions." Intersex Society of North America 1993-2008. {{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519013103/http://www.isna.org/ |archivedate=2016-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling believes that sex is socially constructed because nature does not decide on who is seen as a male or female physically. Rather, doctors decide what seems to be a "natural" sex for the inhabitants of society. In addition, the gender, behavior, actions, and appearance of males/females is also seen as socially constructed because codes of femininity and masculinity are chosen and deemed fit by society for societal usage.

=== Limitations ===

Some feminists go further and argue that neither sex nor gender are strictly binary concepts. [[Judith Lorber]], for instance, has stated that many conventional indicators of sex are not sufficient to demarcate male from female. For example, not all women lactate, while some men do.&lt;ref name="lorber"&gt;Lorber, Judith (1993). [http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124221303/http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }}. Retrieved on 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Suzanne Kessler, in a 1990 survey of medical specialists in pediatric intersexuality, found out that when a child was born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia, its sex was often determined according to the size of its penis.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Suzanne (1990). "The Medical Construction of Gender: Case Management of Intersexed Infants". ''Signs'', Vol. 16, No. 1: 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even if the sex/gender distinction holds, Lorber and Kessler suggest that the dichotomies of female/male and masculine/feminine are not themselves exhaustive. Lorber writes, "My perspective goes beyond accepted feminist views that gender is a cultural overlay that modifies physiological sex differences [...] I am arguing that bodies differ in many ways physiologically, but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are 'female' and 'male' and 'women' and 'men.'"&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt;

Moreover, Lorber has alleged that there exists more diversity within the individual categories of sex and gender—female/male and feminine/masculine, respectively—than between them.&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt; Hence, her fundamental claim is that both sex and gender are social constructions, rather than [[natural kind]]s.

A comparable view has been advanced by Linda Zerilli, who writes regarding [[Monique Wittig]], that she is "critical of the sex/gender dichotomy in much feminist theory because such a dichotomy leaves unquestioned the belief that there is a 'core of nature which resists examination, a relationship excluded from the social in the analysis—a relationship whose characteristic is ineluctability in culture, as well as in nature, and which is the heterosexual relationship.'"&lt;ref&gt;Zerilli, Linda M. G., ''The Trojan Horse of Universalism: Language As a 'War Machine' in the Writings of Monique Wittig'', in Robbins, Bruce, ed., ''The Phantom Public Sphere'' (Minneapolis, Minn.: Univ. of Minn. Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|0-8166-2124-1}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;153–154 (n.&amp;nbsp;35 (citing Wittig, Monique, ''The Straight Mind'', in ''Feminist Issues'', vol. 1, no. 1, Summer, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;107) omitted) (author asst. prof., poli. sci. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; ed. teaches, Eng. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; coeditor, ''Social Text'') (em-dash surrounded by half-spaces in original).&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler also criticizes the sex/gender distinction. Discussing sex as biological fact causes sex to appear natural and politically neutral. However, she argues that "the ostensibly natural facts of sex [are] discursively produced in the service of other political and social interests." Butler concludes, "If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=9–11|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Somatic markers" are feelings in the body that are associated with emotions, such as the association of rapid heartbeat with [[anxiety]] or of [[nausea]] with [[disgust]]. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers strongly influence subsequent decision-making. Within the brain, somatic markers are thought to be processed in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex|ventromedial]] [[prefrontal cortex]] (VMPFC) and the [[amygdala]]. The hypothesis has been tested in experiments using the [[Iowa gambling task]].

K. | last4 = Welch | first4 = N. |title=Risk as feelings |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=267–86 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11316014 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/127/2/267 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.2.267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the somatic marker hypothesis proposes that emotions play a critical role in the ability to make fast, rational decisions in complex and uncertain situations.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt;

Patients with frontal lobe damage, such as [[Phineas Gage]], provided the first evidence that the frontal lobes were associated with decision-making. Frontal lobe damage, particularly to the [[Ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] (vmPFC), results in impaired abilities to organize and plan behavior and learn from previous mistakes, without affecting intellect in terms of [[working memory]], [[attention]], and [[Sentence processing|language comprehension and expression]].&lt;ref name=Damasio1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Damasio|first=A.|title=Somatic Markers and the Guidance of Behavior|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=217–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tranel1994&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tranel | first = D. |title="Acquired sociopathy": the development of sociopathic behavior following focal brain damage |journal=Prog Exp Pers Psychopathol Res |volume= |issue= |pages=285–311 |date=1994 |pmid=8044207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

vmPFC patients also have difficulty expressing and experiencing appropriate emotions. This led Antonio Damasio to hypothesize that decision-making deficits following vmPFC damage result from the inability to use emotions to help guide future behavior based on past experiences. Consequently, vmPFC damage forces those afflicted to rely on slow and laborious cost-benefit analyses for every given choice situation.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bechara|first=A.|last2=Damasio |first2=A.R.|title=The somatic marker hypothesis: A neural theory of economic decision|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|year=2005|volume=52|pages=336–372|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2004.06.010|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis==
When individuals [[decision-making|make decisions]], they must assess the [[incentive]] value of the choices available to them, using [[cognitive]] and emotional processes. When the individuals face complex and conflicting choices, they may be unable to decide using only cognitive processes, which may become overloaded. Emotions, consequently, are hypothesized to guide decision-making.

Emotions, as defined by Damasio, are changes in both body and brain states in response to stimuli.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; Physiological changes (such as [[muscle tone]], [[heart rate]], [[endocrine system|endocrine activity]], [[posture (psychology)|posture]], [[facial expression]], and so forth) occur in the body and are relayed to the brain where they are transformed into an emotion that tells the individual something about the stimulus that they have encountered. Over time, emotions and their corresponding bodily changes, which are called "somatic markers", become associated with particular situations and their past outcomes.

When making subsequent decisions, these somatic markers and their evoked emotions are consciously or unconsciously associated with their past outcomes, and influence decision-making in favor of some behaviors instead of others.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; For instance, when a somatic marker associated with a positive outcome is perceived, the person may feel happy and thereby motivated to pursue that behavior. When a somatic marker associated with the negative outcome is perceived, the person may feel sad, which acts as an internal alarm to warn the individual to avoid that course of action. These situation-specific somatic states based on, and reinforced by, past experiences help to guide behavior in favor of more advantageous choices, and therefore are adaptive.

According to the hypothesis, two distinct pathways reactivate somatic marker responses. In the first pathway, emotion can be evoked by changes in the body that are projected to the brain – called the "body loop". For instance, encountering a feared object like a snake may initiate the [[fight-or-flight]] response and cause fear. In the second pathway, cognitive representations of the emotions (imagining an unpleasant situation "as-if" you were in that particular situation) can be activated in the brain without being directly elicited by a sensory stimulus – called the "[[as-if body loop]]". Thus, the brain can anticipate expected bodily changes, which allows the individual to respond faster to external stimuli without waiting for an event to actually occur.&lt;ref name=Damasio1991 /&gt; The amygdala and VMPFC (a subsection of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex or OMPFC) are essential components of this hypothesized mechanism, and therefore damage to either structure will disrupt decision-making.

==Experimental evidence==
{{Main article|Iowa gambling task}}
In an effort to produce a simple [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] tool that would assess deficits in emotional processing, decision-making, and [[social skills]] of OMPFC-[[lesion]]ed individuals, Bechara and collaborators created the [[Iowa gambling task]].&lt;ref name="DTD1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bechara1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bechara | first1 = A. | first2 = A. R. |last2=Damasio | first3 = H. |last3=Damasio | first4 = S. W. |last4=Anderson |title=Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex |journal=Cognition |volume=50 |issue=1–3 |pages=7–15 |date=1994 |pmid=8039375 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(94)90018-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The task measures a form of emotion-based learning. Studies using the gambling task have found deficits in various neurological (such as [[amygdala]] and OMPFC lesions) and psychiatric populations (such as [[schizophrenia]], [[mania]], and [[drug abuse]]rs).

The Iowa gambling task is a computerized test in which participants are presented with four decks of cards from which they repeatedly choose. Each deck contains various amounts of rewards of either $50 or $100, and occasional losses that are greater in the decks with higher rewards. The participants do not know where the penalty cards are located, and are told to pick cards that will maximize their winnings. The most profitable strategy turns out to be to choose cards only from the small reward/small penalty decks, because although the reward is smaller, the penalty is proportionally much smaller than in the high reward/high penalty decks. Over the course of a session, most healthy participants come to adopt the profitable low-penalty deck strategy. Participants with brain damage, however, are unable to determine the better deck to choose from, and continue to choose from the high reward/high penalty decks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dezfouli | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Keramati | first2 = M. M. | last3 = Ekhtiari | first3 = H. | last4 = Safaei | first4 = H. | last5 = Lucas | first5 = C. |chapter=Understanding Addictive Behavior on the Iowa gambling task Using Reinforcement Learning Framework |chapterurl=http://amir.dezfouli.com/pubs/dkesl_cogsci_2008.pdf |title=Proceedings of the 30th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |date=2008 |pages=1094–9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Iowa gambling task measures participants' quickness in "developing anticipatory emotional responses to guide advantageous choices",&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"/&gt; it is helpful in testing the somatic marker hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers give rise to anticipation of the emotional consequences of a decision being made. Consequently, persons who perform well on the task are thought to be aware of the penalty cards and of the negative emotions associated with drawing such cards, and to realize which deck is less likely to yield a penalty.&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wardle | first1 = M. C. | last2 = Gonzalez | first2 = R. | last3 = Bechara | first3 = A. | last4 = Martin-Thormeyer | first4 = E.

This experiment has been used to analyze the impairments suffered by people with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which has been known to affect neural signaling of prospective rewards or punishments. Such persons perform less well on the task.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has been used to analyze the brain during the Iowa gambling task. The brain regions that were activated during the Iowa gambling task were also the ones hypothesized to be triggered by somatic markers during decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = X. | last2 = Lu | first2 = Z.

==Evolutionary significance==
Damasio has posited that the ability of humans to perform abstract thinking quickly and efficiently coincides with both the development of the ventromedial (VM) cortex and with the use of somatic markers to guide human behavior during evolution.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005 /&gt; Patients with damage to the VM cortices are more likely to engage in behaviors that negatively impact personal relationships in the distant future, but they never engage in actions that would lead to immediate harm to themselves or others.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; The evolution of the prefrontal cortex was associated with the ability to represent events that may occur in the future.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005 /&gt;

==Application to risky behavior==
The somatic marker hypothesis has been applied to trying to understand risky behaviors, such as [[risky sexual behavior]] and drug addiction.

According to the hypothesis, riskier sexual behaviors are more exhilarating and pleasurable, and therefore they are more likely to stimulate repetitive engagement in such behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zuckerman | first1 = M. | last2 = Kuhlman | first2 = D. M. |title=Personality and risk-taking: common biosocial factors |journal=J Pers |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=999–1029 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11130742 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0022-3506&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=68&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=999 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this idea was tested in individuals who were infected with [[HIV]] and were [[Substance dependence|substance dependent]], differences were found between persons who scored well in the Iowa gambling test, and those who scored poorly. The high scorers showed a correlation between the amount of distress they reported having over their HIV status, and their acceptance of risk during sexual behavior – the greater the distress, the greater the risk that these people would take. The low scorers, on the other hand, showed no such correlation. These results were interpreted as indicating that persons with intact decision-making abilities are better able to rely on past emotional experiences when weighing risks, than are persons who are deficient in such abilities, and that acceptance of risk serves to ameliorate emotional distress.&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"/&gt;

Drug abusers are thought to ignore the negative consequences of addiction while seeking drugs. According to the somatic marker hypothesis, such abusers are impaired in their ability to recall and consider past unpleasant experiences when weighing whether to consider drug seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="Bechara, A. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bechara | first = A. |title=Risky business: emotion, decision-making, and addiction |journal=J Gambl Stud |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=23–51 | date = 2003 |pmid=12635539 |doi=10.1023/A:1021223113233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verdejo-Garcia A 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verdejo-García | first1 = A. | last2 = Bechara | first2 = A. | last3 = Recknor | first3 = E.

In response to unpleasant images, drug users showed decreased levels of several neuroendocrine markers, including [[norepinephrine]], [[cortisol]], and [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]. Addicts showed lesser responses to both pleasant and unpleasant images, suggesting that they may have a diminished emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerra | first1 = G. | last2 = Baldaro | first2 = B. | last3 = Zaimovic | first3 = A. |title=Neuroendocrine responses to experimentally-induced emotions among abstinent opioid-dependent subjects |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12821203 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871603000656 |doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(03)00065-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroimaging]] studies utilizing fMRI indicate that drug-related stimuli have the ability to activate brain regions involved in emotional evaluation and reward processing. When shown a film of people smoking [[cocaine]], cocaine users showed greater activation of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], the right inferior [[parietal lobe]], and the [[caudate nucleus]] than did non-users. Conversely, the cocaine users showed lesser activation when viewing a sex film than did non-users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garavan | first1 = H. | last2 = Pankiewicz | first2 = J. | last3 = Bloom | first3 = A. |title=Cue-induced cocaine craving: neuroanatomical specificity for drug users and drug stimuli |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=11 |pages=1789–98 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11058476 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=157&amp;page=1789 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.11.1789 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
{{see also|Reward system}}
Some researchers believe that the use of somatic markers (i.e., [[afferent nerve|afferent feedback]]) would be a very inefficient method of influencing behavior. Damasio's notion of the ''as-if'' experience dependent feedback route,&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt;&lt;ref name="Damasio1999"&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio R. |last=Damasio |title=The Feeling of what Happens: Body, Emotion and the Making of Consciousness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usiJxdb897YC |year=2000 |publisher=Vintage |isbn=978-0-09-928876-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby bodily responses are re-represented utilizing the somatosensory cortex ([[postcentral gyrus]]), also proposes an inefficient method of affecting explicit behavior.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rolls |first=E.T. |title=The brain and emotion |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford | date = 1999 |isbn=978-0-19-852464-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolls (1999) stated that; "it would be very inefficient and noisy to place in the execution route a peripheral response, and transducers to attempt to measure that peripheral response, itself a notoriously difficult procedure" (p.&amp;nbsp;73).&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt; Reinforcement association located in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, where the incentive value of stimuli is decoded, is sufficient to elicit emotion-based learning and to affect behavior via, for example, the orbitofrontal-striatal pathway.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolls1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rolls | first = E. T. |title=Consciousness in Neural Networks? |journal=Neural Netw |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1227–40 |date=October 1997 |pmid=12662513 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0893-6080(97)00049-X |doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(97)00049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can occur via implicit or explicit processes.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt;

The somatic marker hypothesis represents a model of how feedback from the body may contribute to both advantageous and disadvantageous decision-making in situations of complexity and uncertainty. Much of its supporting data comes from data taken from the Iowa gambling task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bechara | first1 = A. | last2 = Tranel | first2 = D. | last3 = Damasio | first3 = H. | last4 = Damasio | first4 = A. R. |title=Failure to respond autonomically to anticipated future outcomes following damage to prefrontal cortex |journal=Cereb.

First, the claim that it assesses implicit learning as the reward/punishment design is inconsistent with data showing accurate knowledge of the task possibilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maia | first1 = T. V. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = J. L. |title=A reexamination of the evidence for the somatic marker hypothesis: what participants really know in the Iowa gambling task |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Second, the claim that this knowledge occurs through preventive marker signals is not supported by competing explanations of the psychophysiology generated profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomb | first1 = I. | last2 = Hauser | first2 = M. | last3 = Deldin | first3 = P. | last4 = Caramazza | first4 = A. |title=Do somatic markers mediate decisions on the gambling task? |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=1103–4; author reply 1104 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12403997 |doi=10.1038/nn1102-1103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the claim that the impairment is due to a 'myopia for the future' is undermined by more plausible psychological mechanisms explaining deficits on the tasks such as reversal learning, risk-taking, and working-memory deficits. There may also be more variability in control performance than previously thought, thus complicating the interpretation of the findings. 

Furthermore, although the somatic marker hypothesis has accurately identified many of the brain regions involved in decision-making, emotion, and body-state representation, it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. There are many experiments that could be implemented to further test the somatic marker hypothesis. One way would be to develop variants of the Iowa gambling task that control some of the methodological issues and interpretation ambiguities generated. It may be a good idea to include removing the reversal learning confound, which would make the task more difficult to consciously comprehend. Additionally, causal tests of the somatic marker hypothesis could be practiced more insistently in a greater range of populations with altered peripheral feedback, like on patients with facial paralysis. 

In conclusion, the somatic marker hypothesis needs to be tested in more experiments. Until a wider range of empirical approaches are employed in order to test the somatic marker hypothesis, it appears that the framework is simply an intriguing idea that is in need of some better supporting evidence. Despite these issues, the somatic marker hypothesis and the Iowa gambling task reestablish the notion that emotion has the potential to be a benefit as well as a problem during the decision-making process in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunn | first1 = B.

'''Stoning''', or '''lapidation''', is a method of [[capital punishment]] whereby a group throws [[stones]] at a person until the subject dies. No individual among the group can be identified as the one who kills the subject. This is in contrast to the case of a judicial [[executioner]]. Often slower than other forms of execution, stoning within the context of contemporary [[Western culture]] is considered a form of [[Torturous death|execution by torture]].

Stoning is called ''[[rajm]]'' (Arabic: {{large|رجم}}) in Islamic literature, and is a legal or customary punishment found in the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]], [[Mauritania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], northern [[Nigeria]], [[Aceh|Aceh Province]] of [[Indonesia]], [[Afghanistan]], and tribal parts of [[Pakistan]], including northwest [[Kurram Valley]] and the northwest Khwezai-Baezai region.&lt;ref name=ebtrf/&gt;&lt;ref name="cell phone stoning"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/special-report-the-punishment-was-death-by-stoning-the-crime-having-a-mobile-phone-8846585.html|author=Batha, Emma|title=Special report: The punishment was death by stoning.

====Torah====
The Jewish [[Torah]] (the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]: [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]) serves as a common religious reference for [[Judaism]]. Stoning is the method of execution mentioned most frequently in the Torah. (Murder is not mentioned as an offense punishable by stoning, but it seems that a member of the victim's family was allowed to kill the murderer; see [[avenger of blood]].) The crimes punishable by stoning were the following:

* Touching [[Mount Sinai]] while God was giving [[Moses]] the [[Ten Commandments]], {{bible|Exodus|19:13}}
* An ox that gores someone to death should be stoned, {{bible|Exodus|21:28}}
* Breaking [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], {{bible|Numbers|15:32}}–36
* Giving one's "seed" (presumably [[ child sacrifice]] of one's offspring) "[[Moloch|to Molech]]" {{Bible|Leviticus| 20:2}}-5
* Having a "[[familiar spirit]]" (or being a [[necromancy|necromancer]]) or being a "[[magician (paranormal)|wizard]]", {{bible|Leviticus|20:27}}
* Enticing others to polytheism, {{bible|Deuteronomy|13:7}}–11
* [[Blasphemy|Cursing God]], {{bible|Leviticus|24:10}}–16
* Engaging in [[idolatry]], Deuteronomy 17:2–7; or seducing others to do so, {{bible|Deuteronomy|13:7}}–12
* "Rebellion" against parents, after repeated warnings, {{bible|Deuteronomy|21:18}}–21
* Getting married as though a virgin, when not a virgin, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:13}}–21
* Sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man in a town, since she did not cry out, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:23}}–24; both parties should be stoned to death
* Forced sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man in a field, where no one could hear her cries and save her, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:25}}–27; the man should be stoned

Describing the stoning of those who entice others to [[Apostasy from Judaism|apostates from Judaism]], the [[Torah]] states:
{{quote|If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which [is] as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, ''Let us go and serve other gods'', which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; [Namely], of the gods of the people which [are] round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the [one] end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth; Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; ''neither shall thine eye pity him'', neither shalt thou spare, ''neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou shalt surely kill him''; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.|[[Deuteronomy]] 13:6–10&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.apostolic-churches.net/bible/search/list/?search_book=Deuteronomy&amp;search_chapter_verse=13&amp;varchapter_verse=13:6 13:6–10]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A case noted in the Bible, not falling into any of the above categories, was that of [[Achan (biblical figure)|Achan]], stoned to death [[Collective responsibility|together with]] his sheep, other livestock and his children for having pillaged valuables from [[Jericho]] during [[Joshua]]'s [[Conquest of Canaan]].

====Mishna====
The [[Talmud]] describes four methods of execution: stoning, pouring molten lead down the throat of the condemned person, beheading, and strangulation (see [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]]). The [[Mishna]] gives the following list of persons who should be stoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] Chapter 7, p.&amp;nbsp;53a [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/sanhedrin7.html], in Hebrew: [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l4407.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

"To the following sinners stoning applies – אלו הן הנסקלין
*one who has had [[Incest|relations with his mother]] – הבא על האם
*with his father's wife – ועל אשת האב
*with his daughter-in-law – ועל הכלה
*a human male [[homosexuality|with a human male]] – ועל הזכור
*or [[zoophilia|with cattle]] – ועל הבהמה
*and the same is the case with a woman who uncovers herself before cattle – והאשה המביאה את הבהמה
*with a blasphemer – והמגדף
*an idolater – והעובד עבודת כוכבים
*he who sacrifices one of his children to Molech – והנותן מזרעו למולך
*one that occupies himself with familiar spirits – ובעל אוב
*a wizard – וידעוני
*one who violates Sabbath – והמחלל את השבת
*one who curses his father or mother – והמקלל אביו ואמו
*one who has assaulted a betrothed damsel – והבא על נערה המאורסה
*a seducer who has seduced men to worship idols – והמסית
*and the one who misleads a whole town – והמדיח
*a witch (male or female) – והמכשף
*a stubborn and rebellious son – ובן סורר ומורה"

As God alone was deemed to be the only arbiter in the use of capital punishment, not fallible people, the [[Sanhedrin]] made stoning a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Sanhedrin 41 a)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Botticcelli, Sandro - The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron - 1481-82.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''[[The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron]]'' (1480–1482), by [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].]]

Prior to early Christianity, particularly in the [[Mishnah]], doubts were growing in Jewish society about the effectiveness of capital punishment in general (and stoning in particular) in acting as a useful deterrent. Subsequently, its use was dissuaded by the central legislators. The Mishnah states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called destructive. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says that this extends to a Sanhedrin that puts a man to death even once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Tarfon say: Had we been in the Sanhedrin none would ever have been put to death. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: they would have multiplied shedders of blood in Israel.&lt;ref name = "Tractate makkos"&gt;[[makkot]] 1:10 March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the following centuries the leading Jewish sages imposed so many restrictions on the implementation of capital punishment as to make it ''de facto'' illegal. The restrictions were to prevent execution of the innocent, and included many conditions for a testimony to be admissible that were difficult to fulfill.

Philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] wrote, "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, Sefer Hamitzvot, Negative Commandment no. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; He was concerned that the law guard its public perception, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect. He saw errors of commission as much more threatening to the integrity of law than errors of omission.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–71 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mode of Judgment====
In rabbinic law, capital punishment may only be inflicted by the verdict of a regularly constituted court of twenty-three qualified members. There must be the most trustworthy and convincing testimony of at least two qualified eyewitnesses to the crime, who must also depose that the culprit had been forewarned of the criminality and the consequences of his project.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=128&amp;letter=C&amp;search=stoning |title=Capital Punishment |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culprit must be a person of legal age and of sound mind, and the crime must be proved to have been committed of the culprit's free will and without the aid of others.

On the day the verdict is pronounced, the convict is led forth to execution. The [[Torah Laws|Torah law]] (Leviticus 19:18) prescribes, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"; and the Rabbis maintain that this love must be extended beyond the limits of social intercourse in life, and applied even to the convicted criminal who, "though a sinner, is still thy brother" (Mak. 3:15; Sanh. 44a): "The spirit of love must be manifested by according him a decent death" (Sanh. 45a, 52a). Torah law provides (Deut. 24:16), "The parents shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the parents; every man shall be put to death for his own sins", and rabbinic jurisprudence follows this principle both to the letter and in spirit. A sentence is not attended by confiscation of the convict's goods; the person's possessions descend to their legal heirs.

The [[Talmud]] limits the use of the death penalty to Jewish criminals who:

* (A) while about to do the crime were warned not to commit the crime while in the presence of two witnesses (and only individuals who meet a strict list of standards are considered acceptable witnesses); and
* (B) having been warned, committed the crime in front of the same two witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/orthodoxfaqenkin/f/adultery_punish.htm |title=Ask the Orthodox Rabbi – Adultery in Judaism – Capital Punishment – Death Penalty |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the Talmudic method of how stoning is to be carried out differs from mob stoning. According to the Jewish [[oral law]], after the Jewish criminal has been determined as guilty before the Great [[Sanhedrin]], the two valid witnesses and the sentenced criminal go to the edge of a two-story building. From there the two witnesses are to push the criminal off the roof of a two-story building. The two-story height is chosen as this height is estimated by the Talmud to effect a quick and painless demise but is not so high that the body will become dismembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Babylon Talmud|page= Sanhedrin 45a}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the criminal has fallen, the two witnesses are to drop a large boulder onto the criminal – requiring both of the witnesses to lift the boulder together. If the criminal did not die from the fall or from the crushing of the large boulder, then any people in the surrounding area are to quickly cause him to die by stoning with whatever rocks they can find.

[[File:Amellie - Stoning of the devil 2006 Hajj.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Stoning of the Devil]], 2006 [[Hajj]]]]
Islamic [[sharia law]] is based on the [[Quran]] and the [[hadith]] as primary sources.

====Quran====
The Qur'an does not mention the act of [[Rajm|stoning (Rajm)]] for any crime.

Contrary to popular belief, the punishment for [[Zina|Adultery (Zina)]] in the Quran is not stoning to death but [[flogging]] with a 100 lashes (if the accuser can provide 4 witnesses to the act). If the accuser cannot produce 4 witnesses, he himself will be punished by flogging with 80 lashes. 
	 
{{quotation|"The woman and the man guilty of fornication/adultery,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment."| Qur'an, Sura 24 (An-Nur), [[Ayah|ayat]] 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
	 	
{{quotation|"And those who accuse chaste women then do not bring four witnesses, flog them, (giving) eighty stripes, and do not admit any evidence from them ever; and these it is that are the transgressors. Except those who repent after this and act aright, for surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful." | Qur'an, Sura 24 (An-Nur), [[Ayah|ayat]] 4-5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|4|e=5|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Hadith====
[[Hadith]] refers to orally transmitted reports of statements or actions attributed to Muhammad. It was [[Hadith of Umar's ban on hadith|forbidden]] to record any Hadith on paper by Muhammad himself, [[Rashidun|the first 4 righteous Caliphs after the death of Muhammed]] and the later Caliphs. They believed the Quran was clear, fully detailed, complete, perfect and sufficient. There were fears that people would confuse hadith with the Qur'an, influence would seep in from other creeds, fear for fabrications by heretics,for personal or political gain. The first Hadith (that have survived) were recorded 200 years after the prophets death. There were tens of thousands [[Muhaddis|Muhaddiths]] who had each memorised at least 400,000 narrations along with the chain of narrators for each narration. Out of the hundreds of thousands of Hadith only a very, very small percentage were declared authentic (Sahih) by Hadith Scholars. Hadith Scholars used a number of methods of evaluation to determine the veracity of the recorded oral reports. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, the individual narrators involved in its transmission and cross-referincing the reports.

Muslims vary in degrees of acceptance of the Hadith. To many Sunnite and Shiite Muslims (different collections of) the hadith are almost on par with the Quran itself. To others the Quran is the word of Allah but the Hadith are the words and deeds of a human (the prophet Muhammed) transmitted down by the 200 years old fallible memory of men. Useful but not completely reliable. Some Muslims give little to no credence to the Hadith. Then there are also the different sets of Hadith accepted by different branches of Islam ([[Nikah mut'ah|Temporary Marriage]] or [[Female Genital Mutilation]]) who consider each other's Hadith fake.

Stoning in the [[Sunnah]] mainly follows on the Jewish stoning rules of the Torah. A few hadiths refer to Muhammad ordering the stoning of a married{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}} Jewish man and a married{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}} woman committing an illegal sexual act after consulting the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|93|633}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|56|829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Narrated Ibn 'Umar: A Jew and Jewess were brought to the Prophet on a charge of committing an illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet asked the Jews, "What do you (usually) do with them?" They said, "We blacken their faces and disgrace them." He said, "Bring here the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful." They (fetched it and) came and asked a one-eyed man to recite. He went on reciting till he reached a portion on which he put his hand. The Prophet said, "Lift up your hand!" He lifted his hand up and behold, there appeared the verse of Ar-Rajm (stoning of the adulterers to death). Then he said, "O Muhammad! They should be stoned to death but we conceal this Divine Law among ourselves." Then the Prophet ordered that the two sinners be stoned to death and, and they were stoned to death, and I saw the man protecting the woman from the stones.| ''Volume 9, Book 93, Number 633: (See Hadith No. 809, Vol. 8)''}}

{{quotation|Narrated by 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:The Jews came to Allah's Apostle and told him that a man and a woman from amongst them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Allah's Apostle said to them, "What do you find in the Torah (old Testament) about the legal punishment of Ar-Rajm (stoning)?" They replied, (But) we announce their crime and lash them." Abdullah bin Salam said, "You are telling a lie; Torah contains the order of Rajm." They brought and opened the Torah and one of them solaced his hand on the Verse of Rajm and read the verses preceding and following it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, "Lift your hand." When he lifted his hand, the Verse of Rajm was written there. They said, "Muhammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. ('Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the stones."|''Volume 4, Book 56, Number 829:''}}

In a few others, a Bedouin man is lashed, while a Jewish woman is stoned to death, for having sex outside marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|3|50|885}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|3|49|860}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|8|82|821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, see the following: Bukhari 6:60:79, Bukhari 83:37, Muslim 17:4196, Muslim 17:4206, Muslim 17:4209, Ibn Ishaq 970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nisrine/&gt;&lt;ref name=kalu/&gt; [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters and the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imamah]]. Shi'a sayings related to stoning can be found in [[Kitab al-Kafi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafed.net/books/hadith/wasael-20/v16.html Rafed.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sunni sayings related to stoning can be found in the [[Sahih Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-Arabic-Ask_Scholar/FatwaA/FatwaA&amp;cid=1122528602718 Islamonline.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people results in 100 lashes.

====Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)====
Stoning (Arabic: رجم ''Rajm'', sometimes spelled as ''Rajam'') has been extensively discussed in the texts of early, medieval and modern era Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ismail Poonwala (2004), The Pillars of Islam: Laws pertaining to human intercourse, Oxford University Press, Oxford University Press, pp. 448-457&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Fiqh|traditional jurisprudence]], zina can include adultery (of married parties), fornication (of unmarried parties), prostitution, [[bestiality]], and rape.&lt;ref name=Semerdjian&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Elyse|last=Semerdjian|title=Zinah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

According to the Islamic concept of ''Li'an'', the testimony of a man who accuses his own wife without any other witnesses may be accepted if he swears by God four times that he is telling the truth with a fifth oath to incur God's condemnation if they be lying. In this case, if his wife counter swears, no punishment will be enforced.&lt;ref name="lian"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi|title=Tafhim al-Qur'an, Surah An Noor (The Light)|url=http://englishtafsir.com/Quran/24/index.html#sdfootnote7sym|website=englishtafsir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran 24:6-9, Quote - "And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have (in support) no evidence but their own― their solitary evidence (can be received) if they bear witness four times (with an oath) by Allah that they are solemnly telling the truth; And the fifth (oath) (should be) that they solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on themselves if they tell a lie. But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) by Allah, that (her husband) is telling a lie; And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth. "&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the widely followed Islamic legal commentaries, ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Al-Muwatta]]'' by [[Malik ibn Anas]], state that contested pregnancy is sufficient proof of adultery and the woman must be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="osismuhsan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Al-Muwatta {{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=no|41|1|8|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hanafi
[[Hanafi]] jurists have held that the accused must be a ''muhsan'' at the time of religiously disallowed sex, to be punished by ''Rajm'' (stoning).&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; A ''Muhsan'' is an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony, regardless of whether the marriage still exists.&lt;ref name=osismuhsan&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1587 Muhsan] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, stoning does not apply to someone who was never married in his or her life (only lashing in public is the mandatory punishment in such cases).&lt;ref name=es8&gt;Elyse Semerdjian (2008), "Off the Straight Path": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo, Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0815631736}}, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

For evidence, Hanafi fiqh accepts the following: self-confession, or testimony of four male witnesses (female witness is not acceptable).&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; Hanafi Islamic law literature specifies two types of stoning.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; One, when the punishment is based on ''bayyina'', or concrete evidence (four male witnesses). In this case the person is bound, a pit dug, the bound person placed and partially buried inside the pit so that he or she may not escape, thereafter the public stoning punishment is executed.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; A woman sentenced to stoning must be partially buried up to her chest.&lt;ref name=es8b/&gt; The first stones are thrown by the witnesses and the accuser, thereafter the Muslim community present, stated [[Abū Ḥanīfa]] and other Hanafi scholars.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; In second type of stoning, when the punishment is based on self-confession, the stoning is to be performed without digging a pit or partially burying the person. In this case, the [[qadi]] (judge) should throw the first stone before other Muslims join in. Further, if the person flees, the person is allowed to leave.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt;

Hanafi scholars specify the stone size to be used for ''Rajm'', to be the size of one's hand. It should not be too large to cause death too quickly, nor too small to extend only pain.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt;

[[Hanafi]]s have traditionally held that the witnesses should throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by witnesses, and the ''qadi'' must throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by a confession.&lt;ref name=rp&gt;Rudolph Peters, Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521796705}}, pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

;Shafi'i
The [[Shafii]] school literature has the same Islamic law analysis as the Hanafi. However, it recommends, that the first stone be thrown by the Imam or his deputy in all cases, followed by the Muslim community witnessing the stoning punishment.&lt;ref name=es8b&gt;Elyse Semerdjian (2008), "Off the Straight Path": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo, Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0815631736}}, pp. 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hanbali
[[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudamah]] states, "Muslim jurists are unanimous on the fact that stoning to death is a specified punishment for the married adulterer and adulteress. The punishment is recorded in number of traditions and the practice of Muhammad stands as an authentic source supporting it. This is the view held by all Companions, Successors and other Muslim scholars with the exception of [[Kharijite]]s."&lt;ref name="IslamOnline.net"&gt;{{cite web | author = IslamOnline.net | title = Stoning: Does It Have Any Basis in Shari`ah? | url = http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545902 | accessdate = 2010-07-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100616223242/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545902 | archivedate = 2010-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Maliki
[[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) holds that stoning is the required punishment for illegal sex by a married or widowed person, as well as for any form of homosexual relations among men.&lt;ref name=nisrine/&gt; [[Malik ibn Anas]], founded of Maliki fiqh, considered pregnancy in an unmarried woman as a conclusive proof of [[zina]]. He also stated that contested pregnancy is also sufficient proof of adultery and any Muslim woman who is pregnant by a man who she is not married to, at the time of getting pregnant, must be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="osismuhsan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Later Maliki Muslim scholars admitted the concept of "sleeping embryo", where a divorced woman could escape the stoning punishment, if she remained unmarried and became pregnant anytime within five years of her divorce, and it was assumed that she was impregnated by her previous husband but the embryo remained dormant for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McGarvey | first=Kathleen | title=Muslim and Christian women in dialogue : the case of northern Nigeria | publisher=Peter Lang | location=Oxford New York | year=2009 | isbn=978-3-03911-417-7 | pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Taliban took over, it became a form of punishment for certain serious crimes or [[adultery]].

The most known case in Iran was the stoning of [[Soraya Manutchehri]] in 1986.

;Methods

In the 2008 version of the [[Hudud|Islamic Penal Code]] of Iran detailed how stoning punishments are to be carried out for adultery, and even hints in some contexts that the punishment may allow for its victims to avoid death:&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions&gt;Amnesty International (2008), [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE13/001/2008/en/ Iran - End executions by Stoning]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 102 – An adulterous man shall be buried in a ditch up to near his waist and an adulterous woman up to near her chest and then stoned to death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 103 – In case the person sentenced to stoning escapes the ditch in which they are buried, then if the adultery is proven by testimony then they will be returned for the punishment but if it is proven by their own confession then they will not be returned.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 104 – The size of the stone used in stoning shall not be too large to kill the convict by one or two throws and at the same time shall not be too small to be called a stone.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Depending upon the details of the case, the stoning may be initiated by the judge overseeing the matter or by one of the original witnesses to the adultery.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt; Certain religious procedures may also need to be followed both before and after the implementation of a stoning execution, such as wrapping the person being stoned in traditional burial dress before the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/11/20/graphic-anatomy-of-a-stoning/|title=Anatomy of a stoning – How the law is applied in Iran - National Post|author=Richard Johnson|date=20 November 2010|work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A conviction for adultery of Safia Bibi, a 13-year-old blind girl who alleged that she was raped by her employer and his son, was reversed and the conviction was set aside on appeal after bitter public criticism. Another conviction for adultery and sentence of stoning (of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar) in early 1988 sparked outrage and led to a retrial and acquittal by the Federal Sharia Court. In this case the trial court took the view that notice of divorce by Shahida's former husband, Khushi Muhammad, should have been given to the Chairman of the local council, as stipulated under Section-7(3) of the ''Muslim Family Laws Ordinance'', 1961. This section states that any man who divorces his wife must register it with the Union Council. Otherwise, the court concluded that the divorce stood invalidated and the couple became liable to conviction under the Adultery ordinance. In 2006, the ordinances providing for stoning in the case of adultery or rape were legislatively demoted from overriding status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Protection of Women Act, 2006 (Pakistan)|url=http://af.org.pk/PDF/Newsletters/Issue%2024%20apr%20jun%2008.pdf|website=af.org.pk|publisher=Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2015|location=Islamabad|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somalia===
In October 2008, a girl, [[Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow]], was buried up to her neck at a [[Somalia]]n football stadium, then stoned to death in front of more than 1,000 people. The stoning occurred after she had allegedly pleaded guilty to adultery in a sharia court in [[Kismayo]], a city that was controlled by [[Islamism|Islamist]] insurgents. According to the insurgents she had stated that she wanted sharia law to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7694397.stm|title = Somali woman executed by stoning|date = 2008-10-27|publisher = ''BBC News'' |accessdate = 2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, had begged for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her neck in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7708169.stm | publisher=''BBC News'' | title=Stoning victim 'begged for mercy' | date=2008-11-04 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] later learned that the girl was in fact 13 years old and had been arrested by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabab]] militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2008/10/somalia-girl-stoned-was-child-13-20081031/|title = Somalia: Girl stoned was a child of 13|date=2008-10-31|publisher = [[Amnesty International]]|accessdate = 2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushdoony]], his son Mark and his son-in-law [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], supported the reinstatement of the Mosaic law's penal sanctions.

====Among Muslims====
A survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2013 found varying support in the global Muslim population for stoning as a punishment for adultery (sex between people where at least one person is married; when both participants are unmarried they get 100 lashes). Highest support for stoning is found in Muslims of the Middle East-North Africa region and South-Asian countries while generally less support is found in Muslims living in the Mediterranean and Central Asian countries. Support is consistently higher  in Muslims who want [[Sharia]] to be the law of the land than in Muslims who do not want Sharia.&lt;ref name=Pewsharia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/|title=Muslim Beliefs About Sharia - Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|date=30 April 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for stoning in various countries is as follows:

===Opposition===
Stoning has been condemned by several human rights organizations. Some groups, such as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name = "amnstoning"&gt;{{Cite news|first=|last=|pages=|title = Amina Lawal|year=2003|publisher=Amnesty International|url = http://www.amnesty-1312.de/Main/AminaLawal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Human Rights Watch]], oppose all capital punishment, including stoning. Other groups, such as RAWA ([[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]]), or the International Committee against Stoning (ICAS), oppose stoning ''per se'' as an especially cruel practice.

Specific sentences of stoning, such as the [[Amina Lawal]] case, have often generated international protest. Groups such as Human Rights Watch,&lt;ref name="hrwstoning"&gt;{{Cite news|first=|last=|pages=|title = Nigeria: Debunking Misconceptions on Stoning Case|year = 2003|publisher = Human Rights Watch|url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/10/26/nigeria-debunking-misconceptions-stoning-case}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in sympathy with these protests, have raised a concern that the Western focus on stoning as an especially "exotic" or "barbaric" act distracts from what they view as the larger problems of capital punishment. They argue that the "more fundamental human rights issue in Nigeria is the dysfunctional justice system."

In Iran, the [[Stop Stoning Forever Campaign]] was formed by various women's rights activists after a man and a woman were stoned to death in [[Mashhad]] in May 2006. The campaign's main goal is to legally abolish stoning as a form of punishment for adultery in Iran.&lt;ref name=meydaan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |author=Rochelle Terman |title=The Stop Stoning Forever Campaign: A Report |format=pdf |date=November 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128142135/http://stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
Stoning is condemned by human rights groups as a form of [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and [[torture]], and a serious violation of human rights.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2013/11/afghanistan-reject-stoning-flogging-amputation-and-other-taliban-era-punishments/|title=Amnesty International - Afghanistan: Reject stoning, flogging, amputation and other Taliban-era punishments|date=26 November 2013|work=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/31/sudan-ban-death-stoning|title=Sudan: Ban Death by Stoning - Human Rights Watch|work=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
Stoning has been condemned as a violation of [[women's rights]] and a form of [[discrimination]] against women. Although stoning is also applied to men, the vast majority of the victims are reported to be women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#.Ux-4MM503IU|title=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center - Gender Inequality and Discrimination: The Case of Iranian Women|work=iranhrdc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopstoning.net/IMG/article_PDF/article_20.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313092405/http://www.stopstoning.net/IMG/article_PDF/article_20.pdf |date=March 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2idhp.eu/en/journee-internationale-de-la-femme-2012|title=2012 International Women’s Day «  Institut international des droits de l’homme et de la Paix (2IDHP)|work=2idhp.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the international group Women Living Under Muslim Laws stoning "is one of the most brutal forms of violence perpetrated against women in order to control and punish their sexuality and basic freedoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/media/activists-push-global-ban-stoning|title=Activists push for global ban on stoning|work=wluml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International has argued that the reasons for which women suffer disproportionately from stoning include the fact that women are not treated equally and fairly by the courts; the fact that, being more likely to be [[illiterate]] than men, women are more likely to sign confessions to crimes which they did not commit; and the fact that general discrimination against women in other life aspects leaves them at higher risk of convictions for adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|title=Amnesty International - Iran: Death by stoning, a grotesque and unacceptable penalty|date=15 January 2008|work=amnesty.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020184028/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|archive-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT rights===
Stoning also targets homosexuals and others who have same-sex relations in certain jurisdictions. In Mauritania,&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; northern Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6940061.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gay Nigerians face Sharia death | date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; and Yemen,&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; the legal punishment for [[sodomy]] is death by stoning.

===Right to private life===
Human rights organizations argue that many acts targeted by stoning should not be illegal in the first place, as outlawing them interferes with people's right to a private life. Amnesty International said that stoning deals with "acts which should never be criminalized in the first place, including consensual sexual relations between adults, and choosing one’s religion".&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

'''Termination for Medical Reasons '''(TFMR) is a campaign and support group seeking to change the law in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to allow [[abortion|terminations]] in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities. Amanda Mellet (of [[Mellet v Ireland]]) is a founding member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/i-believe-in-a-loving-god-and-that-i-won-t-be-damned-for-what-i-did-1.502988|page=13|title='I believe in a loving God and that I won't be damned for what I did'|first=Kathy|last=Sheridan|date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Irish Independent|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/couple-to-file-un-petition-after-being-forced-to-travel-for-abortion-29749581.html|title=Couple to file UN petition after being forced to travel for abortion|first=Sam|last=Griffin|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=17 December 2014|first=Freya|last=Drohan|title=Parents of aborted baby: ‘It’s very hard for us not to be cynical’ about Varadkar’s claims|url=http://www.independent.ie/life/family/parenting/parents-of-aborted-baby-its-very-hard-for-us-not-to-be-cynical-about-varadkars-claims-30844231.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
They campaign for better services for people who experience fatal foetal abnormalities. In 2016 they welcomed the Irish government's new guidelines on [[bereavement counselling]] for grieving parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/new-guidelines-for-grieving-parents-welcomed-1.2751389|title=New guidelines for grieving parents welcomed|first=Vivienne|last=Clarke|date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial meeting with politicians==

In April 2012, TFMR met with a group of 25 [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] and [[Seanad Éireann|Senators]] who were investigating how to reply the [[European Court of Human Rights]] judgement in [[A, B and C v Ireland]], and to ask for a change in Ireland's abortion law. Senator [[Rónán Mullen]], who was in attendance, was not sympathetic to their cause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|title=@CoraSherlock @kencurtin @MagicMumCom it is not a claim it was indeed Ronan Mullen|date=21 April 2012|user=TFMRIRE|number=193687994757160960}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking what their real agenda was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=193732169863143426|user=TFMRIRE|title=fyi re senetor ronan mullen his words were "you have a bigger agenda dont you" nasty comment to someone who had just lost their child END OF|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Broadsheet.ie|url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2012/04/21/the-nasty-td-the-smirking-senator/|date=21 April 2012|title=The Nasty TD…The Smirking Senator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=The Late Late Show|series-link=The Late Late Show (Irish TV series)|station=[[RTÉ One]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgq8xUYYFvk|title=TFMR The Late late Show April 20 2012|date=20 April 2012|access-date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicmum.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=182&amp;t=424465&amp;start=24#p4919042|date=19 April 2012|title=MagicMum.com - View topic - FineGael TD : Fornication main cause of unwanted pregnancy|website=MagicMum.com|quote=He told me i {{sic|should of}} carried my baby till the end because Ireland has the best Palletive care in the world, he also said that he was sponosoring some child in africa that had one of the conditions that the other girl Ruths baby had.

During the debate on the [[Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013]], the group called for an exception to allow termination in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/call-for-fatal-foetal-abnormalities-amendment-to-bill-1.1443325|title=Call for fatal foetal abnormalities amendment to Bill|first=Mary|last=Minihan|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Irish Independent|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/call-on-fatal-foetal-abnormalities-29375216.html|title=Call on fatal foetal abnormalities|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] claimed it would be unconstitutional to include that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/unconstitutional-to-include-fatal-foetal-abnormalities-in-legislation-taoiseach-says-1.1443863|title=Unconstitutional to include fatal foetal abnormalities in legislation, Taoiseach says|first=Marie|last=O'Halloran|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Irish Independent|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/taoiseach-refuses-to-change-abortion-law-to-cover-fatal-foetal-abnormality-29376139.html|title=Taoiseach refuses to change abortion law to cover fatal foetal abnormality|first=Michael|last=Brennan|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizens' Assembly==
{{see also|Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)}}

In 2016 the Irish government set up a Citizens' Assembly to discuss [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland's abortion laws]]. TFMR made a submission calling for a repeal of the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] and the removal of abortion from criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repealeight.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TFMR-Ireland.pdf|title=TFMR Ireland Submission to the Citizens' Assembly|date=14 December 2016|publisher=Termination for Medical Reasons}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p6}}

They were not invited to present to the Citizens' Assembly. [[Every Life Counts]], a similar support/campaign group for parents of children disagnosed with fatal foetal abnormalities, but who are opposed to change in Ireland's abortion law, were invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/News/17-Advocacy-Groups-to-Address-Citizens-Assembly-on-the-Topic-of-Eighth-Amendment.html|title=17 Advocacy Groups to Address Citizens' Assembly on the Topic of Eighth Amendment|date=21 February 2017|publisher=[[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/lifestyle/health/bereaved-parents-who-lost-babies-9919830|title=Bereaved parents who lost babies due to fatal foetal abnormalities excluded from speaking at sitting of the Citizens’ Assembly|date=26 February 2017|first=Slyvia|last=Pownall|newspaper=Irish Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Translation''' is the communication of the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a [[source language (translation)|source-language]] text by means of an [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalent]] [[target language (translation)|target-language]] text.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Namit Bhatia, ed., 1992, pp. 1,051–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English language draws a [[terminology|terminological]] distinction (not all languages do) between ''translating'' (a written text) and ''interpreting'' (oral or sign-language communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of [[writing]] within a language community.

A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language [[word]]s, [[grammar]], or [[syntax]] into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such "spill-overs" have sometimes imported useful source-language [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s that have enriched target languages.  Translators, including early translators of [[sacred text]]s, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 1983, pp. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to [[machine translation|automate translation]] or to [[computer-assisted translation|mechanically aid the human translator]].&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Hutchins, ''Early Years in Machine Translation: Memoirs and Biographies of Pioneers'', Amsterdam, John Benjamins, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the rise of the [[Internet]] has fostered a [[world-wide market]] for [[translation services]] and has facilitated "[[language localization]]".&lt;ref&gt;M. Snell-Hornby, ''The Turns of Translation Studies: New Paradigms or Shifting Viewpoints?'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2006, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Rosetta Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|115px|left|[[Rosetta Stone]], a [[secular icon]] for the art of translation.&lt;ref&gt;"Rosetta Stone", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 5th ed., 1994, p. 2,361.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[English language|English]] word "translation" derives from the [[Latin]] word ''translatio'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vélez|first1=Fabio|title=Antes de Babel|pages=3–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from ''[[Wiktionary:trans#Latin|trans]]'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:fero#Latin|ferre]]'', "to carry" or "to bring" (''-latio'' in turn coming from ''latus'', the [[past participle]] of ''ferre'').  Thus ''translatio'' is "a carrying across" or "a bringing across":  in this case, of a text from one language to another.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germanic languages]] (except for modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and some [[Slavic languages]] have [[calque#Loan translation: translatio and traductio|calque]]d their words for the [[concept]] of "translation" on ''translatio''.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Romance languages]] and the remaining ''Slavic'' languages have derived their words for the concept of "translation" from an alternative Latin word, ''traductio'', itself derived from ''traducere'' ("to lead across" or "to bring across", from ''trans'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:duco#Latin|ducere]]'', "to lead" or "to bring").&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] term for "translation", {{lang|grc|μετάφρασις}} (''metaphrasis'', "a speaking across"), has supplied [[English language|English]] with "[[metaphrase]]" (a "[[literal translation|literal]]", or "word-for-word", translation)—as contrasted with "[[paraphrase]]" ("a saying in other words", from  {{lang|grc|παράφρασις}}, ''paraphrasis'').&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83" /&gt; "Metaphrase" corresponds, in one of the more recent terminologies, to "[[Translation#Equivalence|formal equivalence]]"; and "paraphrase", to "[[Translation#Equivalence|dynamic equivalence]]".&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, the concept of metaphrase—of "word-for-word translation"—is an [[Perfection|imperfect]] concept, because a given word in a given language often carries more than one meaning; and because a similar given meaning may often be represented in a given language by more than one word.  Nevertheless, "metaphrase" and "paraphrase" may be useful as ''ideal'' concepts that mark the extremes in the spectrum of possible approaches to translation.{{efn|"Ideal concepts" are useful as well in other fields, such as [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], which include the concepts of perfectly solid bodies, perfectly rigid bodies, perfectly plastic bodies, perfectly black bodies, perfect crystals, perfect fluids, and perfect gases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'' (first published in Polish in 1976 as ''O doskonałości''); English translation by [[Christopher Kasparek]] subsequently serialized in 1979–1981 in ''Dialectics and Humanism:  The Polish Philosophical Quarterly'', and reprinted in [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'', Warsaw University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theories==

===Western theory===
[[File:John Dryden by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|125px|[[John Dryden]]]]
Discussions of the theory and practice of translation reach back into [[ancient history|antiquity]] and show remarkable continuities. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] distinguished between ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation]]) and ''[[paraphrase]]''. This distinction was adopted by English [[poet]] and [[translator]] [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), who described translation as the judicious blending of these two modes of phrasing when selecting, in the target language, "counterparts," or [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]], for the expressions used in the source language:

{{blockquote|When [words] appear... literally graceful, it were an injury to the author that they should be changed. But since... what is beautiful in one [language] is often barbarous, nay sometimes nonsense, in another, it would be unreasonable to limit a translator to the narrow compass of his author's words: 'tis enough if he choose out some expression which does not vitiate the sense.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;}}

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Dryden cautioned, however, against the license of "imitation", i.e., of adapted translation: "When a painter copies from the life... he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments..."&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

This general formulation of the central concept of translation—[[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalence]]—is as adequate as any that has been proposed since [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]], who, in 1st-century-BCE [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], famously and literally cautioned against translating "word for word" ({{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}).&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

Despite occasional theoretical diversity, the actual ''practice'' of translation has hardly changed since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Except for some extreme [[metaphrase]]rs in the early [[Christian]] period and the [[Middle Ages]], and adapters in various periods (especially pre-Classical Rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]]—"[[literal translation|literal]]" where possible, [[paraphrase|paraphrastic]] where necessary—for the original [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and other crucial "values" (e.g., [[Style (fiction)|style]], [[verse form]], concordance with [[music]]al accompaniment or, in [[film]]s, with speech [[Manner of articulation|articulatory]] movements) as determined from context.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

In general, translators have sought to preserve the [[Context (language use)|context]] itself by reproducing the original order of [[sememe]]s, and hence [[word order]]—when necessary, reinterpreting the actual [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, for example, by shifting from [[active voice|active]] to [[passive voice]], or ''vice versa''. The grammatical differences between "fixed-word-order" [[language]]s&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[analytic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]]) and "free-word-order" languages&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[synthetic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]]) have been no impediment in this regard.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  The particular [[syntax]] (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language. 
[[File:Martin Luther, 1529.jpg|thumb|left|110px|[[Martin Luther]]]]
When a target language has lacked [[terminology|terms]] that are found in a source language, translators have borrowed those terms, thereby enriching the target language. Thanks in great measure to the exchange of [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s between languages, and to their importation from other languages, there are few [[concept]]s that are "[[untranslatability|untranslatable]]" among the modern European languages.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  A greater problem, however, is translating terms relating to cultural concepts that have no equivalent in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of this are described in the article, [http://www.noproblem.no/translate.html "Translating the 17th of May into English and other horror stories"], retrieved 2010-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  For full comprehension, such situations require the provision of a [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]].

Generally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of [[metaphrase]] to [[paraphrase]] that may be used in translating among them. However, due to shifts in [[ecological niche]]s of words, a common [[etymology]] is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language. For example, the English ''actual'' should not be confused with the [[cognate]] French {{lang|fr|actuel}} ("present", "current"), the Polish {{lang|pl|aktualny}} ("present", "current," "topical", "timely", "feasible"),&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''aktuell'' ("topical", "presently of importance"), the Russian {{lang|ru|актуальный}} ("urgent", "topical") or the Dutch ''actueel'' ("current").

The translator's role as a bridge for "carrying across" values between cultures has been discussed at least since [[Terence]], the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an [[artist]].  The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as [[Cicero]]. [[John Dryden|Dryden]] observed that "Translation is a type of drawing after life..." Comparison of the translator with a [[musician]] or [[actor]] goes back at least to [[Samuel Johnson]]'s remark about [[Alexander Pope]] playing [[Homer]] on a [[flageolet]], while Homer himself used a [[bassoon]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;
[[File:Herder by Kügelgen.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Johann Gottfried Herder]]]]
If translation be an art, it is no easy one.  In the 13th century, [[Roger Bacon]] wrote that if a translation is to be true, the translator must know both [[language]]s, as well as the [[science]] that he is to translate; and finding that few translators did, he wanted to do away with translation and translators altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|125px|[[Ignacy Krasicki]]]]
The translator of the Bible into German, [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), is credited with being the first European to posit that one translates satisfactorily only toward his own language. L.G. Kelly states that since [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century, "it has been axiomatic" that one translates only toward his own language.&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Kelly, cited in Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding the demands on the translator is the fact that no [[dictionary]] or [[thesaurus]] can ever be a fully adequate guide in translating. The Scottish historian [[Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|Alexander Tytler]], in his ''Essay on the Principles of Translation'' (1790), emphasized that assiduous [[reading (activity)|reading]] is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including [[listening]] to the [[spoken language|''spoken'' language]], had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and [[grammar]]ian [[Onufry Kopczyński]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The translator's special role in society is described in a posthumous 1803 essay by "Poland's [[La Fontaine]]", the Roman Catholic [[Primate of Poland]], [[Poetry|poet]], [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]], [[Novelist|author]] of the first Polish novel, and translator from French and Greek, [[Ignacy Krasicki]]:

{{blockquote|[T]ranslation... is in fact an art both estimable and very difficult, and therefore is not the labor and portion of common minds; [it] should be [practiced] by those who are themselves capable of being actors, when they see greater use in translating the works of others than in their own works, and hold higher than their own glory the service that they render their country.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 87, from [[Ignacy Krasicki]], {{lang|pl|"O tłumaczeniu ksiąg"}} ("On Translating Books"), in {{lang|pl|Dzieła wierszem i prozą}} (Works in Verse and Prose), 1803, reprinted in [[Edward Balcerzan]], ed., {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other traditions===
Due to [[Western colonialism]] and cultural dominance in recent centuries, Western translation traditions have largely replaced other traditions. The Western traditions draw on both ancient and medieval traditions, and on more recent European innovations.

Though earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when dealing with their products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-Western or pre-Western environments. Also, though heavily influenced by Western traditions and practiced by translators taught in Western-style educational systems, Chinese and related translation traditions retain some theories and philosophies unique to the Chinese tradition.

==== Near East ====
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
Traditions of translating material among the languages of ancient [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Assyria]] ([[Syriac language]]), [[Anatolia]], and [[Israel]] ([[Hebrew language]]) go back several millennia.  There exist partial translations of the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (c. 2000 BCE) into [[Southwest Asia]]n languages of the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a [[bilingual]] document is the 1274 BCE [[Treaty of Kadesh]] between the [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Hittite Empire|Hittie empire]]s.

====Asia====
{{Further|Chinese translation theory}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] by [[Kumārajīva]]:  world's oldest known dated printed book (868 CE)]]

There is a separate tradition of translation in [[South Asia|South]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]] (primarily of texts from the [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] civilizations), connected especially with the rendering of religious, particularly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], texts and with the governance of the Chinese empire. Classical Indian translation is characterized by loose adaptation, rather than the closer translation more commonly found in Europe; and [[Chinese translation theory]] identifies various criteria and limitations in translation.

In the East Asian sphere of Chinese cultural influence, more important than translation ''per se'' has been the use and reading of Chinese texts, which also had substantial influence on the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, with substantial [[Sino-Xenic vocabularies|borrowings of Chinese vocabulary]] and writing system. Notable is the Japanese [[kanbun]], a system for [[Gloss (annotation)|glossing]] Chinese texts for Japanese speakers.

Though Indianized states in [[Southeast Asia]] often translated [[Sanskrit]] material into the local languages, the literate elites and scribes more commonly used Sanskrit as their primary language of culture and government.
[[File:VOA Perry Link.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Perry Link]]]]
Some special aspects of translating from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are illustrated in [[Perry Link]]'s discussion of translating the work of the [[Tang Dynasty]] poet [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (699–759 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry" (review of [[Eliot Weinberger]], with an afterword by [[Octavio Paz]], ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)'', New Directions; and [[Eliot Weinberger]], ''The Ghosts of Birds'', New Directions), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Some of the art of classical [[Chinese poetry]] [writes Link] must simply be set aside as [[untranslatability|untranslatable]].  The internal structure of [[Chinese characters]] has a beauty of its own, and the [[calligraphy]] in which classical poems were written is another important but untranslatable dimension.  Since Chinese characters do not vary in length, and because there are exactly five characters per line in a poem like [the one that [[Eliot Weinberger]] discusses in ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)''], another untranslatable feature is that the written result, hung on a wall, presents a rectangle.  Translators into languages whose word lengths vary can reproduce such an effect only at the risk of fatal awkwardness....

Another imponderable is how to imitate the 1-2, 1-2-3 [[rhythm]] in which five-[[syllable]] lines in classical Chinese poems normally are read.  Chinese characters are pronounced in one syllable apiece, so producing such rhythms in Chinese is not hard and the results are unobtrusive; but any imitation in a Western language is almost inevitably stilted and distracting.  Even less translatable are the patterns of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] arrangement in classical Chinese poetry.  Each syllable (character) belongs to one of two categories determined by the [[pitch contour]] in which it is read; in a classical Chinese poem the patterns of alternation of the two categories exhibit [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and mirroring.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once the [[untranslatability|untranslatables]] have been set aside, the problems for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two:  What does the translator think the poetic line says?  And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]?  Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate."  Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit [[dilemma]].  At the [[literal translation|literalist]] extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about the language of the original Chinese poem.  "The dissection, though," writes Link, "normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the [[scalpel]] of an [[anatomy]] instructor does to the life of a frog."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"/&gt;

Chinese characters, in avoiding [[grammar|grammatical]] specificity, offer advantages to poets (and, simultaneously, challenges to poetry translators) that are associated primarily with absences of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]].&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the norm in classical Chinese poetry, and common even in modern Chinese prose, to omit [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]]; the reader or listener infers a subject.  Some Western languages, however, ask by grammatical rule that subjects always be stated.  Most of the translators cited in Eliot Weinberger's ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]]'' supply a subject.  Weinberger points out, however, that when an "I" as a subject is inserted, a "controlling individual mind of the poet" enters and destroys the effect of the Chinese line.  Without a subject, he writes, "the experience becomes both universal and immediate to the reader."  Another approach to the subjectlessness is to use the target language's [[passive voice]]; but this again particularizes the experience too much.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

[[Noun]]s have no [[Grammatical number|number]] in Chinese.  "If," writes Link, "you want to talk in Chinese about one rose, you may, but then you use a "[[measure word]]" to say "one blossom-of roseness."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Chinese [[verb]]s are [[grammatical tense|tense]]-less:  there are several ways to specify when something happened or will happen, but [[verb tense]] is not one of them.  For poets, this creates the great advantage of [[ambiguity]].  According to Link, Weinberger's insight about subjectlessness—that it produces an effect "both universal and immediate"—applies to timelessness as well.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Link proposes a kind of uncertainty principle that may be applicable not only to translation from the Chinese language, but to all translation:

{{blockquote|Dilemmas about translation do not have definitive right answers (although there can be unambiguously wrong ones if misreadings of the original are involved).  Any translation (except machine translation, a different case) must pass through the mind of a translator, and that mind inevitably contains its own store of perceptions, memories, and values.

[[Eliot Weinberger|Weinberger]] [...] pushes this insight further when he writes that "every reading of every poem, regardless of language, is an act of translation:  translation into the reader's intellectual and emotional life."  Then he goes still further:  because a reader's mental life shifts over time, there is a sense in which "the same poem cannot be read twice."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;}}

====Islamic world====
Translation of material into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] expanded after the creation of [[Arabic script]] in the 5th century, and gained great importance with the rise of [[Islam]] and Islamic empires. Arab translation initially focused primarily on politics, rendering Persian, Greek, even Chinese and Indic diplomatic materials into Arabic. It later focused on translating classical Greek and Persian works, as well as some Chinese and Indian texts, into Arabic for scholarly study at major Islamic learning centers, such as the [[Madrasah of Al-Karaouine|Al-Karaouine]] ([[Fes]], [[Morocco]]), [[Al-Azhar Madrasah|Al-Azhar]] ([[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]), and the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]]. In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions.

Arabic translation efforts and techniques are important to Western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges.  Especially after the [[Renaissance]], Europeans began more intensive study of Arabic and Persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of Arab and oriental origins.  Arabic and, to a lesser degree, Persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized Western traditions, which in time would overtake the Islamic and oriental traditions.

In the 19th century, after the [[Middle East]]'s [[Islam]]ic clerics and copyists
{{blockquote|had conceded defeat in their centuries-old battle to contain the corrupting effects of the [[printing press]], [an] explosion in publishing... ensued.  Along with expanding secular education, printing transformed an overwhelmingly illiterate society into a partly literate one.

In the past, the [[sheikh]]s and the government had exercised a monopoly over knowledge.  Now an expanding elite benefitted from a stream of information on virtually anything that interested them.  Between 1880 and 1908... more than six hundred newspapers and periodicals were founded in Egypt alone.

The most prominent among them was ''al-Muqtataf''...  [It] was the popular expression of a '''translation movement''' that had begun earlier in the century with military and medical manuals and highlights from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] canon.  ([[Montesquieu]]'s ''Considerations on the Romans'' and [[Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' had been favorites.)&lt;ref name = debellaigue77&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950'', University of Chicago Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translator who contributed mightily to the advance of the Islamic Enlightenment was the Egyptian cleric Rifaa al-Tahtawi (1801–73), who had spent five years in Paris in the late 1820s, teaching religion to Muslim students.  After returning to Cairo with the encouragement of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1769–1849), the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] viceroy of Egypt, al–Tahtawi became head of the new school of languages and embarked on an intellectual revolution by initiating a program to translate some two thousand European and Turkish volumes, ranging from ancient texts on geography and geometry to [[Voltaire]]'s biography of [[Peter the Great]], along with the ''[[Marseillaise]]'' and the entire ''[[Code Napoléon]]''.  This was the biggest, most meaningful importation of foreign thought into Arabic since [[Abbasid]] times (750–1258).&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|In France al-Tahtawi had been struck by the way the [[French language|French]] language... was constantly renewing itself to fit modern ways of living.  Yet [[Arabic]] has its own sources of reinvention.  The root system that Arabic shares with other [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] tongues such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is capable of expanding the meanings of words using structured [[consonant]]al variations:  the word for airplane, for example, has the same root as the word for bird.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

[[File:Muhammad Abduh (trimmed).JPG|thumb|140px|[[Muhammad Abduh]]]]
The movement to translate English and European texts transformed the Arabic and [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman]] [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages, and new words, simplified [[syntax]], and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions.  Educated Arabs and Turks in the new professions and the modernized [[civil service]] expressed [[skepticism]], writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today....  No longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools, interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness.  It had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world."  One of the [[neologisms]] that, in a way, came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was ''"darwiniya"'', or "[[Darwinism]]".&lt;ref name = debellaigue77/&gt;

One of the most influential liberal Islamic thinkers of the time was [[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905), Egypt's senior judicial authority—its chief [[mufti]]—at the turn of the 20th century and an admirer of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] who in 1903 visited Darwin's exponent [[Herbert Spencer]] at his home in [[Brighton]].  Spencer's view of [[social organism|society as an organism]] with its own laws of evolution paralleled Abduh's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when Britain and France divided up the Middle East's countries, apart from Turkey, between them, pursuant to the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]]—in violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar Arab autonomy—there came an immediate reaction:  the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] emerged in Egypt, the [[House of Saud]] took over the [[Hijaz]], and regimes led by army officers came to power in [[Iran]] and Turkey.  "[B]oth illiberal currents of the modern Middle East," writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue|de Bellaigue]], "Islamism and militarism, received a major impetus from Western [[Imperialism|empire-builders]]."  As often happens in countries undergoing social crisis, the aspirations of the Muslim world's translators and modernizers, such as Muhammad Abduh, largely had to yield to retrograde currents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fidelity and transparency&lt;!--linked from 'Friedrich Schleiermacher'--&gt;==
[[File:John Dryden by John Michael Wright, 1668 (detail), National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|right|175px|[[John Dryden|Dryden]]]]
[[Fidelity]] (or "faithfulness") and felicity&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]]), dual ideals in translation, are often (though not always) at odds. A 17th-century French critic coined the phrase "{{lang|fr|les belles infidèles}}" to suggest that translations, like women, can be either faithful or beautiful, but not both.{{efn|French philosopher and writer [[Gilles Ménage]] (1613-92) commented on translations by humanist Perrot Nicolas d'Ablancourt (1606-64):  "They remind me of a woman whom I greatly loved in [[Tours]], who was beautiful but unfaithful."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Amparo Hurtado Albir, ''La notion de fidélité en traduction'' (The Idea of Fidelity in Translation), Paris, Didier Érudition, 1990, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Fidelity]] is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the [[source text]], without distortion.[[Transparency (linguistic)|Transparency]] is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language, and conforms to its grammar, syntax and idiom. [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700) wrote in his preface to the translation anthology ''Sylvae'':
{{blockquote|Where I have taken away some of [the original authors'] Expressions, and cut them shorter, it may possibly be on this consideration, that what was beautiful in the Greek or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English; and where I have enlarg'd them, I desire the false Criticks would not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc'd from him; or at least, if both those considerations should fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if he were living, and an Englishman, they are such as he wou'd probably have written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dryden|first1=John|title=Preface to Sylvae|url=http://www.bartleby.com/204/180.html|website=Bartelby.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translation that meets the criterion of fidelity (faithfulness) is said to be "faithful"; a translation that meets the criterion of transparency, "[[idiomatic]]".  Depending on the given translation, the two qualities may not be mutually exclusive.  The criteria for judging the [[fidelity]] of a translation vary according to the subject, type and use of the text, its literary qualities, its social or historical context, etc.  The criteria for judging the [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] of a translation appear more straightforward: an unidiomatic translation "sounds wrong"; and, in the extreme case of [[literal translation|word-for-word translations]] generated by many [[machine translation|machine-translation]] systems, often results in patent nonsense.
[[File:Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]]]  
Nevertheless, in certain contexts a translator may consciously seek to produce a [[literal translation]]. Translators of [[literary]], [[religious]], or [[historic]] texts often adhere as closely as possible to the source text, stretching the limits of the target language to produce an unidiomatic text.  Also, a translator may adopt expressions from the source language in order to provide "local color".
[[File:Lawrence Venuti.jpeg|thumb|90px|[[Lawrence Venuti|Venuti]]]]
While current Western translation practice is dominated by the dual concepts of "fidelity" and "transparency", this has not always been the case.  There have been periods, especially in pre-Classical Rome and in the 18th century, when many translators stepped beyond the bounds of translation proper into the realm of ''[[adaptation]]''.  [[Adapted translation]] retains currency in some non-Western traditions. The [[India]]n epic, the ''[[Ramayana]]'', appears in many versions in the various [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], and the stories are different in each.  Similar examples are to be found in [[medieval Christianity|medieval Christian]] literature, which adjusted the text to local customs and mores.

Many non-transparent-translation theories draw on concepts from [[German Romanticism]], the most obvious influence being the German theologian and philosopher [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]. In his seminal lecture "On the Different Methods of Translation" (1813) he distinguished between translation methods that move "the writer toward [the reader]", i.e., [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], and those that move the "reader toward [the author]", i.e., an extreme [[fidelity]] to the foreignness of the [[source text]]. Schleiermacher favored the latter approach; he was motivated, however, not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign, as by a nationalist desire to oppose France's cultural domination and to promote [[German literature]].

In recent decades, prominent advocates of such "non-transparent" translation have included the French scholar [[Antoine Berman]], who identified twelve deforming tendencies inherent in most prose translations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoine Berman]], ''L'épreuve de l'étranger'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American theorist [[Lawrence Venuti]], who has called on translators to apply "foreignizing" rather than domesticating translation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Venuti]], "Call to Action", in ''The Translator's Invisibility'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalence===
{{main|Dynamic and formal equivalence}}
The question of [[fidelity]] vs. [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] has also been formulated in terms of, respectively, "''formal'' equivalence" and "''dynamic'' [or ''functional''] equivalence" – expressions associated with the translator [[Eugene Nida]] and originally coined to describe ways of translating the ''[[Bible]]''; but the two approaches are applicable to any translation.  "Formal equivalence" corresponds to "[[metaphrase]]", and "dynamic equivalence" to "[[paraphrase]]".  "Formal equivalence" (sought via [[literal translation|"literal" translation]]) attempts to render the text literally, or "word for word" (the latter expression being itself a word-for-word rendering of the [[classical Latin]] {{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}) – if necessary, at the expense of features natural to the target language.  By contrast, "dynamic equivalence" (or "''functional'' equivalence") conveys the essential thoughts expressed in a source text—if necessary, at the expense of [[literal translation|literality]], original [[sememe]] and [[word order]], the source text's active vs. passive [[voice (grammar)|voice]], etc. 
 
There is, however, no sharp boundary between formal and functional equivalence. On the contrary, they represent a spectrum of translation approaches. Each is used at various times and in various contexts by the same translator, and at various points within the same text – sometimes simultaneously. Competent translation entails the judicious blending of formal and functional [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 83-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common pitfalls in translation, especially when practiced by inexperienced translators, involve false equivalents such as "[[false friend]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog-english.jrlanguage.com/overcome-5-challenges-of-english-to-spanish-translation/|title=How to Overcome These 5 Challenges of English to Spanish Translation|date=23 June 2017|publisher=Jr Language|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[false cognate]]s.

===Back-translation===
A "back-translation" is a translation of a translated text back into the language of the original text, made without reference to the original text. 
Comparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation, much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation.  But the results of such reverse-translation operations, while useful as approximate checks, are not always precisely reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |title=Back Translation: Same questions – different continent |journal=Communicate |issue=Winter 2004 |page=5 |last=Crystal |first=Scott |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520035802/http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because [[linguistic]] symbols ([[word]]s) are often [[ambiguous]], whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal.  In the context of [[machine translation]], a back-translation is also called a "round-trip translation."  When translations are produced of material used in medical [[clinical trial]]s, such as [[informed consent|informed-consent forms]], a back-translation is often required by the [[Ethics Committee (European Union)|ethics committee]] or [[institutional review board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |title=Back Translation for Quality Control of Informed Consent Forms |journal=Journal of Clinical Research Best Practices |format=PDF |accessdate=1 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505141653/http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Twain]] provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a French translation of his [[short story]], "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]".  He published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his English-language original, the French translation, and a "Private History of the 'Jumping Frog' Story". The latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that Twain stated had appeared, unattributed to Twain, in a Professor Sidgwick's ''Greek Prose Composition'' (p.&amp;nbsp;116) under the title, "The Athenian and the Frog"; the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] precursor to Twain's "Jumping Frog" story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ld_3LPm8FKkC&amp;dq=french+The+Jumping+Frog&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4trjrMcmq3&amp;sig=P23kCS1s9qiu-1hdnJSzWWKvIJc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA66,M1 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County|The Jumping Frog]]: In English, Then in French, and Then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil'', illustrated by F. Strothman, New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, MCMIII [1903&amp;#93;].&lt;/ref&gt;

When a document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|The Saragossa Manuscript]]'' by the Polish aristocrat [[Jan Potocki]] (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by [[Edmund Chojecki]] in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost. French-language versions of the complete ''Saragossa Manuscript'' have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki's Polish version.&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', pp. 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many works by the influential [[classical antiquity|Classical]] physician [[Galen]] survive only in medieval [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation. Some survive only in [[Renaissance Latin]] translations from the Arabic, thus at a second remove from the original. To better understand Galen, scholars have attempted back-translation of such works in order to reconstruct the original [[ancient Greek|Greek]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

When historians suspect that a document is actually a translation from another language, back-translation into that hypothetical original language can provide supporting evidence by showing that such characteristics as [[idiom]]s, [[pun]]s, peculiar [[grammar|grammatical]] structures, etc., are in fact derived from the original language.  For example, the known text of the ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' folk tales is in [[High German]] but contains puns that work only when back-translated to [[Low German]].  This seems clear evidence that these tales (or at least large portions of them) were originally written in Low German and translated into High German by an over-metaphrastic translator.

Supporters of [[Aramaic primacy]]—of the view that the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]] or its sources were originally written in the [[Aramaic language]]—seek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of the New Testament make much better sense when back-translated to [[Aramaic]]: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek.  Due to similar indications, it is believed that the 2nd century Gnostic [[Gospel of Judas]], which survives only in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], was originally written in [[Greek language|Greek]].

[[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), the dominant English-language literary figure of his age, illustrates, in his use of back-translation, translators' influence on the evolution of languages and literary styles.  Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in [[preposition]]s because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/data/B_HIST_EU.html Gilman, E.

Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, p. 627f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dryden often translated his writing into [[Latin]], to check whether his writing was concise and elegant, Latin being considered an elegant and long-lived language with which to compare; then he back-translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions, Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English, thus forming the controversial rule of no sentence-ending prepositions, subsequently adopted by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=onepage&amp;q=word%20by%20word%20kory%20stamper&amp;f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=47|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Cf. a supposed comment by [[Winston Churchill]]:  "This is the type of pedantry up with which I will not put."}}

== Translators ==
Competent translators show the following attributes:
*a ''very good'' knowledge of the language, written and spoken, ''from which'' they are translating (the [[Source language (translation)|source language]]);
*an ''excellent'' command of the language ''into which'' they are translating (the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]);
*familiarity with the subject matter of the text being translated;
*a profound understanding of the [[etymological]] and [[idiomatic]] correlates between the two languages, including [[Register (sociolinguistics)|sociolinguistic register]] when appropriate; and
*a finely tuned sense of when to ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation|"translate literally]]") and when to ''[[paraphrase]]'', so as to assure true rather than spurious ''[[Translation#Equivalence|equivalents]]'' between the source- and target-language texts.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXI, nos. 2–3 (1986), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

A competent translator is not only [[bilingual]] but [[bicultural]].  A [[language]] is not merely a collection of [[word]]s and of rules of [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] for generating [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, but also a vast interconnecting system of [[connotation]]s and [[culture|cultural]] references whose mastery, writes [[linguist]] [[Mario Pei]], "comes close to being a lifetime job."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Pei]], ''The Story of Language'', p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator—after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures—may require a minimum of ten years' experience.  Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"/&gt;

The translator's role in relation to a text has been compared to that of an artist, e.g., a musician or actor, who interprets a work of art.  Translation, like other human activities,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], "Can We Ever Master King Lear?", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 3 (February 23, 2017), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; entails making choices, and choice implies interpretation.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;{{efn|"Interpretation" in this sense is to be distinguished from the function of an "[[Translation#Interpreting|"interpreter"]] who translates orally or by the use of [[sign language]].}}  [[Mark Polizzotti]] writes:  "A good translation offers not a reproduction of the work but an interpretation, a re-representation, just as the performance of a [[Play (theatre)|play]] or a [[sonata]] is a representation of the [[Play (theatre)|script]] or the [[Sheet music|score]], one among many possible representations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Polizzotti]], quoted in [[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The English-language novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], whose writings [[Zdzisław Najder]] has described as verging on "auto-translation" from Conrad's Polish and French linguistic personae,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. IX.&lt;/ref&gt; advised his niece and [[Polish language|Polish]] translator [[Aniela Zagórska]]:  "[D]on't trouble to be too scrupulous...  I may tell you (in French) that in my opinion ''il vaut mieux interpréter que traduire'' [it is better to interpret than to translate]....  ''Il s'agit donc de trouver les équivalents.  Et là, ma chère, je vous prie laissez vous guider plutôt par votre tempérament que par une conscience sévère....'' [It is, then, a question of finding the equivalent expressions.  And there, my dear, I beg you to let yourself be guided more by your temperament than by a strict conscience....]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad advised another translator that the prime requisite for a good translation is that it be "idiomatic".  "For in the [[idiom]] is the ''clearness'' of a language and the language's force and its picturesqueness—by which last I mean the picture-producing power of arranged words."&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad thought [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]'s English translation of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''À la recherche du temps perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''—or, in Scott Moncrieff's rendering, ''Remembrance of Things Past'') to be preferable to the French original.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaiser, "A Hero of Translation" (a review of Jean Findlay, ''Chasing Lost Time:  The Life of [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]:  Soldier, Spy, and Translator''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[Translation#Poetry|Poetry]]", below, for a similar observation concerning the occasional superiority of the translation over the original.}}

The necessity of making [[choice]]s, and therefore of interpretation, in translating{{efn|[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]] writes that "translation always involves interpretation, and [requires] every translator... to think as deeply as humanly possible about each verbal, poetic, and interpretative [[choice]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]], "A Doggish Translation" (review of ''The Poems of [[Hesiod]]:  Theogony, Works and Days, and The Shield of Herakles'', translated from the Greek by [[Barry B. Powell]], [[University of California Press]], 2017, 184 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 1 (18 January 2018), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (and in other fields of human endeavor) stems from the [[ambiguity]] that subjectively pervades the [[universe]].  Part of the ambiguity, for a translator, involves the structure of human [[language]]. [[Psychology|Psychologist]] and [[neural science|neural scientist]] [[Gary Marcus]] notes that "virtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways.  Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of linguistic ambiguity is the "pronoun disambiguation problem" ("PDP"):  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such disambiguation is not infallible by a human, either.

Ambiguity is a concern to both translators and, as the writings of poet and literary critic [[William Empson]] have demonstrated, to [[literary criticism|literary critics]].  Ambiguity may be desirable, indeed essential, in [[poetry]] and [[diplomacy]]; it can be more problematic in ordinary [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bromwich]], "In Praise of Ambiguity" (a review of [[Michael Wood (academic)|Michael Wood]], ''On Empson'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''), vol. LXIV, no. 16 (26 October 2017), pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A translator is faced with two contradictory tasks:  when translating, he must strive for [[omniscience]]; when reviewing his translation, he must assume (the naive reader's) [[ignorance]]. 

A translator may render only parts of the original text, provided he indicates that this is what he is doing.  But a translator should not assume the role of [[Censorship|censor]] and surreptitiously delete or [[bowdlerize]] passages merely to please a political or moral interest.&lt;ref name="Billiani, Francesca 2001"&gt;Billiani, Francesca (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Translating has served as a school of writing for many an author, much as the copying of masterworks of [[painting]] has schooled many a novice painter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anka Muhlstein]], "Painters and Writers:  When Something New Happens", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 1 (January 19, 2017), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  A translator who can competently render an author's thoughts into the translator's own language, should certainly be able to adequately render, in his own language, any thoughts of his own.  Translating (like [[analytic philosophy]]) compels precise analysis of [[language|language element]]s and of their usage.  In 1946 the poet [[Ezra Pound]], then at [[St. Elizabeth's Hospital]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], advised a visitor, the 18-year-old beginning poet [[W.S. Merwin]]:  "The work of translation is the best teacher you'll ever have."&lt;ref&gt;''[[W.S. Merwin: To Plant a Tree]]'':  one-hour documentary shown on [[PBS]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Elsewhere Merwin recalls Pound saying:  "[A]t your age you don't have anything to write about.  You may think you do, but you don't.  So get to work translating.  The [[Occitan language|Provençal]] is the real source...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S. Merlin'', edited by [[Michael Wiegers]], Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Merwin, translator-poet who took Pound's advice to heart, writes of translation as an "impossible, unfinishable" art.&lt;ref&gt;Merwin's introduction to his 2013 ''Selected Translations'', quoted by [[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S. Merlin'', edited by [[Michael Wiegers]], Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translators, including monks who spread [[Buddhist]] texts in [[East Asia]], and the early modern European translators of the [[Bible]], in the course of their work have shaped the very [[language]]s into which they have translated. They have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between [[culture]]s; and along with ideas, they have imported from the source languages, into their own languages, [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s of [[grammar|grammatical structures]], [[idiom]]s, and [[vocabulary]].

===Interpreting===

{{Main|Interpreting}}
[[Interpreting]], or "interpretation," is the facilitation of [[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]] [[communication]], either simultaneously or consecutively, between two, or among three or more, speakers who are not speaking, or signing, the same language.  The term "interpreting," rather than "interpretation," is preferentially used for this activity by [[English language|Anglophone]] translators, to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word "[[wikt:interpret|interpretation]]."  Unlike English, many languages do not employ two separate words to denote the activities of [[writing|written]] and live-communication ([[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]]) translators.{{efn|For example, in [[Polish language|Polish]], a "translation" is "{{lang|pl|przekład}}" or "{{lang|pl|tłumaczenie}}." Both "translator" and "interpreter" are "{{lang|pl|tłumacz}}." For a time in the 18th century, however, for "translator," some writers used a word, "{{lang|pl|przekładowca}}," that is no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Balcerzan]], {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), 1977, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Even English does not always make the distinction, frequently using "translating" as a synonym for "interpreting."

Interpreters have sometimes played crucial roles in [[History of the world|history]].  A prime example is [[La Malinche]], also known as ''Malintzin'', ''Malinalli'' and ''Doña Marina'', an early-16th-century [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] woman from the Mexican [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]].  As a child she had been sold or given to [[Maya peoples|Maya]] slave-traders from Xicalango, and thus had become bilingual. Subsequently, given along with other women to the invading Spaniards, she became instrumental in the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of [[Mexico]], acting as interpreter, adviser, intermediary and lover to [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortes and the Fall of Old Mexico'', New York, Simon and Schuster, 1993, pp. 171-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly three centuries later, in the [[United States]], a comparable role as interpreter was played for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804–6 by [[Sacagawea]]. As a child, the [[Lemhi Shoshone]] woman had been kidnapped by [[Hidatsa]] Indians and thus had become bilingual.  Sacagawea facilitated the expedition's traverse of the [[North American continent]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sacagawea", ''[[The Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, volume 24, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sworn translation===
[[Translating for legal equivalence|Sworn translation]], also called "certified translation," aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages. It is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations. Some countries recognize declared competence. Others require the translator to be an official state appointee. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, translators must be accredited by certain translation institutes or associations in order to be able to carry out certified translations.

===Telephone===
Many commercial services exist that will interpret spoken language via telephone.  There is also at least one custom-built mobile device that does the same thing. The device connects users to human interpreters who can translate between English and 180 other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/06/27/186525030/translation-please-hand-held-device-bridges-language-gap |title=Translation, Please: Hand-Held Device Bridges Language Gap |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer assist===
{{Main|Computer-assisted translation}}
Computer-assisted translation (CAT), also called "computer-aided translation," "machine-aided human translation" (MAHT) and "interactive translation," is a form of translation wherein a human translator creates a [[target text]] with the assistance of a computer program. The machine supports a human translator.

Computer-assisted translation can include standard [[dictionary]] and grammar software. The term, however, normally refers to a range of specialized programs available to the translator, including [[translation memory|translation-memory]], [[terminology|terminology-management]], [[concordancer|concordance]], and alignment programs.

These tools speed up and facilitate human translation, but they do not provide translation.  The latter is a function of tools known broadly as machine translation.

==Machine translation==
{{Main|Machine translation}}
Machine translation (MT) is a process whereby a computer program analyzes a [[source text]] and, in principle, produces a target text without human intervention. In reality, however, machine translation typically does involve human intervention, in the form of pre-editing and [[post-editing]].&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;See the [https://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/ annually performed NIST tests since 2001] and [[Bilingual Evaluation Understudy]]&lt;/ref&gt;  With proper [[terminology|terminology work]], with preparation of the [[source text]] for machine translation (pre-editing), and with reworking of the machine translation by a human translator (post-editing), commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results, especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a [[translation memory|translation-memory]] or [[Globalization Management System|globalization-management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Unedited machine translation is publicly available through tools on the [[Internet]] such as [[Google Translate]], [[Babel Fish (website)|Babel Fish]], [[Babylon translator|Babylon]], and [[StarDict]]. These produce rough translations that, under favorable circumstances, "give the gist" of the source text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/why-translation-services-are-more-beneficial-than-machined-translation-programs|title=Why Professional Translators Are More Beneficial Than Google Translate|last=Choquette|first=Brandon|date=January 2016|journal=Interpreter and Translators, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the Internet, translation software can help non-native-speaking individuals understand web pages published in other languages. Whole-page-translation tools are of limited utility, however, since they offer only a limited potential understanding of the original author's intent and context; translated pages tend to be more erroneously humorous and confusing than enlightening.

Interactive translations with [[Pop-up ad|pop-up windows]] are becoming more popular. These tools show one or more possible equivalents for each word or phrase. Human operators merely need to select the likeliest equivalent as the mouse glides over the foreign-language text. Possible equivalents can be grouped by pronunciation.  Also, companies such as [[Ectaco]] produce pocket devices that provide machine translations.

Relying exclusively on unedited machine translation, however, ignores the fact that communication in [[natural language|human language]] is [[wikt:context|context]]-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.{{efn|J.M. Cohen observes: "Scientific translation is the aim of an age that would reduce all activities to [[Technology|techniques]]. It is impossible however to imagine a literary-translation machine less complex than the human brain itself, with all its knowledge, reading, and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Claude Piron]] writes that machine translation, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] in the [[source text]], which the [[grammatical]] and [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] exigencies of the target language require to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Piron]], ''Le défi des langues'' (The Language Challenge), Paris, L'Harmattan, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing necessary in order to provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be [[garbage in garbage out|meaningless]].&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;

The weaknesses of pure [[machine translation]], unaided by human expertise, are [[Logology (science of science)#Artificial intelligence|those of artificial intelligence itself]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish [[artificial intelligence]] from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Translator Mark Polizzotti holds that machine translation, by [[Google Translate]] and the like, is unlikely to threaten human translators anytime soon, because machines will never grasp nuance and [[connotation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Wilson, Emily]], "The Pleasures of Translation" (review of Mark Polizzotti, ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', MIT Press, 2018, 182 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 9 (24 May 2018), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary translation==
Translation of [[literature|literary works]] ([[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[theatre|plays]], [[poetry|poems]], etc.) is considered a literary pursuit in its own right. Notable in [[Canadian literature]] ''specifically'' as translators are figures such as [[Sheila Fischman]], [[Robert Dickson (writer)|Robert Dickson]], and [[Linda Gaboriau]]; and the Canadian [[Governor General's Awards]] annually present prizes for the best English-to-French and French-to-English literary translations.

Other writers, among many who have made a name for themselves as literary translators, include [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Robert Stiller]], [[Lydia Davis]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Achy Obejas]], and [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].

In the 2010s a substantial gender imbalance was noted in literary translation into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/dispatches/article/where-are-the-women-in-translation|title=Where Are the Women in Translation?|last=Anderson|first=Alison|date=May 14, 2013|website=Words Without Borders|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with far more male writers being translated than women writers. In 2014 Meytal Radzinski launched the ''Women in Translation'' campaign to address this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://literarytranslators.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/women-in-translation-an-interview-witth-meytal-radzinski/|title=Women in Translation: An Interview with Meytal Radzinski|date=25 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/tags-bookseller/meytal-radzinski|title=Meytal Radzinski - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblibio.blogspot.com/2018/07/exclusion-is-choice-bias-in-best-of.html|title=Biblibio: Exclusion is a choice - Bias in "Best of" lists|first=Meytal|last=Radzinski|date=3 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first important translation in the West was that of the [[Septuagint]], a collection of [[Jew]]ish Scriptures translated into early [[Koine Greek]] in [[Alexandria]] between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE. The dispersed [[Jew]]s had forgotten their ancestral language and needed Greek versions (translations) of their Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], [[Latin]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the western learned world. The 9th-century [[Alfred the Great]], king of [[Wessex]] in [[England]], was far ahead of his time in commissioning [[vernacular]] [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] translations of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' and [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]''. Meanwhile, the [[Christian Church]] frowned on even partial adaptations of [[St. Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate Bible|Vulgate]]'' of c. 384 CE,&lt;ref&gt;J.M Cohen, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the standard [[Latin]] ''[[Bible]]''.

In [[Asia]], the spread of [[Buddhism]] led to large-scale ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years. The [[Tangut Empire]] was especially efficient in such efforts; exploiting the then newly invented [[block printing]], and with the full support of the government (contemporary sources describe the Emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort, alongside sages of various nationalities), the Tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the [[China|Chinese]] centuries to render.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The [[Arabs]] undertook large-scale efforts at translation.  Having conquered the Greek world, they made [[Arabic]] versions of its philosophical and scientific works.  During the [[Middle Ages]], translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Cohen13"&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a ''Schola Traductorum'' (School of Translation) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].  There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions.  Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European [[Scholasticism]], and thus European science and culture.
[[File:Chaucer Hoccleve.png|thumb|170px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]]]
The broad historic trends in Western translation practice may be illustrated on the example of translation into the [[English language]].

The first fine translations into English were made in the 14th century by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who adapted from the [[Italian language|Italian]] of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in his own ''[[Knight's Tale]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''; began a translation of the [[French-language]] ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''; and completed a translation of [[Boethius]] from the [[Latin]]. Chaucer founded an English [[poetry|poetic]] tradition on ''[[Literary adaptation|adaptations]]'' and translations from those earlier-established [[literary language]]s.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The first great English translation was the ''[[Wycliffe Bible]]'' (c. 1382), which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped English [[prose]]. Only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte Darthur]]''—an adaptation of [[Arthurian romance]]s so free that it can, in fact, hardly be called a true translation. The first great [[Tudor period|Tudor]] translations are, accordingly, the ''[[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale New Testament]]'' (1525), which influenced the ''[[Authorized Version]]'' (1611), and [[Lord Berners]]' version of [[Jean Froissart]]'s ''Chronicles'' (1523–25).&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Marsilio Ficino at the Duomo Firence 2.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Marsilio Ficino]]]]
Meanwhile, in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], a new period in the history of translation had opened in [[Florence]] with the arrival, at the court of [[Cosimo de' Medici]], of the [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Georgius Gemistus Pletho]] shortly before the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the Turks (1453). A Latin translation of [[Plato]]'s works was undertaken by [[Marsilio Ficino]]. This and [[Erasmus]]' Latin edition of the ''[[New Testament]]'' led to a new attitude to translation. For the first time, readers demanded rigor of rendering, as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

Non-scholarly literature, however, continued to rely on ''adaptation''. [[France]]'s ''[[Pléiade]]'', [[England]]'s [[Tudor period|Tudor]] poets, and the [[Elizabethan]] translators adapted themes by [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Petrarch]] and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created by the rise of a [[middle class]] and the development of [[printing]], with works such as the original authors ''would have written'', had they been writing in England in that day.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The [[Elizabethan]] period of translation saw considerable progress beyond mere [[paraphrase]] toward an ideal of [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] equivalence, but even to the end of this period, which actually reached to the middle of the 17th century, there was no concern for [[Words|verbal]] [[accuracy]].&lt;ref name=Cohen14&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 17th century, the poet [[John Dryden]] sought to make [[Virgil]] speak "in words such as he would probably have written if he were living and an Englishman". As great as Dryden's poem is, however, one is reading Dryden, and not experiencing the Roman poet's concision. Similarly, [[Homer]] arguably suffers from [[Alexander Pope]]'s endeavor to reduce the Greek poet's "wild paradise" to order. Both works live on as worthy ''English'' epics, more than as a point of access to the Latin or Greek.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Edward FitzGerald.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]]]
Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they hardly knew, or—as in the case of [[James Macpherson]]'s "translations" of [[Ossian]]—from texts that were actually of the "translator's" own composition.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Benjamin Jowett - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Benjamin Jowett]]]]
The 19th century brought new standards of accuracy and style. In regard to accuracy, observes J.M. Cohen, the policy became "the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text", except for any [[bawdy]] passages and the addition of copious explanatory [[footnote]]s.{{efn|For instance, Henry Benedict Mackey's translation of [[St. Francis de Sales]]'s "[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/desales/love.html Treatise on the Love of God]" consistently omits the saint's analogies comparing God to a nursing mother, references to Bible stories such as the rape of Tamar, and so forth.}} In regard to style, the [[Victorians]]' aim, achieved through far-reaching [[metaphrase]] (literality) or ''pseudo''-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a ''foreign'' classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'' of [[Omar Khayyam]] (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

In advance of the 20th century, a new pattern was set in 1871 by [[Benjamin Jowett]], who translated [[Plato]] into simple, straightforward language. Jowett's example was not followed, however, until well into the new century, when accuracy rather than style became the principal criterion.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

===Modern translation===
As a language evolves, texts in an earlier version of the language—original texts, or old translations—may become difficult for modern readers to understand. Such a text may therefore be translated into more modern language, producing a "modern translation" (e.g., a "modern English translation" or "modernized translation").

Such modern rendering is applied either to literature from classical languages such as [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], notably to the [[Bible]] (see "[[Modern English Bible translations]]"), or to literature from an earlier stage of the same language, as with the works of [[William Shakespeare]] (which are largely understandable by a modern audience, though with some difficulty) or with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s Middle English ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' (which is understandable to most modern readers only through heavy dependence on footnotes).

Modern translation is applicable to any language with a long literary history.  For example, in Japanese the 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is generally read in modern translation  (see "[[The Tale of Genji#Modern readership|''Genji:'' modern readership]]").

Modern translation often involves literary scholarship and textual revision, as there is frequently not one single canonical text. This is particularly noteworthy in the case of the Bible and Shakespeare, where modern scholarship can result in substantive textual changes.

Modern translation meets with opposition from some traditionalists.  In English, some readers prefer the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible to modern translations, and Shakespeare in the original of c. 1600 to modern translations.

An opposite process involves translating modern literature into classical languages, for the purpose of [[extensive reading]] (for examples, see "[[List of Latin translations of modern literature]]").

===Poetry===
[[File:Hofstadter2002B.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]]]]
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|65px|[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]]]]
[[File:Vladimir Nabokov 1973.jpg|thumb|55px|[[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]]]
Views on the possibility of satisfactorily translating poetry show a broad spectrum, depending largely on the degree of latitude to be granted the translator in regard to a poem's formal features (rhythm, rhyme, verse form, etc.).  [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his 1997 book, ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', argued that a good translation of a poem must convey as much as possible not only of its literal meaning but also of its form and structure (meter, rhyme or alliteration scheme, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;A discussion of Hofstadter's otherwise latitudinarian views on translation is found in Tony Dokoupil, "[http://www.newsweek.com/id/195684 Translation: Pardon My French: You Suck at This]," ''[[Newsweek]]'', May 18, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russia]]n-born [[linguist]] and [[semiotician]] [[Roman Jakobson]], however, had in his 1959 paper "[[On Linguistic Aspects of Translation]]", declared that "poetry by definition [is] untranslatable".  [[Vladimir Nabokov]], another Russian-born author, took a view similar to Jakobson's.  He considered rhymed, metrical, versed poetry to be in principle untranslatable and therefore rendered his 1964 English translation of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s [[Eugene Onegin#Into English|''Eugene Onegin'' in prose]].

Hofstadter, in ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', criticized Nabokov's attitude toward verse translation.  In 1999 Hofstadter published his own translation of ''Eugene Onegin'', in verse form.

Gregory Hays, in the course of discussing [[ancient Rome|Roman]] adapted translations of [[ancient Greek literature]], makes approving reference to some views on the translating of poetry expressed by [[David Bellos]], an accomplished French-to-English translator.  Hays writes:
{{blockquote|Among the ''idées reçues'' [received ideas] skewered by David Bellos is the old saw that "poetry is what gets lost in translation."  The saying is often attributed to [[Robert Frost]], but as Bellos notes, the attribution is as dubious as the idea itself.  A translation is an assemblage of words, and as such it can contain as much or as little poetry as any other such assemblage.  The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] even have a word (''chōyaku'', roughly "hypertranslation") to designate a version that deliberately improves on the original.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hays, "Found in Translation" (review of [[Denis Feeney]], ''Beyond Greek:  The Beginnings of Latin Literature'', Harvard University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Book titles ===

Book-title translations can be either descriptive or symbolic. Descriptive book titles, for example [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[Le Petit Prince]]''  (The Little Prince), are meant to be informative, and can name the protagonist, and indicate the theme of the book.  An example of a symbolic book title is [[Stieg Larsson]]'s  ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', whose original Swedish title is ''Män som hatar kvinnor''  (Men Who Hate Women).  Such symbolic book titles usually indicate the theme, issues, or atmosphere of the work.

When translators are working with long book titles, the translated titles are often shorter and indicate the theme of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plays ===

The translation of plays poses many problems such as the added element of actors, speech duration, translation literalness, and the relationship between the arts of drama and acting. Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Carlson, "Problems in Play Translation", ''Educational Theatre Journal'' 16, no. 1 (1964), pp. 55-58. {{doi|10.2307/3204378}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Play translators must also take into account several other aspects: the final performance, varying theatrical and acting traditions, characters' speaking styles, modern theatrical discourse, and even the acoustics of the auditorium, i.e., whether certain words will have the same effect on the new audience as they had on the original audience.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, pp. 129-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiences in Shakespeare's time were more accustomed than modern playgoers to actors having longer stage time.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Carlson, "Problems in Play Translation", ''Educational Theatre Journal'' 16, no. 1 (1964), pp. 55-58. {{doi|10.2307/3204378}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern translators tend to simplify the sentence structures of earlier dramas, which included compound sentences with intricate hierarchies of subordinate clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loren Kruger, "Keywords and Contexts: Translating Theatre Theory", ''Theatre Journal'' 59, no. 3 (2007), pp. 355-58. {{jstor|25070054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese literature ===
In translating Chinese literature, translators struggle to find true fidelity in translating into the [[target language (translation)|target language]]. In ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Barnstone argues that poetry "can't be made to sing through a mathematics that doesn't factor in the creativity of the translator".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Stewart, ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Washington, Copper Canyon Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable piece of work translated into English is the ''[[Wen Xuan]]'', an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature. Translating this work requires a high knowledge of the [[genre]]s presented in the book, such as poetic forms, various prose types including memorials, letters, proclamations, praise poems, edicts, and historical, philosophical and political disquisitions, threnodies and laments for the dead, and examination essays. Thus the literary translator must be familiar with the writings, lives, and thought of a large number of its 130 authors, making the ''Wen Xuan'' one of the most difficult literary works to translate.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Eoyang and Lin Yao-fu, ''Translating Chinese Literature'', Indiana University Press, 1995, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation generally, much as with [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|conception of mathematics]], requires, to varying extents, more information than appears in the page of text being translated.

===Sung texts===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Catherine Winkworth.PNG|thumb|left|100px|[[Catherine Winkworth]]]] --&gt;
Translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called "singing translation"—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most [[vocal music]], at least in the Western tradition, is set to [[Verse (popular music)|verse]], especially verse in regular patterns with [[rhyme]]. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of [[prose]] and [[free verse]] has also been practiced in some [[art music]], though [[popular music]] tends to remain conservative in its retention of [[stanza]]ic forms with or without [[refrain]]s.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church [[hymn]]s, such as the German [[chorale]]s translated into English by [[Catherine Winkworth]].{{efn|For another example of poetry translation, including translation of sung texts, see [http://vagalecs.narod.ru/ Rhymes from Russia].}}

Translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry, because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator.  There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line.

Other considerations in writing a singing translation include repetition of words and phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on high notes, and rhythmic features of the vocal line that may be more natural to the original language than to the target language. A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a [[contrafactum]].

Translations of sung texts—whether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a language not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or [[surtitles]] projected during [[opera]] performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing.

===Religious texts===
{{Further|Bible translations|Quran translations}}

[[File:Domenico Ghirlandaio - St Jerome in his study.jpg|thumb|left|135px|[[Jerome]], [[patron saint]] of translators and [[encyclopedia|encyclopedists]]]]
An important role in history has been played by translation of religious texts. Such translations may be influenced by tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey. For example, [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s who translated the [[India]]n [[sutra]]s into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] occasionally adjusted their translations to better reflect [[China]]'s distinct [[culture]], emphasizing notions such as [[filial piety]].

One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the rendering of the [[Old Testament]] into [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 3rd century BCE. The translation is known as the "[[Septuagint]]", a name that refers to the supposedly seventy translators (seventy-two, in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the [[Bible]] at [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. According to legend, each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and,  according to legend, all seventy versions proved identical. The ''Septuagint'' became the [[source text]] for later translations into many languages, including [[Latin]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

Still considered one of the greatest translators in history, for having rendered the ''[[Bible]]'' into [[Latin]], is [[Jerome]] (347–420 C.E.), the [[patron saint]] of translators. For centuries the [[Roman Catholic Church]] used his translation (known as the [[Vulgate]]), though even this translation stirred controversy.  By contrast with Jerome's contemporary, [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 C.E.), who endorsed precise translation, Jerome believed in adaptation, and sometimes invention, in order to more effectively bring across the meaning.  Jerome's colorful Vulgate translation of the Bible includes some crucial instances of "overdetermination".  For example, [[Isaiah]]'s prophecy announcing that the Savior will be born of a virgin, uses the word '''almah'', which is also used to describe the dancing girls at [[Solomon]]'s court, and simply means young and nubile.  Jerome, writes [[Marina Warner]], translates it as ''virgo'', "adding divine authority to the virulent cult of [[sex]]ual disgust that shaped Christian moral theology (the [Moslem] ''[[Quran]]'', free from this linguistic trap, does not connect [[Maryam (name)|Mariam]]/[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s miraculous nature with moral horror of sex)."  The [[apple]] that [[Eve]] offered to [[Adam]], according to Mark Polizzotti, could equally well have been an [[apricot]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], or [[banana]]; but Jerome liked the [[pun]] ''malus/malum'' (apple/evil}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pope Francis]] has suggested that the phrase "lead us not into temptation", in the [[Lord's Prayer]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] (the first Gospel, written c. 80–90 C.E.) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (the third Gospel, written c. 80–110 C.E.), should more properly be translated, "do not let us fall into temptation", commenting that God does not lead people into temptation—[[Satan]] does.{{efn|MJC Warren, Lecturer in Biblical and Religious Studies, [[University of Sheffield]], points out (more explicitly than Charles McNamara) that Luke gives a shorter version of [[Jesus]]'s Lord's Prayer, leaving off the request that God "deliver us from evil"; that (as Charles McNamara also says) accurate translation is not the question here; and that the Bible records a number of incidents when God commands evil actions, such as that [[Abraham]] kill his only son, [[Isaac]] (whose execution is canceled at the last moment).&lt;ref&gt;MJC Warren, "‘Lead us not into temptation’: why Pope Francis is wrong about the Lord’s Prayer", ''[[The Conversation]]'', December 8, 2017 [https://theconversation.com/lead-us-not-into-temptation-why-pope-francis-is-wrong-about-the-lords-prayer-88886]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Some important early Christian authors interpreted the Bible's Greek text and [[Jerome]]'s [[Latin Vulgate]] similarly to Pope Francis.  A.J.B. Higgins&lt;ref&gt;A.J.B. Higgins, "'Lead Us Not into Temptation':  Some Latin Variants", ''[[Journal of Theological Studies]]'', 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1943 showed that among the earliest Christian authors, the understanding and even the text of this devotional verse underwent considerable changes.  These ancient writers suggest that, even if the Greek and Latin texts are left unmodified, something like "do not let us fall" could be an acceptable English rendering.  Higgins cited [[Tertullian]], the earliest of the Latin [[Church Fathers]] (c. 155–c. 240 C.E., "do not allow us to be led") and [[Cyprian]] (c. 200–258 C.E., "do not allow us to be led into temptation").  A later author, [[Ambrose]] (C. 340–397 C.E.), followed Cyprian's interpretation.  [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), familiar with Jerome's Latin Vulgate rendering, observed that "many people... say it this way:  'and do not allow us to be led into temptation.'"&lt;ref&gt;Charles McNamara, "Lead Us Not into Temptation?  Francis Is Not the First to Question a Key Phrase of the Lord's Prayer", ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', January 1, 2018.  [https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/lead-us-not-temptation]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 863 C.E. the brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s "Apostles to the Slavs", began translating parts of the [[Bible]] into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, using the [[Glagolitic script]] that they had devised, based on the [[Greek alphabet]].

The periods preceding and contemporary with the [[Protestant Reformation]] saw translations of the [[Bible]] into [[vernacular]] (local) European languages—a development that contributed to [[Western Christianity]]'s split into [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] over disparities between Catholic and Protestant renderings of crucial words and passages (and due to a Protestant-perceived need to reform the Roman Catholic Church).  Lasting effects on the religions, cultures, and languages of their respective countries were exerted by such [[Bible]] translations as [[Martin Luther]]'s into [[German language|German]] (the [[New Testament]], 1522), [[Jakub Wujek]]'s into [[Polish language|Polish]] (1599, as revised by the [[Jesuits]]), and [[William Tyndale]]'s (New Testament, 1526 and revisions) and the ''[[King James Version]]'' into [[English language|English]] (1611). 
[[File:Moses (Michaelangelo - San Pietro in Vincoli - Rome).jpg|thumb|left|140px|right|Mistranslation: [[Michelangelo]]'s horned [[Moses]]]]
Efforts to translate the Bible into English had their [[martyr]]s. [[William Tyndale]] (c. 1494–1536) was convicted of [[heresy]] at [[Antwerp]], was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Farris |first=Michael |title=From Tyndale to Madison |year=2007 |page=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, [[John Wycliffe]] (c. mid-1320s – 1384) had managed to die a natural death, but 30 years later the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 declared him a heretic and decreed that his works and earthly remains should be burned; the order, confirmed by [[Pope Martin V]], was carried out in 1428, and Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the [[River Swift]].  Debate and religious [[schism]] over different translations of religious texts continue, as demonstrated by, for example, the [[King James Only movement]].

A famous ''mistranslation'' of a [[Biblical]] text is the rendering of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|קֶרֶן|rtl=yes}} (''keren''), which has several meanings, as "horn" in a context where it more plausibly means "beam of light":  as a result, for centuries artists, including sculptor [[Michelangelo]], have rendered [[Moses|Moses the Lawgiver]] with horns growing from his forehead.
[[File:Chinese quran.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Chinese language|Chinese]] translation, verses 33–34 of ''Quran'''s [[Ya Sin|''surah'' (chapter) 36]]]]
Such fallibility of the translation process has contributed to the [[Islamic]] world's ambivalence about translating the ''[[Quran]]'' (also spelled ''Koran'') from the original [[Arabic]], as received by the prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Allah]] (God) through the angel [[Gabriel]] incrementally between 609 and 632 C.E., the year of Muhammad's death.  During prayers, the ''Quran'', as the miraculous and inimitable word of Allah, is recited only in Arabic.  However, as of 1936, it had been translated into at least 102 languages.&lt;ref name = fatani&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first =Afnan|last = Fatani|title =Translation and the Qur'an|editor-link =Oliver Leaman|editor-first = Oliver| editor-last = Leaman|encyclopedia=The Qur'an:  An Encyclopaedia|publisher = Routledge|date = 2006|pages = 657–669|isbn = 978-0415775298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental difficulty in translating the ''Quran'' accurately stems from the fact that an Arabic word, like a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word, may have a [[Polysemy|range of meanings]], depending on [[Context (language use)|context]].  This is said to be a linguistic feature, particularly of all [[Semitic languages]], that adds to the usual similar difficulties encountered in translating between any two languages.&lt;ref name = fatani/&gt;  There is always an element of human judgment—of interpretation—involved in understanding and translating a text.  Muslims regard any translation of the ''Quran'' as but one possible interpretation of the [[Classical Arabic|Quranic (Classical) Arabic]] text, and not as a full equivalent of that divinely communicated original.  Hence such a translation is often called an "interpretation" rather than a translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], ''Islam in the World'', Granta, 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|978-1-86207-906-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To complicate matters further, as with other languages, the meanings and usages of some expressions have changed ''over time'', between the Classical Arabic of the ''Quran'', and modern Arabic.  Thus a modern Arabic speaker may misinterpret the meaning of a word or passage in the ''Quran''.  Moreover, the interpretation of a Quranic passage will also depend on the historic context of Muhammad's life and of his early community.  Properly researching that context requires a detailed knowledge of ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[Prophetic biography|sirah]]'', which are themselves vast and complex texts.  Hence, analogously to the translating of [[Translation#Chinese literature|Chinese literature]], an attempt at an accurate translation of the ''Quran'' requires a knowledge not only of the Arabic language and of the [[Target language (translation)|target language]], including their respective evolutions, but also a deep understanding of the two [[culture]]s involved.

== Technical translation ==
{{main|Technical translation}}
[[Technical translation]] renders documents such as manuals, instruction sheets, internal memos, minutes, financial reports, and other documents for a limited audience (who are directly affected by the document) and whose useful life is often limited.  Thus, a user guide for a particular model of refrigerator is useful only for the owner of the refrigerator, and will remain useful only as long as that refrigerator model is in use.  Similarly, software documentation generally pertains to a particular software, whose applications are used only by a certain class of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jody|year=2006 |title=Technical Translation: Usability Strategies for Translating Technical Documentation |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Multiple'' tests of artificial-intelligence efficacy are needed because, "just as there is no single test of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletic]] prowess, there cannot be one ultimate test of [[intelligence]]."  One such test, a "Construction Challenge", would test perception and physical action—"two important elements of intelligent behavior that were entirely absent from the original [[Turing test]]."  Another proposal has been to give machines the same standardized tests of science and other disciplines that schoolchildren take.  A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].  "[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways."  A prominent example is known as the "pronoun disambiguation problem":  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.

'''Type II partnerships''' were developed at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002. Arising in opposition to the [[State (polity)|state]]-centred [[Ecogovernmentality|eco-governmentality]] of previous approaches to [[sustainable development]] policy, the partnerships facilitate the inclusion of private and civil [[Actor (policy debate)|actors]] into the management of sustainable development. The partnerships are employed alongside traditional [[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] mechanisms in order to effectively implement the United Nations' [[Agenda 21]] and [[Millennium Development Goals]], particularly at sub-national level. Although widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and effective developments in global [[environmental governance]] in recent years, the partnerships have faced criticism due to fears of a lack of [[accountability]], and the risk that they may exacerbate inequalities of power between Northern and Southern states. Despite these reservations, there is a general consensus among state and non-governmental actors that Type II partnerships are a significantly progressive step in global environmental governance in general, and sustainable development [[discourse]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Witte"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witte|first=J.M.|title=or Peril?

Benner |editor2=C. Streck |editor3=J.M. Witte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and development==

First proposed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, Type II partnerships are characterised by collaborations between national or sub-national governments, private sector actors and civil society actors, who form [[Voluntariness|voluntary]] transnational agreements in order to meet specific sustainable development goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Susan|title=Sustainable Development|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Johannesburg negotiations also produced so-called Type I outcomes referred to under the umbrella of a Global Deal, a series of legally binding intergovernmental commitments designed to aid states in the implementation of sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite book|last=Death|first=Carl|title=Governing Sustainable Development: Partnerships, Protests and Power at the World Summit|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the discussions preceding the summit, a growing consensus emerged among the actors involved that traditional intergovernmental relations were no longer sufficient in the management of sustainable development, and consequently the talks began to incorporate suggestions for increasingly [[Decentralisation|decentralised]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participatory]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Von Moltke|first=K|title=Governments and International Civil Society in Sustainable Development: A Framework|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2002|volume=2|issue=4|pages=341–359|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r357283n24j85mr1/|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered to be one of the most innovative and celebrated outcomes of the 2002 summit, the partnerships were created as a means by which to further implement the sustainable development goals set out in the Agenda 21 action plan, particularly those objectives aimed at the local and regional level, as traditional Type I intergovernmental strategies were deemed unlikely to effectively achieve lower level implementation of the Agenda 21 plan.&lt;ref name="UNESCAP"&gt;{{cite book|last=UNESCAP|title=Regional Follow-Up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|year=2003|publisher=United Nations Publications|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Johannesburg negotiations concluded that Type II partnerships must meet seven key criteria: i) they should be voluntary and based on shared responsibility, ii) they must complement, rather than substitute, intergovernmental sustainable development strategies, and must meet the agreed outcomes of the Johannesburg summit, iii) they must consist of a range of multi-level [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], preferably within a given area of work, iv) they must ensure [[Transparency (social)|transparency]] and accountability, v) they must produce tangible results, vi) the partnership must be new, and adequate funding must be available, and vii) a follow-up process must be developed. If these requirements were successfully fulfilled, it was hoped that Type II partnerships could create a fundamental shift in sustainable development discourse, leading to an increasingly participatory, bottom-up method of governing the issue.&lt;ref name="UNESCAP"/&gt;

== Implementation and management==

Following the Johannesburg summit, the [[United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development]] was granted responsibility for the management of Type II partnerships as its [[:wikt:mandate|mandate]] and focus were considered most appropriate to the supervision of the partnerships. The UNCSD was created following the [[Earth Summit|1992 Rio summit]] with the sole mandate of overseeing the implementation of Agenda 21 and the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], a focus which made the UNCSD highly amenable to the management of Type II agreements. The UNCSD supervises the 300+ Type II partnerships formed as a result of the summit, ensuring that the partnerships continue to implement the sustainable development goals agreed at Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bull|first=B|title=International Handbook on Public-Private Partnerships|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|authorlink=Public-Private Partnerships: The United Nations Experience|editor=G.A. Hodge |editor2=C. Greve |editor3=A.E. Boardman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of one of the larger partnerships supervised by the UNCSD is the [[Global Water Partnership]], a network of over 2,300 global partners composed of organisations including UN agencies, governments of developed and developing countries, development banks, research institutions, [[NGOs]] and private actors. The organisation aims to diffuse information regarding water management to stakeholders at all levels, and assists countries in the development of water management strategies at the local, national and global level, increasing the capacity of developing nations to manage water supplies in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Water Partnership|title=About GWP|url=http://www.gwp.org/en/About-GWP/|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in environmental governance==

=== Transition from government to governance===

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“This Summit will be remembered not for the treaties, commitments, or eloquent declarations it produced, but for the first stirrings of a new way of governing the global commons, the beginnings of a shift from the stiff formal waltz of traditional diplomacy to the jazzier dance of improvisational solution oriented partnerships that may include non-government organizations, willing governments and other stakeholders.”'' World Resources Institute, 2002&lt;ref name="WRI"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Resources Institute|title=The Johannesburg Summit- News Release|url=http://archive.wri.org/newsroom/wrifeatures_text.cfm?ContentID=371|accessdate=11 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807172431/http://archive.wri.org/newsroom/wrifeatures_text.cfm?ContentID=371|archivedate=7 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dominance of Type II partnerships as a primary outcome of the Johannesburg summit represented a fundamental shift in the governing of sustainable development; a transition from the top-down, government-centred method favoured by the [[Brundtland Report]] and at the 1992 Rio summit, to a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach which acknowledged the importance of the economic and social expertise of non-governmental actors in sustainable development initiatives. Immediately prior to the summit, then- UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] predicted that whilst [[governments]] would be responsible for the creation of a common plan of action for sustainable development, the most significant and powerful agents of change to emerge from the Johannesburg negotiations would be Type II partnerships, through which the UN hoped to harness the technological, financial and scientific resources of partners involved in the agreements, reinvigorating the organisation's pursuit of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

The UN guidelines for Type II partnerships specified that the agreements should be complementary to, not an alternative to, intergovernmental action plans for sustainable development. As opposed to developing the partnerships as a method of 'governing without government', the agreements were designed to govern alongside traditional government approaches. Rather than treating Type II partnerships as a [[panacea]] for sustainable development, it was hoped that such participatory multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms would increase the flexibility and enhance the implementation of sustainable development policy in collaboration with states and international organisations. After the Johannesburg summit, the concept of environmental governance was no longer understood as a legalistic function performed solely by governments, but rather as a collaborative, informal approach to the management of environmental issues, involving both state and non-governmental actors. This new understanding demonstrates that the changing approach to sustainable development which arose from the Johannesburg summit influenced a much wider shift in global environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;

==== Competing rationalities of government====

Within a [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] context, the Type I and Type II arguments presented in the summit negotiations represent two fundamentally opposing [[Governmentality|rationalities of government]]. The [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]], state-centric approach to sustainable development favoured by advocates of the Global Deal represents a rationality of government which Foucault&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The Will to Knowledge: The History of Sexuality, vol. 1|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified as [[Biopolitics|bio-politics]]; the application of political power in an attempt to control or modify life processes. Such an approach to the pursuit of sustainable development offers little opportunity for participation by private or civil actors, in direct contrast to the multi-stakeholder premise of Type II partnerships. The eco-governmental, disciplinary ideas conveyed in the Global Deal suggest that the Type I approach typifies the centralised [[command-and-control]] method favoured by traditional government, whereas the decentralised, voluntary nature of Type II partnerships demonstrates an advanced liberal governmentality which empowers non-state actors to undertake responsibility for the governing of sustainable development, an approach which is representative of the participatory, multi-stakeholder methods by which governance is characterised.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; The eventual dominance of Type II partnerships in the outcomes of the Johannesburg summit therefore symbolises a wider shift in the understanding of the purposes, ends and means of government in relation to sustainable development and environmental governance.

However, Mert&lt;ref name="Mert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mert|first=A|title=Partnerships for sustainable development as discursive practice: Shifts in discourses of environment and democracy|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|year=2009|volume=11|issue=5–6|pages=326–339|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VT4-4V1V4W8-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=15ccd8bbaafc4015ed26846ca6267eb1&amp;searchtype=a|accessdate=14 May 2011|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2008.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the compatibility of partnerships with the global governance of sustainable development. The partnerships represented a point of intersection between three previously separate political discourses; [[participatory democracy]], [[private governance]], and sustainable development, altering the dynamics of global environmental governance processes. The shift towards voluntary [[Mechanism (sociology)|mechanisms]] as opposed to international regulation could prove problematic as legally binding [[Legal framework|frameworks]] are sometimes the most appropriate solution to the governance of environmental problems. A [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] approach to sustainable development discourse could demonstrate greater effectiveness in the management of the issue than a fragmented, partnership-driven approach which could lead to inconsistent and conflicting management of such a global issue.&lt;ref name="Mert"/&gt;

=== Transnational governance networks===

Type II partnerships exemplify a growing reliance on public-private-civil co-operation in environmental governance. The architects of the summit placed an emphasis on discussions which would encourage the creation of multi-stakeholder partnerships with the objective of fulfilling UN sustainable development goals, acknowledging that traditional intergovernmental agreements were inadequate to sufficiently promote sustainable development.&lt;ref name="AndonovaLevy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andonova|first=L.B.|author2=Levy, M.A.|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Co-operation on Environment and Development 2003/04|year=2003|url=http://web-prod.iheid.ch/webdav/site/iheid/shared/iheid/800/andonova/Andonova-Levy2.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, state actors were notoriously unwilling to improve international environmental co-operation prior to the Johannesburg summit, leaving those who sought a positive outcome to the WSSD to search for alternative solutions which incorporated a broader variety of actors.&lt;ref name="Andonova"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Organisations in Global Environmental Governance|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|author=Andonova, L.B.|authorlink=International Organisations as Entrepreneurs of Environmental Partnerships|editor1=F. Biermann |editor2=B. Siebenhüner |editor3=A. Schreyögg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type II partnerships emerged as the dominant outcome of the Johannesburg summit, highlighting their importance as agents of change in the achievement of sustainable development. The partnerships were considered by advocates to be representative of a new era of environmental governance, characterised by collaborative decision-making and shared responsibility between public, private and civil actors in the management of [[International|transnational]] public issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Partnerships, Governance and Sustainable Development: Reflections on Theory and Practice|year=2007|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|author=Glasbergen, P.|authorlink=Setting the Scene: The Partnership Paradigm in the Making|editor=P. Glasbergen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Type II partnerships marked the emergence of a broader phenomenon within environmental governance- the introduction of [[Network governance|transnational governance networks]] in the management of global environmental issues. Transnational governance networks combine actors from the public, private and civil sectors in the pursuit of common practices and ideas.&lt;ref name="Andonova"/&gt; The role of networks of private and civil actors in transboundary communication is not novel to the academic community; however, the emphasis on transnational public-private-civil networks as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development during the Johannesburg negotiations led to recognition of the ability of such networks to integrate private and civil actors into the global environmental governance process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnational governance networks address a number of shortcomings in traditional state-centred approaches to the management of transboundary issues such as sustainable development. They can diffuse information to the public perhaps more effectively than governments or international organisations, particularly when such information requires a degree of technical expertise to deliver, such as the transfer of specialised knowledge from the private sector to industry groups regarding sustainable business practices. They can also facilitate the implementation of global management strategies at the local level, and they may potentially close the participation gap in global environmental governance by involving private and civil actors in decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann|first=F |author2=Chan, M-S. |author3=Mert, A. |author4=Pattberg, P. |title=Multi-stakeholder Partnerships for Sustainable Development: Does the Promise Hold?|journal=Paper presented at the 2007 Amsterdam Conference on the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change|year=2007|url=http://www.2007amsterdamconference.org/Downloads/AC2007_%20BiermannChanMertPattberg.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reframing of sustainable development discourse===

The Johannesburg summit represented a further shift in the governing of sustainable development; rather than considering environmental issues in isolation, as had previously been common practice within sustainable development policy, the Johannesburg negotiations concluded that a reframing of sustainable development discourse, which re-conceptualised sustainable development as a dynamic interaction between three interdependent pillars- society, environment and economy- was necessary in order to pursue a more [[holistic]] ideal of sustainable development. This reframing of sustainable development required Type II partnerships to address a broader concept of sustainable development, and consequently objectives such as poverty alleviation and community involvement feature alongside environmental issues in the objectives of the partnerships.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

== Issues==

=== Imbalances of power===

Although designed to incorporate a broader range of social, environmental and economic perspectives into the environmental governance process and to facilitate the inclusion of actors from all levels into decision-making, the extent to which imbalances of power between actors involved in the partnerships affects their implementation has provoked concern among their critics.&lt;ref name="AndonovaLevy"/&gt;

Brinkerhoff and Brinkerhoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brinkerhoff|first=D.W.|author2=Brinkerhoff, J.M. |title=Partnerships between international donors and non-governmental development organizations: opportunities and constraints|journal=Review of Administrative Sciences|year=2004|volume=70|issue=2|pages=253–270|url=http://ras.sagepub.com/content/70/2/253.short|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorised that an effective partnership must fulfil two essential criteria: mutuality- interdependence and equality between partners, and organisational identity- the equal maintenance of each partner’s missions and goals. In the event of a partnership between Northern and Southern actors, for example, the North will inevitably contribute greater financial and material resources to the partnership than the South, creating a power inequality which may enable the North to assume control of the partnership and impairing the mutuality necessary for the partnership to function successfully.&lt;ref name="Blagescu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blagescu|first=M.|author2=Young, J. |title=Partnerships and Accountability: Current thinking and approaches among agencies supporting Civil Society Organisations|journal=ODI Working Paper no. 255|year=2005|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern was reflected by a number of developing nations who formed a coalition to lobby against the development of Type II partnerships, fearing that the partnerships would award too much authority over sustainable development to the global North, whilst simultaneously reducing the responsibility of industrialised nations to develop and implement legally binding intergovernmental management strategies.&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;

In order to maintain mutuality, it is therefore essential that the definition of a contribution within Type II partnerships is extended beyond financial and material resources, and includes knowledge, skills and other relevant strengths which can be incorporated to redress the balance of power within the partnership.&lt;ref name="Blagescu"/&gt;

=== Accountability===

Critics of Type II partnerships have expressed concern that the initiative is simply a means by which to deflect accountability for sustainable development management from states and international organisations. The United States, a nation infamously opposed to state-led environmental governance as evidenced by their withdrawal from the [[Kyoto protocol]], strongly supported the development of Type II partnerships whilst continuing to oppose Type I outcomes, leading to concern that some nations may view Type II partnerships as an opportunity to deflect attention from a lack of state-level progress in the management of sustainable development. An emphasis on Type II partnerships, it is argued, could therefore be exploited by nations who wish to avoid accountability for the management of sustainable development and environmental issues, transferring responsibility for such issues to private actors who are less accountable to the needs of those affected by the problem in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survival For a Small Planet|year=2004|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|author=Bigg, T.|authorlink=The World Summit on Sustainable Development: Was It Worth It?|editor=T. Bigg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuring of accountability and transparency is a key criterion of Type II partnerships; however, the diverse multi-stakeholder composition of the partnerships negates the use of traditional accountability methods, such as the introduction of a centralised authority charged with maintaining the accountability of the partners involved in Type II agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hale|first=T.N.|author2=Mauzerall, D.L. |title=Thinking Globally and Acting Locally: Can the Johannesburg Partnerships Coordinate Action on Sustainable Development?|journal=Journal of Environment and Development|year=2004|volume=13|issue=3|pages=220–239|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/13/3/220.short|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bäckstrand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Democratizing Global Environmental Governance? Stakeholder Democracy after the World Summit on Sustainable Development|journal=European Journal of International Relations|year=2006|volume=12|issue=4|pages=467–498|url=http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/12/4/467.abstract?rss=1|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that a [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralistic]] system of accountability, incorporating market and reputational accountability measures such as financial sanctions and [[name and shame|naming and shaming]], could improve the accountability of the actors involved in Type II partnerships by providing more flexible methods of ensuring accountability which can be adapted to the nature of the actor in question.

== Discussion==

The Type II partnerships developed at the Johannesburg summit demonstrated a paradigm-shifting impact upon sustainable development discourse and the conceptualisation of global environmental governance. By addressing the limitations of the state-centric, top-down method which typified environmental governance prior to Johannesburg and facilitating the participation of private and civil actors in the governing of sustainable development, the partnerships became emblematic of the transition from command-and-control government to the informal, participatory governance mechanisms by which global environmental governance is now classified. Furthermore, the partnerships exemplify the use of transnational governance networks as a mechanism by which to implement environmental policy at local and regional level. Such factors led the World Resources Institute&lt;ref name="WRI"/&gt; to declare the partnerships representative of a ‘new era’ of environmental governance.

However, considering the flaws inherent in the partnerships, it is crucial that advocates of the agreements resist the temptation to consider them a magic bullet with which every shortcoming of a centralised approach to environmental governance can be addressed. Although advantageous in terms of increased flexibility and effective lower-level implementation of policies, partnerships lack the internal and external accountability of intergovernmental strategies, and may intensify power inequalities between the industrialised North and developing South. The decision of the UN to introduce Type II partnerships as complementary governance mechanism is therefore the most appropriate application of the partnerships, as the dynamic interaction between intergovernmental strategies and voluntary public-private-civil partnerships can potentially produce a far greater positive impact upon global environmental governance than the sum of its parts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10851">'''Unsportsmanlike conduct''' (also called '''unsporting behaviour''' or '''ungentlemanly conduct''' or '''bad sportsmanship''' or '''poor sportsmanship''') is a [[Foul (sports)|foul]] or offense in many [[sport]]s that violates the sport's generally accepted rules of [[sportsmanship]] and participant conduct. Examples include [[verbal abuse]] or taunting of an opponent, an excessive celebration following a scoring play, or feigning injury. The official rules of many sports include a catch-all provision whereby participants or an entire team may be penalized or otherwise sanctioned for unsportsmanlike conduct.

==Examples in different sports==
In [[American football]], unsportsmanlike conduct results in a 15-yard [[Penalty (American football)|penalty]], assessed after the completion of a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/penaltysummaries |title=NFL Rules Digest: Summary of Penalties |work=[[National Football League]] |accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it occurs after a scoring play, the 10 or 15 yards are assessed on the kickoff. Situations that can incur such a penalty include [[excessive celebration]]s after plays, often involving props or multiple players or engaging in taunting against an opponent; a player's purposeful removal of his helmet anywhere in the field of play during or in between plays; or if a [[Bench-clearing brawl|substitute leaves the team bench during a fight]]. Unsportsmanlike conduct can also lead to players or officials being ejected from the game if the conduct is found to be flagrant. In the NCAA, NFL, two unsportsmanlike conduct fouls lead to the offender's ejection. The referee signals unsportsmanlike conduct by holding his arms outstretched with palms facing downward. Coaches can also receive an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty for taunting, arguing with, or abusing officials, one of the few times a coach's actions can be penalized outside of the rare [[palpably unfair act]] penalty; but can't be ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/signals/26 |title=NFL Official Signals |work= National Football League |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canadian football]], the equivalent penalty is '''objectionable conduct''' and only carries a 10-yard penalty. [[Indoor American football]] leagues, because of the shorter field, also assign a 10-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.

In [[association football]], the term "unsporting behaviour" is more commonly used, being one of the listed reasons under law 12 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|laws of the game]] for which a [[Yellow card (sport)|yellow card]] may be given. It is interpreted broadly, most commonly to sanction [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|fouls]] which are more serious than most, though below a level which would merit a [[red card (sport)|red card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lotg_en.pdf |title=Laws of the Game 2008/2009 |page=35 |work=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include extravagant goal celebrations (e.g. removing one's jersey) and simulating actions intended to deceive the referee ([[diving (association football)|diving]]). 

In [[basketball]], such misconduct is penalized by a ''technical'' foul as opposed to a ''personal'' foul. The technical foul is akin to a caution in that two such fouls warrant an expulsion, although egregious conduct will be immediately assessed two consecutive technical fouls, or in at least one case, one.

In [[tennis]], such conduct is categorized as a "code violation". Examples include racket abuse (intentionally throwing a racket or using it to strike an object other than the ball), ball abuse (intentionally hitting or throwing the ball into the stands outside of normal play), or intentionally shouting during a point in order to distract an opponent. Penalties vary based on the organizers of the match or tournament and usually start with a verbal warning for a first violation, and forfeiture of a point, game, or a match for additional violations.

In [[cricket]], such behavior is considered to be violating the "spirit of the game". The preamble to the "[[Laws of cricket|Laws of Cricket]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/preamble-to-the-laws,475,AR.html |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106065059/http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/preamble-to-the-laws,475,AR.html |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; state certain actions which may violate the spirit of cricket. A more detailed list (along with appropriate sanctions) is given in the [[ICC Cricket Code of Conduct]].  Since good behaviour in cricket is traditionally deemed the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of a gentleman to the game's historical status as a "gentleman's game", it has led to the saying, "It's not cricket", an English language phrase meaning unsportsmanlike conduct in sports, in business, or in life in general. There is considerable debate over whether [[Sledging (cricket)|sledging]] should be deemed as "unsportsmanlike behavior" and banned due to several high profile punishable instances of racial and verbal abuse during international matches; proponents have argued that sledging was meant to be witty and humorous and not a personal attack on the opposition player.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=There's something disturbing about Abbott's acceptance of sledging in cricket|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/theres-something-disturbing-about-abbotts-acceptance-of-sledging-in-cricket|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Sledging shows Australian cricket culture has lost its moral compass|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/sledging-shows-australian-cricket-culture-has-lost-its-moral-compass-20150119-12trzc.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wit of Cricket|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygNa9iKqu2oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=wit+in+cricket&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PP1|publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]|first=Barry|last=Johnston|author-link=Barry Johnston (writer)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ice hockey]], unsportsmanlike conduct is defined in Rule 75 of the [[National Hockey League]] Rule Book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26486 |title=Official Rules. Rule 75 - Unsportsmanlike Conduct|website=Nhl.com|accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:
"Players, goalkeepers and non-playing Club personnel are responsible for their conduct at all times and must endeavor to prevent disorderly conduct before, during or after the game, on or off the ice and any place in the rink. The Referees may assess penalties to any of the above team personnel for failure to do so." A player can receive a two-minute penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. Unusually for a team sport, [[fighting in ice hockey|fighting]], in most circumstances, does not constitute unsportsmanlike conduct.

===Field lacrosse===

[[Field lacrosse]]'s definition of unsportsmanlike conduct generally includes the same behavior as other sports, such as arguing with the official over a call, using [[foul language]] and taunting or baiting other players. It is considered a [[personal foul (field lacrosse)|personal foul]] under the rules. Coaches and nonplaying personnel can incur the penalty if they enter the field without the official's permission (save situations where the rules allow it) or use abusive language toward officials. Additional infractions can be called if the behavior continues. Penalties can vary from one to three minutes, usually non-releasable; in some less severe instances that do not involve abusive conduct, such as deliberately handling the ball during play, repeatedly committing the same [[technical foul (field lacrosse)|technical foul]] or deliberately delaying return to the playing field in order to gain an advantage, those penalties are releasable.&lt;ref name="NCAA lacrosse rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAA Men's Lacrosse 2015 and 2016 Rules and Interpretations|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/LC16.pdf|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|page=51|date=October 2014|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under rules for high school boys' lacrosse, a second unreleasable unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the same player is an automatic [[Ejection (sports)#Field lacrosse|ejection]] foul. The player must serve three unreleasable minutes in the penalty area; when that time expires, a substitute must re-enter the game in his place. He must leave the game area unless they are no school personnel around to supervise, in which case he is confined to the bench area for the duration of the game. As a consequence of the ejection, he is [[Suspension (punishment)|suspended]] for at least the next game.&lt;ref name="NFHS ejection foul for second offense"&gt;{{cite book|title=2017 Boys' Lacrosse Rules Book|publisher=[[National Federation of State High School Associations]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motorsports===

In [[Formula 1]], drivers are shown a black-and-white flag for unsportsmanlike driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keith Collantine |url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/04/04/drivers-as-stewards-make-presence-felt-as-hamilton-gets-black-and-white-flag/ |title=Drivers as stewards make presence felt as Hamilton gets black-and-white flag · F1 Fanatic |website=F1fanatic.co.uk |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASCAR]] likewise has section 12-4, which prohibits actions that are 'detrimental to stock car racing'.  This was invoked against [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] as a result of apparently [[gaming the system]] in order to allow their driver [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] to make the 2013 [[Chase for the Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/09/09/nascar-sprint-cup-richmond-penalties-mwr-chase.html/ |title=NASCAR penalizes Michael Waltrip Racing |website=Nascar.com |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match fixing==
Unsportsmanlike conduct also includes attempts by players of [[Match fixing#Avoiding the best team before the finals|match fixing]], which has seen teams deliberately lose (a thrown game) or achieve draws or select scores, in order to receive a more favorable knockout bracket or a higher draft pick.

Named after an influential member of the [[United States|American]] woman's [[Suffragette|suffrage]] movement, [[Victoria Woodhull]], its focus includes analyzing groups and individuals that seek to perpetuate a culture of  [[sexual repression]].

Sexual Freedom Day, officially recognized in 2011 in Washington, DC, celebrates the birthday of Victoria Woodhull. The WSFA has held the Sexual Freedom Summit annually since 2010. Organization members have included [[LGBT]] activist [[Jeffrey Montgomery]], former chairwoman of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] [[Mary Frances Berry]], writer [[Eric Rofes]], lawyer [[Lawrence G. Walters]], and activist [[Dan Massey]].

In the furtherance of activities relating to its goals, the organization has allied itself with groups including the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance]], the [[Tully Center for Free Speech]] at [[Syracuse University]], [[National Coalition Against Censorship]], the [[Heartland Institute]], [[National Association of Scholars]], [[American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression]], [[Accuracy in Academia]], and the [[American Council of Trustees and Alumni]]. An [[academic paper]] in the ''[[Journal of Homosexuality]]'' characterized the organization as one "that addresses both international and national sexual freedom issues as well as a host of other health and human rights issues."&lt;ref name="susanwright" /&gt;

==History==

===Foundation: 2003===
[[File:Ricci Levy testifying in Washington, DC.jpeg|thumb|left|Executive Director of Woodhull Sexual Freedom Alliance, Ricci Levy, testifying in [[Washington, D.C.]] at a hearing on [[same-sex marriage]] on November 2, 2009 in front of the [[Council of the District of Columbia]]; Chair of the hearing was Commissioner [[Phil Mendelson]].]]
The organization was founded in 2003 with the name Woodhull Freedom Foundation.&lt;ref name="susanwright" /&gt; It began with a focus on global and domestic human rights, specifically looking at sexual freedom.&lt;ref name="susanwright"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Susan|last=Wright|title=Discrimination of SM-identified individuals|journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]]|volume=50|issue=2–3|doi=10.1300/J082v50n02_10|year=2006|pages=217–231|publisher=[[Routledge]]|issn=0091-8369}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for [[Victoria Woodhull]] (1838{{endash}}1927), the first woman to own a company on [[Wall Street]] and to campaign for [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name="reese" /&gt; Its focus includes examining the stakeholders that maintain a climate of [[sexual repression]].&lt;ref name="dyer" /&gt;

The organization releases an annual report in September on "Sexual Freedom Day" called the "State of Sexual Freedom", which describes goals towards increasing sexual freedom.&lt;ref name="reese" /&gt;  Woodhull's public relations representative [[Jeffrey Montgomery]] told the ''[[Washington Blade]]'' that their goals intersected with human rights: "Woodhull is the organization at the intersection of all sexual freedom issues because of the common core value of fundamental human rights. ... Without sexual freedom all personal freedoms are at risk."&lt;ref name="reese" /&gt; Woodhull tracks [[sex and the law|laws and regulations pertaining to sexual activity]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="susanwright" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Old laws hover over Virginians' bedrooms|date=January 24, 2005|first=Monique|last=Angle|work=[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]|location=[[Newport News, Virginia]]|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
