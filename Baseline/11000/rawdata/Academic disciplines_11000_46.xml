'''Anthropological theories of value''' attempt to expand on the traditional [[Value theory|theories of value]] used by [[economics|economists]] or [[value theory|ethicists]]. They are often broader in scope than the theories of value of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Karl Marx]], etc. usually including [[sociological]], [[political]], institutional, and [[historical]] perspectives ([[transdisciplinarity]]).  Some have influenced [[feminist economics]].

The basic premise is that economic activities can only be fully understood in the context of the society that creates them. The concept of "value" is a [[social construct]], and as such is defined by the culture using the concept. Yet we can gain some insights into modern patterns of exchange, value, and wealth by examining previous societies. An anthropological approach to economic processes allows us to critically examine the cultural biases inherent in the principles of modern economics.  [[Anthropological linguistics]] is a related field that looks at the terms we use to describe economic relations and the ecologies they are set within.  Many anthropological economists (or economic anthropologists) are reacting against what they see as the portrayal of modern society as an economic machine that merely produces and consumes.

[[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] for example wrote about objects that circulate in society without being consumed.  [[Georges Bataille]] wrote about objects that are destroyed, but not consumed.  Bruce Owens talks about objects of value that are neither circulating nor consumed (e.g. gold reserves, warehoused paintings, family [[Antique|heirloom]]s).

== Value as meaning-making ==
[[David Graeber]] attempts to synthesize the insights of Karl Marx and Marcel Mauss. He sees value as a model for human [[meaning-making]]. Starting with Marxist definitions of consumption and production, he introduces Mauss's idea of "objects that are not consumed" and posits that the majority of human behavior consists of activities that would not be properly categorized as either consumption or production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|date=2001|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]]|isbn=0-312-24044-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== List of things that are neither consumption nor production ===
{{synthesis|date=February 2015}}
A list of things that are neither consumption nor production in 2003 includes those human activities that are not consumption, in the narrow sense of simply purchasing something, and are not production, in the sense of creating or modifying something intended for sale or exchange, namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00141844.1999.9981601 | last1 = Owens | first1 = Bruce McCoy | year = 1999| title = Unruly Readings: Neofetishes, Paradoxical Singularities, and the Violence of Authentic Value, | url = | journal = Ethnos | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–262 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Economists typically use the term consumption in a way that is far broader than merely purchasing something. It is quite common to talk about the consumption of time.  Many of the items on this list can still be considered either production or consumption, or to involve production or consumption at some stage to be accomplished. For example, cooking a meal is production of food for someone's consumption, and it involves consuming (cooking) raw materials previously purchased or gathered; and, writing is production of material for someone to consume through reading.  Both of these activities are often done for some return in value, whether it is for respect or monetary payment.  In a similar way, some of these items are replacements for consumption &amp;ndash; for example, rather than purchase a meal, you can cook the meal yourself.  In cooking the meal, you have now in effect paid for the meal with your own labor rather than earning wages and paying for a meal with those wages. In this way, economists, and in general anyone, could view this list as containing nothing that is not consumption or production, other than possibly turning around in a circle, though this involves consuming calories that would, at some point, have been consumed. For example, even window shoppers are consuming &amp;ndash; the product is marketers’ production (specifically in this case, the window dresser's creation).  Possibly, only in death are we neither consuming nor producing, but merely being consumed, though it could be argued that one's body is consuming space, particularly in a cemetery plot (real estate), but even if cremated and scattered. [[Gary Becker]]'s [[household production function]]s and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce [[utility]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6206">In [[biochemistry]], two [[biopolymer]]s are '''antiparallel''' if they run [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other but with opposite [[directionality (molecular biology)|alignment]]s. An example is the two [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strands of a [[DNA]] [[nucleic acid double helix|double helix]], which [[antiparallel (mathematics)#Antiparallel vectors|run in opposite directions]] alongside each other.

==Nucleic acids==
[[Nucleic acid]] molecules have a [[phosphoryl]] (5') end and a [[hydroxyl]] (3') end. This notation follows from [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|organic chemistry nomenclature]], and can be used to define the movement of enzymes such as [[DNA polymerase]]s relative to the DNA strand in a non-arbitrary manner.

=== G-quadruplexes ===
[[File:G-quadruplex (G4) structure.png|thumb|283x283px|The different types of topologies in G-quadruplex, propeller, lateral, and diagonal.]]
[[G-quadruplex]]es, also known as G4 DNA are secondary structures found in nucleic acids that are rich in guanine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Routh ED, Creacy SD, Beerbower PE, Akman SA, Vaughn JP, Smaldino PJ | title = A G-quadruplex DNA-affinity Approach for Purification of Enzymatically Active G4 Resolvase1 | language = en | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | issue = 121 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28362374 | doi = 10.3791/55496 | url = https://www.jove.com/video/55496/a-g-quadruplex-dna-affinity-approach-for-purification-enzymatically }}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are normally located at the ends of the chromosomes known as the telomeric regions. The G-quadruplex can either be parallel or antiparallel depending on the loop configuration, which is a component of the structure. If all the DNA strands run in the same direction, it is termed to be a parallel quadruplex, and is known as a strand-reversal/propeller, connecting adjacent parallel strands. If one or more of the DNA strands run in opposite direction, it is termed as an anti-parallel quadruplex, and can either be in a form of a lateral/edgewise, connecting adjacent anti-parallel strands, or a diagonal, joining two diagonally opposite strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burge S, Parkinson GN, Hazel P, Todd AK, Neidle S | title = Quadruplex DNA: sequence, topology and structure | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 19 | pages = 5402–15 | date = 2017-04-01 | pmid = 17012276 | pmc = 1636468 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of these G-quadruplexes can be determined by a cation.

===DNA replication===
In DNA, the 5' [[carbon]] is located at the top of the [[leading strand]], and the 3' carbon is located at the lower section of the [[lagging strand]]. The [[nucleic acid sequence]]s are complementary and parallel, but they go in opposite directions, hence the antiparallel designation.&lt;ref name=knex&gt;{{cite web | last = Benson | first  =Gary | name-list-format = vanc | title = Anti-Parallel Strands | url = http://tandem.bu.edu/knex/anti.parallel.knex.html |work=K*Nex DNA Modeling |publisher=Boston University |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiparallel structure of DNA is important in [[DNA replication]] because it replicates the leading strand one way and the lagging strand the other way. During DNA replication the leading strand is replicated continuously whereas the lagging strand is replicated in segments known as [[Okazaki fragments]].

==== Anti-parallelism in biochemistry  ====
The importance of an antiparallel DNA double helix structure is because of its hydrogen bonding between the complimentary nitrogenous base pairs. If the DNA structure were to be parallel, the hydrogen bonding would not be possible, as the base pairs would not be paired in the known way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1998-11/910892899.Mb.r.html|title=Re: Why are the two strands of a DNA molecule antiparallel?|last=PhD|first=Kenneth P MItton,|website=www.madsci.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four base pairs are: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, where adenine compliments thymine, and guanine compliments cytosine. [[Transcription (biology)|Transcription]] would be another problem if the DNA structure were to be parallel, making no sense of the information being read from the DNA. This would further lead to the creation of producing the incorrect proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27839/why-is-dna-antiparallel-can-it-be-parallel|title=why is DNA antiparallel? Can it be parallel?|website=biology.stackexchange.com|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polypeptides==
[[Polypeptide]]s have an [[N-terminus]] and a [[C-terminus]], which refer to the ends of the polymer in a way that reflects the direction in which the polymer was [[protein biosynthesis|synthesized]]. The chronological sequence of each [[amino acid]] [[monomer|sub-unit]] is the basis for directionality notation in polypeptides; a given [[protein structure|protein]] can be represented as its set of unique [[amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties|amino acid abbreviations]] within an N-terminus and a C-terminus.

===Beta sheet===
[[File:Beta sheets.svg|thumb|440x440px|Antiparallel and parallel beta sheet]]
Many proteins may adopt a [[beta sheet]] as part of their [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]]. In beta sheets, sections of a single polypeptide may run side-by-side and antiparallel to each other, to allow for [[hydrogen bond]]ing between their [[backbone chain]]s. Beta sheets can also be either a parallel or anti-parallel secondary structure. However, an anti-parallel beta sheet is significantly more stable than a parallel structure due to their well aligned H-bonds, which are at a 90° angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/educmat/phy456/456lec01.htm | title = Secondary structure of Proteins | website = www.chembio.uoguelph.ca | access-date = 2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4256">The '''apparent place''' of an [[physical body|object]] is its position in space as seen by an observer. Because of physical and geometrical effects it may differ from the "true" or "geometric" position.

== Astronomy ==

In [[astronomy]], a distinction is made between the ''mean position'', ''apparent position'' and ''topocentric position'' of an object.

=== Position of a star ===

The mean position of a [[star]] (relative to the observer's adopted [[coordinate system]]) can be calculated from its value at an arbitrary [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], together with its actual motion over time (known as [[Proper motion]]). The ''apparent position'' is its position as seen by a theoretical observer at the centre of the moving [[Earth]]. Several effects cause the apparent position to differ from the mean position:&lt;ref name=ESAA1992&gt;P. Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), pp 99-140, [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac ''Explanatory Supplement to the ''Astronomical Almanac'': A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac''] (Sausalito [CA]: University Science Books, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Annual [[Aberration of light|aberration]] — a deflection caused by the [[velocity]] of the Earth's motion around the [[Sun]], relative to an [[inertial frame]]. This is independent of the distance of the star from the Earth.
* Annual [[parallax]] — the apparent change in position due to the star being viewed from different places as the Earth orbits the Sun in the course of a [[year]]. Unlike aberration, this effect depends on the distance of the star, being larger for nearby stars.
* [[Axial precession|Precession]] — a long-term (ca. 26,000 years) variation in the direction of the Earth's axis of rotation.
* [[Nutation]] — shorter-term variations in the direction of the Earth's axis of rotation.

The ''[[Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars]]'' is an astronomical [[yearbook]], which is published one year in advance by the [[Astronomisches Rechen-Institut]] in [[Heidelberg]], Germany. It lists the apparent place of about 1000 [[fundamental star]]s for every 10 days and is published as a book and in a more extensive version on the [[Internet]].

=== Solar System objects ===

The apparent position of a [[planet]] or other object in the [[Solar System]] is also affected by [[Light-time correction]], which is caused by the finite time it takes light from a moving body to reach the observer. Simply put, the observer sees the object in the position where it was when the light left it.

Theoretically, light-time correction could also be calculated for more distant objects, such as stars, but in practice it is ignored. The movement of an object since the light left it is not needed because the mean position is the mean position of where it appears to be, not of where it once was. Unlike planets, these objects basically appear to move in straight lines, so for normal use no complicated calculation is needed to find their mean position.

=== Topocentric position ===

The ''topocentric position'' of a body is that seen by an actual observer on the Earth, and differs from the apparent position as a result of the following effects:

* Diurnal [[Aberration of light|aberration]] — a deflection caused by the [[velocity]] of the observer's motion around the Earth's centre, due to its [[rotation]].
* Diurnal [[parallax]] — the apparent change in position due to the object being viewed from different places as the observer's position rotates around the Earth's axis.
* [[Polar motion]] — small changes in the position of the Earth's [[axis of rotation]] relative to its surface.
* [[Atmospheric refraction]] — a deflection of the light from the object caused by its passage through the Earth's [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5640">The '''Art Elective Program (AEP)''' is offered by schools in [[Singapore]] that have obtained permission from the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]]. This programme is also known as Higher Art and can also be offered as a [[Singapore]]-[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] [[General Certificate of Education]] [[GCE Ordinary Level|Ordinary Level]] (O-level) subject.

Lessons for the AEP are usually conducted in a separate classroom, sometimes after regular classes. Schools that offer AEP as a subject normally have an art room, a media lab and facilities to store and use art materials. In AEP, students learn how to design or work with digital art programs such as [[Adobe Illustrator]]. Techniques with basic media such as pencil, pen, and paint are taught.

The lessons also include Study Of the Visual Arts (SOVA), in which the students are taught to analyze works by renowned artists. 

==History==
AEP was announced in 1983 by the Ministry of Education. It was conceived as an enrichment programme for students with an artistic flair. It was started in January 1984 by the Chinese High School and the Nanyang Girls' High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19830825-1.2.61.aspx|title=Two schools to start flair for art programme|date=25 August 1983|newspaper=The Straits Times|page=14|access-date=10 April 2016|via=NewspaperSG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEP is designed to enable students with artistic abilities to undertake an enriched art programme. The AEP curriculum aims to develop students’ conceptual and analytical thinking and creativity. Samples of the AEP curriculum and students’ creative processes and artworks can be found in the catalogue published for the AEP exhibition.

==Projects==
Every year, students create at least two projects within the spectrum of art and design, such as photography or designing a logo. Projects are weighted heavily in the overall grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seab.gov.sg/pages/nationalExaminations/GOL/School_Candidates/2016_GCE_O.asp|title=SEAB list of O'level subject syllabus|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.seab.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examinations==
Throughout the year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/education-system/ |title= SEAB Education System Website|publisher=www.moe.gov.sg|date= |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;the students prepare SOVA and Drawing and Painting papers. The four exams are Continual Assessments 1 and 2, Semester Assessments 1 and 2. Drawing and Painting examinations vary in duration and students are allowed to create an art piece over around 2–3 hours. Two weeks before the Drawing and Painting exams, students are given several themes to choose from. They then have two weeks to complete their assigned task. The exam is marked according to five components: Investigation and Interpretation of Theme, Exploration and Development of Theme, Aesthetic Qualities, Control of Materials and Technical Processes and Personal Response. For the SOVA examination, students are tested on several artists whom they have studied. They examine selected artworks by these artists and interpret their styles and the methods applied to produce the artwork. This paper is considered a "theory" examination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">In [[electronic engineering]], a '''bridging fault''' consists of two signals that are connected when they should not be. Depending on the [[logic circuit]]ry employed, this may result in a [[wired-OR]] or [[wired-AND]] logic function. Since there are O(n^2) potential bridging faults, they are normally restricted to signals that are physically adjacent in the design.

==Modeling bridge fault==
Bridging to VDD or Vss is equivalent to stuck at fault model. Traditionally bridged signals were modeled with logic AND or OR of signals. If one driver dominates the other driver in a bridging situation, the dominant driver forces the logic to the other one, in such case a ''dominant bridging fault'' is used. To better reflect the reality of CMOS VLSI devices, a ''dominant AND or dominant OR bridging fault model'' is used where dominant driver keeps its value, while the other signal value is the result of AND (or OR) of its own value with the dominant driver.

The term '''coma cocktail''' refers to a combination of substances administered in an emergency to comatose individuals,&lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the cause of the [[coma]] in the individual was not yet known.

A standard combination included [[dextrose]] (1 Amp D50W IV), [[flumazenil]] (0.2&amp;nbsp;mg IV), [[naloxone]] (2&amp;nbsp;mg IV), and [[thiamine]] (100&amp;nbsp;mg IV).&lt;ref name="pmid8187685"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doyon S, Roberts JR |title=Reappraisal of the "coma cocktail". Dextrose, flumazenil, naloxone, and thiamine |journal=Emerg. Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=301–16 |date=May 1994 |pmid=8187685 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the use of naloxone and flumazenil be administered more selectively than glucose and thiamine.&lt;ref name="pmid11233676"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buylaert WA |title=Coma induced by intoxication |journal=Acta Neurol Belg |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=221–4 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11233676 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have proposed that the concept be abandoned completely because modern [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] providers should be able to determine the likely etiology of the change in mental status. At a minimum, the clinical presentation of the patient should rule in or out some portions of the coma cocktail.&lt;ref name="pmid12483195"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bledsoe BE |title=No more coma cocktails.

== History ==
The coma cocktail is thought to have been created in United States as a first line treatment for an unconscious patient in an era where intensive care was new and difficult to maintain. Original coma cocktails included [[Xanthine|methylxanthines]], [[physostigmine]], physical stimulation (such as cold water baths or ammonium carbonate ("[[smelling salts]]")), [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]], [[strychnine]], [[picrotoxin]], [[nikethamide]] and [[camphor]]. As medicine and assessment techniques have advanced, the preceding drugs have been mostly replaced by the modern coma cocktail as described above.&lt;ref name="Sivilotti"/&gt;

== Dextrose == 
If the blood glucose concentration of the patient is alternating consciousness or at least contributing to the alteration, said patient likely needs hypertonic dextrose. Another indicator is seizures.&lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypertonic dextrose is effective in treating [[hypoglycemia]], and one in twelve patients administered for altered mental status suffer from it. This statistic may be sufficient evidence for doctors to support the routine of administering the drug. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Dextrose]] contributes to the controversy of coma cocktails by inducing [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]] in patients that are deficient in [[thiamine]]. &lt;ref name="Sivilotti" &gt;{{Cite journal

Patients that are specifically at risk of being impacted this way are those with alcoholic tendencies or malnourishment. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

	[[Naloxone]] has well-documented effectiveness; as a matter of fact, 575/609 patients (mainly with heroin overdose) showed improved consciousness and respiration within five minutes of treatment. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	The major downsides to naloxone are the hypersensitivity from the patient and its reaction with substances contaminating opioids/opiates. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of hypersensitivity, the patient may subsequently suffer from restlessness, headache, and vomiting. 
Opiates/opioids, such as heroin, can be contaminated with [[scopolamine]], and if it is present, the patient may face an anticholinergic crisis. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Flumazenil == 
[[Flumazenil]] is an imidazobenzodiazepine that can help mediate and antagonize the effects of [[benzodiazepines]]. It can be used in [[anaesthesia]] as well as intensive care. &lt;ref name="Sivilotti" &gt;{{Cite journal

[[Flumazenil]] raises concerns with its tendency to induce [[benzodiazepine]] [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], and symptoms include [[seizures]] and agitation. When a patient overdoses intentionally, [[benzodiazepines]] can actually mediate the effects of other lethal drugs in the system, so flumazenil’s action to reverse its effects can actually be harmful. &lt;ref name="Sivilotti" &gt;{{Cite journal

For this reason, flumazenil is recommended in scenarios with only benzodiazepine ingestion so as to avoid the other negative effects. 

== Thiamine == 

[[Thiamine]] is effective for treatment of [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]] as well as [[ethylene glycol]] ingestion. For ethylene glycol, thiamine helps by preventing synthesis of the glycol’s metabolites.

	Overall, thiamine does not cause as notable issues in the cocktail, but patients can be sensitive to it nonetheless. If a physician administers both [[dextrose]] and [[thiamine]], as is common in comatose patients, [[thiamine]] should be administered first. &lt;ref name="Sivilotti" &gt;{{Cite journal

A '''creative director''' is a position often found within the [[graphic design]], [[film]], [[music]], [[video game industry|video game]], [[fashion]], [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], or [[Show business|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well.

A creative director is a vital role in all of the arts and entertainment industries. In another sense, they can be seen as another element in any product development process. The creative director may also assume the roles of an art director, copywriter, or lead designer. The responsibilities of a creative director include leading the communication design, interactive design, and concept forward in any work assigned. For example, this responsibility is often seen in industries related to advertisement. The creative director is known to guide a team of employees with skills and experience related to graphic design, fine arts, motion graphics, and other creative industry fields. Some example works can include visual layout, brainstorming, and copywriting. To assume the role of a creative director, one must already have an existing set of skills and expertise in many areas. Often, these types of artists start up from the very beginning in fields that can relate to motion graphics, advertisement in television, and/or book (or magazine) publishing.

==Communication design==

===Advertising===
In the advertising industry, a creative director is determined to develop various marketing schemes and strategies for a company or client that he or she is hired by. Assuming one is hired by a company that is fairly well known and established, there would be some type of creative department or management that the director would work with. The creative director would also serve as the project manager that works directly with employers, and in most circumstances, they would be responsible for designing concepts for advertisements and other promotional needs for their client(s). Some examples of their duties involve [[copywriting]] and laying out chronological advertisement plans which explain the ongoing process of a project. It is important for an advertisement creative director to meet their goals at specific deadline with maximum efficiency as possible. To do so, they must be able to guide the creative department effectively from start to finish. Educational requirements of this position involve a blending of skills in business and journalism. To even be considered as a creative director, one would need to have a couple of years of experience in advertising (as little as five to as many as ten years).&lt;ref&gt;"Advertising Creative Director Job Description, Salary, and Training Information." 300+ Job Descriptions: Find Your Dream Job in 2011. N.p., n.d. Web. 1 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.jobdescriptions.net/business/advertising-creative-director/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copy writing or art directing positions. Familiarity with film-making techniques is also common. Creative directors rise to become executive creative directors or chief creative officers, a position with executive responsibility for the entire creative department, and some progress to chairman of a firm.

Creative directors usually possess a [[communication design]] or [[fine art]]s &amp; animation degree. Copywriters may have degrees in [[journalism]], [[language arts]], or media innovation, or may develop more emphasis on advertising copy writing while pursuing a communication design degree.

==Video games==
{{main|Video game producer}}
With the increased team sizes and more specialised disciplines in the games industry, certain game designers are titled as 'creative director', 'executive designer', or 'game director'. A creative director in a video game company is usually responsible for product development across a number of titles and is generally regarded as the prime design authority across the company's product range. Some examples are [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Sam Lake]], [[Neil Druckmann]], or [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] whose influence extends across more than one project.

The creative director has an important responsibility in this industry. The director must devise ideas to lead a video game project forward and many responsibilities involve working with various individuals or teams spread out within the entire project/video game production. This can include cross-functional collaboration with the various disciplines involved in games development. Academically speaking, a creative director is usually degree educated but there are some circumstances where a high school education strongly focusing on aspects such as art, graphics, [[computer science]], and math can be acceptable and provide some valuable insight to students who hope to aspire in this field of work. Some skills that a creative director working in the video game industry may have include proficiency in [[computer programming]] and graphic development (illustrations, fine art) and have excellent interpersonal and writing skills (since they deal with many other clients and management leaders). The exact skills a game director possesses will depend on their background in the industry. Creative director, or game director, is not usually an entry level position, but in a smaller studio it can be. This is more common in start up companies for instance though normally one would have to earn that role by showing their skills and development over a period of years. The entertainment industry is not always a meritocracy, however, and sometimes people just luck into or inherit such positions. Creative directors have often done their share of lower level startup positions such as internships or assisting other directors in art related work fields. It is all about advancing through the career chain, and once one has earned the position a creative director, they may be eligible to work for larger and more popular game developing companies depending on how successful they have been with past collaborative projects.&lt;ref&gt;Careers in focus:computer and video game design. 2nd ed. New York: Ferguson, 2009. p.17-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

{{Main|Production designer}}

The creative director in the film industry is referred to as the [[production designer]]. A production designer carries a large responsibility of designing the look of a movie. The job is similar to a creative director's role in the video game industry in that he or she manages a team of employees and has to consistently develop new ideas and methods of working. It is vital that designers in this field are able to produce expressive/creative ideas and translate them into something cinematic. Usually a certain sum of funds is distributed among different departments in the production of a film (in this case, the art department). Creative directors must decide on how to distribute and use the funds in the most efficient and effective way to ensure maximum quality in the films art department. An example can include the structuring of scenes and sets once a film begins to undergo the shooting process. During this process, it is important for creative directors to understand what props and effects should be used and how they should be used among various sets and scenes of the film. Some important qualifications that one should have include being able to manage teams, having expertise in design (specifically in theatre, interior sets and art design), being open minded to new ideas and methods in regards to organizing film sets, and having an understanding of coordinating among different departments in order to move a project towards success. A creative director in the film industry usually starts out in lower ranks of the chain, such as an assistant to other art directors and/or as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Department – Skillset." Welcome to Skillset – Skillset. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.skillset.org/film/jobs/productiondesign&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music director}}
Creative directors in the field of music can be broken down into various key roles that make up the whole (it may be said that one can be known as a 'music director'). It is in this artistic field where the individual, the director, must master tasks that are relatable to one another. An orchestral conductor is a prime example (but not exclusive) of this role and how one would direct music and harmonize symphonies as well as guide/direct other musician’s in an ensemble. The three roles in this sense can consist of: the active [[musician]], the musical art director, and the instructor that teaches and informs music for society. The main requirements one would need to have is an extensive background and knowledge of music (being able to master one or more instrument), understanding the principles and theories behind music composition, developing an understanding and connection with musicians that the director would be working with to communicate music in a harmonic and creative sense, and most importantly being able to develop leadership skills among other musicians.&lt;ref&gt;"Traits and Skills of a Music Director – League of American Orchestras."

==Fashion==
Creative director is the highest creative position in a [[Fashion design|fashion house]]. The creative director does not design clothes, but instead formulates and impresses upon the designers an overarching concept or concepts for a certain collection and the label as a whole. 
A fashion creative director's main role is to establish what designs should be created, what will appeal to the target market, and how the concepts will be applied and distributed in collaboration with fashion designers who are responsible for creating the clothing and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Director: Inside Jobs."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2793">{{Further|resprouter|epicormic sprouter}}
'''Crown sprouting''' is the ability of a [[plant]] to regenerate its [[shoot|shoot system]] after destruction (usually by fire) by activating dormant vegetative structures to produce regrowth from the [[root crown]] (the junction between the root and shoot portions of a plant).&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Sampson&lt;/ref&gt; These dormant structures take the form of [[lignotuber]]s or basal [[epicormic buds]]. Plant species that can accomplish crown sprouting are called '''crown resprouters''' (distinguishing them from [[Resprouter|stem or trunk resprouters]]) and, like them, are characteristic of fire-prone habitats such as [[chaparral]].&lt;ref name=Knox&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Knox, Kirsten J. E. |author2=Morrison, David A. | year = 2005 | title = Effects of inter-fire intervals on the reproductive output of resprouters and obligate seeders in the Proteaceae | journal = Austral Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–413 | doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01482.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to plant fire survival strategies that decrease the [[flammability]] of the plant, or by requiring heat to [[germinate]], crown sprouting allows for the total destruction of the above ground growth. Crown sprouting plants typically have extensive root systems in which they store nutrients allowing them to survive during fires and sprout afterwards. Early researchers suggested that crown sprouting species might lack species genetic diversity; however, research on [[Gondwana]]n shrubland{{Clarify|date=March 2011|reason=What is a "Gondwanan shrubland"?  The linked article of "Gondwana" does not mention it.}} suggests that crown sprouting species have similar genetic diversity to seed sprouters.&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Bond, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[genus|genera]], such as ''[[Arctostaphylos]]'' and ''[[Ceanothus]]'', have species that are both resprouters and not, both adapted to fire.

[[California Buckeye]], ''[[Aesculus californica]]'', is an example of a western United States tree which can regenerate from its root crown after a fire event, but can also regenerate by seed.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4829">[[Image:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]] 
'''Detritivores''', also known as '''detrivores''', '''detritophages''', '''detritus feeders''', or '''detritus eaters''', are [[heterotroph]]s that obtain [[nutrient]]s by consuming [[detritus]] (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as [[feces]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel, R. G. 2001. Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems. Academic Press. 3rd. p.700.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many kinds of [[invertebrate]]s, [[vertebrate]]s and [[plant]]s that carry out [[coprophagia|coprophagy]]. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to [[decomposition]] and the [[nutrient cycles]]. They should be distinguished from other [[decomposer]]s, such as many species of [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] and [[protist]]s, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale ([[saprotrophic nutrition]]). However, the terms ''detritivore'' and ''decomposer'' are often used interchangeably. 

[[Image:Adonis Blue butterflies.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Two [[Adonis blue]] [[Butterfly|butterflies]] lap at a small lump of feces lying on a rock.]]

Detritivores are an important aspect of many [[ecosystem]]s. They can live on any soil with an organic component, including [[marine ecosystems]], where they are termed interchangeably with [[bottom feeder]]s. 

Typical detritivorous animals include [[millipede]]s, [[Collembola|springtail]]s, [[woodlouse|woodlice]], [[Scathophagidae|dung flies]], [[slug]]s, many [[wikt:terrestrial|terrestrial]] [[worm]]s, [[sea stars]], [[sea cucumbers]], [[fiddler crabs]], and some sedentary [[polychaete]]s such as amphitrites (''Amphitritinae'', worms of the family [[Terebellidae]]) and other [[Terebellida|terebellids]].

[[Scavenger]]s are typically not thought to be detritivores, as they generally eat large quantities of organic matter, but both detritivores and scavengers are specific cases of [[consumer-resource systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Getz, W. (2011). Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer–resource modelling. Ecology Letters, {{doi|10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The eating of wood, whether alive or dead, is known as [[xylophagy]]. Τhe activity of animals feeding only on dead wood is called [[wikt:sapro-|sapro]]-xylophagy and those animals, sapro-xylophagous.

==Ecology==
[[File:Mycena interrupta.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fungi are the primary [[decomposers]] in most environments, illustrated here ''[[Mycena interrupta]]''. Only fungi produce the enzymes necessary to decompose [[lignin]], a chemically complex substance found in wood.]]
In [[food webs]], detritivores generally play the roles of [[decomposers]]. Detritivores are often eaten by [[Heterotroph|consumers]] and therefore commonly play important roles as recyclers in ecosystem [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] and [[biogeochemical cycles]]. 

Many detritivores live in mature [[woodland]], though the term can be applied to certain [[bottom-feeder]]s in [[Benthos|wet environments]]. These organisms play a crucial role in [[benthic]] ecosystems, forming essential [[food chain]]s and participating in the [[nitrogen cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/CIWDGE/SCOPE%20Books%20Web%20Archive/SCOPE%2033/SCOPE_33_2.06_Tenore_191-206.pdf |title= Nitrogen in Benthic Food Chains |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070610021232/http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/CIWDGE/SCOPE%20Books%20Web%20Archive/SCOPE%2033/SCOPE_33_2.06_Tenore_191-206.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-10 |df=  }}, Tenore, K.R., [[Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment|SCOPE]] publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fungi, acting as decomposers,  are important in today's terrestrial environment. During the [[Carboniferous period]], fungi and bacteria had yet to evolve the capacity to digest [[lignin]], and so large deposits of dead plant tissue accumulated during this period, later becoming the [[fossil fuel]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

[[File:Decaying tree trunk..jpg|thumb|A decaying tree trunk in Canada's [[boreal forest]]. Decaying wood fills an important ecological niche, providing habitat and shelter, and returning important nutrients to the soil after undergoing decomposition.]]

By [[feeding]] on sediments directly to extract the organic component, some detritivores accidentally concentrate [[toxic]] [[pollutant]]s.

In addition, the standard provides a description of when to avoid multiple relationships (e.g., when the relationship causes harm to the client or impairs the psychologist's competence) and when these relationships are ''not'' considered unethical (e.g., when the relationship does not exploit the client or impair competence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=L.W.|author2=Battaglia, J. |author3=Epstein, R.S. |title=Frontier ethics: Mental health care needs and ethical dilemmas in rural communities|journal=[[Psychiatric Services]]|year=1999|volume=50|issue=4|pages=497–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=M.B.|title=Professional boundaries: The dilemma of dual and multiple relationships in rural clinical practice|journal=Counseling and Clinical Psychology Journal|year=2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werth|first=J.L.|author2=Hastings, S.L. |author3=Riding-Malon, R. |title=Ethical challenges of practicing in rural areas|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=105–127|doi=10.1002/jclp.20681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Other Fields==
Several "helping" fields which are not strictly psychological in nature, but which still involve a therapeutic counseling environment, also have stringent policies involving dual relationships and the avoidance of such relationships. For example, the National Association of Social Workers [NASW], which regulates 132,000 social workers across the world, names multiple types of dual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics|url=http://socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|publisher=National Association of Social Workers|page=Section 1.02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes sexual, financial, personal or religious relationships which could become exploitative due to the differences in power between the worker and the client. Social workers are advised by the NASW to communicate with their clients when such a relationship arises or could arise, and are advised to take steps to avoid dual relationships wherever possible. The NASW recognizes, however, that dual relationships can be unavoidable in some types of communities, such as in rural communities or military installations.

'''Epigenetics''' is the study of heritable [[phenotype]] changes that do not involve alterations in the [[DNA sequence]].&lt;ref name="Epigenetics 2009 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupont C, Armant DR, Brenner CA | title = Epigenetics: definition, mechanisms and clinical perspective | journal = Seminars in Reproductive Medicine | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 351–57 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19711245 | pmc = 2791696 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1237423 | quote = In the original sense of this definition, epigenetics referred to all molecular pathways modulating the expression of a genotype into a particular phenotype. Over the following years, with the rapid growth of genetics, the meaning of the word has gradually narrowed. Epigenetics has been defined and today is generally accepted as "the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] prefix ''[[wikt:epi-|epi-]]'' ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἐπι-}} "over, outside of, around") in ''epigenetics'' implies features that are "on top of" or "in addition to" the traditional [[gene]]tic basis for inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beware the pseudo gene genies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/19/epigenetics-dna--darwin-adam-rutherford |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetics most often denotes changes that affect gene activity and [[gene expression|expression]], but can also be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change. Such effects on [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[physiology|physiological]] [[phenotypic trait]]s may result from external or [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors, or be part of normal developmental program. The standard definition of epigenetics requires these alterations to be heritable,&lt;ref name="nature2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19339683" /&gt; either in the progeny of cells or of organisms.

The term also refers to the changes themselves: functionally relevant changes to the genome that do not involve a change in the [[nucleotide sequence]]. Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone modification]], each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying [[DNA]] sequence. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of [[repressor protein]]s that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA. These epigenetic changes may last through [[cell division]]s for the duration of the cell's life, and may also last for multiple generations even though they do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism;&lt;ref name="pmid17522671"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Bird A | title=Perceptions of epigenetics | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=447 | issue=7143 | pages=396–98 | date=May 2007 | pmid=17522671 | doi=10.1038/nature05913 | bibcode=2007Natur.447..396B }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10140 |title=What genes remember |author=Hunter, Philip |magazine=Prospect Magazine |issue=146 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501094940/http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10140 |archivedate=1 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of an epigenetic change in [[eukaryotic]] biology is the process of [[cellular differentiation]]. During [[morphogenesis]], [[totipotent]] [[stem cells]] become the various [[pluripotent]] [[cell line]]s of the [[embryo]], which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, as a single fertilized egg cell – the [[zygote]] – continues to [[mitosis|divide]], the resulting daughter cells change into all the different cell types in an organism, including [[neurons]], [[muscle cells]], [[epithelium]], [[endothelium]] of [[blood vessels]], etc., by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others.&lt;ref name="pmid17522676"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Reik W | title=Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development | journal=Nature | volume=447 | issue=7143 | pages=425–32 | date=May 2007 | pmid=17522676 | doi=10.1038/nature05918 | bibcode=2007Natur.447..425R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some phenomena not necessarily heritable have also been described as epigenetic. For example, the term epigenetic has been used to describe any modification of chromosomal regions, especially histone modifications, whether or not these changes are heritable or associated with a phenotype. The consensus definition now requires a trait to be heritable for it to be considered epigenetic.&lt;ref name="pmid19339683" /&gt;

==Definitions==
The term ''epigenetics'' in its contemporary usage emerged in the 1990s, but for some years has been used in somewhat variable meanings.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-developing-genome-9780199922345?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics|last=Moore|first=David S.|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199922345|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consensus definition of the concept of ''epigenetic trait'' as "stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence" was formulated at a [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] meeting in 2008,&lt;ref name="pmid19339683"/&gt; although alternate definitions that include non-heritable traits are still being used.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt;

===Historical===

The term ''epigenesis'' has a generic meaning "extra growth". It has been used in English since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: "The word is used by W. Harvey, ''Exercitationes'' 1651, p. 148, and in the ''English Anatomical Exercitations'' 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean ‘partium super-exorientium additamentum’, ‘the additament of parts budding one out of another’."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waddington's canalisation, 1940s===

From the generic meaning, and the associated adjective ''epigenetic'', [[C. H. Waddington]] coined the term ''epigenetics'' in 1942 as pertaining to ''[[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]]'', in parallel to [[Valentin Haecker]]'s 'phenogenetics' ({{lang|de|Phänogenetik}}).&lt;ref name=waddington&gt;{{cite journal|author=Waddington, C. H. | title=The epigenotype| journal=Endeavour | volume=1 | pages=18–20 |doi= | year=1942 }}
"For the purpose of a study of inheritance, the relation between phenotypes and genotypes [...] is, from a wider biological point of view, of crucial importance, since it is the kernel of the whole problem of development. Many geneticists have recognized this and attempted to discover the processes involved in the mechanism by which the genes of the genotype bring about phenotypic effects. The first step in such an enterprise is – or rather should be, since it is often omitted by those with an undue respect for the powers of reason – to describe what can be seen of the developmental processes. For enquiries of this kind, the word 'phenogenetics' was coined by Haecker [1918, {{lang|de|Phänogenetik}}]. The second and more important part of the task is to discover the causal mechanisms at work, and to relate them as far as possible to what experimental embryology has already revealed of the mechanics of development. We might use the name 'epigenetics' for such studies, thus emphasizing their relation to the concepts, so strongly favourable to the classical theory of epigenesis, which have been reached by the experimental embryologists. We certainly need to remember that between genotype and phenotype, and connecting them to each other, there lies a whole complex of developmental processes. It is convenient to have a name for this complex: 'epigenotype' seems suitable."
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Epigenesis'' in the context of the biology of that period referred to the differentiation of cells from their initial [[totipotent]] state in embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[preformationism]]'' for historical background. ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'':
"the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. [...] The opposite theory was formerly known as the 'theory of evolution'; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the 'theory of preformation', sometimes as that of 'encasement' or 'emboîtement'."&lt;/ref&gt;

When Waddington coined the term, the physical nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known; he used it as a conceptual model of how genes might interact with their surroundings to produce a phenotype; he used the phrase "epigenetic landscape" as a metaphor for [[morphogenesis|biological development]]. Waddington held that cell fates were [[canalisation (genetics)|established in development (canalisation)]] much as a marble rolls down to the point of [[local optimum|lowest local elevation]].&lt;ref name="Waddington2014"&gt;{{cite book |author=Waddington, C. H.  |title=The Epigenetics of Birds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqKTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |date=1953 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-44047-0 |pages=1–}} (2014 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington suggested visualising increasing irreversibility of cell type differentiation as ridges rising between the valleys where the marbles (cells) are travelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hall BK | title=In search of evolutionary developmental mechanisms: the 30-year gap between 1944 and 1974 | journal=302 | issue=1 | pages=5–18 | date=15 January 2004 | pmid=14760651 | doi=10.1002/jez.b.20002 | volume=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times Waddington's notion of the epigenetic landscape has been rigorously formalized in the context of the [[system dynamics|systems dynamics]] state approach to the study of cell-fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Alvarez-Buylla ER, Chaos A, Aldana M, Benítez M, Cortes-Poza Y, Espinosa-Soto C, Hartasánchez DA, Lotto RB, Malkin D, Escalera Santos GJ, Padilla-Longoria P | title=Floral Morphogenesis: Stochastic Explorations of a Gene Network Epigenetic Landscape | journal=PLoS ONE | date=November 3, 2008 | pmid=18978941 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003626 |doi-access=free  |bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.3626A | volume=3 | issue=11 | pages=e3626 | pmc=2572848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Rabajante JF, Babierra AL | title=Branching and oscillations in the epigenetic landscape of cell-fate determination | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=117 | issue=2–3 | pages=240–49 | date=January 30, 2015 | pmid=25641423 | doi =10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell-fate determination is predicted to exhibit certain dynamics, such as attractor-convergence (the attractor can be an equilibrium point, limit cycle or [[strange attractor]]) or oscillatory.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

===Developmental psychology===

The term "epigenetic" has also been used in [[developmental psychology]] to describe psychological development as the result of an ongoing, bi-directional interchange between heredity and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gottlieb, G. | year=1991 | title=Epigenetic systems view of human development | url=| journal=Developmental Psychology | volume=27 | issue=1| pages=33–34 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.27.1.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactivist ideas of development have been discussed in various forms and under various names throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. An early version was proposed, among the founding statements in [[embryology]], by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] and popularized by [[Ernst Haeckel]]. A radical epigenetic view (physiological epigenesis) was developed by [[Paul Wintrebert]]. Another variation, probabilistic epigenesis, was presented by [[Gilbert Gottlieb]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Gottlieb. [http://chd.ucsd.edu/_files/winter2009/Gottlieb.probabilistic.pdf Probabilistic epigenesis], Developmental Science 10:1 (2007), 1–11&lt;/ref&gt; This view encompasses all of the possible developing factors on an organism and how they not only influence the organism and each other, but how the organism also influences its own development.

The developmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] wrote of an ''epigenetic principle'' in his book [[Erik Erikson#Bibliography|''Identity: Youth and Crisis'' (1968)]], encompassing the notion that we develop through an unfolding of our personality in predetermined stages, and that our environment and surrounding culture influence how we progress through these stages. This biological unfolding in relation to our socio-cultural settings is done in [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], where "progress through each stage is in part determined by our success, or lack of success, in all the previous stages."&lt;ref name=Boeree1997&gt;Boeree, C. George, (1997/2006), [http://www.social-psychology.de/do/pt_erikson.pdf ''Personality Theories, Erik Erikson'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erikson|first=Erik|title=Identity: Youth and Crisis|year=1968|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company |location=Chapter 3|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Epigenetics|title=Epigenetics|publisher= Bio-Medicine.org|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
[[Robin Holliday]] defined epigenetics as "the study of the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity during the development of complex organisms."&lt;ref name="pmid2265224"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holliday R | title=DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Inheritance | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume=326 | issue=1235 | pages=329–38 |date=Jan 30, 1990 | doi =10.1098/rstb.1990.0015 |bibcode = 1990RSPTB.326..329H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''epigenetic'' can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism.

The more recent usage of the word in science has a stricter definition. It is, as defined by [[Arthur Riggs (geneticist)|Arthur Riggs]] and colleagues, "the study of [[mitosis|mitotically]] and/or [[meiosis|meiotically]] heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence."&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-490-4"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Riggs AD, Russo VE, Martienssen RA | title=Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location=Plainview, NY | year=1996 | pages=| isbn=0-87969-490-4 | oclc=| doi=}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "epigenetics", however, has been used to describe processes which have not been demonstrated to be heritable such as some forms of histone modification; there are therefore attempts to redefine it in broader terms that would avoid the constraints of requiring heritability. For example, [[Adrian Peter Bird|Adrian Bird]] defined epigenetics as "the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states."&lt;ref name="pmid17522671" /&gt; This definition would be inclusive of transient modifications associated with [[DNA repair]] or [[cell-cycle]] phases as well as stable changes maintained across multiple cell generations, but exclude others such as templating of membrane architecture and [[prions]] unless they impinge on chromosome function. Such redefinitions however are not universally accepted and are still subject to dispute.&lt;ref name="nature2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ledford H | title=Disputed definitions | journal=Nature | volume=455 | issue=7216 | pages=1023–28 | year=2008 | pmid=18948925 | doi=10.1038/4551023a }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] "Roadmap Epigenomics Project", ongoing as of 2016, uses the following definition: "For purposes of this program, epigenetics refers to both heritable changes in gene activity and expression (in the progeny of cells or of individuals) and also stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable."&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web |work=NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project |url=http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/overview |title=Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a consensus definition of the epigenetic trait, "stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence", was made at a [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] meeting.&lt;ref name="pmid19339683"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Berger SL, Kouzarides T, Shiekhattar R, Shilatifard A | title=An operational definition of epigenetics |journal=[[Genes &amp; Development]] | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=781–83 | year=2009 | pmid=19339683 | pmc=3959995 | doi=10.1101/gad.1787609 | url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/7/781.full }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity of the word to "genetics" has generated many parallel usages. The "epigenome" is a parallel to the word "genome", referring to the overall epigenetic state of a cell, and [[epigenomics]] refers to more global analyses of epigenetic changes across the entire genome.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt; The phrase "[[genetic code]]" has also been adapted – the "[[epigenetic code]]" has been used to describe the set of epigenetic features that create different phenotypes in different cells. Taken to its extreme, the "epigenetic code" could represent the total state of the cell, with the position of each molecule accounted for in an ''epigenomic map'', a diagrammatic representation of the gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modification status of a particular genomic region. More typically, the term is used in reference to systematic efforts to measure specific, relevant forms of epigenetic information such as the [[histone code hypothesis|histone code]] or [[DNA methylation]] patterns.

==Molecular basis==
Epigenetic changes modify the activation of certain genes, but not the genetic code sequence of DNA. The microstructure (not code) of DNA itself or the associated [[chromatin]] proteins may be modified, causing activation or silencing. This mechanism enables differentiated cells in a multicellular organism to express only the genes that are necessary for their own activity. Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Most epigenetic changes only occur within the course of one individual organism's lifetime; however, these epigenetic changes can be transmitted to the organism's offspring through a process called [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]].  Moreover, if gene inactivation occurs in a sperm or egg cell that results in fertilization, this epigenetic modification may also be transferred to the next generation.&lt;ref name="pmid17320501"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Chandler VL | title=Paramutation: from maize to mice | journal=Cell | volume=128 | issue=4 | pages=641–45 | date=February 2007 | pmid=17320501 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific epigenetic processes include [[paramutation]], [[bookmarking]], [[Imprinting (genetics)|imprinting]], [[gene silencing]], [[X-inactivation|X chromosome inactivation]], [[position effect]], [[DNA methylation reprogramming]], [[transvection (genetics)|transvection]], [[maternal effect]]s, the progress of [[carcinogenesis]], many effects of [[teratogen]]s, regulation of [[histone]] modifications and [[heterochromatin]], and technical limitations affecting [[parthenogenesis]] and [[cloning]].

=== DNA damage ===
DNA damage can also cause epigenetic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Kovalchuk O, Baulch JE | title=Epigenetic changes and nontargeted radiation effects – is there a link? | journal=Environ. Mol.

These damages are largely repaired, but at the site of a DNA repair, epigenetic changes can remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Cuozzo C, Porcellini A, Angrisano T, Morano A, Lee B, Di Pardo A, Messina S, Iuliano R, Fusco A, Santillo MR, Muller MT, Chiariotti L, Gottesman ME, Avvedimento EV | title=DNA damage, homology-directed repair, and DNA methylation | journal=PLoS Genet. | volume=3 | issue=7 | pages=e110 | date=July 2007 | pmid=17616978 | pmc=1913100 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a double strand break in DNA can initiate unprogrammed epigenetic gene silencing both by causing DNA methylation as well as by promoting silencing types of histone modifications (chromatin remodeling - see next section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=O'Hagan HM, Mohammad HP, Baylin SB | title=Double strand breaks can initiate gene silencing and SIRT1-dependent onset of DNA methylation in an exogenous promoter CpG island | journal=PLoS Genet. | volume=4 | issue=8 | pages=e1000155 | year=2008 | pmid=18704159 | pmc=2491723 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155 | editor1-last=Lee | editor1-first=Jeannie T }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the enzyme [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|Parp1 (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase)]] and its product poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) accumulate at sites of DNA damage as part of a repair process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Malanga M, Althaus FR | title=The role of poly(ADP-ribose) in the DNA damage signaling network | journal=Biochem Cell Biol | volume=83 | issue=3 | pages=354–64 | year=2005 | pmid=15959561 | doi=10.1139/o05-038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This accumulation, in turn, directs recruitment and activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1 that can cause [[nucleosome]] remodeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Gottschalk AJ, Timinszky G, Kong SE, Jin J, Cai Y, Swanson SK, Washburn MP, Florens L, Ladurner AG, Conaway JW, Conaway RC | title=Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation directs recruitment and activation of an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler | journal=Proc.

=== Techniques used to study epigenetics ===
Epigenetic research uses a wide range of [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] techniques to further understanding of epigenetic phenomena, including [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (together with its large-scale variants [[ChIP-on-chip]] and [[ChIP-Seq]]), [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]], methylation-sensitive [[restriction enzymes]], DNA adenine methyltransferase identification ([[DamID]]) and [[bisulfite sequencing]].&lt;ref name="verma"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3925982|year=2013|author1=Verma|first1=M|title=Epigenetic Research in Cancer Epidemiology: Trends, Opportunities, and Challenges|journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|volume=23|issue=2|pages=223–33|last2=Rogers|first2=S|last3=Divi|first3=R.

==Mechanisms==
Several types of epigenetic inheritance systems may play a role in what has become known as cell memory,&lt;ref name="jablonka92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Jablonka E, Lamb MJ, Lachmann M | title=Evidence, mechanisms and models for the inheritance of acquired characteristics | journal=[[J. Theor. Biol.]] |date=September 1992 | volume=158 | issue=2 | pages=245–68 | doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80722-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; note however that not all of these are universally accepted to be examples of epigenetics.

===Covalent modifications===
[[Covalent]] modifications of either DNA (e.g. cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation) or of histone proteins (e.g. lysine acetylation, lysine and arginine methylation, serine and threonine phosphorylation, and lysine ubiquitination and sumoylation) play central roles in many types of epigenetic inheritance. Therefore, the word "epigenetics" is sometimes used as a synonym for these processes. However, this can be misleading. Chromatin remodeling is not always inherited, and not all epigenetic inheritance involves chromatin remodeling.&lt;ref name="pmid17407749"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ptashne M | title=On the use of the word 'epigenetic' | journal=Curr. Biol. | volume=17 | issue=7 | pages=R233–36 | date=April 2007 | pmid=17407749 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|DNA associates with histone proteins to form chromatin.]]
Because the [[phenotype]] of a cell or individual is affected by which of its genes are transcribed, heritable [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription states]] can give rise to epigenetic effects. There are several layers of regulation of [[gene expression]]. One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the [[histone]] proteins with which it associates. If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well. Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms:
# The first way is [[post translational modification]] of the amino acids that make up histone proteins. Histone proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids. If the amino acids that are in the chain are changed, the shape of the histone might be modified. DNA is not completely unwound during replication. It is possible, then, that the modified histones may be carried into each new copy of the DNA. Once there, these histones may act as templates, initiating the surrounding new histones to be shaped in the new manner. By altering the shape of the histones around them, these modified histones would ensure that a lineage-specific transcription program is maintained after cell division.
# The second way is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at [[CpG site]]s, to convert [[cytosine]] to [[5-methylcytosine]]. 5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing with a guanine in double-stranded DNA. However, some areas of the genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from one parent or the other ([[genetic imprinting]]).

Mechanisms of heritability of histone state are not well understood; however, much is known about the mechanism of heritability of DNA methylation state during cell division and differentiation. Heritability of methylation state depends on certain enzymes (such as [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]]) that have a higher affinity for 5-methylcytosine than for cytosine. If this enzyme reaches a "hemimethylated" portion of DNA (where 5-methylcytosine is in only one of the two DNA strands) the enzyme will methylate the other half.

Although histone modifications occur throughout the entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[ubiquitylation]], [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], ribosylation and citrullination. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 [[lysine]]s of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally related to transcriptional competence.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

One mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with "active" transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like [[SWI/SNF]] and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur. This is the "cis" model of epigenetic function. In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Another model of epigenetic function is the "trans" model. In this model, changes to the histone tails act indirectly on the DNA. For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin-modifying enzymes (or transcription machinery as well). This chromatin remodeler can then cause changes to the state of the chromatin. Indeed, a bromodomain – a protein domain that specifically binds acetyl-lysine – is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the [[SWI/SNF]] complex. It may be that acetylation acts in this and the previous way to aid in transcriptional activation.

The idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by [[histone methylation]] as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive [[heterochromatin]]). It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein [[Heterochromatin Protein 1|HP1]] recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.

It has been shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is responsible for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 &amp; H4. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone.&lt;ref name="pmid9487389"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Jenuwein T, Laible G, Dorn R, Reuter G | title=SET domain proteins modulate chromatin domains in eu- and heterochromatin | journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. | volume=54 | issue=1 | pages=80–93 | date=January 1998 | pmid=9487389 | doi=10.1007/s000180050127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differing histone modifications are likely to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently from acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change the behavior of the [[nucleosome]]. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the [[histone code]], although the idea that histone state can be read linearly as a digital information carrier has been largely debunked. One of the best-understood systems that orchestrates chromatin-based silencing is the [[SIR protein]] based silencing of the yeast hidden mating type loci HML and HMR.

DNA methylation frequently occurs in repeated sequences, and helps to suppress the expression and mobility of '[[transposable elements]]':&lt;ref name="slotkin2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Slotkin RK, Martienssen R | title=Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=272–85 | date=April 2007 | pmid=17363976 | doi=10.1038/nrg2072 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[5-methylcytosine]] can be spontaneously deaminated (replacing nitrogen by oxygen) to [[thymidine]], CpG sites are frequently mutated and become rare in the genome, except at [[CpG islands]] where they remain unmethylated. Epigenetic changes of this type thus have the potential to direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. [[DNA methylation]] patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent [[DNA methyltransferase]]s, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice.&lt;ref name="li92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Li E, Bestor TH, Jaenisch R | title=Targeted mutation of the DNA methyltransferase gene results in embryonic lethality | journal=Cell | volume=69 | issue=6 | pages=915–26 | date=June 1992 | pmid=1606615 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90611-F }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNMT1 is the most abundant methyltransferase in somatic cells,&lt;ref name="robertson99"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Robertson KD, Uzvolgyi E, Liang G, Talmadge C, Sumegi J, Gonzales FA, Jones PA | title=The human DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1, 3a and 3b: coordinate mRNA expression in normal tissues and overexpression in tumors | journal=Nucleic Acids Res. | volume=27 | issue=11 | pages=2291–98 | date=June 1999 | pmid=10325416 | pmc=148793 | doi=10.1093/nar/27.11.2291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; localizes to replication foci,&lt;ref name="leonhardt92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Leonhardt H, Page AW, Weier HU, Bestor TH | title=A targeting sequence directs DNA methyltransferase to sites of DNA replication in mammalian nuclei | journal=Cell | volume=71 | issue=5 | pages=865–73 | date=November 1992 | pmid=1423634 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90561-P }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a 10–40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA and interacts with the [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]] (PCNA).&lt;ref name="chuang97"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Chuang LS, Ian HI, Koh TW, Ng HH, Xu G, Li BF | title=Human DNA-(cytosine-5) methyltransferase-PCNA complex as a target for p21WAF1 | journal=Science | volume=277 | issue=5334 | pages=1996–2000 | date=September 1997 | pmid=9302295 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5334.1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By preferentially modifying hemimethylated DNA, DNMT1 transfers patterns of methylation to a newly synthesized strand after [[DNA replication]], and therefore is often referred to as the ‘maintenance' methyltransferase.&lt;ref name="robertson00"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Robertson KD, Wolffe AP | title=DNA methylation in health and disease | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=11–19 | date=October 2000 | pmid=11262868 | doi=10.1038/35049533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNMT1 is essential for proper embryonic development, imprinting and X-inactivation.&lt;ref name="li92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="li93"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Li E, Beard C, Jaenisch R | title=Role for DNA methylation in genomic imprinting | journal=Nature | volume=366 | issue=6453 | pages=362–65 | date=November 1993 | pmid=8247133 | doi=10.1038/366362a0 | bibcode=1993Natur.366..362L }}&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasize the difference of this molecular mechanism of inheritance from the canonical Watson-Crick base-pairing mechanism of transmission of genetic information, the term 'Epigenetic templating' was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Viens A, Mechold U, Brouillard F, Gilbert C, Leclerc P, Ogryzko V | title=Analysis of human histone H2AZ deposition in vivo argues against its direct role in epigenetic templating mechanisms | journal=Mol.

Histones H3 and H4 can also be manipulated through demethylation using histone lysine demethylase (KDM). This recently identified enzyme has a catalytically active site called the Jumonji domain (JmjC). The demethylation occurs when JmjC utilizes multiple cofactors to hydroxylate the methyl group, thereby removing it. JmjC is capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and tri-methylated substrates.&lt;ref name="pmid19234061"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Nottke A, Colaiácovo MP, Shi Y | title=Developmental roles of the histone lysine demethylases | journal=Development | volume=136 | issue=6 | pages=879–89 | date=March 2009 | pmid=19234061 | pmc=2692332 | doi=10.1242/dev.020966 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RNA transcripts===
Sometimes a gene, after being turned on, transcribes a product that (directly or indirectly) maintains the activity of that gene. For example, [[Hnf4]] and [[MyoD]] enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the [[transcription factor]] activity of the [[proteins]] they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development.&lt;ref name="pmid19154003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Mattick JS, Amaral PP, Dinger ME, Mercer TR, Mehler MF | title=RNA regulation of epigenetic processes | journal=BioEssays | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=51–59 | date=January 2009 | pmid=19154003 | doi=10.1002/bies.080099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of [[alternative splicing|different splice forms]] of [[RNA]], or by formation of double-stranded RNA ([[RNAi]]). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are often turned on or off by [[signal transduction]], although in some systems where [[syncytia]] or [[gap junction]]s are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by [[diffusion]]. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the [[zygote]] by the mother during [[oogenesis]] or via [[nurse cell]]s, resulting in [[maternal effect]] phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA is transmitted from the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring.&lt;ref name="choi06"&gt;{{cite web|last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=RNA can be hereditary molecule |website=The Scientist |url=https://ukessay.com/blog/rna-can-be-hereditary-molecule |date=25 May 2006 |dead-url=no |archive-date=8 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208182915/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/23494/ |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroRNAs===
[[MicroRNA]]s (miRNAs) are members of [[non-coding RNA]]s that range in size from 17 to 25 nucleotides. miRNAs regulate a large variety of biological functions in plants and animals.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Bernal JE, Duran C, Papiha SS | title=Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of human microRNAs | journal=Cancer Lett | volume=331 | issue=1 | pages=1–10 | year=2012 | pmid=23246373 | doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2012.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, in 2013, about 2000 miRNAs have been discovered in humans and these can be found online in a miRNA database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/browse.pl Browse miRBase by species&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Each miRNA expressed in a cell may target about 100 to 200 messenger RNAs that it downregulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Lim LP, Lau NC, Garrett-Engele P, Grimson A, Schelter JM, Castle J, Bartel DP, Linsley PS, Johnson JM | title=Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs | journal=Nature | volume=433 | issue=7027 | pages=769–73 | year=2005 | pmid=15685193 | doi=10.1038/nature03315 |bibcode = 2005Natur.433..769L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the downregulation of mRNAs occurs by causing the decay of the targeted mRNA, while some downregulation occurs at the level of translation into protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee D, Shin C | year = 2012 | title = MicroRNA-target interactions: new insights from genome-wide approaches | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1271 | issue = | pages = 118–28 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06745.x | pmid = 23050973 | pmc=3499661| bibcode = 2012NYASA1271..118L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obesity-associated [[FTO gene]] is shown to be able to [[demethylate]] [[N6-methyladenosine]] in RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Guifang Jia |author2=Ye Fu |author3=Xu Zhao |author4=Qing Dai |author5=Guanqun Zheng |author6=Ying Yang |author7=Chengqi Yi |last8=Lindahl |first8=Tomas |author9=Tao Pan |author10=Yun-Gui Yang |author11=Chuan He |title=N6-Methyladenosine in nuclear RNA is a major substrate of the obesity-associated FTO|journal=[[Nature Chemical Biology]]|date=16 October 2011|volume=7|issue=12|pages=885–87|doi=10.1038/nchembio.687|pmid=22002720|pmc=3218240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-10-links-common-rna-modification-obesity.html |title=New research links common RNA modification to obesity |publisher=Physorg.com |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===sRNAs===
[[Bacterial small RNA|sRNAs]] are small (50–250 nucleotides), highly structured, non-coding RNA fragments found in bacteria. They control gene expression including [[virulence]] genes in pathogens and are viewed as new targets in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Howden BP, Beaume M, Harrison PF, Hernandez D, Schrenzel J, Seemann T, Francois P, Stinear TP | title=Analysis of the Small RNA Transcriptional Response in Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus after Antimicrobial Exposure | journal=Antimicrob.

Their phylogenetic analyses, for example through sRNA–mRNA target interactions or protein [[Hfq binding sRNA|binding properties]], are used to build comprehensive databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccb.bmi.ac.cn/srnatarbase/ sRNATarBase 2.0 A comprehensive database of bacterial SRNA targets verified by experiments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926215123/http://ccb.bmi.ac.cn/srnatarbase/ |date=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sRNA-[[gene map]]s based on their targets in microbial genomes are also constructed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srnamap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/ Genomics maps for small non-coding RNA's and their targets in microbial genomes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prions===
{{details|Fungal prions}}
[[Prion]]s are [[Infection|infectious]] forms of [[protein]]s. In general, proteins fold into discrete units that perform distinct cellular functions, but some proteins are also capable of forming an infectious conformational state known as a prion. Although often viewed in the context of [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|infectious disease]], prions are more loosely defined by their ability to catalytically convert other native state versions of the same protein to an infectious conformational state. It is in this latter sense that they can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without a modification of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Epigenetic inheritance and prions|vauthors=Yool A, Edmunds WJ | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year=1998 | pages=241–42 | volume=11 | doi=10.1007/s000360050085 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fungal prion]]s are considered by some to be epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome. [[PSI (prion)|PSI+]] and URE3, discovered in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=[PSI], a cytoplasmic suppressor of super-suppression in yeast | author=Cox BS| journal=Heredity | volume=20 | pages=505–21 | year=1965 | doi=10.1038/hdy.1965.65 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5573734"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Lacroute F | title=Non-Mendelian mutation allowing ureidosuccinic acid uptake in yeast | journal=J.

In PSI+ cells, the loss of the Sup35 protein (which is involved in termination of translation) causes ribosomes to have a higher rate of read-through of stop [[codon]]s, an effect that results in suppression of [[nonsense mutation]]s in other genes.&lt;ref name="pmid225301"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Liebman SW, Sherman F | title=Extrachromosomal psi+ determinant suppresses nonsense mutations in yeast | journal=J.

===Structural inheritance===
{{details|Structural inheritance}}
In [[ciliate]]s such as ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' and ''[[Paramecium]]'', genetically identical cells show heritable differences in the patterns of ciliary rows on their cell surface. Experimentally altered patterns can be transmitted to daughter cells. It seems existing structures act as templates for new structures. The mechanisms of such inheritance are unclear, but reasons exist to assume that multicellular organisms also use existing cell structures to assemble new ones.&lt;ref name="pmid1804215"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Sapp J | title=Concepts of organization.

===Nucleosome positioning===
Eukaryotic genomes have numerous [[nucleosomes]]. Nucleosome position is not random, and determine the accessibility of DNA to regulatory proteins. This determines differences in gene expression and cell differentiation. It has been shown that at least some nucleosomes are retained in sperm cells (where most but not all histones are replaced by [[protamines]]). Thus nucleosome positioning is to some degree inheritable. Recent studies have uncovered connections between nucleosome positioning and other epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation.&lt;ref name=Teif_2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Teif VB, Beshnova DA, Vainshtein Y, Marth C, Mallm JP, Höfer T, Rippe K | title=Nucleosome repositioning links DNA (de)methylation and differential CTCF binding during stem cell development | journal=Genome Research |date=8 May 2014 | volume=24 | pages=1285–95 | doi=10.1101/gr.164418.113 | pmid=24812327 | pmc=4120082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and consequences==

===Development===
Developmental epigenetics can be divided into predetermined and probabilistic epigenesis. Predetermined epigenesis is a unidirectional movement from structural development in DNA to the functional maturation of the protein. "Predetermined" here means that development is scripted and predictable. Probabilistic epigenesis on the other hand is a bidirectional structure-function development with experiences and external molding development.&lt;ref name=Griesemer_2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Griesemer J, Haber MH, Yamashita G, Gannett L | title=Critical Notice: Cycles of Contingency – Developmental Systems and Evolution | journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=March 2005 | volume=20 | issue =2–3 | pages=517–44 | doi=10.1007/s10539-004-0836-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somatic epigenetic inheritance, particularly through DNA and histone covalent modifications and [[nucleosome]] repositioning, is very important in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms.&lt;ref name="Teif_2014"/&gt; The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop, [[morphogen]]s activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a memory. In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only [[stem cells]] retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types ("totipotency" and "multipotency"). In [[mammal]]s, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, such as in [[Epigenetic Regulation of Neurogenesis|neurogenesis]], but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of. Epigenetic modifications regulate the transition from neural stem cells to glial progenitor cells (for example, differentiation into oligodendrocytes is regulated by the deacetylation and methylation of histones.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter: "Nervous System Development" in "Epigenetics," by Benedikt Hallgrimsson and Brian Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as [[chromatin remodeling]], it has been hypothesised that some kinds of plant cells do not use or require "cellular memories", resetting their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.&lt;ref name="pmid17194589"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Costa S, Shaw P | title='Open minded' cells: how cells can change fate | journal=Trends Cell Biol. | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=101–06 | date=March 2007 | pmid=17194589 | doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2006.12.005 | url=http://cromatina.icb.ufmg.br/biomol/seminarios/outros/grupo_open.pdf | quote=This might suggest that plant cells do not use or require a cellular memory mechanism and just respond to positional information.

Epigenetic changes can occur in response to environmental exposure – for example, mice given some dietary supplements have epigenetic changes affecting expression of the [[agouti gene]], which affects their fur color, weight, and propensity to develop cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid12163699"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Cooney CA, Dave AA, Wolff GL | title=Maternal methyl supplements in mice affect epigenetic variation and DNA methylation of offspring | journal=J.

Controversial results from one study suggested that traumatic experiences might produce an epigenetic signal that is capable of being passed to future generations. Mice were trained, using foot shocks, to fear a cherry blossom odor. The investigators reported that the mouse offspring had an increased aversion to this specific odor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fearful-memories-passed-down&amp;print=true Fearful Memories Passed Down to Mouse Descendants: Genetic imprint from traumatic experiences carries through at least two generations], By Ewen Callaway and Nature magazine | Sunday, 1 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-mice-sons-grandsons-dangers-sperm.html#ajTabs Mice can 'warn' sons, grandsons of dangers via sperm], by Mariette Le Roux, 12/1/13.&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested epigenetic changes that increase gene expression, rather than in DNA itself, in a gene, M71, that governs the functioning of an odor receptor in the nose that responds specifically to this cherry blossom smell. There were physical changes that correlated with olfactory (smell) function in the brains of the trained mice and their descendants. Several criticisms were reported, including the study's low statistical power as evidence of some irregularity such as bias in reporting results.&lt;ref&gt;G. Francis, "Too Much Success for Recent Groundbreaking Epigenetic Experiments" http://www.genetics.org/content/198/2/449.abstract&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limits of sample size, there is a probability that an effect will not be demonstrated to within statistical significance even if it exists. The criticism suggested that the probability that all the experiments reported would show positive results if an identical protocol was followed, assuming the claimed effects exist, is merely 0.4%. The authors also did not indicate which mice were siblings, and treated all of the mice as statistically independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24292232 | doi=10.1038/nn.3594 | volume=17 | title=Parental olfactory experience influences behavior and neural structure in subsequent generations | pmc=3923835 | year=2014 | journal=Nat. Neurosci. | pages=89–96 | vauthors=Dias BG, Ressler KJ}} (see comment by Gonzalo Otazu)&lt;/ref&gt; The original researchers pointed out negative results in the paper's appendix that the criticism omitted in its calculations, and undertook to track which mice were siblings in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41239/title/Epigenetics-Paper-Raises-Questions/{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgenerational===
{{main|Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance}}
&lt;!--Note that the first sentence of this section clashes with the first sentence of the article defining 'epigenetics', by which epigenetics is necessarily heritable. This may arise from confusing the molecular marks sometimes associated with epigenetic variation (e.g. DNA methylation) with epigenetic phenotypic variation itself.--&gt;
Epigenetic mechanisms were a necessary part of the evolutionary origin of [[cell differentiation]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-854968-7"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hoekstra RF | title = Evolution: an introduction | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2000 | page = 285 | isbn = 0-19-854968-7  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although epigenetics in multicellular organisms is generally thought to be a mechanism involved in differentiation, with epigenetic patterns "reset" when organisms reproduce, there have been some observations of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (e.g., the phenomenon of [[paramutation]] observed in [[maize]]). Although most of these multigenerational epigenetic traits are gradually lost over several generations, the possibility remains that multigenerational epigenetics could be another aspect to evolution and adaptation.
As mentioned above, some define epigenetics as heritable.

A sequestered germ line or [[Weismann barrier]] is specific to animals, and epigenetic inheritance is more common in plants and microbes. [[Eva Jablonka]], [[Marion J. Lamb]] and Étienne Danchin have argued that these effects may require enhancements to the standard conceptual framework of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] and have called for an [[extended evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-262-10107-6"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Lamb MJ, Jablonka E | title=Evolution in four dimensions: genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and symbolic variation in the history of life | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2005 | pages=| isbn=0-262-10107-6 | oclc=| doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Denis Noble]] ''The Music of Life'' see esp pp. 93–98 and p. 48 where he cites Jablonka &amp; Lamb and [[Massimo Pigliucci]]'s review of Jablonka and Lamb in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] '''435''', 565–566 (2 June 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Danchin É, Charmantier A, Champagne FA, Mesoudi A, Pujol B, Blanchet S | year = 2011 | title = Beyond DNA: integrating inclusive inheritance into an extended theory of evolution | url = http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v12/n7/full/nrg3028.html | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 475–86 | doi=10.1038/nrg3028 | pmid=21681209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other evolutionary biologists, such as [[John Maynard Smith]], have incorporated epigenetic inheritance into [[population genetics]] models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Maynard Smith J | title=Models of a Dual Inheritance System | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=143 | issue=1 | pages=41–53 | year=1990 | pmid=2359317 | doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80287-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or are openly skeptical of the extended evolutionary synthesis ([[Michael Lynch (geneticist)|Michael Lynch]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Lynch M | title=The frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity | journal=PNAS | volume=104 | issue=suppl. 1 | pages=8597–604 | year=2007 | pmid=17494740 | pmc=1876435 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0702207104 | bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8597L }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Dickins]] and [[Qazi Rahman]] state that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of [[natural selection]] and therefore fit under the earlier "[[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickins |first1=Thomas E. |last2=Rahman |first2=Qazi |title=The extended evolutionary synthesis and the role of soft inheritance in evolution |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=279 |issue=1740 |pages=2913–21 |year=2012 |pmid=22593110 |pmc=3385474 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.0273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filamentous fungus ''Neurospora crassa'' is a prominent model system for understanding the control and function of cytosine methylation. In this organism, DNA methylation is associated with relics of a genome defense system called RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) and silences gene expression by inhibiting transcription elongation.&lt;ref name="pmid19092133"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Lewis ZA, Honda S, Khlafallah TK, Jeffress JK, Freitag M, Mohn F, Schübeler D, Selker EU | title=Relics of repeat-induced point mutation direct heterochromatin formation in Neurospora crassa | journal=Genome Res. | volume=19 | issue=3 | pages=427–37 | date=March 2009 | pmid=19092133 | pmc=2661801 | doi=10.1101/gr.086231.108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[yeast]] [[prion]] PSI is generated by a conformational change of a translation termination factor, which is then inherited by daughter cells.

== Epigenetics in bacteria ==
[[File:Escherichia coli flagella TEM.png|thumb|150px|''Escherichia coli'' bacteria]]
While epigenetics is of fundamental importance in [[eukaryote]]s, especially [[Multicellular organism|metazoans]], it plays a different role in bacteria. Most importantly, eukaryotes use epigenetic mechanisms primarily to regulate gene expression which bacteria rarely do. However, bacteria make widespread use of postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria also use DNA [[adenine]] methylation (rather than DNA [[cytosine]] methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]], [[Vibrio]], [[Yersinia]], [[Haemophilus]]'', and ''[[Brucella]]''. In ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In ''[[Gammaproteobacteria]]'', adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression.&lt;ref name="JorgTost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casadesus"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Casadesús J, Low D | title=Epigenetic gene regulation in the bacterial world | journal=Microbiol.

In announcing the funding, government officials noted that epigenetics has the potential to explain mechanisms of aging, human development, and the origins of cancer, heart disease, mental illness, as well as several other conditions. Some investigators, like [[Randy Jirtle]], PhD, of Duke University Medical Center, think epigenetics may ultimately turn out to have a greater role in disease than genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Beil |title=Medicine's New Epicenter?

===Twins===
Direct comparisons of identical twins constitute an optimal model for interrogating environmental epigenetics. In the case of humans with different environmental exposures, monozygotic (identical) twins were epigenetically indistinguishable during their early years, while older twins had remarkable differences in the overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; The twin pairs who had spent less of their lifetime together and/or had greater differences in their medical histories were those who showed the largest differences in their levels of 5-methylcytosine DNA and acetylation of histones H3 and H4.&lt;ref name="pmid16009939" /&gt;

A high-throughput study, which denotes technology that looks at extensive genetic markers, focused on epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins to compare global and locus-specific changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications in a sample of 40 monozygotic twin pairs.&lt;ref name="pmid16009939" /&gt; In this case, only healthy twin pairs were studied, but a wide range of ages was represented, between 3 and 74 years. One of the major conclusions from this study was that there is an age-dependent accumulation of epigenetic differences between the two siblings of twin pairs. This accumulation suggests the existence of epigenetic “drift”. Epigenetic drift is the term given to epigenetic modifications as they occur as a direct function with age. While age is a known risk factor for many diseases, age-related methylation
has been found to occur differentially at specific sites along the genome. Over time, this  can result in measurable differences between biological and chronological age. Epigenetic changes have been found to be reflective of lifestyle and may act as functional biomarkers of disease before clinical threshold is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wallace |first1=Robert G. |last2=Twomey |first2=Laura C. |last3=Custaud |first3=Marc-Antoine |last4=Moyna |first4=Niall |last5=Cummins |first5=Philip M. |last6=Mangone |first6=Marco |last7=Murphy |first7=Ronan P. |title=Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers of Epigenetic Drift within the Cardiovascular Compartment |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2016 |issue= |pages=2465763 |year=2016 |pmid=26942189 |pmc=4749768 |doi=10.1155/2016/2465763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study, where 114 monozygotic twins and 80 dizygotic twins were analyzed for the DNA methylation status of around 6000 unique genomic regions, concluded that epigenetic similarity at the time of blastocyst splitting may also contribute to phenotypic similarities in monozygotic co-twins. This supports the notion that microenvironment at early stages of embryonic development can be quite important for the establishment of epigenetic marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Kaminsky ZA, Tang T, Wang SC, Ptak C, Oh GH, Wong AH, Feldcamp LA, Virtanen C, Halfvarson J, Tysk C, McRae AF, Visscher PM, Montgomery GW, Gottesman II, Martin NG, Petronis A | title=DNA methylation profiles in monozygotic and dizygotic twins | journal=Nat Genet | volume=41 | issue=2 | pages=240–45 | year=2009 | pmid=19151718 | doi=10.1038/ng.286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Congenital genetic disease is well understood and it is clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of [[Angelman syndrome]] and [[Prader-Willi syndrome]]. These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially [[hemizygous]] because of [[genomic imprinting]], and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|105830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genomic imprinting===
{{further|Genomic imprinting}}

Some human disorders are associated with [[genomic imprinting]], a phenomenon in mammals where the father and mother contribute different epigenetic patterns for specific genomic loci in their [[germ cells]].&lt;ref name="pmid17121465"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Wood AJ, Oakey RJ | title=Genomic imprinting in mammals: emerging themes and established theories | journal=PLoS Genet. | volume=2 | issue=11 | pages=e147 | date=November 2006 | pmid=17121465 | pmc=1657038 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known case of imprinting in human disorders is that of [[Angelman syndrome]] and [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] – both can be produced by the same genetic mutation, [[chromosome 15q partial deletion]], and the particular syndrome that will develop depends on whether the mutation is inherited from the child's mother or from their father.&lt;ref name="pmid2564739"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Knoll JH, Nicholls RD, Magenis RE, Graham JM, Lalande M, Latt SA | title=Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes share a common chromosome 15 deletion but differ in parental origin of the deletion | journal=Am.

[[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]] is also associated with genomic imprinting, often caused by abnormalities in maternal genomic imprinting of a region on chromosome 11.

[[Rett syndrome]] is underlain by mutations in the [[MECP2]] gene despite no large-scale changes in expression of MeCP2 being found in microarray analyses. [[BDNF]] is downregulated in the MECP2 mutant resulting in Rett syndrome.

A variety of epigenetic mechanisms can be perturbed in different types of cancer.

===Diabetic wound healing===
Epigenetic modifications have given insight into the understanding of the pathophysiology of different disease conditions. Though, they are strongly associated with cancer, their role in other pathological conditions are of equal importance. It appears that, the hyperglycaemic environment could imprint such changes at the genomic level, that macrophages are primed towards a pro-inflammatory
state and could fail to exhibit any phenotypic alteration towards the pro-healing type. This phenomenon of altered Macrophage Polarization is mostly associated with all the diabetic complications in a clinical set-up. At present, several reports reveal the relevance of different epigenetic modifications with respect to diabetic complications. Sooner or later, with the advancements in biomedical
tools, the detection of such biomarkers as prognostic and diagnostic tools in patients could possibly emerge out as alternative approaches. It is noteworthy to mention here that the use of epigenetic modifications as therapeutic targets warrant extensive preclinical as well as clinical evaluation prior to use.&lt;ref&gt;Mallik SB, Jayashree BS, Shenoy RR.

The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75).

Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of anxiety-related phenotypes has been reported in a preclinical study using mice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Short |first1=A K |last2=Fennell |first2=K A |last3=Perreau |first3=V M |last4=Fox |first4=A |last5=O’Bryan |first5=M K |last6=Kim |first6=J H |last7=Bredy |first7=T W |last8=Pang |first8=T Y |last9=Hannan |first9=A J |title=Elevated paternal glucocorticoid exposure alters the small noncoding RNA profile in sperm and modifies anxiety and depressive phenotypes in the offspring |journal=Translational Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e837 |year=2016 |pmid=27300263 |pmc=4931607 |doi=10.1038/tp.2016.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this investigation, transmission of paternal stress-induced traits across generations involved small non-coding RNA signals transmitted via the male germline.

=== Depression ===
Epigenetic inheritance of depression-related phenotypes has also been reported in a preclinical study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inheritance of paternal stress-induced traits across generations involved small non-coding RNA signals transmitted via the paternal germline.

=== Fear conditioning ===
Studies on mice have shown that certain conditional fears can be inherited from either parent. In one example, mice were conditioned to fear a strong scent, [[acetophenone]], by accompanying the smell with an electric shock. Consequently, the mice learned to fear the scent of acetophenone alone. It was discovered that this fear could be passed down to the mice offspring. Despite the offspring never experiencing the electric shock themselves the mice still displayed a fear of the acetophenone scent, because they inherited the fear epigenetically by site-specific DNA methylation. These epigenetic changes lasted up to two generations without reintroducing the shock.&lt;ref name="Szyf2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szyf M |title=Lamarck revisited: epigenetic inheritance of ancestral odor fear conditioning |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=2–4 |year=2014 |pmid=24369368 |doi=10.1038/nn.3603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The two forms of heritable information, namely genetic and epigenetic, are collectively denoted as dual inheritance. Members of the APOBEC/AID family of [[cytosine deaminase]]s may concurrently influence genetic and epigenetic inheritance using similar molecular mechanisms, and may be a point of crosstalk between these conceptually compartmentalized processes.&lt;ref name="pmid20800313"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Chahwan R, Wontakal SN, Roa S | title=Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic information through cytosine deamination | journal=Trends Genet. | volume=26 | issue=10 | pages=443–48 | date=October 2010 | pmid=20800313 | doi=10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics induce epigenetic changes in [[mammalian]] cells through iron [[chelation]]. This leads to epigenetic effects through inhibition of α-ketoglutarate-dependent [[dioxygenases]] that require [[iron]] as a co-factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=26205818 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M115.671222 | volume=290 | title=Nonantibiotic Effects of Fluoroquinolones in Mammalian Cells. | date=Sep 2015 | journal=J Biol Chem | pages=22287–97 | pmc=4571980 | author=Badal S, Her YF, Maher LJ 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various pharmacological agents are applied for the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or maintain the embryonic stem cell (ESC) phenotypic via epigenetic approach. Adult stem cells like bone marrow stem cells have also shown a potential to differentiate into cardiac competent cells when treated with G9a histone methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=mezentseva|first1=nadejda|last2=yang|first2=jinpu|last3=kaur|first3=keerat|last4=eisenberg|first4=carol|last5=eisenberg|first5=leonard|title=The histone methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294 enhances the cardiac potential of bone marrow cells.|date=2012|pmid=22994322|doi=10.1089/scd.2012.0181|volume=22|journal=Stem Cells Dev|pages=654–67|pmc=3564468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=yang|first1=jinpu|last2=kaur|first2=keerat|last3=ong|first3=lilin|last4=eisenberg|first4=carol|last5=eisenberg|first5=leonard|title=Inhibition of G9a Histone Methyltransferase Converts Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Cardiac Competent Progenitors.|journal=Stem Cells International|date=2015|pmid=26089912|doi=10.1155/2015/270428|volume=2015|pages=270428|pmc=4454756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudoscience==
Due to epigenetics being in the early stages of development as a science and the [[sensationalism]] surrounding it in the public media, [[David Gorski]] and geneticist [[Adam Rutherford]] advised caution against proliferation of false and [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] conclusions by [[new age]] authors who make unfounded suggestions that a person's genes and health can be manipulated by [[brainwashing|mind control]]. Misuse of the scientific term by [[quackery|quack authors]] has produced misinformation to the general public.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/19/epigenetics-dna--darwin-adam-rutherford "Beware the pseudo gene genies"]. The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/epigenetics-it-doesnt-mean-what-quacks-think-it-means/ "Epigenetics: It doesn’t mean what quacks think it means"].

[[Fair trade]] is where a farmer or craftsperson is paid a fair price for their product, one that represents its true worth, not just the lowest price that it is possible to pay. This is a price that covers the cost of production and enables the producer to live with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Trade New Zealand is an organisation that was launched in 2005 which supports fair trade by ensuring that farmers and workers' rights are not exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/What-is-Fairtrade/Who-we-are "Who We Are"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Oxfam]] New Zealand, there are several companies to support fairly traded goods from, which are exported to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/what-we-do/issues/fair-trade "Fair trade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013-2014 there were 42 Fair Trade Licensees and Traders in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2013/14 Annual Report ''Fair Trade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015-2016 this number rose to 54 Fair Trade Licensees and Traders in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Fair Trade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gwen Green, Oxfam's Engagement Director, says: "when farmers are paid fairly for their products, we see people able to make real improvements to their lives and their communities. Producers who used to struggle to feed their families are able to give their children an education, and communities can build schools and develop businesses. It is one of the smart solutions to poverty".&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/news/kiwis-have-fairtrade-cuppa-give-farmers-fair-go "Kiwis have a Fairtrade cuppa to give farmers a fair go"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Wellington became the first fair trade capital city in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Wellington Fair Trade [https://www.wellingtonfairtrade.org.nz "Fair Trade City"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Whangarei was recognised by the Fair Trade Association of Australia New Zealand as being one of four fair trade councils in New Zealand, and the first fair trade district in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Lambly [http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/northland/91210547/whangarei-becomes-first-fair-trade-district-in-nz "Whangarei becomes first Fair Trade District in New Zealand"] (5 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair trade and human rights==
[[International human rights law]] is founded on the idea that all human beings have the same set of fundamental rights.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran ''International Human Rights Law'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to equality and non-discrimination provides that human beings, regardless of their status or membership of a particular group, are entitled to the same set of rights.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran ''International Human Rights Law'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted in 1948, includes in it protections against discrimination and slavery, and provides for the rights to freedom of association and to form and join trade unions, the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work, to protection against unemployment and the right to equal pay for equal work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justin Nolan and Simon Rice ''The International Law of Human Rights'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2011) at 554.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of equality is reflected in the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights'.

Freedom from slavery and compulsory labour is recognised in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom from slavery and the prohibition of the slave trade refers to the practice of treating human beings as property.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justin Nolan and Simon Rice ''The International Law of Human Rights'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2011) at 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced or compulsory labour is also prohibited under article 8 of the Covenant, although it is subject to exceptions. That is, performance of labour as part of a prison sentence will not breach a state's obligations.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art 8(3)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; The right to employment with just and favourable conditions is recognised in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), and these conditions should provide workers with fair wages and equal pay for work of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand law and standards==
New Zealand law does not generally have extraterritorial effect. The extraterritorial application of human rights regimes can be defined as the existence of a legal obligation to respect rights.&lt;ref&gt;Marko Milanovic ''Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) at 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fair Trading Act 1986]] deals with misleading and deceptive conduct,&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trading Act 1986, s 9&lt;/ref&gt; and despite its title, has no direct legal connection with this particular aspect of fair trade in New Zealand. In New Zealand slavery and forced labour are criminalised. A person is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years who, within or outside New Zealand, sells and purchases, or in any way whatsoever deals with any person as a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1961, ss 98(1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery]] is prohibited by  the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]. Slavery is also not mentioned in the [[Human Rights Act 1993]]. There is currently no law that fair trade products need to be endorsed or supported through both private and public organisations in New Zealand.

==Fair trade labelling laws==
The [[Fairtrade Mark]] indicates that products purchased by consumers are supporting farmers and workers as they work to improve their livelihoods and provide better support to their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/What-is-Fairtrade/What-Fairtrade-does "What Fairtrade Does"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015-2016 79% of New Zealanders recognised the Fairtrade Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Fairtrade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, recognition of the Fairtrade Mark in New Zealand reached 78% and measured at NZ$89 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Strengthening Regional Impact'', at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The total revenue for Fairtrade ANZ has increased by 29% in the 2016 Financial Year.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Strengthening Regional Impact'', at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two recognised international fair trade systems - the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO) and [[Fairtrade Labelling Organisations International]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair trade label appears on product packaging and is a consumer guarantee which is awarded to specific products that have been traded according to the International Fair trade labelling standards.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the WFTO certifies organisations as fair trade organisations - throughout their entire supply chain.

==Principles of fair trade==
The [[Fair Trade Federation]] is an organisation that recognises and upholds those principles to promote equity in international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Federation [http://www.fairtradefederation.org/fair-trade-federation-principles/ "Fair Trade Federation Principles"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation works with The [[World Fair Trade Organisation]] (WFTO) and subscribes to similar fair trade principles. The organisation has ten principles of fair trade which it follows. These principles listed below are sourced from the WFTO website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://wfto.com/fair-trade/10-principles-fair-trade "Ten Principles of Fair Trade"] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
#	Opportunities for disadvantaged producers
#	Transparency and accountability
#	Fair trade practices
#	Fair payment
#	No child labour, no forced labour
#	No discrimination, gender equity, freedom of association
#	Good working conditions
#	Capacity building
#	Promote fair trade
#	Respect for the environment

==Fair trade suppliers==
Oxfam New Zealand works with suppliers that sell a range of fair trade products in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/what-we-do/issues/fair-trade/buy-fairtrade "Buy Fairtrade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Trade Aid, Whittaker's, All Good Bananas, and L'Affare are some suppliers that trade fair trade products.
* Trade Aid is New Zealand's oldest and largest fair trade organisation, which was established in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid New Zealand [https://www.tradeaid.org.nz/our-story/ "Our Story"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The original goal of Trade Aid is to "support the work of self-help organisations through long-term trading relationships based on transparency and fairness".&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid "How fair is fair?" ''Education Series 2''.&lt;/ref&gt; Each year Trade Aid allocates New Zealand Government aid monies - $220,000 in 2012-13 - to fund projects aimed at increasing sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid "Business Matters" ''Education Series 6''.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade Aid sources its products from more than 65 trading partner organisations who buy these products from small groups of farmers and artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid New Zealand [https://www.tradeaid.org.nz/about-us/ "About Us"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Whittaker's]] have fair trade certification for two of their chocolate block products, the 5 Roll Refined Creamy Milk and 72% Dark Ghana. The cocoa beans for these blocks come from the Fair trade cooperative [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/News/News/Archive/Whittakers-creamiest-block-cream-of-the-crop "Whittaker's Creamiest Block"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Whittaker's buys all of its cocoa beans through the Ghana Cocoa Board. The Ghana Cocoa Board is the government organisation responsible for marketing the Ghanaian cocoa crop. The Ghana Cocoa Board, in partnership with other organisations, is committed to ensuring that the cocoa industry in Ghana is conducted in a socially responsible manner.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Cocoa Board [https://www.cocobod.gh "GCB"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Whittaker's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation, an organisation that support farmers and communities in cocoa-growing regions in several third world countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Cocoa Foundation [http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/about-wcf/history-mission/ "History and mission"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*All Good Bananas is a 100% New Zealand owned and operated company.&lt;ref&gt;All Good Organics [http://allgoodorganics.co.nz/fairtrade-bananas/ "Fairtrade Bananas"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first fair trade bananas import to New Zealand in 2010, $940,000 has been given back to the El Guabo community in fair trade premium funding.&lt;ref&gt;All Good Organics [http://allgoodorganics.co.nz/about "About"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*L'Affare is a coffee business that was established in Wellington, New Zealand in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;L'Affare [http://www.laffare.co.nz/about/ "About"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; L'Affare partners with Trade Aid which supports the imports of fair trade coffee from local communities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laffare.co.nz/coffee/fairtrade/ "Fair Trade and Sustainability"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universities==
There are two universities in New Zealand that have been recognised by the [[Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand]] as fair trade universities. In 2013 the [[University of Otago]] became the first New Zealand university to be granted fair trade accreditation, along with more than 100 universities around the world that have become fair trade institutions.&lt;ref&gt;University of Otago [http://www.otago.ac.nz/otagobulletin/news/otago057741.html "Otago Becomes New Zealand's First Fairtrade University"] (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Vice Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne says: "I am proud of the effort staff and students have gone to make this happen and look forward to a long and meaningful association with Fairtrade. We now have Fairtrade products available at all seven outlets on campus and 90 per cent of residential students have access to Fairtrade products in their colleges". In July 2017, the [[University of Canterbury]] was also granted fair trade accreditation, becoming the first entirely fair trade campus in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The fair trade criteria for accreditation is that 50 per cent of products should be fair trade, where that option is available.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The supporting of fair trade products at University of Canterbury means that the campus uses fair trade coffee, tea and hot drinking chocolate, as well as selling Trade Aid chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.sustain.canterbury.ac.nz/fairtrade/ "Fair Trade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Chair of the UC Fair Trade Committee Dr John Hopkins stated "by the time we applied for accreditation, UC purchases for tea and coffee had reached 80 per cent, and are still rising". Professor Ian Wright from the University of Canterbury says: "our staff and students can be proud that their commitment will have far-reaching impacts, not only in raising awareness in the local community, but in directly benefiting producers, growers and workers in developing countries".&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fidelity''' when personified in Western art stands for the secular aspect of Faith, or the trust that exists between a master and servant, or in family relationships.  [[Fidelity]] is often represented as a woman, shown holding a golden seal and a key, but may also be represented by a dog. Fidelity may be shown alone, or may be accompanied by a dog, a symbol of not only faithfulness but also fidelity.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, James. Dictionary of Subjects &amp; Symbols in Art. Rev. ed. United States of America: Westview Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, [[Penelope]] or [[Griselda (folklore)|Griselda]] might also stand for fidelity. Fidelity is not in the usual lists of the [[seven virtues]], though it may sometimes be included in such groupings. The plant myrtle (''[[Myrtus]]'') has been associated with fidelity, and hence used in weddings, from Roman times to the present, and wreathed crowns of myrtle may be found in art.

A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of fidelity personified.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; The deep origins of this can also be recognized in the generic name ''Fido'' given to dogs, which originated from the Latin word ''fidus,'' meaning "trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the faithful dog of Titus Labienus, that would not quit his master's corpse, recorded in [[Pliny's Natural History]] book viii, was briefly recounted in [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia'' (1593, etc.) in the explanation of the emblem of ''Fedeltà'' represented as a woman holding a ring and accompanied by a white dog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asim.it/iconologia/ICONOLOGIAview.asp?Id=97 Ripa, ''Iconologia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fidelity in portraiture ==
When in a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. When the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's "[[Arnolfini Portrait]]."

== Fidelity and Death ==
During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crusaders|crusader]] lying in full armor on his tomb-chest, with a dog beneath his feet is a familiar trope.

'''Helical growth''' is the expansion of [[fungi|fungal]], [[algae|algal]] or higher plant cells or organs leading to a twisted (i.e. [[Helix|helical]]) [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organ (biology)|organ]] shape. Helical growth typically results in the breaking of (usually radial) [[symmetry (biology)]]. Resulting shapes may be left-handed or right-handed. Helical growth can arise naturally (e.g. as seen in tendrils or in [[twining plant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goriely | first1 = A. | last2 = Tabor | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Spontaneous helix-hand reversal and tendril perversion in climbing plants | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 1564–156 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.80.1564 | bibcode=1998PhRvL..80.1564G}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or artificially by [[mutation]] (''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''). In many cases, a phenomenon known as [[tendril perversion]] is seen, in which a tendril curves in opposite directions at each end, with a transition in-between.&lt;ref name=Goriely2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/research/researchgroups/applied/siam/resources/SIAM_Day_2013_AGoriely_lecture.pdf|title=Inversion, Rotation, and Perversion in Mechanical Biology: From Microscopic Anisotropy to Macroscopic Chirality | author=Alain Goriely | date = 2013 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helical growth of twining plants is based on a [[nutation in plants|nutational movement]] of stems (circumnutation). When such stems find support this nutational movement may become fixed into a helical winding. Most twining plants show right-handed helices regardless of the hemisphere the plant is growing in.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, W. et al. 2007. The global trend in plant twining direction. ''Global Ecol. Biogeogr.'' 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[missense mutation]] in the conserved grip1 motif, called spiral3, caused a left-handed helical organization of cortical microtubule arrays, and severe right-handed helical growth. The spiral3 mutation compromises interaction between GCP2 and GCP3, another subunit of the complex, in yeast. In the spiral3 mutant, microtubule dynamics and nucleation efficiency were not markedly affected, but nucleating angles were wider and more divergently distributed. A spiral3 katanin double mutant had swollen and twisted epidermal cells, and showed that the microtubule minus ends were not released from the nucleation sites, although the nucleating angles distributed in a similar manner to those in spiral3. These results show that Arabidopsis GCP2 has an important role in precisely positioning the gamma-tubulin-containing complex on pre-existing microtubules and in the proper organization of cortical arrays.&lt;ref name="NakamuraHashimoto2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors =Nakamura M, Hashimoto T|title=A mutation in the Arabidopsis -tubulin-containing complex causes helical growth and abnormal microtubule branching|journal=Journal of Cell Science|volume=122|issue=13|year=2009|pages=2208–2217|issn=0021-9533|doi=10.1242/jcs.044131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helical growth of single cells, as seen in ''[[Phycomyces]]'' (Fungi) and ''[[Nitella]]'' (Characeae), is believed to be caused by a helical arrangement of microfibrils in the cell wall. This was suggested by birefringence analyses of cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roelofsen | first1 = P.A. | year = 1965 | title = Ultrastructure of the wall in growing cells and its relation to the direction of growth | url = | journal = Adv.

Mutant analysis strongly supports the idea that cortical microtubules have an important role in controlling the direction of organ expansion in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hashimoto | first1 = T | year = 2002 | title = Molecular genetic analysis of left-right handedness in plants | url = | journal = Philos.

'''Home economics''', '''domestic science''' or '''home science''' is a field of study&lt;ref&gt;[[International Federation for Home Economics]] (IFHE): Position Statement in: ''International Journal of Home Economics''; Volume 1, Issue 1, available [http://www.ifhe.org here]&lt;/ref&gt; that deals with the relationship between individuals, families, communities, and the environment in which they live.

==Name==
Family and consumer science was previously known in the United States as home economics, often abbreviated "home ec" or "HE". In 1994, various organizations, including the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]], adopted the new term "family and consumer science" to reflect the fact that the field covers aspects outside of home life and wellness.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafcs.org/AboutUs/FAQ.asp#10|publisher=American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences|title=FAQ|accessdate=2015-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111213950/http://www.aafcs.org/AboutUs/FAQ.asp#10|archive-date=2015-01-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is also known by other names, including human sciences, home science, and domestic economy. In addition, home economics has a strong historic relationship to the field of [[human ecology]], and since the 1960s a number of university-level home economics programs have been renamed "[[human ecology]]" programs, including [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology|Cornell University's program]].&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Change to Human Ecology?|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/cases/namechange.html|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Catharine Beecher.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Catharine Beecher, American educator]]
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Ellen Richards, photograph ca. 1864]]

One of the first to champion the economics of running a home was [[Catherine Beecher]], sister to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].  Catherine and Harriet both were leaders in mid-19th century North America in talking about domestic science.  They came from a very religious family that valued education especially for women.

The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 propelled domestic science further ahead as land grant colleges sought to educate farm wives in running their households as their husbands were being educated in agricultural methods and processes. [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Illinois]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Michigan]] were early leaders offering programs for women.  There were women graduates of these institutions several years before the [[Lake Placid Conferences]] which gave birth to the home economics movement.

The home economics movement started with [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], who was the first woman to attend [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and later became the first female instructor.  Through her [[chemistry]] research, she became an expert in water quality and later began to focus on applying scientific principles to domestic situations.  At the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair|Chicago World’s Fair]] in 1893, she designed the Rumford Kitchen, which was a tiny kitchen that served nutritious meals to thousands of fair goers, along with a healthy dose of nutrition education.  She shunned an invitation to participate in the Women’s Building as she said none of her research was just women’s work, but rather information for all.

[[Image:Home Economics 1911.jpg|thumb|250px|A home economics class in 1911 in [[Toronto]]]]
Late in the 19th century, Richards convened a group of contemporaries to discuss the essence of domestic science and how the elements of this discipline would ultimately improve the quality of life for many individuals and families. They met at pristine Lake Placid, New York at the invitation of [[Melvil Dewey]].  Over the course of the next 10 years, these educators worked tirelessly to elevate the discipline, which was to become home economics, to a legitimate profession.  Richards wanted to call this [[oekology]] or the science of right living. [[Euthenics]], the science of controllable environment, was also a name of her choice, but "home economics" was ultimately chosen as the official term in 1899.&lt;ref name=aafcs&gt;{{cite web|title=AAFCS Brand Story|url=http://www.aafcs.org/res/branding/AAFCS_Brand_Story.pdf|publisher=American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences|accessdate=20 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908184750/http://www.aafcs.org/res/branding/AAFCS_Brand_Story.pdf|archive-date=8 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards then founded the American Home Economics Association (now called the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]]) in 1909.&lt;ref name=aafcs/&gt;

In the 1910s the AHEA won passage of two crucial pieces of legislation that allowed home economists to establish formal niches for research and teaching within institutions of higher education.  The [[Smith-Lever Act]] of 1914 and the [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 provided funding to expand demonstration work in rural communities and to develop and teach a home economics curriculum on the campuses of most state land-grant colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 36.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation contributed to the creation of the Office of Home Economics, which grew into the [[Bureau of Home Economics]], at the [[US Department of Agriculture]] during the early 20th century.

Home economics emerged at the turn of the twentieth century as a movement to train women to be more efficient household managers.  At the same moment, American families began to consume many more goods and services than they produced.  To guide women in this transition, professional home economics had two major goals:  to teach women to assume their new roles as modern consumers and to communicate homemakers’ needs to manufacturers and political leaders.  The development of the profession progressed from its origins as an educational movement to its identity as a source of consumer expertise in the interwar period to its virtual disappearance by the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Dust jacket.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional goal of the field was to “rationalize housework”, or lend the social status of a profession to it, based on a theory that housework could be intellectually fulfilling to women engaged in it, along with any emotional or relational benefits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elias|first=Megan|date=January 2006|title="Model Mamas": The Domestic Partnership of Home Economics Pioneers Flora Rose and Martha Van Rensselaer|jstor=4617244|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=15 |issue=1|pages=65–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, home economics classes were intended to ready young women for their duties in the home in healthy environments. Classes were first offered in the United States, Canada, Germany and Great Britain, followed by Latin America, Asia, and Africa. International organizations such as those associated with the [[United Nations]] have been involved in starting home economics programs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Robert, Editor-in-Chief, et al. 1971. ''Funk  &amp; Wagnall’s New Encyclopedia''. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnall’s, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1940s [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] (later University) was the only program granting a master of science in household equipment. However, this program was centered on the ideals that women should acquire practical skills but also a scientifically based understanding of how technology in the household works. For example, women were required to disassemble and then reassemble kitchen machinery so they could understand basic operations as well as repair the equipment. In doing so, Iowa State effectively created culturally acceptable forms of physics and engineering for women in an era when these pursuits were not generally accessible to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Gendered Technical Training and Consumerism in Home Economics, 1920-1980|journal=Technology and Culture|date=October 2002|volume=43|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Home Economics class receiving instructions on cooking. Ottawa, Ontario, 1959.jpg|thumb|A Home Economics class receiving instruction in cooking, Ottawa, Ontario, 1959.]]

Home economists … found a receptive audience among many of its young female members who expressed interest in learning about how to improve their homes, spend their leisure time, and make decisions about what to buy, what to make at home, and even what books to read.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 13.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Though men’s participation in Home Economics programs was encouraged it was not actively recruited, and in future courses at universities such as Cornell, men’s roles became entrenched in such courses as hotel management in the hospitality industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A Standards Committee’s proposal in 1924 changed the AHEA constitution allowing for a special voting membership section clearing the way for HEIB (Home Economists in Business) section.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 150.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group of HEIB members worked for food companies such as Washburn Crosby (later General Mills), Kellogg’s, ..or trade associations charged with promoting particular foods such as the Institute of American Meat Packers and the National Dairy Council.  [Some] worked as journalists for women’s magazines such as.. the Ladies’ Home Journal.  [Others] worked for utility companies.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 149.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The function that home economists have been performing for more than a century remains key to our experiences as consumers, but the professional identity has disappeared.  Indeed, efforts to reposition the discipline ultimately led to its renaming in the late twentieth century.  In 1994, “home economics” was replaced by “family and consumer science.”…This renaming signaled a formal break from the field’s association with domesticity, highlighting instead issues of “family” and “consumption.”&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 295.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new actor that rose to prominence in the 1980s was the charismatic celebrity unaligned with home economists or any other professional group. [[Martha Stewart]] and her fellow “domestic celebrities,” in television programs, books, magazines, and websites, attest to the continued importance of independent experts and commercial mass-media organizations in facilitating technological and cultural change in consumer products and services industries.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 299.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

To a great degree, Americans today tap into values once enshrined in a home economics curriculum to express a national identity and assert a standard of living that is distinct not only from Developing Nations but also from the cultures of other Industrialized Nations....  Even as luxury consumption exerts a cultural pull for many, middle-class culture still celebrates consumers who make sensible, controlled choices in the marketplace, resisting pure pleasure, impulse purchases, and cheap or shoddy goods.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 300.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice homes in American colleges===
Practice homes were added to American universities in the early 1900’s in order to model a living situation, although the all-women ‘team’ model used for students was different from prevailing expectations of housewives. For example, women were graded on collaboration, while households at the time assumed that women would be working independently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nevertheless, the practice homes were valued. These practicum courses took place in a variety of environments including single-family homes, apartments, and student dorm-style blocks. For a duration of a number of weeks, students lived together while taking on different roles and responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, interior decoration, hosting, and budgeting. Some classes also involved caring for young infants, temporarily adopted from orphanages. Childcare practicums were often included at the same time as other classwork, requiring students to configure their intellectual and home lives as compatible with one another. According to Megan Elias, “in the ideal, domestic work was as important as work done outside the home and it was performed by teams of equals who rotated roles. Each member of the team was able to live a life outside the home as well as inside the home, ideally, one that both informed her domestic work and was informed by it. This balance between home and the wider world was basic to the movement”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===American university departments===
Departments were set up in a number of American universities.  For example [[Brigham Young University]] had a department from 1920-1950.&lt;ref&gt;https://byuorg.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Brigham_Young_University._Dept._of_Home_Economics_(1930-1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

FCS is taught worldwide, as an elective or a required course in [[secondary education]], and in many tertiary and [[continuing education]] institutions. Sometimes it is also taught in [[primary education]].  International cooperation in the field is coordinated by the [[International Federation for Home Economics]], established in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifhe.org/34.html|title=About IFHE|accessdate=2015-01-11|publisher=International Federation for Home Economics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207025618/http://www.ifhe.org/34.html|archive-date=2014-12-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
[[File:RSOfleiden1898Gartenarbeitunbek.jpg|thumb|Gardening in Ofleiden, 1898]]
Between 1880 and 1900, the [[Reifenstein schools]] concept was initiated by Ida von Kortzfleisch, a Prussian noble woman and early German feminist. Reifenstein refers to Reifenstein im Eichsfeld, a municipality in Thuringia and site of the first permanent school. Reifensteiner Verband comprised from 1897 till 1990 about 15 own schools and cooperated with further operators. About 40 wirtschaftliche Frauenschulen, rural economist women schools were connected to the Reifensteiner concept and movement and allowed higher education for women already in the German Kaiserreich.&lt;ref&gt;Ortrud Wörner-Heil: Adelige Frauen als Pionierinnen der Berufsbildung: die ländliche Hauswirtschaft und der Reifensteiner Verband kassel university press GmbH, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1913 doctorate of Johannes Kramer compared different concepts of home economic education worldwide and praised the system e.g. in Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kramer: Das ländlich-hauswirtschaftliche Bildungswesen in Deutschland, University of Erlangen doctorate, Fulda 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the field is most commonly known as "family studies" or "family science" (가정과학, gajeong-gwahak). The field began in schools taught by Western missionaries in the late 19th century.  The first college-level department of family science was established at [[Ewha Womans University]] in [[Seoul]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1EizWo6iIn4C&amp;pg=PA5|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|title=가정과학대학 70년사 (Gajeonggwahakdaehak 70-nyeonsa / 70 Years of the College of Family Science)|year=1999|isbn=9788973003839|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2012 there were only 3.5 million students enrolled in FCS secondary programs, a decrease of 38 percent over a decade.

===Home science in India===
Many Education boards in [[India]] such as [[National Institute of Open Schooling|NIOS]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nios.ac.in/currisylhs-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]], [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]],&lt;ref&gt;http://cbse.nic.in/examin~1/scheme06ex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[CISCE]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisce.org/data/.../27.%20Home%20Science.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and various state boards offer home science as a subject in their courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[UK]], Home Economics was once a [[GCSE]] qualification offered to secondary school pupils, but has since been replaced with a course entitled Food and Nutrition which focuses more on the nutritional side of food to economics.

In [[Scotland]], Home Economics was replaced by Hospitality: Practical Cooking at National 3,4 and 5 level and Health and Food Technology at National 3, 4, 5, Higher and Advanced Higher. The awarding body is the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|SQA]].

Situated in the human sciences, home economics draws from a range of disciplines to achieve optimal and sustainable living for individuals, families, and [[communities]]. Historically, home economics has been in the context of the [[home]] and [[household]], but this has extended in the 21st century to include the wider living environments as we better understand that the capacities, choices, and priorities of individuals and families impact at all levels, ranging from the household to the local and the global community. Home economists are concerned with promoting and protecting the well-being of individuals, families, and communities; they facilitate the development of attributes for lifelong learning for paid, unpaid, and [[Volunteering|voluntary]] work. Home economics professionals are advocates for individuals, families, and communities.

The content of home economics comes from the synthesis of multiple disciplines. This [[interdisciplinary]] knowledge is essential because the phenomena and challenges of everyday life are not typically one-dimensional. The content of home economics courses vary, but may include: [[food]], [[nutrition]], and [[health]]; personal finance; family resource management and planning; [[textile]]s and [[clothing]]; [[wikt:shelter|shelter]] and housing; [[consumerism]] and [[consumer science]]; household management; design and technology; food science and [[hospitality]]; [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and family studies; communication and extension [[education]] and [[community services]], among others. The capacity to draw from such disciplinary diversity is a strength of the profession, allowing for the development of specific interpretations of the field, as relevant to the context.

===Cleaning===
Home cleaning tasks can be separated into four categories: litter removal, storage of belongings, dusting, and washing of surfaces. Washing of surfaces is the most dangerous and complicated part because of the cleaning solutions. For example, hard water deposits are cleaned with acid solutions and grease is cleaned with alkaline solutions; they can both harm the skin and are reactive toward each other, potentially producing unwanted by-products. Mixing together chlorine bleach and strong acids (e.g. limescale remover containing HCl) forms chlorine gas, which is toxic. Solvents such as [[paint thinner]] and [[rubbing alcohol]] are toxic and flammable. Some disinfectants are toxic. Even dish water can require rubber gloves.

==Professional associations==
The [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences|AAFCS (American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences)]] represents teachers, educators, cooperatives, business, designers and nutritionists.The American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) is the only national forum where K-12 teachers, university educators, and corporate executives collaborate to improve the quality of individual and family life.

The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] (ACTE) is the largest American national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepared youth and adults for successful careers.  ACTE's core purpose is to provide leadership in developing an educated, prepared, and competitive workforce.  The ACTE division of Family and Consumer Sciences Education includes three sections (1) NATFACS - National Association Teachers of Family and Consumer Sciences (2) NATEFACS - National Association Teacher Educators of Family andy Consumer Sciences, andy (3) NASAFACS - National Association State Administrators of Family and Consumer Sciences.

The [[National Council on Family Relations]], (NCFR) founded in 1938, is the oldest multidisciplinary, nonpartisan professional organization focused solely on family research, practice and education. They claim to be the premier professional association for the multidisciplinary understanding of families. The members’ interests—as diverse as their careers and backgrounds—are focused on topics and efforts that yield a common benefit: …understanding and strengthening families. NCFR members are professionals dedicated to understanding and strengthening families. The 3,400-plus members come from more than 35 countries and all 50 U.S. states, and include: researchers, demographers, marriage and family therapists, parent/family educators, university faculty, students, social workers, public health workers, extension specialists and faculty, ECFE teachers, clergy, counselors, K-12 teachers, and more.

'''iMelody''' is a non-polyphonic [[ringtone]] exchange object format,&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.sonyericsson.com/getDocument.do?docId=74305 Sony Ericsson W800 White Paper (R2A)]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF file, page 19) (you'll need to enter in a text from a captcha image in order to download the file)&lt;/ref&gt; used for [[mobile phone]]s [Extension: '''.imy'''], defined by [[Ericsson]] and [[Sony Ericsson]] together with other manufacturers and is based on Ericsson's proprietary eMelody format. The iMelody format was made because the eMelody had some musical limitations.

== Transferring melody to mobile phones ==
In order to transfer these ringtones to a mobile phone, one could simply send an [[Short message service|SMS message]] with the iMelody/eMelody text as the text of the message, or one could make a plain text file containing the iMelody/eMelody text and using the extension of either .imy for iMelody or .emy for eMelody and transfer the file to the mobile phone by [[bluetooth]], [[IrDA]] (infrared), or by a data cable. The file could also be attached to an [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] message or an e-mail message.

== iMelody ==
'''MIME''': "text/x-iMelody" or "audio/iMelody"

'''Extension''': ".imy"

Here is an example of an advanced ringtone in the iMelody format, this is a silent ringtone that only makes the phone's vibrating motor vibrate constantly:
 BEGIN:IMELODY
 VERSION:1.2
 FORMAT:CLASS1.0
 BEAT:25
 MELODY:vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeon (r2vibeonvibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2vibeonr2ledonr2vibeonr2vibeon
 END:IMELODY

Another example of an advance ringtone, which makes the vibrating motor vibrate constantly, the backlight of the phone's display blink and plays a simple tone:
 BEGIN:IMELODY
 VERSION:1.2
 FORMAT:CLASS1.0
 BEAT:900
 STYLE:S1
 MELODY:(vibeonbackoff*6c5ledon*6d5ledoff*6e5ledon*6f5ledoff*6g5ledon*6a5ledoff*6b5ledon*6a5ledoff*6g5*6f5*6e5*6d5*6c5backon*6d5*6e5*6f5*6g5*6a5*6b5*6a5*6g5*6f5*6e5*6d5@0)
 END:IMELODY

== eMelody ==
'''MIME''': "text/x-eMelody" or "audio/e-melody""

'''Extension''': ".emy"

Here is an example of a ringtone in eMelody format:
 BEGIN:EMELODY
 VERSION:1.0
 NAME:Test melody 1
 COMPOSER:John Smith
 MELODY:+f+a+fa(b)bdcC+GA+d+#c+dfg+daea+d+#c+e+f+e+fa(b)bdC+EA+d+#c+dfgba+d+#C

ico-D members include professional design organisations, design promotion bodies, design media, design education institutions and individuals with a vested interest in professional design. Design media are affiliated through the International Design Media Network (IDMN). Individuals are affiliated through the ico-D's Friends Network which was established in 1991.&lt;ref name="IcogradaAbout" /&gt;

==Founding history==
[[Peter Kneebone]] proposed the idea to establish an international organisation for graphic design and was involved in Icograda's founding.&lt;ref name="Muesuem of London"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/festival/kneebone.htm | title=The Festival of Britain | publisher=Museum of London | date=2001-09-10 | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Industrial Artists (which changed its name in 1963 to the Society of Industrial Artists &amp; Designers, and is now the Chartered Society of Designers, or CSD) set up a working group under the chairmanship of [[Willy de Majo]], to promote the creation of an organisation to represent internationally the many professional graphic design associations throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Brighton"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/archives/willy-de-majo-archive | title=Willy de Mayo Archive | publisher=University of Brighton Faculty of Arts | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; No such organisation existed. The profession was rapidly growing in importance, and also attempting to clarify its identity and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990. 'Icograda: the first 25 years'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary'' edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt; It was involved in increasingly complex social and technological situations. National associations were developing, but international dialogue and action were intermittent and uncoordinated. It was important to create links between the professional associations in all countries, and between the profession and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;W.M. de Mayo, 1990. 'A vision realized'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary''&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural conference of Icograda took place at Watney House, London, from 26–28 April 1963, attended by delegates from 28 associations in 17 European countries.&lt;ref name="Anniversary"&gt;Peter Kneebone, 1990. 'Icograda: reflections on a history'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary'' edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was chaired by [[Henri Kay Henrion|H.K. Henrion]] and supported by Kneebone as secretary. On 27 April, the meeting agreed to formally establish Icograda. Proposals that were ratified include the development and drafts of a ''Code of Ethics and Professional Practice'', a ''Code of Contract and Conditions of Engagement for Graphic Designers'', ''Rules and Regulations for International Graphic Design Competitions'', an ''International Directory of Organizations Concerned with Graphic Design'' and the publication of a News Bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990. 'Icograda: the first 25 years'. In ''Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary'' edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Executive Board was elected at the meeting in London, composed of Willy de Majo (Great Britain, President), [[Wim Crouwel|Wim H. Crouwel]] (The Netherlands, Secretary General), Martin Gavier (Sweden, Treasurer), Peter Hatch (Great Britain, Vice President), Hans Neuburg (Switzerland, Vice President), Jukka Pellinen (Finland, Vice President), D. Stojannovic-Sip (Yugoslavia, Vice President), John Tandy (Great Britain, Member), Pieter Brattinga (The Netherlands, Member) and Paul Schwarz (The Netherlands, Honorary Treasurer). This Executive Board served from 1963 to 1966.&lt;ref name="BoardHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same meeting, the first Icograda Congress and General Assembly in 1964 in Zurich was called in order to establish the aims and structures upon which the future of the organisation rested.&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakane, 1990. 'Icograda: the first 25 years'. In Graphic Design, World Views: ICOGRADA'S 25th Anniversary edited by Jorge Frascara. Kodansha: Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2013, Icograda celebrated its 50th anniversary and its 25th General Assembly.&lt;ref name="50thAnniversary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/events/calendar1081.htm |title=25 Icograda General Assembly: Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=Icograda |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events and activities==

===1960s===
The first Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place in 1964 in Zurich.&lt;ref name="CongressHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles1925.htm | title=Congress History | publisher=Icograda | accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was attended by about 200 designers from 17 countries and 23 associations. The theme of the Congress was Commercial Artist or Graphic Designer".&lt;ref name="Anniversary" /&gt; The Congress opened with the reading of a message by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] who wrote: “Every day designers of all kinds are becoming responsible for a greater proportion of man's environment. Almost everything that we see and use that was not made by the Almighty has come from some designer's drawing board. This is a very heavy responsibility and every effort by designers to improve standards, to encourage proper training and to develop a sense of social awareness is to be welcomed.”&lt;ref&gt;The original letter is housed at the Icograda Archive, University of Brighton&lt;/ref&gt; At the General Assembly, delegates Icograda's aims and objectives, and it was further agreed to establish an audio-visual archive and library, to publish a news bulletin and to award student scholarships. Jenny Toynbee from Edinburgh School of Art won the first student scholarship. Ernest Hoch's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/people/obit.html |title=The optimism of modernity : documents |publisher=Optimism-modernity.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/people/hoch-catalogue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/metric-typo/hoch77.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; proposals for a unified system of typographic measurement was accepted for further development.

In 1965 Icograda establishes the Signs and Symbols Commission. It first collaborates closely with the International Chamber of Commerce and then with the [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]. In the same year Icograda publishes ''Graphic journalism: Catalogue of Magazines and Annuals of Graphic Design and Allied Subjects'' featuring around 300 journals from 30 countries.&lt;ref name="Anniversary" /&gt;

In April 1966 the first Icograda International Student Project was judged in Belgrade. The theme was 'Public information signs' and the jury included Abram Games, Josef Müller-Brockmann, Paul Rand, Masaru Katzumie and Ivan Picelj.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hitchins, 2013, ''An Icograda love story'', article to be published in November 2013 as part of the Icograda Legacy Initiative collection&lt;/ref&gt; The second Icogarada Congress, 'Graphic Design and Visual Communication Technology', and General Assembly were then held from 11–16 July 1966 in Bled, then in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles1925.htm |title=Congress History |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buckminster Fuller|R Buckminster Fuller]] was one of the main speakers at the Congress. At the General Assembly, four key policy documents were ratified: ''Rules and Regulations for International Graphic Design Competitions'', the ''Honorarium for Judges of International Competitions'' document and the revised ''Code of Ethics and Professional Practice'', and the ''Code of Contract and Conditions of Engagement for Graphic Designers''. [[:no:Knut Yran|Knut Yran]], head of design at Phillips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.design.philips.com/about/design/aboutus/designheritage/index.page |title=Philips - Design - Our design heritage |publisher=Design.philips.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Eindhoven, was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] from the Netherlands, Secretary-General.&lt;ref name="BoardHistory" /&gt; The first student seminar was also held in Bled from 11–13 July 1966 and the theme was 'Breaking the Language Barrier with Signs and Symbols'. In addition, the production of ''Equality of Man'', a film project for students and young people in support of the United Nations Human Rights Year, was the first of several Icograda collaborations with [http://asifa.net/ International Animated Film Association (ASIFA)]

The third Icograda Congress 'Design Destinations in a Changing World' was held in 1968 in Eindhoven.&lt;ref name="CongressHistory" /&gt; An exhibition of Belgian graphics was organised by Michel Olyff at the same time and the entire congress decamped to Brussels for a day. "Sachez que tout en ce monde n’est que signes et signes de signes" (beware that all in the world is only signs and signs of signs), were the words of Marcel Schwab quoted by Alderman van der Harten in opening the congress. Der Harten went on to make observations about communication, information systems, symbols, codes and signals, "but away from the congress there were different signs that could not be ignored. A government minister failed to appear to make an address on the third morning of the congress; he was in an emergency cabinet meeting."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stephen Hitchins, Icograda board member 1987-1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Icograda has always been totally non-political but the 1968 Congress coincided with the end of the [[Prague Spring]]. As the tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia the congress paused in a moment of silent respect. As the crisis deepened over the next few days Netherlanders offered hospitality to those wishing to stay on in the country for a few days, and many of the delegates marched, protested and petitioned their embassies as military repression threatened the freedoms of friends and colleagues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Whilst the SIAD had facilitated the inaugural meeting in London five years before, it must be remembered that most of the founders of Icograda were central Europeans, an assortment of Yugoslav, Austrian, German, Polish and Hungarian political émigrés who had made their home in the UK to escape persecution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The response of the Congress was therefore only to be expected. Some presentations from Teunissen van Manen, Richard Gregory, Benno Wissing, Jerome Gould, and [[Massimo Vignelli]], were thus overshadowed by political events.

At the 3rd Icograda General Assembly [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]] was elected President and [[Pieter Brattinga]] re-elected Secretary-General.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |title=Board History |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202034259/http://www.icograda.org/about/board/articles1910.htm |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the book ''ICOGRADA The First Five Years''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnTZGwAACAAJ | title = ICOGRADA, the First Five Years | author1 = Society | first1 = Wynkyn de Worde | date = 1968*}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Wynkyn de Worde, was published and Icograda was commissioned by UNESCO to produce their first series of slides on graphic design.

===1970s===
In 1971 the fourth General Assembly was held in Vienna, John Halas was elected President, and Marijke Singer Secretary-General. The newly established President's Trophy was awarded to Peter Kneebone. In 1970, the congress and exhibition 'The Visual Communicator and the Learning Industry' took place in Vienna. Despite a raft of excellent speakers, there was considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which the event had been organised, in particular the commercial nature of the exhibition, and the congress effectively turned on itself for half a day with an open discussion about how matters should be arranged in the future. Memorably Herb Rohn from Carbondale, Illinois, standing on a table, demanded metaphorically that "the windows of the Hofburg be thrown open to let some fresh air into this place where there has been none this week."

The first issue of 'icographic', Icograda's biannual magazine, was published in 1971. Founded by John Halas, it was edited by Patrick Burke. The complete ten-year cycle was tapped out on an IBM Selectric typewriter, with many idiosyncratic but significant design issues being presented to a widening design audience.

In 1972 Icograda achieved consultative status with UNESCO in Paris. The fifth General Assembly and the Symposium 'Towards a Working Congress on Education' were held in London. Kurt Weidemann was elected President, Marijke Singer Secretary-General, and the President's Trophy was awarded to Patrick Wallis Burke.

In 1973 the first Icograda Student Seminar was held in London, chaired by FHK Henrion. The London seminars were a regular feature of the design calendar until 1999. After Henrion died in 1990, the event was chaired by Alan Fletcher, and for its final three years by Mervyn Kurlansky.

In 1974 the sixth Icograda General Assembly took place in Krefeld, Germany. Walter Jungkind was elected Icograda president, the first non-European resident to hold the office. He was also the first whose main career was in design education. Marijke Singer was again elected Secretary-General and Ernest Hoch won the President's Trophy. The assembly was followed by the 'Edugra' Congress held in Neuss, across the Rhine from Düsseldorf. The theme was 'Graphic Design Education'.

In 1975 the Icograda Edugraphic '75 International Conference was held in Edmonton with the theme 'Education for Graphic Design/Graphic Design for Education'. In 1976 a symposium 'Design for Need', jointly sponsored by Icograda and ICSID was held at the Royal College of Art in London. Following a study undertaken for UNESCO, an Icograda travelling exhibition 'The Image of Women in Advertising' opened in Eindhoven.

The 1977 Zurich Congress − 'Graphic Design for Social Communication' − was complimented by an entire issue of ''Graphis'' magazine devoted to the Congress exhibition held at the Kunstgewerbe Museum Zurich. ICSID president Kenji Ekuan was one of the keynote speakers. The congress was followed by a seminar in Lausanne − 'A Town and its Image' − and the General Assembly at which Flemming Ljorring was elected President and Peter Kneebone Secretary-General. The President's Trophy was awarded to Kenneth and Shelagh Adshead for their work on the audio-visual archive.

In 1978 Icograda met at Evanston outside Chicago for the 'Design that Works' congress devoted to design evaluation; how designers could prove the commercial and social value of what they did. Speakers included Josef Müller-Brockmann, Milton Glaser and Massimo Vignelli. The eighth general assembly took place the following year in Paris at the Centre Pompidou. Peter Kneebone was elected President, Keith Murgatroyd Secretary-General and Bob Vogele was awarded the President's Trophy for his work organising the event in Chicago. The assembly was preceded by a seminar − 'Is Graphic Design a Reflection of Society or a Factor in its Evolution?'

===1980s===
In 1980, Mauro Kunst organised the first Icograda Latin American conference in Guadalajara, Mexico. In the same year, ''World design sources directory 1980 = Répertoire des sources d'information en design 1980'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getcited.org/pub/101980835 |title=(1980) World design sources directory 1980: Répertoire des sources d'information en design 1980 |publisher=Getcited.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Centre de Creation Industrielle, was published on behalf of Icograda and ICSID.

The first Icograda, ICSID and IFI Joint Congress took place in Helsinki from 1–8 August 1981, an event that had been under discussion since 1977. The theme was 'Design Integration'. Three separate general assemblies followed the congress. At the 9th Icograda General Assembly, Stig Hogdal was elected President, Marijke Singer was once again elected Secretary-General and the President's Trophy was awarded to Geoffrey Bensusan for his work on the ''Icograda News Bulletin''. The first Icograda-Philips design award was awarded to Benoit de Pierrepont and S S Satie focusing on the theme ''The design of instructions and warnings, and the related problems of society in any area of human activity''. Also in 1981, Icograda organised a poster competition on behalf of UNESCO to celebrate the International Year of Disabled Persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=32403&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO.ORG &amp;#124; International Year of Disabled Persons |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000483/048396eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the first of six issues of ''icographic/volume 2'' was published on behalf of Icograda by Mobilia Press, with Jorge Frascara as associate editor. Each issue was devoted to a single theme and abstracts were included in four languages. Also in 1982, Haig David-West organised the first African regional meeting in Port Harcourt, Nigeria and in 1983, Haig David-West (the first ever elected Icograda Executive board member from Africa)&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; edited the publication ''Dialogue on graphic design problems in Africa'', based on this meeting.

In 1983 the 10th General Assembly and Icograda Congress '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Design Interaction''' were held in Dublin.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; The keynote address was given by [[Erskine Barton Childers|Erskine Childers]] of the United Nations. In one of the most remarkable addresses ever made to an Icograda congress, Childers mixed thousands of years of history with personal experience as he set out examples where "I can tell you that again and again down the years I have confronted communication needs for which graphic visuals were indispensable – the only answer".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;The global Picture, paper presented to the Icograda 1983 Dublin Congress by Erskine Childers, Director of Information, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; Setting out a powerful argument for the potential of creating "rapid economic and social development through a major effort in endogenously researched and programmed use of the visual media leading to – but in that order – literacy"&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; he called on the delegates to "offer and apply your centuries-evolved skills and sensitivities to help humanity see – literally see – both its marvelous capacity for progress and its primeval capacity for error, inhumanity, social neglect, even apocalyptic destruction".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Admitting that he was presenting the delegates with challenges that were 'especially heavy' Childers said "I never knew a good graphic designer who did not explode with creativity and blossom when faced with an ostensibly impossible task... History will once again make its awesome judgement of you – but from now on with greater respect because you cannot any longer be underestimated. You help all of us perceive and place ourselves in life. Now you must help all of us understand so that we can more wisely and assuredly manage all our futures".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Raymond Kyne was elected President&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and Robert Blaich won the President's Award for his promotion of Icograda-Philips design award.&lt;ref name="icograda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/awards/articles1920.htm |title=President's Award |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of member organisations had by grown to 50. A multidisciplinary design competition on the theme of ''Shu/Collectivity'', held under the auspices of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and sponsored by the Japan Design Foundation, was won by Charles Owen from the Illinois Institute of Technology.

In 1985, the 11th Icograda Congress ''The place and influence of graphic design in everyday life'' was organised by Philippe Gentil&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; in Nice, the first time that there were major presentations from India ('design without designers' by people whose needs were too urgent to await intervention by professionals) and Australia (from boomerang to bicentenary); from the design of books in China to street signs in Buenos Aires, and provocatively 'the backside of design' – what happens after the consultant has moved on to new, more rewarding problems. According to Stephen Hitchins (Icograda board member from 1987−1991),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ivan Chermayeff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgstudionyc.com/about-us/ivan-chermayeff |title=Ivan Chermayeff &amp;#124; Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv |publisher=Cgstudionyc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a long presentation totally devoid of visuals stating that he "wanted graphics to grow up" – comparing much of it "to WC Fields' definition of a virgin: a child about four years old, extremely ugly". So much of the pleasure Chermayeff claimed that he gained from graphic design was from process rather than product, "a sensation of feeling something is still wet long after it's dry". Improvisation, accidents, speed, freshness, and individuality were what mattered to him. Even without pictures, he won many delegates over. At the 11th Icograda General Assembly (also in Nice) [http://www.frascara-noel.net/ Jorge Frascara] was elected president. The President's Trophy went to Jan Railich, the chairman of the Brno Biennale.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; Also in 1985, the ''World Directory of Design Schools and Programmes'' was published jointly by Icograda, ICSID and IFI, and edited by Maarten Regouin, secretary of the Icograda Education Working Group, which also coincided with Icograda's establishment of the Design History and Design Management working groups chaired by Michael Twyman and Abe Rosenfeld respectively.

In 1986 Icograda Excellence Awards were made for the first time at the Brno and Warsaw Biennales. The recipients were Christof Gassner and Henryk Tomaszewski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/awards/articles1922.htm |title=Excellence Award |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Amrik Kalsi, [http://www.frascara-noel.net/ Jorge Frascara] and Peter Kneebone organised the ''Graphic Design for Development Seminar'' on behalf of Icograda and UNESCO. It was hosted in Nairobi, Kenya, from 6–10 July and attracted 91 participants from 14 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000833/083352eb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/feature/current/articles1127.htm?query_page=1 |title=GRAPHIC DESIGN FOR DEVELOPMENT - PART 1 OF 2 |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Joint Congress of Icograda, ICSID, IFI ''Design 87'' − with as its theme 'Design Response' − was held in Amsterdam from 16–20 August 1987.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; At the 12th Icograda General Assembly which took place from 21–22 August (also in Amsterdam), Niko Spelbrink was elected president and Mary V. Mullin became Secretary-General (and Director of the Icograda Secretariat – a position she held until 1999).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Susumu Sakane was awarded the President's Trophy.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; Uwe Loesch won the first Icograda Excellence Award to be presented at the Lahti Biennale. Icograda published the ''History of Design Bibliography'' edited by [[Victor Margolin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigger.uic.edu/~victor/index.html |title=victor's home page |publisher=Tigger.uic.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Projects in Graphic Design Education''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frascara-noel.net/publications3.html |title=Publications |publisher=FrascaraNoel |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Jorge Frascara.

In 1988, Nils Tvengsberg organised a special event in Oslo, from 13–15 May, to mark the 25th anniversary of Icograda.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; All 11 presidents from 1963-onwards attended together with many former board members, partners, friends and supporters. It coincided with Norway's national day and according to Stephen Hitchins, "it was one of the more remarkable Icograda events in a history of remarkable events".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/members/member_list276 |title=Icograda |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Nils Tvengsberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/members/member_list372.htm |title=Icograda |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first person to serve on the boards of both Icograda and ICSID simultaneously. His goal was to look at the possibility of joining their common interests. It would be over 20 years before this partnership, the International Design Alliance (IDA), would be headquartered in Montreal, contemplating the first IDA joint congress in 2011.

In 1989 the 13th Congress took place at Tel Aviv University, chaired by Abe Rosenfeld.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; The theme was 'Graphic Design Through High Technology?' At the General Assembly Simon de Hartog won the President's Award,&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; and Helmut Langer became President.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===1990s===
In 1990, ''Graphic Design, World Views. A celebration of ICOGRADA’s 25th Anniversary'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jdExAQAAIAAJ | title = Graphic design, world views: A celebration of Icograda's 25th anniversary | isbn = 9780870119002 | author1 = Frascara | first1 = Jorge | last2 = Associations | first2 = International Council of Graphic Design | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Jorge Frascara, designed by Niko Spelbrink, and with a cover designed by [[Grapus]], was published jointly by Icograda and Kodansha, a major book on graphic design that celebrated Icograda's 25th anniversary.

The Icograda Foundation was established in 1991 for the advancement of worldwide understanding and education through the effective use of graphic design. A limited company, the Foundation was a registered charity funded by corporate sponsorships, individual donations, legacies, and various fundraising activities. Mary Mullin received the President's Award for her work in establishing the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/about/articles149.htm |title=Foundation |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Comdevelopment Ltd |url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/the-icograda-foundation |title=The Icograda Foundation of HP4 3NE in Berkhamsted Hertfordshire |publisher=Companiesintheuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencharities.org/charities/1003880 |title=Icograda Foundation |publisher=OpenCharities |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the 14th Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place in Montréal, from 25–29 August, attended by around 2,000 delegates.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; At the Icograda General Assembly (30–31 August 1991), [[Giancarlo Iliprandi]] was elected president.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Highlights of the Assembly included: the hosting of the 3rd Marijke Singer Memorial Lecture presented by Margaret Catley Carlson, entitled ''Images for the Next Century''; the Icograda President's Award was bestowed on Mary V. Mullin for the inauguration of the Icograda Foundation and the Friends of Icograda;&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt; establishment of the Icograda World Graphic Design Day;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/programmes/worlddesignday.htm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; World Communication Design Day |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishment of Icograda Steering Committee for the International Design Archive and Research Centre Project; and the establishment of Icograda Friends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/members/categories/articles125.htm |title=Friends |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with seed donations contributed by 68 Japanese founders, chaired by Hiroshi Kojitani. In the same year, the first ''Icograda/IFI/ICSID Joint Newsletter'' was published.

In 1993 the 3rd Joint Congress of Icograda, ICSID and IFI was held in Glasgow, Ireland from 5–9 September.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; Stephen Hitchins chaired the organising committee and there were 101 speakers and over 1,000 delegates. [[Rick Poynor]] writing in ''[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/ Creative Review]'' in 2007, said it had been “the most sophisticated and future-orientated discussion of design in the UK for 15 years”. Jeremy Myerson called it "a watershed event, one of those rare occasions when the design community comes together and presses the pause button, and stops to reflect on what designers do, how things have changed, and where design practice could go in the future... It explored the limits of design. Yet it also opened up new horizons". To quote [[Christopher Frayling]] who rounded off the event, "Two moments from Design Renaissance will stick in my mind for a long time. One is [[Victor Papanek]] quoting in discussion [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who said, 'there is hope in honest error, none in icy perfection'. The other is [[Yuri Soloviev]]'s story about persuading [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] not to go ahead with a town planning scheme in Georgia, while swimming out into the Black Sea, on holiday. I guess the moral of the tale is: if you are up to your neck in it − keep talking, keep persuading, grab the moment when it comes, have a healthy disregard for bureaucracy, and be a strong swimmer. Oh, and as you are swimming, try not to lose your bearings and always remember that the word 'utopia' means 'of no place at all'."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As with all Icograda events, it was an invigorating experience, and it swam out into some uncharted waters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At the 15th General Assembly held in Glasgow immediately after the Congress, Philippe Gentil was elected President.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Hiroshi Kojitani received the President's Award for his work in establishing Friends of Icograda.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt;

From 23–27 July 1995, the 16th Icograda Congress took place in Lisbon, Portugal, followed by the General Assembly in Porto. The theme of the Congress was ''Shifting Frontiers''. At the 16th Icograda General Assembly, Jose Korn Bruzzone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/media/releases/articles911.htm |title=Jose Korn Bruzzone to Deliver Education Keynote at Icograda World Design Congress 2007 |publisher=Icograda |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Chile became President and the Icograda President's Award was presented to Marion Wesel-Henrion and J. Brian Davies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/feature/current/articles1655.htm |title=A tribute to J.

In 1996, Icograda released a policy document ''Digital Immortality: Encapsulating the Work of the World's Top 20th Century Designers for an Icograda Archive in digital form'' aimed to establish a comprehensive archive for Icograda and the work of leading graphic design masters. In the same year, Icograda participated in a meeting of the Icograda/ICSID/IFI working group founded to develop closer working relations between the three organisations which took place from 7–8 December in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The 17th Icograda Congress and General Assembly took place from 21–23 October in Punte del Este, Uruguay.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; This was the first Icograda Congress to be hosted in the Southern Hemisphere and attracted ±1 000 delegates. The Congress theme was 'INTERCAMBIOS/EXCHANGES'. At this General Assembly in Punte del Este, the Icograda Assembly joined the ICSID and IFI General Assemblies to unanimously pass a resolution which called for closer contact between the "three sisters," paving the path towards the formation of the International Design Alliance (IDA), which was eventually established in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/IDA.htm |title=International Design Alliance |publisher=Icograda |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528090348/http://www.icograda.org/about/IDA.htm |archivedate=2013-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy-A Schockaert from Belgium became President and Mary V. Mullin was again elected Secretary General.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In early 1999, Mary V. Mullin resigned as the Icograda Secretary General and Director of the Icograda Secretariat after serving 12 years in the position. The Secretariat relocated from London to Brussels under the new leadership of Thierry van Kerm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thierry-van-kerm/6/609/13a |title=Thierry Van Kerm |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was appointed as Icograda Director in June of the same year.

''Sydney Design 99: Viewpoints in Time'', the 4th joint Icograda/ICSID/IFI Congress took place from 26–29 September in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref name="icograda.org"/&gt; Around 1 400 delegates from 45 countries attended the event. The 18th Icograda General Assembly followed immediately after the Congress, 30 September-1 October in Sydney. At the Assembly, David Grossman from Israel become President and Martha Bateman from South Africa was elected as Secretary General (Bateman was only the second person from Africa to serve on the Executive Board and the first to serve in a senior position). At this GA the Council officially separated the positions of Secretary General and Director of the Secretariat (paid position) functions.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the 19th Icograda General Assembly&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the GA ratified a Joint motion of Icograda, ICSID and IFI to establish Design for the World. The Icograda President's Award was presented to Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO for the organisation's long track-record in supporting Icograda's activities.&lt;ref name="icograda" /&gt;

===2000s===
At the 17th Icograda General Assembly a motion was ratified to hold a special millennium congress in October 2000 in Seoul, South Korea. The theme was ''Oullim'', meaning 'great harmony'. The event was attended by around 1,600 delegates and was also the first Icograda event to be webcast live on the Internet. The Congress also included the launch of the ''Icograda Education Manifesto 2000'', which was published in 17 languages.

In 2001, Icograda held regional meetings in Zagreb, Croatia in April, and in La Habana, Cuba in June. The meeting in Cuba coincided with the establishment of a new series of seminars entitled ''Design Perspectives'' which attracted 335 delegates from 23 countries. In September 2001, the ''Continental Shift 2001: World Design Convergence'' Congress took place in Johannesburg, South Africa. This was the first time that Icograda hosted a congress in Africa and also the first joint Icograda/IFI Congress. The Congress opened on 11 September, only hours after the 9/11 terror attacks in the USA. At the 19th Icograda General Assembly (15–16 September, Johannesburg), [[Robert L. Peters]] (Canada) became President and Tiffany Turkington (South Africa) was elected Secretary General. One of the most important agenda items was the adoption of an Icograda/ICSID Joint Resolution to establish a joint committee to study institutionalised collaboration. In November of the same year, the first Icograda Design Week was held in Melbourne, Australia. The Design Week included a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and Regional Meeting. The year also saw the publication of ''Masters of the 20th century design: Icograda Hall of Fame (1974-1999)'' (book and CD-ROM), edited and designed by Mervyn Kurlansky, published by [[Graphis Inc.]] The book provided an in-depth view of the Icograda Student Seminars which had been held annually in London from 1973 to 1999.

In March 2002, the Icograda Design Week took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and consisted of the ''Environs'002: Design Without Borders'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar and a North American Regional Meeting. Smaller versions of the ''Design Perspectives'' seminar were also hosted in Victoria, Canada, as well as in Seattle, USA. The Icograda Design Week in Brno took place from 17–21 June in the Czech Republic. The event included ''Over the fence: Design in Central and Eastern Europe'' ''Design Perspectives'' seminar, a Regional Meeting attended by delegates from eight countries, the ''Identity/Integrity Icograda Conference'', ''East Meets West, Icograda Student Workshop'', a symposium and inauguration of the Icograda Education Network (IEN) and a workshop to conceptualise the formation of the International Design Media Network (IDMN). The Design Week was further preceded by a joint meeting of the boards of Icograda, ICSID and IFI, resulting in the conceptualisation of the International Design Alliance (IDA) and the Host City Project to establish a joint Icograda/ICSID Secretariat.

In September of the same year, the Icograda board embarked on a three-week visit to China and Taiwan where they presented a ''Design Perspectives'' seminar in Beijing, ''logo2002: Identity and Communication Conference,'' and met with various Chinese design stakeholders aiming to seed the formation of new professional associations. In addition Icograda presented the ''Branding and Innovalue'' seminar and an Asian Regional Meeting in Taipei, followed by a Design Education Symposium and Student Workshop in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Furthermore, the Icograda, ICSID and IFI presidents met on several occasions in Hornbaek, Denmark, to develop a Joint Resolution aimed at establishing the International Design Alliance and launching the Host City Project to establish a joint Secretariat in one location.

The year's activities ended with the hosting of a Regional Meeting, and ''Graphic Design for Social Causes'' workshop co-hosted by Design for the World as well as a ''Design Perspectives'' Seminar in Barcelona, Spain which attracted delegates from 15 countries.

In January 2003 Icograda initiated two surveys focusing on ''Design for Social Causes'' and ''Members’ interest and activity in sustainability issues''. In March, the Board visited India where they met with various Indian design stakeholders in Mumbai to seed the formation of new associations, followed by further meetings and co-hosting the ''Brands-Identities-Graphics 2003'', Icograda ''Design Perspective'' Seminar in Ahmedabad. The Icograda Education Network Conference and Assembly of Icograda Education Network was held June in Brighton, UK. These events coincided with the signing of an agreement to establish the Icograda Archive at the Design History Research Centre Archives at the University of Brighton, which resulted in 145.11 linear metres of official documentation and publications, including c. 1,500 posters and c. 800 books and journals being transferred to University of Brighton.

The ''VISUALOGUE: Icograda World Design Congress'' took place from 8–11 October 2003 in Nagoya, Japan, preceded by the ''Icograda Education Network Symposium''. More than 80 speakers and around 3 700 delegates from 48 countries participated in these events. At the 20th Icograda General Assembly which followed the Congress (the first GA to be held in Asia), representatives from 57 members attended in addition to observers from 16 related organisations, with official membership increasing to 80 associations from 57 countries. The GA agenda included the ratification of the Icograda/ICSID ''Hornbaek Joint Resolution'' to establish the International Design Alliance (IDA), and the election of the 2003−2005 Icograda Board, the first in history to represent six continents. Mervyn Kurlansky became President but no candidate was nominated for the Secretary General position.

In January 2004 the ''Icograda Design Week in Istanbul'' was held in Turkey. The Week's programme included ''6 Alfabe, Icograda Student Workshop'', an IEN Symposium, Regional Meeting, ''Building Bridges: Icograda Design Conference'', ''Design Perspectives Icograda Regional Design Seminar'', as well as the launch of the Icograda Design Media Network (IDMN). This was followed by the Icograda Design Week in São Paulo, Brazil, in April of the same year. The Week's programme included ''The Language of the City Student Workshop'', a Latin American Regional Meeting, ''Design in Latin America Regional Design Seminar'', and the ''Fronteiras! Icograda Design Conference''. In August, Icograda and ICSID hosted a Joint Board Meeting and evaluation of the final six bids for the Joint Secretariat in Essen, Germany. Montreal's bid was selected as most ambitious and beneficial, followed by a site visit by representatives of Icograda and ICSID in September to initiate the final negotiations regarding relocation of the two organisations’ Secretariates to Montreal.

In January 2005, Icograda and ICSID signed a 10-year contract with Montreal International (MI) to relocate to a shared office in Montreal, sponsored by MI. After six years in Brussels, the Secretariat relocated to Montreal. In February, Thierry Van Kerm resigned and Brenda Sanderson was appointed as Icograda Director, officially moving into the new shared Secretariat in May. During the same time, ICSID and Icograda collaborate on the first international ''Women in Design'' exploratory study as well as on the ''Interdesign on Sustainable Rural Transport – Technology for Developing Countries'', which was hosted in April in Rustenburg, South Africa. The book, ''Worldwide Identity: Inspired Design from Forty Countries'', written and produced by [[Robert L. Peters]], published by Rockport, was also published and INDIGO (International Indigenous Design Network) was conceptualised.

''Era '05'' was another major collaborative effort by Icograda, ICSID and IFI to stage a fifth Joint Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1023.htm |title=2005 - COPENHAGEN (DENMARK) |publisher=Icograda |date=2005-09-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme for the main Congress was 'The Changing Role and Challenges of Design' which attracted participation by designers, business leaders, politicians, legal practitioners and social scientists. A milestone in the cooperative efforts between leading design organisations in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, ''Era 05'' was built on the ideal that as a creative force, design and designers were integral in helping to address the challenges all faced and identifying solutions to cope with a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world. In September, ''Era '05'' began with small-scale pre-congress events hosted in Oslo, Helsinki and Gothenburg. The main Congress took place in Copenhagen and featured 126 speakers from 27 countries and was attended by around 900 delegates. At the 21st Icograda General Assembly that followed, Jacques Lange (South Africa) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was elected Secretary General. The newly elected board was now the most geographically diverse in Icograda's history with members from South Africa, South Korea, Canada, Denmark, Lebanon, USA, Australia and Brazil. Craig Halgreen received the Icograda President's Award for supporting and sustaining Sappi's ''Ideas that Matter'' program.

In 2006, Icograda co-organised three Design Weeks. In January, ''So Tiny, So Many: Icograda Design Week in Hong Kong'' took place in China and consisted of a student workshop, an evening lecture series and a Regional Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1025.htm |title=2006 - HONG KONG (CHINA) |publisher=Icograda |date=2006-01-20 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, ''Defining design on a changing planet: Icograda Design Week in Seattle'', took place in the USA. The Week included a student workshop that focussed on the [[Millennium Development Goals|UN Millennium Development Goals]] (in collaboration with United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Programme on Youth, a North American Regional Meeting, an ''Icograda Design Perspectives'' seminar, ''Defining Design on Changing Planet: Icograda Conference'', as well as the launch of the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130528082407/http://www.icograda.org/programmes/plusdesign.htm +design]'' programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/events/event_archive/articles1016.htm |title=2006 - SEATTLE (UNITED STATES) |publisher=Icograda |date=2006-07-09 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Icograda Design Week in South Africa'' took place in September in Pretoria and Johannesburg.

[[Image:ILL Grenoble soleil.jpg|thumb|right|Institut Laue-Langevin]]
[[File:ILL members map.svg|thumb|right|ILL members]]
The '''Institut Laue–Langevin''' ('''ILL''') is an internationally financed scientific facility, situated on the [[Polygone Scientifique]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]. It is one of the world centres for research using [[neutron]]s. Founded in 1967 and honouring the [[physicist]]s [[Max von Laue]] and [[Paul Langevin]], the ILL provides one of the most intense neutron sources in the world and the most intense continuous neutron flux in the world in the moderator region: 1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a thermal power of 58.3&amp;nbsp;MW. 

The ILL neutron scattering facilities provide an indispensable analytical tool for the analysis of the structure of novel conducting and magnetic materials for future electronic devices, the measurement of stresses in mechanical materials, and investigations into how complex molecular assemblies behave, particularly in a biological environment. The ILL also tackles questions relating to the fundamental properties of matter.

== History ==
[[Image:Institut Laue Langevin inside reactor hall.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the reactor hall]]
The institute was founded by [[France]] and [[Germany]], with the [[United Kingdom]] becoming the third major partner in 1973. These partner states provide, through [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]], the bulk of its funding. Ten other countries have since become partners. Scientists of institutions in the member states may apply to use the ILL facilities, and may invite scientists from other countries to participate. Experimental time is allocated by a scientific council involving ILL users. The use of the facility and travel costs for researchers are paid for by the institute. Commercial use, for which a fee is charged, is not subject to the scientific council review process. Over 750 experiments are completed every year, in fields including [[magnetism]], [[superconductivity]], [[materials engineering]], and the study of [[liquid]]s, [[colloid]]s and biological substances. 

The high-flux [[research reactor]] produces neutrons through fission in a specially designed, compact-core fuel element.  [[Neutron moderators]] cool the neutrons to useful wavelengths, which are then directed at a suite of instruments and used to probe the structure and behaviour of many forms of matter by elastic and inelastic [[neutron scattering]], and to probe the fundamental physical properties of the [[neutron]].  Nothing goes to waste: [[Fission products]] and [[gamma rays]] produced by nuclear reactions in the reactor core are also used by specialised instruments, which forms an important part of the instrument suite.

An ambitious modernisation programme was launched in 2000, through the design of new neutron infrastructure and the introduction of new instruments and instrument upgrades. The first phase has already resulted in 17-fold gains in performance. The second phase has started in 2008, it comprises the building of 5 new instruments, the upgrade of 4 others, and the installation of 3 new neutron guides.

== EPN Science Campus ==
{{Science with neutrons}}
The ILL shares its site, the 'epn science campus',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epn-campus.eu/ epn-campus.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; with other institutions including the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF) and the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) and the [[Unit for Viral Host Cell Interactions]] (UVHCI). The French Institut de Biologie Structurale (IBS) has joined the campus in 2013.

== Members ==
The ILL is governed by its Associates, the founding countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An international partnership for science|url=http://www.ill.eu/about/what-is-the-ill/an-international-partnership/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[France]], [[Germany]] and [[United Kingdom]]
in association with its Scientific Member countries (listed below by chronological order of accession):
*[[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Sweden]], [[Belgium]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Denmark]].

== Applications research ==
In summer 2016, using an imaging technique neutron radiation, the facilities of the Institut Laue–Langevin demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by [[Halomonas titanicae]] near the wreck of [[RMS Titanic]] to survive the osmotic pressure that salt water causes on their membranes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2016/09/extremophile-bacteria-will-eat-away-wreck-titanic-2030 laboratoryequipment.com, September 6, 2016, Extremophile Bacteria’ Will Eat Away Wreck of the Titanic by 2030.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognitions ==
The physicist [[Duncan Haldane]] who worked at the institute from 1977 to 1981 received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2016 with [[Michael Kosterlitz]] and [[David J. Thouless]] for their work on the transitions of topological phases in the material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/science/nobel-prize-physics-topology.html nytimes October 4, 2016, 3 Who Studied Unusual States of Matter Win Nobel Prize in Physics.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ill.eu/fr/presse-et-infos/infos/congratulations-to-the-2016-nobel-prize-laureates/ ill.eu October 4, 2016, Congratulations to the 2016 Physics Nobel Prize laureates !]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Mossbauer]], Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961, succeed to [[Heinz Maier-Leibnitz]] in 1972 as the director of the institute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1979">'''LEEP Online Education''' is a [[distance learning]] program offered by the UIUC iSchool (formerly GSLIS [Graduate School of Library and Information Science]) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

The LEEP program provides students who are not able to relocate to the [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]-[[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] area a means to attend the university's [[American Library Association|ALA]]-accredited [[Master of Library and Information Science]], Master of Information Science or [[Certificate of Advanced Study]] (CAS) program. The program, and the iSchool overall, is ranked #1 by U.S. News &amp; World Report.

==History==

The [[acronym]] LEEP originally stood for Library Education Experimental Program. Founded in 1995, the program is no longer considered experimental.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine A. Thompson, [http://www.nelibraries.org/200606/200606-thompson.htm "LEEPing to an Advanced Library School Degree,"] ''New England Libraries'', Vol. 2, No. 5 (June, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coursework==
LEEP differentiates itself from other distance learning [[library and information science|library and information science (LIS)]] programs through the integration of brief periods of on-campus participation, [[Internet]] instruction through synchronous sessions, and independent learning. Off-campus students attend classes via the school's [[Moodle]] Virtual Learning Environment (VIS) and the Blackboard Collaborate platform. With the 21st LEEP cohort, beginning in the summer/fall of 2016, the on-campus participation was condensed to a weekend program (as opposed to a week+).

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;In [[anthropology]], '''liminality''' (from the Latin word ''līmen'', meaning "a threshold"&lt;ref&gt;"liminal", ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Ed. J. A. Simpson and E. S. C. Weiner. 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford 23, 2007; [[cf.]] ''[[Wiktionary:subliminal|subliminal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of [[rites]], when participants no longer hold their preritual status but have not yet begun the transition to the status they will hold when the rite is complete. During a rite's liminal stage, participants "stand at the threshold"&lt;ref&gt;("Nordic Work with Traumatised Refugees: Do We Really Care", edited by Gwynyth Overland, Eugene Guribye, Birgit)&lt;/ref&gt;  between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way, which completing the rite establishes.

The concept of liminality was first developed in the early twentieth century by folklorist [[Arnold van Gennep]] and later taken up by [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;"Liminality and Communitas", in "The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure" (New Brunswick: Aldine Transaction Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, usage of the term has broadened to describe political and cultural change as well as rites.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørn Thomassen, ''The Uses and Meanings of Liminality'' (International Political Anthropology 2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; During liminal periods of all kinds, social hierarchies may be reversed or temporarily dissolved, continuity of tradition may become uncertain, and future outcomes once taken for granted may be thrown into doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Horvath, Bjørn Thomassen, and Harald Wydra, ''Introduction: Liminality and Cultures of Change'' (International Political Anthropology 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The dissolution of order during liminality creates a fluid, malleable situation that enables new institutions and customs to become established.&lt;ref&gt;Arpad Szakolczai, ''Liminality and Experience: Structuring transitory situations and transformative events'' (International Political Anthropology 2009) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also passed into popular usage, where it is applied much more broadly, undermining its significance to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield, ''The Dictionary of Anthropology'' (1997) p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites of passage==

===Arnold van Gennep===

Van Gennep, who coined the term liminality, published in 1909 his 'Rites de Passage', a work that explores and develops the concept of liminality in the context of rites in small-scale societies. Van Gennep began his book by identifying the various categories of rites. He distinguished between those that result in a change of status for an individual or social group, and those that signify transitions in the passage of time. In doing so, he placed a particular emphasis on [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], and claimed that "such rituals marking, helping, or celebrating individual or collective passages through the cycle of life or of nature exist in every culture, and share a specific three-fold sequential structure".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

This three-fold structure, as established by van Gennep, is made up of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;Arnold van Gennep, ''The Rites of Passage'' (London 1977) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''preliminal rites'' (or ''rites of separation''): This stage involves a metaphorical "death", as the initiate is forced to leave something behind by breaking with previous practices and routines.
* ''liminal rites'' (or ''transition rites''): Two characteristics are essential to these rites. First, the rite "must follow a strictly prescribed sequence, where everybody knows what to do and how".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Second, everything must be done "under the authority of a master of ceremonies".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 148&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive nature of this rite allows for considerable changes to be made to the identity of the initiand. This middle stage (when the transition takes place) "implies an actual passing through the threshold that marks the boundary between two phases, and the term 'liminality' was introduced in order to characterize this passage."&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 141&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''postliminal rites'' (or ''rites of incorporation''): During this stage, the initiand is re-incorporated into society with a new identity, as a "new" being.

Turner confirmed his nomenclature for 'the three phases of passage from one culturally defined state or status to another...''preliminal'', ''liminal'', and ''postliminal'''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor W. Turner, ''The Ritual Process'' (Penguin 1969) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this structural template, Van Gennep also suggested four categories of rites that emerge as universal across cultures and societies. He suggested that there are four types of social rites of passage that are replicable and recognizable among many ethnographic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2015-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last1=Andrews|first1=Hazel|last2=Roberts|first2=Les|isbn=9780080970875}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:

* Passage of people from one status to another, initiation ceremonies in which an outsider is brought into the group. This includes marriage and initiation ceremonies that move one from the status of an outsider to an insider.
* Passage from one place to another, such as moving houses, moving to a new city, etc.
* Passage from one situation to another: beginning university, starting a new job, and graduating high school or university.
* Passage of time such as New Year celebrations and birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2015-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last1=Andrews|first1=Hazel|last2=Roberts|first2=Les|isbn=9780080970875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gennep considered rites of [[initiation]] to be the most typical rite. To gain a better understanding of "tripartite structure" of liminal situations, one can look at a specific rite of initiation: the initiation of youngsters into adulthood, which Turner considered the most typical rite. In such rites of passage, the experience is highly structured. The first phase (the rite of separation) requires the child to go through a separation from his family; this involves his/her "death" as a child, as [[childhood]] is effectively left behind. In the second stage, initiands (between childhood and adulthood) must pass a "test" to prove they are ready for adulthood. If they succeed, the third stage (incorporation) involves a celebration of the "new birth" of the adult and a welcoming of that being back into society.

By constructing this three-part sequence, van Gennep identified a pattern he believed was inherent in all ritual passages. By suggesting that such a sequence is universal (meaning that all societies use rites to demarcate transitions), van Gennep made an important claim (one that not many anthropologists make, as they generally tend to demonstrate [[cultural diversity]] while shying away from universality).

An anthropological rite, especially a [[rite of passage]], involves some change to the participants, especially their [[social status]].;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Turner, "Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites de Passage", in ''The Forest of Symbols'' (Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University Press]], 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; and in 'the first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behaviour signifying the detachment of the individual...from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Ritual'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Their status thus becomes liminal. In such a liminal situation, "the initiands live outside their normal environment and are brought to question their self and the existing social order through a series of rituals that often involve acts of pain: the initiands come to feel nameless, spatio-temporally dislocated and socially unstructured".&lt;ref&gt;Bjørn Thomassen, "Liminality" in ''The Encyclopedia of Social Theory''(London 2006) p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, liminal periods are "destructive" as well as "constructive", meaning that "the formative experiences during liminality will prepare the initiand (and his/her cohort) to occupy a new social role or status, made public during the reintegration rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2006, 322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victor Turner===

Turner, who is considered to have "re-discovered the importance of liminality", first came across van Gennep's work in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he published his book ''The Forest of Symbols'', which included an essay entitled ''Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites of Passage''. Within the works of Turner, liminality began to wander away from its narrow application to ritual passages in small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the various works he completed while conducting his fieldwork amongst the Ndembu in [[Zambia]], he made numerous connections between [[Tribe|tribal]] and non-tribal societies, "sensing that what he argued for the Ndembu had relevance far beyond the specific [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] context".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; He became aware that liminality "...served not only to identify the importance of in-between periods, but also to understand the human reactions to liminal experiences: the way liminality shaped personality, the sudden foregrounding of agency, and the sometimes dramatic tying together of thought and experience".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'The attributes of liminality or of liminal ''personae'' ("threshold people") are necessarily ambiguous'.&lt;ref&gt;Turner ''Ritual'' p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; One's sense of [[identity (social science)|identity]] dissolves to some extent, bringing about disorientation, but also the possibility of new perspectives. Turner posits that, if liminality is regarded as a time and place of withdrawal from normal modes of social action, it potentially can be seen as a period of scrutiny for central values and axioms of the culture where it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Ritual'' p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;—one where normal limits to thought, self-understanding, and behavior are undone. In such situations, "the very structure of society [is] temporarily suspended"&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

'According to Turner, all liminality must eventually dissolve, for it is a state of great intensity that cannot exist very long without some sort of structure to stabilize it...either the individual returns to the surrounding social structure...or else liminal communities develop their own internal social structure, a condition Turner calls "normative communitas"'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Homas, ''Jung in Context'' (London 1979) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Victor Turner has vital significance in turning attention to this concept, introduced by Arnold van Gennep, a main intellectual opponent of [[Durkheim]], who subsequently was diverted out of anthropological and sociological thinking. However, Turner's approach to liminality has two major shortcomings. First, partly due to criticism, Turner was  keen to limit the meaning of the concept to the concrete settings of small-scale tribal societies, preferring the neologism coined by him, 'liminoid', to analyse certain features of the modern world, like theatre (Turner 1982). However, Agnes Horvath (2013) argues that the term can be applied to concrete historical events, and should be applied, as offering a vital means for historical and sociological understanding.  Second, again staying too close to his own experiences, Turner attributed a rather univocally positive connotation to liminal situations, as ways of renewal. However, liminal situations can be, and in actual fact in modern era, rather quite different: periods of uncertainty, anguish, even existential fear: a facing of the abyss in void.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath, Agnes. ''Modernism and Charisma''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, Macmillan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Liminality has both spatial and temporal dimensions, and can be applied to a variety of subjects: individuals, larger groups (cohorts or villages), whole societies, and possibly even entire civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt; The following chart summarizes the different dimensions and subjects of liminal experiences, and also provides the main characteristics and key examples of each category.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Another significant variable is "scale," or the "degree" to which an individual or group experiences liminality.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 17&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "there are degrees of liminality, and…the degree depends on the extent to which the liminal experience can be weighed against persisting structures."&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 18&lt;/ref&gt; When the spatial and temporal are both affected, the intensity of the liminal experience increases and so-called "pure liminality" is approached.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==In large-scale societies==

The concept of a liminal situation can also be applied to entire societies that are going through a crisis or a "collapse of order".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] made a significant contribution to this idea through his concept of the "[[axial age]]", which was "an in-between period between two structured world-views and between two rounds of empire building; it was an age of creativity where 'man asked radical questions', and where the 'unquestioned grasp on life is loosened'".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; It was essentially a time of uncertainty which, most importantly, involved entire civilizations. Seeing as liminal periods are both destructive and constructive, the ideas and practices that emerge from these liminal historical periods are of extreme importance, as they will "tend to take on the quality of structure".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Events such as political or social revolutions (along with other periods of crisis) can thus be considered liminal, as they result in the complete collapse of order and can lead to significant social change.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2006, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Liminality in large-scale societies differs significantly from liminality found in ritual passages in small-scale societies. One primary characteristic of liminality (as defined van Gennep and Turner) is that there is a way in as well as a way out.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In ritual passages, "members of the society are themselves aware of the liminal state: they know that they will leave it sooner or later, and have 'ceremony masters' to guide them through the rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; However, in those liminal periods that affect society as a whole, the future (what comes after the liminal period) is completely unknown, and there is no "ceremony master" who has gone through the process before and that can lead people out of it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, liminal situations can become dangerous. They allow for the emergence of "self-proclaimed ceremony masters", that assume leadership positions and attempt to "[perpetuate] liminality and by emptying the liminal moment of real creativity, [turn] it into a scene of mimetic rivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depth psychology==
Jungians have often seen the [[individuation]] process of self-realization as taking place within a liminal space.  'Individuation begins with a withdrawal from normal modes of socialisation, epitomized by the breakdown of the persona...liminality'.&lt;ref&gt;Homans 1979, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "what Turner's concept of social liminality does for status in society, Jung...does for the movement of the person through the life process of individuation".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, quoted in Miller and Jung 2004, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation can be seen as a "movement through liminal space and time, from disorientation to integration....What takes place in the dark phase of liminality is a process of breaking down...in the interest of "making whole" one's meaning, purpose and sense of relatedness once more'"&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1988, 73, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] figure, "the trickster is a symbol of the liminal state itself, and of its permanent accessibility as a source of recreative power".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pelton in Young-Eisendrath and Dawson eds. 1997, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

But other depth psychologies speak of a similar process.  [[Carl Rogers]] describes "the 'out-of-this-world' quality that many therapists have remarked upon, a sort of trance-like feeling in the relationship that client and therapist emerge from at the end of the hour, as if from a deep well or tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1961, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The French talk of how the analytic setting 'opens/forges the "intermediate space," "excluded middle," or "between" that figures so importantly in [[Irigaray]]'s writing".&lt;ref&gt;E. Hirsh, in Burke et al. eds. 1994, 309n&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Milner]] claimed that "a temporal spatial frame also marks off the special kind of reality of a psycho-analytic session...the different kind of reality that is within it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Casement 1997, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jungians however have perhaps been most explicit about the 'need to accord space, time and place for liminal feeling'&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1988, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;—as well about the associated dangers, 'two mistakes: we provide no ritual space at all in our lives...or we stay in it too long'.&lt;ref&gt;Bly, 1991, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Jung's psychology has itself been described as 'a form of "permanent liminality" in which there is no need to return to social structure'.&lt;ref&gt;Homans  1979, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of general usage==
 {{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}

===In rites===
In the context of rites, liminality is being artificially produced, as opposed to those situations (such as natural disasters) in which it can occur spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In the simple example of a college [[graduation]] ceremony, the liminal phase can actually be extended to include the period of time between when the last assignment was finished (and graduation was assured) all the way through reception of the diploma. That [[no man's land]] represents the limbo associated with liminality. The stress of accomplishing tasks for college has been lifted, yet the individual has not moved on to a new stage in life (psychologically or physically). The result is a unique perspective on what has come before, and what may come next.

It can include the period between when a couple get engaged and their marriage or between death and burial, for which cultures may have set ritual observances. Even sexually liberal cultures may strongly disapprove of an engaged spouse having sex with another person during this time. When a marriage proposal is initiated there is a liminal stage between the question and the answer during which the social arrangements of both parties involved are subject to transformation and inversion; a sort of "life stage limbo" so to speak in that the affirmation or denial can result in multiple and diverse outcomes.

Getz&lt;ref&gt;Getz 2007, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; provides commentary on the liminal/liminoid zone when discussing the planned event experience. He refers to a liminal zone at an event as the creation of "time out of time: a special place". He notes that this liminal zone is both spatial and temporal and integral when planning a successful event (e.g. ceremony, concert, conference etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Getz 2007, 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In time===
The temporal dimension of liminality can relate to moments (sudden events), periods (weeks, months, or possibly years), and epochs (decades, generations, maybe even centuries).&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
====Examples====
[[Twilight]] serves as a liminal time, between day and night—where one is 'in the twilight zone, in a liminal nether region of the night'.&lt;ref&gt;Costello 2002, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title of the television fiction series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' makes reference to this, describing it as "the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition" in one variant of the original series' opening. The name is from an actual zone observable from space in the place where daylight or shadow advances or retreats about the Earth.  [[Noon]] and, more often, [[midnight]] can be considered liminal, the first transitioning between morning and afternoon, the latter between days.

Within the years, liminal times include [[equinox]]es when day and night have equal length, and [[solstice]]s, when the increase of day or night shifts over to its decrease.  Where the [[quarter days]] are held to mark the change in seasons, they also are liminal times. [[New Year's Day]], whatever its connection or lack of one to the astrological sky, is a liminal time.  Customs such as fortune-telling take advantage of this liminal state.  In a number of cultures, actions and events on the first day of the year can determine the year, leading to such beliefs as [[first-foot]].  Many cultures regard it as a time especially prone to hauntings by [[ghost]]s—[[liminal being]]s, neither alive nor dead.

===In religion===

====Christian worship====

Liminal existence can be located in a separated ''sacred space'', which occupies a ''sacred time''.  Examples in the Bible include the dream of Jacob ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:12–19) where he encounters God between heaven and earth and the instance when [[Isaiah]] meets the Lord in the [[temple of holiness]] ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 6:1–6).&lt;ref&gt;Carson, 2003, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a liminal space, the individual experiences the revelation of ''sacred knowledge'' where God imparts his knowledge on the person.

Worship can be understood in this context as the church community (or ''communitas'' or ''[[koinonia]]'') enter into liminal space corporately.&lt;ref&gt;Carson 2003, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious symbols and music may aid in this process described as a [[pilgrimage]] by way of [[prayer]], [[song]], or [[liturgical]] acts.  The congregation is transformed in the liminal space and as they exit, are sent out back into the world to serve.

===Of beings===
Various minority groups can be considered liminal. In reality illegal immigrants (present but not "official"), and stateless people, for example, are regarded as liminal because they are "betwixt and between home and host, part of society, but sometimes never fully integrated".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex]] or [[transgender]] people, [[bisexual]] people in most contemporary societies, people of mixed [[ethnicity]], and those accused but not yet judged guilty or not guilty, are liminal. Teenagers, being neither children nor adults, are liminal people: indeed, "for young people, liminality of this kind has become a permanent phenomenon...Postmodern liminality".&lt;ref&gt;Kahane 1997, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[trickster]] as the mythic projection of the magician—standing in the ''limen'' between the sacred realm and the profane"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 2009, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and related [[archetype]]s embody many such contradictions as do many [[popular culture]] [[celebrities]]. The category could also hypothetically and in [[fiction]] include [[cyborg]]s, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between two species, [[shapeshifter]]s. One could also consider seals, crabs, shorebirds, frogs, bats, dolphins/whales and other "border animals" to be liminal: "the wild duck and swan are cases in point...intermediate creatures that combine underwater activity and the bird flight with an intermediate, terrestrial life".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson in Jung 1978, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It should come as no surprise that these liminal creatures figure prominently in mythology as shapeshifters and spirit guides.

===In places===
The spatial dimension of liminality can include specific places, larger zones or areas, or entire countries and larger regions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Liminal places can range from [[border]]s and frontiers to no man's lands and [[disputed territories]], to [[crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] to perhaps [[airport]]s or [[hotel]]s, which people pass through but do not live in: arguably indeed all 'romantic travel enacts the three stages that characterize liminality: separation, marginalization, and reaggregation'.&lt;ref&gt; Illouz 1997, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mythology]] and [[religion]] or [[occult|esoteric lore]] liminality can include such realms as [[Purgatory]] or [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Da'at]], which, as well as signifying liminality, some theologians deny actually existing, making them, in some cases, doubly liminal. "Between-ness" defines these spaces. For a hotel worker (an insider) or a person passing by with disinterest (a total outsider), the hotel would have a very different connotation. To a traveller staying there, the hotel would function as a liminal zone, just as 'doors and windows and hallways and gates frame...the definitively liminal condition'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown in Corcoran 2002, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

More conventionally, springs, caves, shores, rivers, volcanic calderas—'a huge crater of an extinct volcano...[as] another symbol of transcendence'&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson, in Jung 1978, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;—fords, passes, crossroads, bridges, and marshes are all liminal: '"edges", borders or faultlines between the legitimate and the illegitimate'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown in Corcoran 2002, 196&lt;/ref&gt; Oedipus (an adoptee and therefore liminal) met his father at the crossroads and killed him; the bluesman [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] met the devil at the crossroads, where he is said to have sold his soul. Major transformations occur at crossroads and other liminal places, at least partly because liminality—being so unstable—can pave the way for access to esoteric knowledge or understanding of both sides.&lt;ref&gt;El Khoury, 2015, 217&lt;/ref&gt; Liminality is sacred, alluring, and dangerous.

In contemporary culture viewing the nightclub experience (dancing in a [[nightclub]]) through the liminoid framework highlights the 'presence or absence of opportunities for social subversion, escape from social structures, and exercising choice'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Gori|first2=Keith|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Hogg|first4=Gillian|last5=Farrington|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-02|title=Experiential liminoid consumption: the case of nightclubbing|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=32|issue=1–2|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1089309|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows 'insights into what may be effectively improved in hedonic spaces. Enhancing the consumer experience of these liminoid aspects may heighten experiential feelings of escapism and play, thus encouraging the consumer to more freely consume'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Gori|first2=Keith|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Hogg|first4=Gillian|last5=Farrington|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-02|title=Experiential liminoid consumption: the case of nightclubbing|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=32|issue=1–2|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1089309|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In folklore===
There are a number of stories in [[folklore]] of those who could only be killed in a liminal space: [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes|Lleu]] could not be killed during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, nor riding or walking, nor clothed or naked (and is attacked at dusk, while wrapped in a net with one foot on a cauldron and one on a goat). Likewise, in [[Hindu]] text [[Bhagavat Purana]], [[Vishnu]] appears in a half-man half-[[lion]] form named [[Narasimha]] to destroy the demon Hiranyakashipu who has obtained the power never to be killed in day nor night, in the ground nor in the air, with [[weapon]] nor by bare hands, in a building nor outside it, by man nor beast.  Narasimha kills Hiranyakashipu at dusk, across his lap, with his sharp claws, on the threshold of the palace, and as Narasimha is a god himself, the demon is killed by neither man nor beast. In the [[Mahabharata]], [[Indra]] promises not to slay [[Namuci]] and [[Vritra]] with anything wet or dry, nor in the day or in the night, but instead kills them at dusk with foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Vritra |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA/Gale Group |year=2006 |url=http://www.bookrags.com/Vritra |accessdate = 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another example comes from Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke" in which the Forest Spirit can only be killed while switching between its two forms.

===In ethnographic research===
In ethnographic research, 'the researcher is...in a liminal state, separated from his own culture yet not incorporated into the host culture'&lt;ref&gt;Norris Johnson, in Robben and Sluka 2007, 76&lt;/ref&gt;—when he or she is both participating in the culture ''and'' observing the culture. The researcher must consider the self in relation to others and his or her positioning in the culture being studied.

In many cases, greater participation in the group being studied can lead to increased access of cultural information and greater in-group understanding of experiences within the culture. However increased participation also blurs the role of the researcher in data collection and analysis. Often a researcher that engages in fieldwork as a "participant" or "participant-observer" occupies a liminal state where he/she is a part of the culture, but also separated from the culture as a researcher. This liminal state of being betwixt and between is emotional and uncomfortable as the researcher uses self-reflexivity to interpret field observations and interviews.

Some scholars argue that ethnographers are present in their research, occupying a liminal state, regardless of their participant status. Justification for this position is that the researcher as a "human instrument" engages with his/her observations in the process of recording and analyzing the data. A researcher, often unconsciously, selects what to observe, how to record observations and how to interpret observations based on personal reference points and experiences. For example, even in selecting what observations are interesting to record, the researcher must interpret and value the data available. To explore the liminal state of the researcher in relation to the culture, self-reflexivity and awareness are important tools to reveal researcher bias and interpretation.

===In popular culture===
====Novels and short stories====

''[[Rant (novel)|Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey]]'' is a US novel by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] from 2007 that makes use of liminality in explaining time travel. ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' is  a romance by A. S. Byatt, which describes how [[postmodern]] 'Literary theory. Feminism...write about liminality. Thresholds. Bastions. Fortresses'.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt 1990, 505–06.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Twilight (novel series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' is a book series by Stephanie Meyer that was turned into film series. Each book title speaks of a liminal period (''[[Twilight (Meyer novel)|Twilight]], [[New Moon (novel)|New Moon]], [[Eclipse (Meyer novel)|Eclipse]]'', and ''[[Breaking Dawn]]''). In the children's story ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' (1961), Milo enters "The Lands Beyond", a liminal place (which explains its topsy-turvy nature), through a magical tollbooth. When he finishes his quest, he returns, but changed, seeing the world differently. The giver of the tollbooth is never seen and name never known, and hence, also remains liminal. In ''[[Offshore (novel)|Offshore]]'', a British novel by [[Penelope Fitzgerald]], the characters live between sea and land on docked boats, becoming liminal people; as such, liminality is a major theme in the novel. [[Saul Bellow|Bellow]]'s varied uses of liminality...include his ''[[Dangling Man]]'', suspended between civilian life and the armed forces'&lt;ref&gt;Elsbree 1991, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; at 'the onset of the dangling days'.&lt;ref&gt;Bellow 1977, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotte Brönte's widely-read ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' follows the protagonist through different stages of life as she crosses the threshold from student to teacher to woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brontë, Charlotte (1816–1855)|volume = 1|date=2017-11-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.3523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her existence throughout the novel is liminal and can first be seen when she hides herself behind a large red curtain to read, closing herself off physically and existing in a paracosmic realm. At Gateshead, Jane is noted to be set apart and on the outside of the family, putting her in a liminal space in which she neither belongs nor is completely cast away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Megan|date=2017|title=The Space In-Between: Exploring Liminality in Jane Eyre|url=|journal=Criterion: A Journal of Literary Criticism|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane's existence emerges as paradoxical as she transcends commonly accepted beliefs about what it means to be a woman, orphan, child, victim, criminal, and pilgrim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creates her own narrative as she is torn from her past and denied a sure future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with a series of crises, Jane's circumstances question social constructs and allow Jane to act to progress or retract; as a result, a narrative dynamic of structure and liminality (as coined by Turner).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Karen Brooks states that Australian [[grunge lit]] books, such as Clare Mendes'  ''[[Drift Street]]'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and [[Andrew McGahan]]'s ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "liminal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an [[abjection|abject]] human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that Berridge's short stories provide "...a variety of violent, disaffected and often abject young people", characters who "...blur and often overturn" the boundaries between suburban and urban space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "liminality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Brooks states that the story "Caravan Park" in Berridge's short story collection is an example of a story with a "liminal" setting, as it is set in a [[mobile home]] park; since mobile homes can be relocated, she states that setting a story in a mobile home "...has the potential to disrupt a range of geo-physical and psycho-social boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brookes|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that in Berridge's story "Bored Teenagers", the adolescents using a community drop-in centre decide to destroy its equipment and defile the space by urinating in it, thus "altering the dynamics of the place and the way" their bodies are perceived, with their destructive activities being deemed by Brooks to indicate the community centre's "loss of authority" over the teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plays====
''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', a play by [[Tom Stoppard]], takes place both in a kind of no-man's-land and the actual setting of ''[[Hamlet]]''. "Shakespeare's play ''Hamlet'' is in several ways an essay in sustained liminality ... only via a condition of complete liminality can Hamlet finally see the way forward".&lt;ref&gt;Liebler, pp. 182–84&lt;/ref&gt; In the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' for the entire length of the play, two men walk around restlessly on an empty stage. They alternate between hope and hopelessness.  At times one forgets what they are even waiting for, and the other reminds him: "We are waiting for Godot". The identity of 'Godot' is never revealed, and perhaps the men do not know Godot's identity. The men are trying to keep up their spirits as they wander the empty stage, waiting.

====Films and TV shows====
''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' (1959–2003) is a US television anthology series that explores unusual situations between reality and the paranormal.  ''[[The Terminal (film)|The Terminal]]'' (2004), is a US film in which the main character (Viktor Navorski) is trapped in a liminal space; since he can neither legally return to his home country Krakozhia nor enter the United States, he must remain in the airport terminal indefinitely until he finds a way out at the end of the film. In the film ''[[Waking Life]]'', about dreams, Aklilu Gebrewold talks about liminality.

====Music and other media====
"Liminal Space" is an album by American [[breakcore]] artist Xanopticon. [[Coil (band)|Coil]] mention liminality throughout their works, most explicitly with the title of their song "Batwings (A Limnal Hymn)" ''(sic)'' from their album [[Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 2]]. In ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'' where Harald Hoerwick, the creator of the MMORPG "The World", attempted to bring the real world into the online world, creating a hazy barrier between the two worlds; a concept called "Liminality".

==Liminoid experiences==
In 1974, Victor Turner coined the term ''liminoid'' (from the greek word eidos, meaning "form or shape"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Liminality|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to refer to experiences that have characteristics of liminal experiences but are optional and do not involve a resolution of a personal crisis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Turner, Victor. 'Liminal to liminoid in play, flow, and ritual: An essay in comparative symbology'. ''Rice University Studies'' 1974. 60(3):53–92&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike liminal events, liminoid experiences are conditional and do not result in a change of status, but merely serve as transitional moments in time&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/63159/article_RIP603_part4.pdf|title=LIMINAL TO LIMINOID, IN PLAY, FLOW, AND
RITUAL: AN ESSAY IN COMPARATIVE SYMBOLOGY|last=Turner|first=Victor|date=|website=Rice Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/25/18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The liminal is part of society, an aspect of social or religious rites, while the liminoid is a break from society, part of "play" or "playing". With the rise in industrialization and the emergence of leisure as an acceptable form of play separate from work, liminoid experiences have become much more common than liminal rites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In these modern societies, rites are diminished and 'forged the concept of "liminoid" rituals for analogous but secular phenomena' such as attending rock concerts and other&lt;ref&gt; Illouz, ''Consuming'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; liminoid experiences.

The fading of liminal stages in exchange for liminoid experiences is marked by the shift in culture from tribal and agrarian to modern and industrial. In these societies, work and play are entirely separate whereas in more archaic societies, they are nearly indistinguishable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the past play was interwoven with the nature of work as symbolic gestures and rites in order to promote fertility, abundance, and the passage of certain liminal phases; thus, work and play are inseparable and often dependent on social rites&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Examples of this include Cherokee and Mayan riddles, trickster tales, sacred ball games, and joking relationships which serve holy purposes of work in liminal situations while retaining the element of playfulness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ritual and myth were, in the past, exclusively connected to collective work that served holy and often symbolic purposes; liminal rites were held in the form of coming-of-age ceremonies, celebrations of seasons, and more. Industrialization cut the cord between work and the sacred, putting "work" and "play" in separate boxes that rarely, if ever, intersected. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a famous essay regarding the shift to liminal to liminoid in industrial society, Turner offers a twofold explanation of this sect. First, society began to move away from activities concerning collective ritual obligations, placing more emphasis on the individual than the community; this led to more choice in activities, with many such as work and leisure becoming optional. Second, the work done to earn a living became entirely separate from his or her other activities so that it is "no longer natural, but arbitrary."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In simpler terms, the industrial revolution brought about free time that had not existed in past societies and created space for liminoid experiences to exist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Types of Liminoid Experiences ===

==== Sports ====
Sporting events such as the Olympics, NFL football games, and hockey matches are forms of liminoid experiences. They are optional activities of leisure that place both the spectator and the competitor in in-between places outside of society's norms. Sporting events also create a sense of community among fans and reinforces the collective spirit of those who take part.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RIOZwUzy0vsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=liminoid&amp;ots=AQGD79gCAS&amp;sig=kfUSHa6p5gBzA_n3vZAnIhIPc9A#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Victor Turner and Contemporary Cultural Performance|last=John|first=Graham St|date=2008-04-01|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857450371|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homecoming football games, gymnastics meets, modern baseball games, and swim meets all qualify as liminoid and follow a seasonal schedule; therefore, the flow of sports becomes cyclical and predictable, reinforcing the liminal qualities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Flying ====
Airplane travel is inherently liminoid-suspended in the sky, neither here nor there and crossing thresholds of time and space, it is difficult to make sense of the experience of flying.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Alexandra G.|date=2002-10|title=Organizational Politics of Place and Space: The Perpetual Liminoid Performance of Commercial Flight|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10462930208616175|journal=Text and Performance Quarterly|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=297–316|doi=10.1080/10462930208616175|issn=1046-2937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flights shift our existence into a limbo space in which movement becomes an accepted set of cultural performances aimed at convincing us that air travel is a reflection of reality rather than a separation from it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''MAGEN''' (Masking Gateway for Enterprises) is [[information security]] technology designed by [[IBM R&amp;D Labs in Israel#Haifa Research Lab|IBM's Haifa Research Lab]].  MAGEN is designed to keep users from viewing discrete chunks of secret or sensitive data on their screens that they are not authorized to see.

MAGEN applies a sort of inverse [[highlighter|highlighting]] on the data in question in real time as it is rendered on the screen.  This allows "[[Classified information|eyes only]]" business logic to be implemented once, at the screen, rather than within each affected application.

MAGEN leverages a combination of [[optical character recognition]] and [[screen scraping]] techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">The '''Master of IT in Business (MITB)''' is a master's degree emphasizing on the application of [[information technology]] to create business impact and value. The MITB degree originated in the early [[21st century]] as the [[digital transformation]] of businesses took place leaving industries to compete with each other on their technological capacity and advancement. The MITB is typically a sandwich course of two distinct horizontals targeted at providing a holistic view and understanding of both [[technology]] and [[management]] alike. The MITB offers a more specialized and niche course selection for [[technology]] and [[business]] education aspirants alike. Students on completion of such degrees typically pursue careers in various verticals leveraging [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.smu.edu.sg/master-it-business |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbs.rutgers.edu/ |title=Rutgers MBS |publisher=Rutgers University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jcu.edu.sg/courses-and-study/courses/course/master-of-information-technology-business-informatics |title=James Cook MITBI |publisher=James Cook University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postgrad.com.sg/master-of-it-in-business |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mbaguide.com.sg/course/master-of-it-in-business-mitb/ |title=SMU MITB |publisher=Singapore Management University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109110054/http://mbaguide.com.sg/course/master-of-it-in-business-mitb/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/mc200/#pageId=overview |title=RMIT MBIT |publisher=RMIT University |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/programs-courses/postgraduate-coursework/agsm-master-business-technology-mbt |title=UNSW MBT |publisher=UNSW |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The degree is offered under various names by:
* [[Singapore Management University]] as Master of IT in Business (MITB) 
* [[Rutgers University]] as Master of Business &amp; Science (MBS)
* [[James Cook University]] as Master of IT in Business Informatics (MITBI)
* [[RMIT]] as Master of Business Information Technology (MBIT) 
* [[UNSW]] as Masters of Business &amp; Technology (MBT)

and by many other universities worldwide.

==Admissions==
Many programs base their admission decisions in a very similar fashion to the [[MBA]] programs, on a combination of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities or volunteer work, and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole. The [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MITB programs. The [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MITB programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitroeff, Natalie |title=Almost All Business Schools Now Accept the GRE|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/gre-at-business-school-most-mba-programs-now-accept-the-gre-too |date=20 October 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission.

The '''Mathura lion capital''' is an [[Indo-Scythian]] sandstone capital from [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] in Northern India, dated to the first decade of the 1st century CE (1-10 CE).&lt;ref&gt;An Inscribed Silver Buddhist Reliquary of the Time of King Kharaosta and Prince Indravarman, Richard Salomon, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 116, No. 3 (Jul. - Sep., 1996), pp. 442 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/605147?seq=25#page_scan_tab_contents]&lt;/ref&gt; It was consecrated under the rule of [[Rajuvula]], one of the [[Northern Satraps]] of the region of [[Mathura]].

The capital was unearthed at the Saptarishi mound of Mathura by [[Bhagwan Lal Indraji]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jason Neelis |title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GB-JV2eOr2UC&amp;pg=PA122 |date=19 November 2010 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-18159-8 |page=122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is covered with [[Prakrit]] inscriptions in the [[kharoshthi]] script of northwestern [[India]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/r/red_sandstone_pillar_capital.aspx Red Sandstone Pillar Capital], British Museum, accessed August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was made on the occasion of the funeral of "the illustrious king Muki and his horse" (Muki has been conjectured to be [[Maues]]).

The capital describes, among other donations, the gift of a [[stupa]] with a relic of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], by Queen [[Ayasia]], the "chief queen of the [[Indo-Scythian]] ruler of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], satrap [[Rajuvula]]". She is mentioned as the "daughter of [[Kharahostes]]" (See: Mathura Lion Capital inscriptions below). The lion capital also mentions the genealogy of several Indo-Scythian satraps of Mathura. It mentions [[Sodasa]], son of Rajuvula, who succeeded him and also made Mathura his capital.

The capital also displays at its center a Buddhist [[triratana]] symbol, further confirming the involvement of Indo-Scythian rulers with Buddhism.

The inscription indicates support of the [[Sarvastivadin]], against the [[Mahasamghikas]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfield, "The dynastic art of the Kushans", p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

It is on display at the [[British Museum]] in the Joseph E. Hotung Gallery.

[[Sten Konow]], who compiled a definitive listing of Indian Buddhist inscriptions said: "If we bear in mind that '''mb''' becomes m i.e mm in the dialect of [[Kharoshthi]] dhammapada, and that is used for the common o in Sudasa in the Lion Capital Inscriptions, the Kamuia of the Lion Capital can very well represent a Sanskrit Kambojika ... I shall only add that if Kharoshtha and his father Arta were [[Kambojas]], the same may have been the case with Moga, and we understand why the Kambojas are sometimes mentioned with the [[Indo-Scythians|Saka]]s and [[Yona#Ancient Indian references|Yavanas]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sten Konow, ''Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum'', Vol II, Part I, p xxxvi, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Konow's readings, his sequence of sentences and some of the interpretation, particularly the connection with king Maues, need to be changed in the light of a new reading of H. Falk.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Falk, "Ten thoughts on the Mathura Lion capital reliquary". Bhandare, Shailendra &amp; Sanjay Garg (eds.), "Felicitas - Essays in Numismatics, Epigraphy and History in Honour of Joe Cribb". Mumbai, pp. 121-141&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Me'am Lo'ez''' ({{lang-he|מעם לועז}}), initiated by Rabbi [[Yaakov Culi]] in 1730, is a widely studied [[Exegesis|commentary]] on the [[Tanakh]] written in [[Ladino language|Ladino]]. It is perhaps the best known publication in that language.

==Content==
In Rabbi Culi's time, many individuals in Turkey were not sufficiently fluent in the [[Hebrew language]] to study the [[Torah]] and its [[Rabbinic literature#Classic Torah and Talmud commentaries|commentaries]] in the original. Rabbi Culi thus undertook the "colossal task" of writing a [[compendium]] of the major fields of Torah study. The commentary was to be user-friendly and was thus written in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] or Judaeo-Spanish, the [[Jewish language]] spoken by the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[Jews in Turkey]].

The book was divided according to the [[weekly Torah portion]] (''[[Parashat hashevua]]''); Rabbi Culi explains each chapter in detail according to the [[Midrash]] and [[Talmud]], as well as discussing the relevant ''[[Halacha]]'' as based on the [[Shulchan Aruch#Shulchan Aruch|''Shulchan Aruch'']] and ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''. In his introduction Rabbi Culi personally guarantees that "everyone who reads the ''Me'am Loez'' every day will be able to answer in Heaven that he has learned the ''whole'' Torah, because all aspects of the Torah are covered on it".

==Authorship==
While Rabbi Culi died only two years later after completing the [[Book of Genesis]] and 2/3 of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], due to its mass popularity—and the extensive notes already written by Rabbi Culi—a decision was taken to complete the commentaries. Rabbi [[Yitzhak Magriso]] completed [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], and wrote the commentary on the books of [[Leviticus]] and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]. [[Deuteronomy]] was done by Rabbi [[Yitzhak Bechor Agruiti]]. The commentary on [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] was written by Rabbi [[Rachamim Menachem Mitrani]]. The [[Book of Esther]] was done by Rabbi [[Raphael Chiyya Pontremoli]]. Rabbi [[Shmeul Yerushalmi]] translated the works into Hebrew, although greatly deviated from the originals on their Nach commentaries and the book of Avoth. He also continued the Meam Loez work in Hebrew on many of the books of Nach that the sages before him did not write.

==Translations==
The Me'am Loez quickly became extremely popular in the Jewish communities of [[Turkey]], Spain, [[Morocco]] and [[Egypt]]. With the decline of Ladino after the Holocaust, various [[translation]]s were produced, and the work can still be found in many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[synagogue]]s to this day. In 1967, a Hebrew translation, ''Yalkut Me'am Lo'ez'', was produced by Rabbi [[Shmuel Kravitzer]]. The first English translation, the ''Torah Anthology'', was written (primarily) by Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]];&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Aryeh, ''The Torah Anthology'', Maznaim Publishing Corporation, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; this translation has introduced Me'am Lo'ez to the [[Ashkenazi]] world. (In 1964, Gonzalo Maeso and Pascual Recuero, two [[Catholic]] scholars, from the [[University of Granada]] produced a modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] printing. "Apparently, their lack of knowledge regarding both [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and Ladino resulted in an edition filled with inaccuracies".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sephardiccouncil.org/meam.html&lt;/ref&gt;) Pilar Romeu published in Barcelona, 2000, a critical edition with concordance and analytical indexes of the Me'am Lo'ez of the Pentateuch (''Torah'').&lt;ref&gt;Romeu, Pilar (2000): Las llaves del Meam loez: Edición crítica, concordada y analítica de los Índices del Meam loez de la Torá. Barcelona, 343 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Spanish scholar, Rosa Asenjo, published in Barcelona, 2003, the Me'am Lo'ez of Song of Songs (''Šir ha-širim'') of Hayim Y. Šakí (Constantinople, 1899).&lt;ref&gt;Asenjo, Rosa: El Meam loez de Cantar de los Cantares (Šir ha-širim) de Hayim Y. Šakí (Constantinopla, 1899) (Barcelona: Tirocinio, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parallel Scale Nomogram.svg|right|400px|thumb|A typical parallel-scale nomogram. This example calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17 are substituted into the equation. The isopleth crosses the scale for T at just under 4.65.]]

A '''nomogram''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] νόμος ''nomos'', "law" and γραμμή ''grammē'', "line"), also called a '''nomograph''', '''alignment chart''' or '''abaque''', is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer [[Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne|Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne]] (1862-1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel [[coordinate system]] invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard [[Cartesian coordinates]].

A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an ''index line'' or ''isopleth''.

Nomograms flourished in many different contexts for roughly 75 years because they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are obtained very quickly and reliably by simply drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a [[slide rule]], or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. In addition, nomograms naturally incorporate implicit or explicit [[domain knowledge]] into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. 
[[Image:Smith chart gen.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|An impedance [[Smith chart]] (with no data plotted)]]

Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device, and like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned. While the slide rule is intended to be a general-purpose device, a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation, with tables of values effectively built into the construction of the [[Scale (ratio)|scales]]. Nomograms are typically used in applications where the level of accuracy  they offer is sufficient and useful. Alternatively, a nomogram can be used to check an answer obtained from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation. 

Other types of graphical calculators such as '''intercept charts''', '''trilinear diagrams''' and '''hexagonal charts''' are sometimes called nomograms. Other such examples include the [[Smith chart]], a graphical calculator used in [[electronics]] and [[systems analysis]], [[thermodynamic diagram]]s and [[tephigram]]s, used to plot the vertical structure of the atmosphere and perform calculations on its stability and humidity content. These do not meet the strict definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths.

==Description==
[[Image:Components of a Nomogram.png|right|300px|thumb|Components of a parallel-scale nomogram]]
A nomogram for a three-variable equation typically has three scales, although there exist nomograms in which two or even all three scales are common. Here two scales represent known values and the third is the scale where the result is read off.  The simplest such equation is ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for the three variables ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. An example of this type of nomogram is shown on the right, annotated with terms used to describe the parts of a nomogram.

More complicated equations can sometimes be expressed as the sum of functions of the three variables. For example, the nomogram at the top of this article could be constructed as a parallel-scale nomogram because it can be expressed as such a sum after taking logarithms of both sides of the equation.

The scale for the unknown variable can lie between the other two scales or outside of them. The known values of the calculation are marked on the scales for those variables, and a line is drawn between these marks. The result is read off the unknown scale at the point where the line intersects that scale. The scales include 'tick marks' to indicate exact number locations, and they may also include labeled reference values. These scales may be [[linear]], [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], or have some more complex relationship.

The sample isopleth shown in red on the nomogram at the top of this article calculates the value of ''T'' when ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7.30 and ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.17. The isopleth crosses the scale for ''T'' at just under 4.65; a larger figure printed in high resolution on paper would yield ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.64 to three-digit precision. Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables.

Straight scales are useful for relatively simple calculations, but for more complex calculations the use of simple or elaborate curved scales may be required. Nomograms for more than three variables can be constructed by incorporating a grid of scales for two of the variables, or by concatenating individual nomograms of fewer numbers of variables into a compound nomogram.

==Applications==
Nomograms have been used in an extensive array of applications. A sample includes

* The original application by d'Ocagne, the automation of complicated [[cut and fill]] calculations for earth removal during the construction of the French national railway system. This was an important proof of concept, because the calculations are non-trivial and the results translated into significant savings of time, effort, and money.
* The design of channels, pipes and weirs for regulating the flow of water.
* The work of [[Lawrence Henderson]], in which nomograms were used to correlate many different aspects of blood physiology. It was the first major use of nomograms in the United States and also the first medical nomograms anywhere. Nomograms continue to be used extensively in medical fields.
* Ballistics calculations prior to fire control systems, where calculating time was critical.
* Machine shop calculations, to convert blueprint dimensions and perform calculations based on material dimensions and properties. These nomograms often included markings for standard dimensions and for available manufactured parts.
* Statistics, for complicated calculations of properties of distributions and for operations research including the design of acceptance tests for quality control.
* Operations Research, to obtain results in a variety of optimization problems.
* Chemistry and chemical engineering, to encapsulate both general physical relationships and empirical data for specific compounds.
* Aeronautics, in which nomograms were used for decades in the cockpits of aircraft of all descriptions. As a navigation and flight control aid, nomograms were fast, compact and easy-to-use calculators.
* Astronomical calculations, as in the post-launch orbital calculations of [[Sputnik 1]] by P.E. Elyasberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin Yu.A.Mozzhorin Memories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018165625/http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin |date=2007-10-18 }} at the website of Russian state archive for scientific-technical documentation&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engineering work of all kinds: Electrical design of filters and transmission lines, mechanical calculations of stress and loading, optical calculations, and so forth.
* Military, where complex calculations need to be made in the field quickly and with reliability not dependent on electrical devices.
*[[Seismology]], where nomograms have been developed to estimate earthquake [http://web.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/geog458558/labs/nomogram.html magnitude]

==Examples==

===Parallel-resistance/thin-lens===
[[Image:Nomogramparallelresistance.svg|right|200px|thumb|Parallel [[electrical resistance]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below performs the computation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1/A+1/B}=\frac{AB}{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;

This nomogram is interesting because it performs a useful nonlinear calculation using only straight-line, equally graduated scales. While the diagonal line has a scale &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; times larger than the axes scales, the numbers on it exactly match those directly below or to its left, and thus it can be easily created by drawing a straight line diagonally on a sheet of [[graph paper]].

''A'' and ''B'' are entered on the horizontal and vertical scales, and the result is read from the diagonal scale.  Being proportional to the [[harmonic mean]] of ''A'' and ''B'', this formula has several applications.  For example, it is the [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel-resistance formula]] in [[electronics]], and the [[Thin lens|thin-lens equation]] in [[optics]].

In the example, the red line demonstrates that parallel resistors of 56 and 42&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]s have a combined resistance of 24&amp;nbsp;ohms. It also demonstrates that an object at a distance of 56&amp;nbsp;cm from a [[lens (optics)|lens]] whose [[focal length]] is 24&amp;nbsp;cm forms a [[real image]] at a distance of 42&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Chi-squared test computation===
[[Image:chisquarenomo3.png|right|200px|thumb|[[Chi-squared distribution]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below can be used to perform an approximate computation of some values needed when performing a familiar statistical test, [[Pearson's chi-squared test]]. This nomogram demonstrates the use of curved scales with unevenly spaced graduations.

The relevant expression is

:&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

The scale along the top is shared among five different ranges of observed values: A, B, C, D and E. The observed value is found in one of these ranges, and the tick mark used on that scale is found immediately above it. Then the curved scale used for the expected value is selected based on the range. For example, an observed value of 9 would use the tick mark above the 9 in range A, and curved scale A would be used for the expected value. An observed value of 81 would use the tick mark above 81 in range E, and curved scale E would be used for the expected value. This allows five different nomograms to be incorporated into a single diagram.

In this manner, the blue line demonstrates the computation of

:(9 &amp;minus; 5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ 5 = 3.2

and the red line demonstrates the computation of

:(81 &amp;minus; 70)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 70 = 1.7

In performing the test, [[Yates's correction for continuity]] is often applied, and simply involves subtracting 0.5 from the observed values. A nomogram for performing the test with Yates's correction could be constructed simply by shifting each "observed" scale half a unit to the left, so that the 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ... graduations are placed where the values 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... appear on the present chart.

===Food risk assessment===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food [[risk assessment]] nomogram]]
Although nomograms represent mathematical relationships, not all are mathematically derived.  The following one was developed graphically to achieve appropriate end results that could readily be defined by the product of their relationships in subjective units rather than numerically. The use of non-parallel axes enabled the non-linear relationships to be incorporated into the model.

The numbers in square boxes denote the axes requiring input after appropriate assessment.

The pair of nomograms at the top of the image determine the probability of occurrence and the availability, which are then incorporated into the bottom multistage nomogram.

Lines 8 and 10 are ‘tie lines’ or ‘pivot lines’ and are used for the transition between the stages of the compound nomogram.

The final pair of parallel logarithmic scales (12) are not nomograms as such, but reading-off scales to translate the risk score (11, remote to extremely high) into a sampling frequency to address safety aspects and other ‘consumer protection’ aspects respectively.  This stage requires political ‘buy in’ balancing cost against risk.  The example uses a three-year minimum frequency for each, though with the high risk end of the scales different for the two aspects, giving different frequencies for the two, but both subject to an overall minimum sampling of every food for all aspects at least once every three years.

This [[risk assessment]] nomogram was developed by the [[Public analyst|UK Public Analyst Service]] with funding from the [[Food Standards Agency|UK Food Standards Agency]] for use as a tool to guide the appropriate frequency of sampling and analysis of food for official food control purposes, intended to be used to assess all potential problems with all foods, although not yet adopted.

===Sample size estimation===
[[File:Power0501.pdf|thumb|Nomograph for Sample Size Estimation]]

This nomograph can be used to estimate the sample size requirements for statistical analyses. It uses four parameters: ''&amp;alpha;'' (fixed), effect size (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;''), statistical power, and number of cases ''N'' (two scales for ''&amp;alpha;'' = .05 (liberal) or .01 (conservative)).

The hypothesized effect size in the population can either be expressed as a correlation coefficient (''&amp;rho;'') or a normalized difference in means (''&amp;delta;'') for a [[T-test]]. The normalized difference is equal to the absolute value of the difference between two population means (''&amp;mu;''₁ &amp;minus; ''&amp;mu;''₂), divided by the pooled standard deviation (''s'').

The statistical power desired is estimated by 1 &amp;minus; ''&amp;beta;'', where ''&amp;beta;'' is equal to the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;II error. A [[type II error|''Type&amp;nbsp;II'' error]] is failing to reject the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact the null hypothesis is false in the population and should be rejected. Cohen (1977)&lt;ref name=Cohen_1977&gt;Cohen, J. (1977). ''Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences'', 2nd.&amp;nbsp;ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; recommends using power equal to 0.80 or 80%, for a ''&amp;beta;'' = 0.20&amp;nbsp;.

The sample size or number of cases required is reported for two standard levels of statistical significance (''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 or 0.05). The value of ''&amp;alpha;'' is the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;I error. A [[type I error|''Type&amp;nbsp;I'' error]] is rejecting the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., claiming that either ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact it ''is'' true (the value ''is'' zero) in the population and should ''not'' be rejected. The most commonly used values of &amp;alpha; are 0.05 or 0.01&amp;nbsp;.

To find the sample size requirements for a given statistical analysis, estimate the effect size expected in the population (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'') on the left hand axis, select the desired level of power on the right hand axis, and draw a line between the two values.

Where the line intersects with either the ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.05 or ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 middle axis will indicate the sample size required to achieve statistical significance of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05 or 0.01, respectively (for the previously given parameters).

For instance, if one estimates the population correlation (''&amp;rho;'') to be 0.30, and desires statistical power equal to 0.80, then to obtain a significance level of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05, the sample size requirement would be ''N'' = 70 cases rounded up (more precisely approximately 68&amp;nbsp;cases using interpolation).

'''Oil well control''' is the management of the dangerous effects caused by the unexpected release of [[formation fluid]], such as [[natural gas]] and/or [[crude oil]], upon surface equipment of oil or gas [[drilling rig]]s and escaping into the atmosphere. Technically, oil well control involves preventing the formation fluid, usually referred to as [[#Kicks|kick]], from entering into the [[wellbore]] during drilling.

Formation fluid can enter the wellbore if the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] being drilled.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, William C.; Plisga, Gary J. (2005). ''Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering'' (2nd edition). Elsevier.

Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Oil well control also includes monitoring a well for signs of impending influx of formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling and procedures, to stop the well from flowing when it happens by taking proper remedial actions.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=well%20control "Well control"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to manage and control these pressure effects can cause serious equipment damage and injury, or loss of life.  Improperly managed well control situations can cause [[blowout (well drilling)|blowouts]], which are uncontrolled and explosive expulsions of formation fluid from the well, potentially resulting in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/primary-well-control.html "Primary Well control"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''.

==Importance of oil well control==
[[Image:H104.jpg|thumb|Modern driller Argentina.]]
Oil well control is one of the most important aspects of drilling operations. Improper handling of [[#Kicks|kicks]] in oil well control can result in blowouts with very grave consequences, including the loss of valuable resources. Even though the cost of a blowout (as a result of improper/no oil well control) can easily reach several millions of US dollars, the monetary loss is not as serious as the other damages that can occur: irreparable damage to the environment, waste of valuable resources, ruined equipment, and most importantly, the safety and lives of personnel on the drilling rig.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Schubert, [http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2010/01/15WCFocus.pdf "Managed-Pressure Drilling: Kick Detection and Well Control" Section: "Kick Detection While Drilling"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2010/01/15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schub"&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, [http://www.pe.tamu.edu/schubert/public_html/PETE%20625/MEng%20Report.pdf "Well control"], ''Texas A&amp;M University MEng Report for well control'' (December 1995). Retrieved 2011-01-04, p.'''I'''-1/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avert the consequences of blowout, the utmost attention must be given to oil well control. That is why oil well control procedures should be in place prior to the start of an abnormal situation noticed within the wellbore, and ideally when a new rig position is sited.  In other words, this includes the time the new location is picked, all drilling, [[Completion (oil well)|completion]], [[workover]], [[snubbing]] and any other drilling-related operations that should be executed with proper oil well control in mind.&lt;ref name=Schub/&gt; This type of preparation involves widespread training of personnel, the development of strict operational guidelines and the design of drilling programs — maximizing the probability of successfully regaining hydrostatic control of a well after a significant influx of formation fluid has taken place.&lt;ref name=Schub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Bybee, [http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2010/01/15WCFocus.pdf "A Well-Specific Approach to the Quantification of Well Control"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2010/01/15, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental concepts and terminology==
[[Pressure]] is a very important concept in the oil and gas industry. Pressure can be defined as: the force exerted per unit area. Its [[International System of Units|SI]] unit is [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per square metre or [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]. Another unit, [[Bar (unit)|bar]], is also widely used as a measure of pressure, with 1&amp;nbsp;bar equal to 100&amp;nbsp;kilopascals. Normally pressure is measured in the U.S. petroleum industry in units of [[Pounds per square inch|pounds force per square inch]] of area, or psi. 1000 &amp;nbsp;psi equals 6894.76&amp;nbsp;kilo-pascals.

===Hydrostatic pressure===
[[Fluid statics#Hydrostatic pressure|Hydrostatic pressure]] (HSP), as stated, is defined as pressure due to a column of fluid that is not moving. That is, a column of fluid that is static, or at rest, exerts pressure due to local force of gravity on the column of the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/hydrostatic-pressure.html "Hydrostatic Pressure"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''. Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for calculating hydrostatic pressure in SI units ([[newtons|N]]/[[square meter|m²]]) is:

: Hydrostatic pressure = Height (m) × Density (kg/m³) × Gravity (m/s²).&lt;ref&gt;Micheal Nelkon &amp; Philip Parker, ''Advanced Level Physics'', 7th Edition, New Delhi, India, CBS Publishers, 1995, pp. 103–105, {{ISBN|81-239-0400-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All fluids in a [[wellbore]] exert hydrostatic pressure, which is a function of [[density]] and vertical height of the fluid column. In US oil field units, hydrostatic pressure can be expressed as:

: ''HSP'' = 0.052 × ''MW'' × ''TVD''', where '''MW''' ([[Mud weight|'''M'''ud '''W'''eight or density]]) is the drilling-fluid density in pounds per gallon (ppg), '''TVD''' is the [[true vertical depth]] in feet and '''HSP''' is the hydrostatic pressure in psi.
The 0.052 is needed as the conversion factor to psi unit of HSP.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=hydrostatic%20pressure "Hydrostatic pressure"], "Schlumberger OilField Glossary". Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

To convert these units to SI units, one can use:

*1 ppg = ≈ {{val|119.8264273|u=kg/m³}}
*1&amp;nbsp;ft = 0.3048 metres
*1 psi = 0.0689475729 bar
*1 bar = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pascals
*1bar= 15 psi

===Pressure gradient===
The [[pressure gradient]] is described as the pressure per unit length. Often in oil well control, pressure exerted by fluid is expressed in terms of its pressure gradient. The SI unit is pascals/metre. The hydrostatic pressure gradient can be written as:

: Pressure gradient (psi/ft) = HSP/TVD = 0.052 × MW (ppg).&lt;ref name="Jerome Jacob Schubert 1995"&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p. '''1'''-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation pressure===
Formation pressure is the pressure exerted by the [[formation fluid]]s, which are the liquids and gases contained in the geologic formations encountered while drilling for oil or gas. It can also be said to be the pressure contained within the pores of the formation or reservoir being drilled. Formation pressure is a result of the hydrostatic pressure of the formation fluids, above the depth of interest, together with pressure trapped in the formation. Under formation pressure, there are 3 levels:
normally pressured formation,
abnormal formation pressure, or
subnormal formation pressure.

;Normally pressured formation
Normally pressured formation has a formation pressure that is the same with the hydrostatic pressure of the fluids above it. As the fluids above the formation are usually some form of water, this pressure can be defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level.

The normal hydrostatic pressure gradient for freshwater is 0.433&amp;nbsp;pounds per square inch per foot (psi/ft), or 9.792 kilopascals per meter (kPa/m), and 0.465&amp;nbsp;psi/ft for water with dissolved solids like in Gulf Coast waters, or 10.516&amp;nbsp;kPa/m. The density of formation water in saline or marine environments, such as along the Gulf Coast, is about 9.0&amp;nbsp;[[Pressure#pounds per gallon|ppg]] or 1078.43&amp;nbsp;kg/m³. Since this is the highest for both Gulf Coast water and fresh water, a normally pressured formation can be controlled with a 9.0&amp;nbsp;ppg mud.

Sometimes the weight of the overburden, which refers to the rocks and fluids above the formation, will tend to compact the formation, resulting in pressure built-up within the formation if the fluids are trapped in place. The formation in this case will retain its normal pressure only if there is a communication with the surface. Otherwise, an ''abnormal formation pressure'' will result.

;Abnormal formation pressure
As discussed above, once the fluids are trapped within the formation and not allow to escape there is a pressure build-up leading to abnormally high formation pressures. This will generally require a mud weight of greater than 9.0&amp;nbsp;ppg to control. Excess pressure, called "overpressure" or "geopressure", can cause a well to blow out or become uncontrollable during drilling.

;Subnormal formation pressure
Subnormal formation pressure is a formation pressure that is less than the normal pressure for the given depth. It is common in formations that had undergone production of original hydrocarbon or formation fluid in them.&lt;ref name="Jerome Jacob Schubert 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=abnormal%20pressure "Abnormal Pressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=underpressure "UnderPressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=normal%20pressure "Normal Pressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overburden pressure===
''Overburden pressure'' is the pressure exerted by the weight of the rocks and contained fluids above the zone of interest. Overburden pressure varies in different regions and formations. It is the force that tends to compact a formation vertically. The density of these usual ranges of rocks is about 18 to 22&amp;nbsp;ppg (2,157 to 2,636&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). This range of densities will generate an overburden pressure gradient of about 1&amp;nbsp;psi/ft (22.7&amp;nbsp;kPa/m). Usually, the 1&amp;nbsp;psi/ft is not applicable for shallow marine sediments or massive salt. In offshore however, there is a lighter column of sea water, and the column of underwater rock does not go all the way to the surface. Therefore, a lower overburden pressure is usually generated at an offshore depth, than would be found at the same depth on land.

Mathematically, overburden pressure can be derived as:

: &lt;big&gt;S = ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;× D&lt;/big&gt;×g

where
:g = acceleration due to gravity

: &lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt; = overburden pressure

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = average formation bulk density

: &lt;big&gt;D&lt;/big&gt; = vertical thickness of the overlying sediments

The bulk density of the sediment is a function of rock matrix density, porosity within the confines of the pore spaces, and porefluid density. This can be expressed as

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = φρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; + (1 – φ)ρ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where

: &lt;big&gt;φ&lt;/big&gt; = rock porosity

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = formation fluid density

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = rock matrix density&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp. '''1'''-3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; Schubert, Jerome; Haghshenas, Arash; Paknejad, Amir Saman; Hughes, Jim (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling''. Gulf Publishing Company.

===Fracture pressure===
''Fracture pressure'' can be defined as pressure required to cause a formation to fail or split. As the name implies, it is the pressure that causes the formation to fracture and the circulating fluid to be lost. Fracture pressure is usually expressed as a gradient, with the common units being psi/ft (kPa/m) or ppg (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

To fracture a formation, three things are generally needed, which are:

# Pump into the formation. This will require a pressure in the wellbore greater than formation pressure.
# The pressure in the wellbore must also exceed the rock matrix strength.
# And finally the wellbore pressure must be greater than one of the three principal stresses in the formation.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p. '''1'''-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; ''et al''. (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling'', p.23, section 1.8.1 (online version).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pump pressure (system pressure losses)===
''Pump pressure'', which is also referred to as ''system pressure loss'', is the sum total of all the pressure losses from the oil well surface equipment, the [[drill pipe]], the [[drill collar]], the [[drill bit]], and [[Annulus (oil well)|annular]] friction losses around the drill collar and drill pipe. It measures the system pressure loss at the start of the circulating system and measures the total friction pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-4, 5, 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slow pump pressure (SPP)===
''Slow pump pressure'' is the circulating pressure (pressure used to pump fluid through the whole active fluid system, including the borehole and all the surface tanks that constitute the primary system during drilling) at a reduced rate. SPP is very important during a well kill operation in which circulation (a process in which drilling fluid is circulated out of the suction pit, down the drill pipe and drill collars, out the bit, up the annulus, and back to the pits while drilling proceeds) is done at a reduced rate to allow better control of circulating pressures and to enable the mud properties (density and viscosity) to be kept at desired values. The slow pump pressure can also be referred to as "kill rate pressure" or "slow circulating pressure" or "kill speed pressure" and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/circulate.html "Circulate"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''. Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=circulate "Circulate"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shut-in drill pipe pressure===
''Shut-in drill pipe pressure'' (SIDPP), which is recorded when a well is shut in on a kick, is a measure of the difference between the pressure at the bottom of the hole and the hydrostatic pressure (HSP) in the drillpipe. During a well shut-in, the pressure of the wellbore stabilizes, and the formation pressure equals the pressure at the bottom of the hole. The drillpipe at this time should be full of known-density fluid. Therefore, the formation pressure can be easily calculated using the SIDPP. This means that the SIDPP gives a direct of formation pressure during a kick.

===Shut-in casing pressure (SICP)===
The ''shut-in casing pressure'' (SICP) is a measure of the difference between the formation pressure and the HSP in the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] when a kick occurs.

The pressures encountered in the annulus can be estimated using the following mathematical equation:

: FP = HSP&lt;sub&gt;mud&lt;/sub&gt; + HSP&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt; + SICP

where

: FP = formation pressure (psi)

: HSP&lt;sub&gt;mud&lt;/sub&gt; = Hydrostatic pressure of the mud in the annulus (psi)

: HSP&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt; = Hydrostatic pressure of the influx (psi)

: SICP = shut-in casing pressure (psi)

===Bottom-hole pressure (BHP)===
''Bottom-hole pressure'' (BHP) is the pressure at the bottom of a well. The pressure is usually measured at the bottom of the hole. This pressure may be calculated in a static, fluid-filled wellbore with the equation:

: BHP = D × ρ × C,

where

: BHP = bottom-hole pressure
: D =  the vertical depth of the well
: ρ = density
: C = units conversion factor
: (or, in the English system, BHP = D × MWD × 0.052).
In Canada the formula is depth in meters x density in kgs x the constant gravity factor (0.00981), which will give the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the well bore or (hp) hp=bhp with pumps off.
The bottom-hole pressure is dependent on the following:
*Hydrostatic pressure (HSP)
*Shut-in surface pressure (SIP)
*Friction pressure
*Surge pressure (occurs when transient pressure increases the bottom-hole pressure)
*Swab pressure (occurs when transient pressure reduces the bottom-hole pressure)
Therefore, BHP can be said to be the sum of all pressures at the bottom of the wellhole, which equals:

: BHP = HSP + SIP + friction + Surge - swab&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-8, 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; ''et al.'' (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling'', p.11, section 1.4.1 (online version).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic calculations in oil well control==
There are some basic calculations that need to be carried during oil well control. A few of these essential calculations will be discussed below. Most of the units here are in US oil field units, but these units can be converted to their SI units equivalent by using this [[Conversion of units]] link.

===Capacity===
The capacity of [[drill string]] is an essential issue in oil well control. The capacity of drillpipe, drill collars or hole is the volume of fluid that can be contained within them.

The capacity formula is as shown below:

: ''Capacity'' = ID&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1029.4

where

: Capacity =  Volume in barrels per foot(bbl/ft)
: ID = Inside diameter in inches
: 1029.4  = Units conversion factor

Also the total pipe or hole volume is given by :

: ''Volume in barrels'' (bbls) = ''Capacity'' (bbl/ft) × length (ft)

Feet of pipe occupied by a given volume is given by:

: ''Feet of pipe'' (ft) = ''Volume of mud'' (bbls) / ''Capacity'' (bbls/ft)

Capacity calculation is important in oil well control due to the following:
*Volume of the drillpipe and the drill collars must be pumped to get kill weight mud to the bit during kill operation.
*It is used to spot pills and plugs at various depths in the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p.2-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annular capacity===
This is the volume contained between the inside diameter of the hole and the outside diameter of the pipe.
Annular capacity is given by :

: ''Annular capacity'' (bbl/ft) = (ID&lt;sub&gt;hole&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - OD&lt;sub&gt;pipe&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / 1029.4

where

: ID&lt;sub&gt;hole&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Inside diameter of the casing or open hole in inches

: OD&lt;sub&gt;pipe&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Outside diameter of the pipe in inches

Similarly

: ''Annular volume'' (bbls) = ''Annular capacity'' (bbl/ft) × length (ft)

and
    
: ''Feet occupied by volume of mud in annulus''  = ''Volume of mud'' (bbls) / ''Annular Capacity'' (bbls/ft).&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''2'''-1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluid level drop===
''Fluid level drop'' is the distance the mud level will drop when a dry string(a bit that is not plugged) is being pulled from the wellbore and it is given by:

: ''Fluid level drop'' = Bbl disp / (CSG cap + Pipe disp)

or

: ''Fluid level drop'' = Bbl disp / (Ann cap + Pipe cap)

and the resulting loss of HSP is given by:

: ''Lost HSP'' = 0.052 × MW × ''Fluid drop''

where

: ''Fluid drop'' = distance the fluid falls (ft)

: ''Bbl disp'' = displacement of the pulled pipe (bbl)

: ''CSG cap''  = casing capacity (bbl/ft)

: ''Pipe disp'' = pipe displacement (bbl/ft)

: ''Ann cap'' = Annular capacity between casing and pipe (bbl/ft)

: ''Pipe cap'' = pipe capacity

: ''Lost HSP'' = Lost hydrostatic pressure (psi)

: ''MW'' =  mud weight (ppg)

When pulling a wet string (the bit is plugged) and the fluid from the drillpipe is not returned to the hole. The fluid drop is then changed to the following:

: ''Fluid level drop'' = ''Bbl disp'' / ''Ann cap''

===Kill Mud weight (KMW)===
''Kill Mud weight''  is the density of the mud required to balance formation pressure during kill operation. The Kill Weight Mud can be calculated by:

: ''KWM =  SIDPP/(0.052 × TVD) + OWM''

where

: ''KWM'' = kill weight mud (ppg)

: ''SIDPP'' = shut-in drillpipe pressure (psi)

: ''TVD'' &amp;nbsp; = true vertical depth (ft)

: ''OWM'' &amp;nbsp; = original weight mud (ppg)

But when the formation pressure can be determined from data sources such as bottom hole pressure, then ''KWM'' can be calculated as follows:

: ''KWM'' = ''FP'' / 0.052 × ''TVD''

where ''FP'' = Formation pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''2'''-4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kicks==
[[File:IXTOC I oil well blowout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|[[Ixtoc I]] oil well blowout]]
'''Kick''' is the entry of [[formation fluid]] into the wellbore during drilling operations. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of [[drilling fluid]] is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. The whole essence of oil well control is to prevent kick from occurring and if it happens to prevent it from developing into [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]. An uncontrolled kick usually results from not deploying the proper equipment, using poor practices, or a lack of training of the rig crews. Loss of oil well control may lead into blowout, which represents one of the most severe threats associated with the exploration of petroleum resources involving the risk of lives and environmental and economic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=kick "Kick"],''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/50495081/Basic-Well-Control "Basic Well Control"], Scribd site. Accessed 10/04/2011, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of kicks===
{{main|Causes of kicks}}
A kick will occur when the bottom hole pressure(BHP) of a well falls below the formation pressure and the formation fluid flows into the wellbore.There are usually causes for kicks some of which are:
*[[#Failure to keep the hole full during a trip|Failure to keep the hole full during a trip]]
*[[#Swabbing while tripping|Swabbing while tripping]]
*[[#Lost circulation|Lost circulation]]
*[[#Insufficient density of fluid|Insufficient density of fluid]]
*[[#Abnormal pressure|Abnormal pressure]]
*[[#Drilling into an adjacent well|Drilling into an adjacent well]]
*[[#Lost control during drill stem test|Lost control during drill stem test]]
*[[#Improper fill on trips|Improper fill on trips]]

====Failure to keep the hole full during a trip====
''Tripping'' is the complete operation of removing the [[Drill string|drillstring]] from the wellbore and running it back in the hole. This operation is typically undertaken when the bit (which is the tool used to crush or cut rock during drilling) becomes dull or broken, and no longer drills the rock efficiently. A typical drilling operation of deep oil or gas wells may require up to 8 or more trips of the drill string to replace a dull rotary bit for one well.

Tripping out of the hole means that the entire volume of steel (of drillstring) is being removed, or has been removed, from the well. This displacement of the drill string (the steel) will leave out a volume of space that must be replaced with an equal volume of [[Drilling mud|mud]]. If the replacement is not done, the fluid level in the wellbore will drop, resulting in a loss of hydrostatic pressure (HSP) and bottom hole pressure (BHP). If this bottom hole pressure reduction goes below the [[#Formation pressure|formation pressure]], a [[#Kicks|kick]] will definitely occur.

====Swabbing while tripping====
''Swabbing'' occurs when bottom hole pressure is reduced due to the effects of pulling the [[drill string]] upward in the bored hole. During the tripping out of the hole, the space formed by the [[Drill pipe|drillpipe]], [[drill collar]], or tubing (which are being removed) must be replaced by something, usually [[Drilling mud|mud]]. If the rate of tripping out is greater than the rate the mud is being pumped into the void space (created by the removal of the drill string), then swab will occur. If the reduction in bottom hole pressure caused by swabbing is below [[#Formation pressure|formation pressure]], then a [[#Kicks|kick]] will occur.

====Lost circulation====
''Lost circulation'' usually occurs when the hydrostatic pressure fractures an open formation. When this occurs, there is loss in circulation, and the height of the fluid column decreases, leading to lower [[#Hydrostatic pressure|HSP]] in the [[Well bore|wellbore]]. A kick can occur if steps are not taken to keep the hole full. Lost circulation can be caused by:
*excessive mud weights
*excessive annular friction loss
*excessive surge pressure during trips, or "spudding" the bit
*excessive shut-in pressures.

====Insufficient density of fluid====
If the density of the drilling fluid or [[Drilling mud|mud]]  in the well bore is not sufficient to keep the formation pressure in check, then a kick can occur. Insufficient density of the drilling fluid can be as a result of the following :
* attempting to drill by using an underbalanced weight solution
*excessive dilution of the mud
*heavy rains in the pits
*barite settling in the pits
*spotting low density pills in the well.

====Abnormal pressure====
Another cause of kicks is drilling accidentally into [[#Abnormal Formation pressure|abnormally-pressured]] permeable zones. The increased formation pressure may be greater than the bottom hole pressure, resulting in a kick.

====Drilling into an adjacent well====
Drilling into an adjacent well is a potential problem, particularly in [[offshore drilling]] where a
large number of directional wells are drilled from the same [[Oil platform|platform]]. If the drilling well penetrates the [[production string]] of a previously completed well, the formation fluid from the completed well will enter the wellbore of the drilling well, causing a kick. If this occurs at a shallow depth, it is an extremely dangerous situation and could easily result in an uncontrolled blowout with little to no warning of the event.

====Lost control during drill stem test====
A drill-stem test is performed by setting a packer above the formation to be tested, and allowing the formation to flow. During the course of the test, the bore hole or casing below the packer, and at least a portion of the drill pipe or tubing, is filled with formation fluid. At the conclusion of the test, this fluid must be removed by proper well control techniques to return the well to a safe condition. Failure to follow the correct procedures to kill the well could lead to a blowout.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''3'''-1, 2, 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control", pp.19/20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, William C.; Plisga, Gary J. (2005). ''Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering'', pp.39-41, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Improper fill on trips====
Improper fill on trip occurs when the volume of drilling fluid to keep the hole full on a Trip (complete operation of removing the [[Drill string|drillstring]] from the wellbore and running it back in the hole) is less than that calculated or less than Trip Book Record. This condition is usually caused by formation fluid entering the wellbore due to the swabbing action of the drill string, and, if action is not taken soon, the well will enter a kick state.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''4'''-1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace, Robert D.

===Kick warning signs===
[[Image:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Deepwater Horizon explosion|Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout]], 21 April 2010]]
In oil well control, a kick should be able to be detected promptly, and if a kick is detected, proper kick prevention operations must be taken immediately to avoid a blowout. There are various tell-tale signs that signal an alert crew that a kick is about to start. Knowing these signs will keep a kicking oil well under control, and avoid a blowout:

====Sudden increase in drilling rate====
A sudden increase in penetration rate (drilling break) is usually caused by a change in the type of formation being drilled. However, it may also signal an increase in formation pore pressure, which may indicate a possible kick.

====Increase in annulus flow rate====
If the rate at which the pumps are running is held constant, then the flow from the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] should be constant. If the annulus flow increases without a corresponding change in pumping rate, the additional flow is caused by formation fluid(s) feeding into the [[well bore]] or gas expansion. This will indicate an impending kick.

====Gain in pit volume====
If there is an unexplained increase in the volume of surface mud in the pit (a large tank that holds drilling fluid on the rig), it could signify an impending kick. This is because as the formation fluid feeds into the wellbore, it causes more [[drilling fluid]] to flow from the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] than is pumped down the [[drill string]], thus the volume of fluid in the pit(s) increases.

====Change in pump speed/pressure====
A decrease in pump pressure or increase in pump speed can happen as a result of a decrease in [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the annulus as the formation fluids enters the wellbore. As the lighter formation fluid flows into the wellbore, the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the annular column of fluid decreases, and the drilling fluid in the drill pipe tends to U-tube into the annulus. When this occurs, the pump pressure will drop, and the pump speed will increase. The lower pump pressure and increase in pump speed symptoms can also be indicative of a hole in the drill string, commonly referred to as a washout. Until a confirmation can be made whether a washout or a well kick has occurred, a kick should be assumed.

==Categories of oil well control==
There are basically three types of oil well control which are:
primary oil well control,
secondary oil well control, and 
tertiary oil well control. Those types are explained below.

===Primary Oil Well Control===
Primary oil well control is the process which maintains a hydrostatic pressure in the
wellbore greater than the pressure of the fluids in the formation being drilled, but less than formation fracture pressure. It uses the [[Drilling mud|mud]] weight to provide sufficient pressure to prevent an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore. If hydrostatic pressure is less than formation pressure, then formation fluids will enter the wellbore. If the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in the wellbore exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation, then the fluid in the well could be lost. In an extreme case of lost circulation, the formation pressure may exceed hydrostatic pressure, allowing formation fluids to enter into the well.

===Secondary Oil Well Control===
Secondary oil well control is done after the Primary oil well control has failed to prevent formation fluids from entering the wellbore. This process uses [[Blowout Preventer|“blow out preventer”]], a BOP, to prevent the escape of wellbore fluids from the well. As the rams and choke of the BOP remain closed, a pressure built up test is carried out and a kill mud weight calculated and pumped inside the well to kill the kick and circulate it out.

===Tertiary (or shearing) Oil Well Control===
Tertiary oil well control describes the third line of defense, where the formation cannot be controlled by primary or secondary well control (hydrostatic and equipment). This happens in underground blowout situations. The following are examples of tertiary well control:

*Drill a [[relief well]] to hit an adjacent well that is flowing and kill the well with heavy mud
*Rapid pumping of heavy mud to control the well with equivalent circulating density
*Pump barite or heavy weighting agents to plug the wellbore in order to stop flowing
*Pump cement to plug the wellbore&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control", p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jetj"&gt;Rachain Jetjongjit, [http://www.drillingformulas.com/what-is-tertiary-well-control/ "What is Tertiary well control"], DrillingFormulas.com, Drilling Formulas and Drilling Calculations.

Accessed 2011-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shut-in procedures==
Using shut-in procedures is one of the oil-well-control measures to curtail kicks and prevent a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] from occurring. Shut-in procedures are specific procedures for closing a well in case of a kick. When any positive indication of a kick is observed, such as a sudden increase in flow, or an increase in pit level, then the well should be shut-in immediately. If a well shut-in is not done promptly, a blowout is likely to happen.

Shut-in procedures are usually developed and practiced for every rig activity, such as drilling, tripping, logging, running tubular, performing a drill stem test, and so on. The primary purpose of a specific shut-in procedure is to minimize kick volume entering into a wellbore when a kick occurs, regardless of what phase of rig activity is occurring. However, a shut-in procedure is a company-specific procedure, and the policy of a company will dictate how a well should be shut-in.

They are generally two type of Shut-in procedures which are soft shut-in or hard shut-in. Of these two methods, the hard shut-in is the fastest method to shut in the well; therefore, it will minimize the volume of kick allowed into the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p.'''5'''-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Well kill procedures==
Source: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil well drilling engineering|last=Rabia|first=Hussain|publisher=Springer|year=1986|isbn=0860106616|location=|pages=302–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A well kill procedure is an oil well control method. Once the well has been [[#Shut-in procedures|shut-in]] on a [[#Kicks|kick]], proper kill procedures must be done immediately. The general idea in well kill procedure is to circulate out any formation fluid already in the [[wellbore]] during kick, and then circulate a satisfactory weight of kill mud called Kill Weight Mud (KWM) into the well without allowing further fluid into the hole. If this can be done, then once the kill mud has been fully circulated around the well, it is possible to open up the well and restart normal operations. Generally, a kill weight mud (KWM) mix, which provides just hydrostatic balance for formation pressure, is circulated. This allows approximately constant bottom hole pressure, which is slightly greater than formation pressure to be maintained, as the kill circulation proceeds because of the additional small circulating friction pressure loss. After circulation, the well is opened up again.

The major well kill procedures used in oil well control are listed below:
*Wait and Weight
*Driller method
*Circulate and Weight
*Concurrent Method
*Reverse Circulation
*Dynamic Kill procedure
*Bullheading
*Volumetric Method
*Lubricate and Bleed&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''6'''-1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control". pp.37/38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil well control incidents - root causes==
[[Image:Oil well burning in Bibi Eibat.JPG|thumb|1904 [[oil well fire]] at [[Bibiheybət|Bibi-Eibat]] (near [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]).]]
There will always be potential oil well control problems, as long as there are drilling operations anywhere in the world. Most of these well control problems are as a result of some errors and can be eliminated, even though some are actually unavoidable. Since we know the consequences of failed well control are severe, efforts should be made to prevent some human errors which are the root causes of these incidents. These causes include:

*Lack of knowledge and skills of [[Drilling rig|rig]] personnel
*Improper work practices
*Lack of understanding of oil well control training
*Lack of application of policies, procedures, and standards
*Inadequate risk management&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM training material, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/50495081/Basic-Well-Control "Basic Well Control"], Scribd site. Accessed 10/04/2011, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations for building well-control culture==
An effective oil-well-control culture can be established within a company by requiring well control training of all rig workers, by assessing well control competence at the rigsite, and by supporting qualified personnel in carrying out safe well control practices during the drilling process. Such a culture also requires personnel involved in oil well control to commit to following the right procedures at the right time. Clearly communicated policies and procedures, credible training, competence assurance, and management support can minimize and mitigate well control incidents. An effective well control culture is built upon technically competent personnel who are also trained and skilled in crew resource management (a discipline within human factors), which comprises situation awareness, decision-making (problem-solving), communication, teamwork, and leadership. Training programs are developed and accredited by organizations such as the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) and International Well Control Forum (IWCF).

[http://www.iadc.org IADC], headquartered in Houston, TX, is a nonprofit industry association that accredits well control training through a program called WellSharp, which is aimed at providing the necessary knowledge and practical skills critical to successful well control. This training comprises drilling and well servicing activities, as well as course levels applicable to everyone involved in supporting or conducting drilling operations--from the office support staff to the floorhands and drillers and up to the most-experienced supervisory personnel. Training such as those included in the WellSharp program and the courses offered by IWCF contribute to the competence of personnel, but true competence can be assessed only at the jobsite during operations. Therefore, IADC also accredits industry competence assurance programs to help ensure quality and consistency of the competence assurance process for drilling operations. IADC has regional offices all over the world and accredits companies worldwide. [http://www.iwcf.org/ IWCF] is an [[non-governmental organization|NGO]], headquartered in Europe, whose main aim is to develop and administer well-control certification programs for personnel employed in oil-well drilling and for workover and well-intervention operations.&lt;ref&gt;Kareen Bybee, [http://www.spe.org/spe-site/spe/spe/jpt/2009/01/16WCFocus.pdf "Building a Well-Control Culture"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2009/01/16, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IADC, [http://www.iadc.org/wellsharp/ "WellSharp"], IADC.org, International Association of Drilling Contractors Well-Control Accreditation Program.

}} __NOTOC__
'''Papilionaceous flowers''' (from [[Latin]]: ''papilion'', a butterfly) are flowers with the characteristic [[zygomorphic|irregular]] and butterfly-like corolla found in many, though not all, plants of the species-rich [[Faboideae]] subfamily of [[Fabaceae|legumes]]. [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]] suggested that the term ''Flores papilionacei'' originated with [[Valerius Cordus]],&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; who applied it to the flowers of the [[Phaseolus vulgaris|bean]].&lt;ref name=cordus&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordus|first1=Valerius |title=Historia Stirpium et Sylva |chapter=162 |date=1561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
===Corolla===
The flowers have a [[Floral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]] with the [[corolla (botany)|corolla]] consisting of five [[petal]]s. A single, large, upper petal is known as the banner (also vexillum or standard petal). The semi-cylindrical base of the banner embraces and compresses two equal and smaller lateral wings (or alae). The wings in turn enclose a pair of small [[keel]] [[petal]]s, that are situated somewhat lower than the wings, but are interior to them.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; They have concave sides and correspond with the shape of the wings. The two keel petals are fused at their bases&lt;ref name=reddy/&gt; or stuck together&lt;ref name=nswfs&gt;{{cite web |title=Botanical term: papilionaceous |url=http://www.nswildflora.ca/glossary/papilionaceous.html |website=nswildflora.ca |publisher=Nova Scotia Wild Flora Society |date=2007 | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form a boat-shaped structure that encloses the essential flower organs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=P.K. |title=Genetics: classical to modern |date=2007 |publisher=Rastogi Publications |location=Meerut, India |isbn=8171338968 |pages=146–147 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[androecium]] and [[gynoecium]]. Typically these flowers have a vexillary (i.e. descendingly imbricate or overlapping) [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivation]].&lt;ref name=reddy&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reddy |first1=S. M. |title=University Botany III: (Plant Taxonomy, Plant Embryology, Plant Physiology) |volume = 3 |date=2007 |publisher=New Age International |isbn=9788122415476 |pages=60–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stamens===
The stamens often have a diadelphous morphology, meaning that they are united in two sets with a distinct filament shape in each set.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; The inferior set forms a membranous sheath at its base, that envelops the single, superior [[pistil]] in a tube. The tube divides into nine filaments, which trace the base of the keel petals that enclose them.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; The single free filament lies above them. In ''[[Smithia]]'' the two sets are equal, with 5 stamens in each.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

Many papilionaceous flowers however have ten distinct stamens. Genera that conform to the latter morphology include ''[[Sophora]]'', ''[[Anagyris]]'', ''[[Cercis]]'', ''[[Daviesia]]'', ''[[Dillwynia]]'', ''[[Gompholobium]]'', ''[[Mirbelia]]'' and ''[[Pultenaea]]''.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] observed that the fertility of plants with papilionaceous flowers depend to an important extent on visits by bees,&lt;ref name=darw&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life | chapter = IV: On the advantage |date=2007 |publisher=Cosimo Classics |location=New York |isbn=1602061440 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is accepted that this corolla structure evolved under selective pressure of bee pollinators.&lt;ref name=swj&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aronne |first1=Giovanna |last2=Giovanetti |first2=Manuela |last3=De Micco |first3=Veronica |title=Morphofunctional Traits and Pollination Mechanisms of Coronilla emerus L.

Four different mechanisms of pollen release are known in papilionaceous flowers, which are respectively known as the explosive, valvular, piston and brush mechanisms.&lt;ref name=swj/&gt; In the explosive or tripping mechanism (''cf.'' [[Medicago sativa|alfalfa]], [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]], [[Mucuna|ox-eye bean]]&lt;ref name=mos&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mosquin |first1=Ted |title=The explosive pollination mechanism in Cornus canadensis L. |url=http://www.ou.edu/cas/botany-micro/ben/ben194.html |website=Botanical Electronic News |publisher=The Canadian Field-Naturalist, Volume 99, Number I, Jan.-Mar. 1985 |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) all pollen is instantly released when pressure on the staminal column is permanently released (usually by an insect) causing it to snap against the standard petal. In the valvular mechanism pollen is released repeatedly when pollinators unseal the upper rim of the keel petals, and force them downwards. In the piston mechanism (''cf.'' [[Hippocrepis emerus|scorpion senna]]&lt;ref name=swj/&gt;) pollen is released repeatedly when the keel tip is moved by an insect so as to release pollen through a hole in the tip. The brush mechanism employs a pistil which is longer than the stamens, so as to avoid self-pollination. When a pollinator presses against the standard and wing petals, a brush on the temporarily lifted pistil brushes pollen onto the pollinator, while the stigma receives external pollen.&lt;ref name=swj/&gt;

==Examples and exceptions==
Well-known plant genera in the Faboideae which exhibit this corolla morphology include  [[Phaseolus|beans]], [[Pisum|peas]], [[Lathyrus|sweet peas]], [[alfalfa]] (lucerne), [[Trifolium|clovers]], [[Lupinus|lupines]], [[Dalea|smoke trees]], [[Robinia|black locust]]s, [[Astragalus|locoweed]]s and [[Erythrina|coral trees]].&lt;ref name=ww1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Armstrong |first1=W.

The [[Amorpha|false indigo]] genus, though belonging to the Faboideae, does not exhibit a papilionaceous corolla morphology, as it has only one petal per flower,&lt;ref name=aquatic&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wooten |first1=Robert K.

==Other legume subfamilies==
To the contrary, plants in the [[Mimosoideae]] subfamily of legumes have the petals reduced, and have numerous stamens arranged in showy spikes. In the [[Caesalpinioideae]] subfamily of legumes the upper petal is initially enveloped by the lateral petals, before the petals unfold to assume a radial five-fold symmetry.&lt;ref name=ww1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13755">'''Phytosociology''' is the branch of science which deals with [[plant communities]], their composition and development, and the relationships between the [[species]] within them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; A phytosociological system is a system for classifying these communities. 

== History ==
Rooted in [[phytogeography]] and as such considered sometimes a field of [[geobotany]], phytosociology emerged simultaneously in Poland ([[Józef Paczoski|Paczoski]]), France ([[Josias Braun-Blanquet|Braun-Blanquet]]) and Sweden (Du Rietz), but hardly penetrated in Anglo-Saxon world, where prevailed the [[Community_(ecology)#Individualistic_theory|continuum concept of community]], opposed to the concept of [[plant association]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Decocq, G. (2016). Moving from Patterns to Processes: A Challenge for the Phytosociology of the Twenty-First Century? In: Box, E. O. (Ed.). ''Vegetation Structure and Function at Multiple Spatial, Temporal and Conceptual Scales''. Springer. pp. 407-424, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LwHNCwAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "phytosociology" was coined in 1896 by Paczoski.&lt;ref&gt;Rabotnov TA. 1970-1979. Phytocoenology. In: The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd ed. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Phytocoenology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The aim of phytosociology is to achieve a sufficient empirical model of [[vegetation]] using [[plant]] ''[[taxa]]'' combinations that characterize univocally vegetation units. Vegetation units as understood by phytosociologists may express largely abstract vegetation concepts (e.g. the set of all hard-leaved [[evergreen forest]]s of western [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] area) or actual readily recognizable vegetation types (e.g. cork-oak oceanic forests on [[Pleistocene]] dunes with dense canopy in SW-[[Iberian Peninsula]]). Such conceptual units are called "syntaxa" (singular "syntaxon") and can be set in a hierarchy system called "synsystem" or syntaxonomic system. The act of creation, amelioration or adjusting the synsystem is called "syntaxonomy". Therefore, the syntaxonomic system is putatively a sufficient empirical representation of vegetation of a given territory. An ''International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iavs.org/Resources/Classification/International-Code-of-Phytosociological-Nomenclatu.aspx |title=The International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt;, issuing the rules for naming "syntaxa" exists and its use has increased among vegetation scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weber |first1=H E |last2=Moravec |first2=J |last3=Theurillat |first3=J-P |date=Oct 2000 |title=International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature |journal=Journal of Vegetation Science |volume=11 | issue=5| pages=739–768|jstor=3236580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association model==
The basic unit of syntaxonomy is the "[[Association (ecology)|association]]", defined by its characteristic combination of plant taxa, [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] features, physiognomy, biogeographical area, role in ecological succession, historical (e.g. history of use by humans) and paleo-biogeographical relationships. The association is sometimes viewed as a concrete phytocoenosis (the plant component of a [[biocoenosis]]). Associations with floristic and territorial affinities{{what?|reason=what does that mean?|date=December 2016}} can be grouped in larger ecological conceptual units (i.e. syntaxa) called "alliances". Similar alliances may be grouped in "orders" and orders in vegetation "classes". The setting of syntaxa in such a hierarchy makes up the syntaxonomical system, or the reference model of the given vegetation and territory.

This science began with [[Charles Flahault]] and continued in earnest with the work of [[Josias Braun-Blanquet]] (1884–1980).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

==Vegetation complexes==
Nowadays, phytosociologists try to include higher levels of complexity in the perception of vegetation, namely by describing whole successional units (vegetation series) or, in general, vegetation complexes. These lie in the scope of Landscape Phytosociology. Other developments include the use of [[multivariate statistics]] for the definition of "syntaxa" and their environmental interpretation.

On the one hand, some authors consider phytosociology to be in the scope of contemporary vegetation science, a successful approach because of its highly descriptive and predictive powers, and its usefulness in nature management issues. On the other hand, there are numerous critics who have focused on several methodological limitations: the absence of statistical approaches, the complexity and non-stability of the nomenclatural system, the mistakes in the predictive models, and certain basic assumptions.

==Habitat-type classification==
Even if in continental Europe, a complete synsystem describing vegetation types has been developed and it is a basis for habitat-type classification (e.g. NATURA 2000 typology and habitat network), there are numerous scientific experts who do not have a positive opinion about the suitability for phytosociology to be the main [[geobotany|geobotanical]] approach for managing vegetation systems. An important point of disagreement is the floristic-phytosociological assumption that the forest patches of the Mediterranean species of pines mainly derived from afforestations, non-stables and incidentals.

==Data collections==
Phytosociological data contain information collected in relevés (or plots) listing each species cover-abundance values and the measured environmental variables. This data is conveniently databanked in a program like TURBOVEG&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hennekens | first1 = SM | last2 = Schaminée | first2 = JHJ | year = 2001 | title = TURBOVEG, a comprehensive data base management system for vegetation data | url = | journal = Journal of Vegetation Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 589–591 | doi=10.2307/3237010| jstor = 3237010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for editing, storage and export to other applications.

Data is usually classified and sorted using TWINSPAN&lt;ref&gt;Hill MO (1979) TWINSPAN: A FORTRAN Programme for arranging multivariate data in an ordered two-way table by classification of the individuals and attributes. Ecology and Systematics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; in host programs like [[JUICE (software)|JUICE]] to create realistic species-relevé associations. Further patterns are investigated using clustering and resemblance methods, and [[Ordination (statistics)|ordination techniques]] available in software packages like CANOCO&lt;ref&gt;ter Braak CJF, Šmilauer P (2002) CANOCO Reference manual and CanoDraw for Windows User’s guide: Software for Canonical Community Ordination (version 4.5). Microcomputer Power, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[R (programming language)|R]]-package vegan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oksanen |first=J.

==History==
[[File:Eno Hall.gif|thumb|400px|left|Eno Hall (1924)]]
In 1893, fourteen years after [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded the first psychology [[laboratory]] in the world, a Psychology Laboratory was built in [[Nassau Hall]], the oldest building in the university, under the leadership of [[James Mark Baldwin|J. Mark Baldwin]]. In 1915, psychology received recognition in the title when the department was renamed Department of Philosophy and Psychology. It was not until 1920, however, that the Department of Psychology was established with Howard Warren as its first chairman.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; In 1924, Eno Hall was constructed to house the department. The building was named in honor of [[Henry Lane Eno|Henry Eno]], the principal donor and research associate in psychology. Warren was also a donor, but he chose to keep his donation anonymous at the time. He commented that it was "the first laboratory in this country, if not in the world, dedicated solely to the teaching and investigation of [[experimental psychology|scientific psychology]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcweb.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs.cgi?id=2&amp;link=http%3a%2f%2fetcweb%2eprinceton%2eedu%2f%43ampus%57%57%57%2f%43ompanion%2feno%5fhall%2ehtml&amp;file=%2fvar%2flocal%2fasweb%2fwww%2fapps%2fglimpse%2fwg2%2farchives%2f2%2f%2ecache%2f182%5f201011121511%2eabra&amp;line=8&amp;highlight=eno%7chall#mfs Eno Hall] from {{cite book|last1=Leitch|first1=Alexander|title=A Princeton Companion|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400870011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to university president [[John Grier Hibben|John Hibben]], the laboratory was the realization of a dream that Warren had cherished for a long time.

University president [[James McCosh]] was primary professor of psychology in the early days of the department.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Maier, B. N. (2004).

[[File:Green Hall2.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Green Hall (c. 1996)]]
An Office of Public Opinion Research was established when [[Hadley Cantril]] was department head:
:Already by the mid-1930s, Cantril made contact with [[George Gallup|Gallup]], who, welcoming recognition of his new methods by an academic scholar, offered the Princeton man the full use of his facilities at cost. Later, in 1940, Cantril secured a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant to set up the Office of Public Opinion Research at Princeton. The objectives of this new institute included not only learning how to measure [[public opinion]] systematically and accurately but also understanding the psychology of public opinion, "how and why it changes, what motivates large segments of the public."&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Sproule (1997) ''Propaganda and Democracy'', page 183, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-47022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office’s 1947 report ''Gauging Public Opinion'' noted the arrival of a new [[discipline (academia)|discipline]]:
:Within the past decade the field of public opinion research has been transformed from an academic hobby and commercial toy to a discipline of its own. The enormous possibilities of the sampling technique used in market research have been avidly exploited by American business. Newspaper and magazine publishers were quick to sense the news value of reports on what the nation thinks. And now responsible public officials have learned to take opinion polls seriously for their contribution to modern statecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hadley Cantril]] and associates of the Office of Public Opinion Research (1947) : [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.275054 Gauging Public Opinion], page vii, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the department relocated to Green Hall on the corner of Washington St. and William St. The building, which had been previously occupied by the School of [[Engineering]], was redesigned by university alumnus Francis W. Roudebush for the use of the psychology and [[sociology]] departments.&lt;ref name=green&gt;[http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/green_hall.html Green Hall] from {{cite book|last1=Leitch|first1=Alexander|title=A Princeton Companion|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400870011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the Princeton Psychology Colloquium Committee, which schedules weekly speeches and discussions for psychology students, invited [[Richard Herrnstein]], psychology professor at [[Harvard University]] to speak about the vision of pigeons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=245084 Herrnstein feels threatened, cancels Princeton appearance]. (1972). ''The Harvard Crimson''. Retrieved August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Herrnstein was the victim of serious criticism because he had written an article in which he argued that [[Human genetic variation|genetic differences]] would play an increasingly larger role in the determination of [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, G. M., Maher, B. A., White, S. H., &amp; Wilson, J. Q. (1998). [http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/03.12/FacultyofArtsan.html Faculty of Arts and Sciences, memorial minute]. ''The Harvard University Gazette''. Retrieved August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Princeton's University Action Group, a radical student organization, threatened to sabotage the event on the grounds that Herrnstein was a [[racist]], the Harvard professor canceled his appearance. Kamin asserted that "the climate in which [Herrnstein's] decision was made raises serious questions about [[freedom of speech]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Most of the department's graduates from the classes of 2004 to 2007 had placements in the faculties of [[research universities]] and post-doctoral positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Thanks to a group of faculty and students who work across traditional disciplines and departments, interdisciplinary research and scholarship in the department has grown significantly since the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

In December, 2013, the department relocated to the newly built Peretsman-Scully Hall, located farther down Washington Road on the southeast side of Poe Field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7722">'''Process Validation''' is the analysis of data gathered throughout the design and manufacturing of a product in order to confirm that the process can reliably output products of a determined standard. Regulatory authorities like [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] and [[FDA]] have published guidelines relating to process validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM070336.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of process validation is to ensure varied inputs lead to consistent and high quality outputs. Process validation is an ongoing process that must be frequently adapted as manufacturing feedback is gathered. End-to-end validation of production processes is essential in determining product quality because quality cannot always be determined by finished-product inspection. Process validation can be broken down into 3 steps: process design, process qualification, and continued process verification.

==Process Design==
In this stage data from the development phase are gathered and analyzed to define the commercial manufacturing process. By understanding the commercial process a framework for quality specifications can be established and used as the foundation of a control strategy. [[Process design]] is the first of three stages of process validation. Data from the development phase is gathered and analyzed to understand end-to-end system processes. These data are used to establish benchmarks for quality and production control.

===Design of Experiment (DOE)===
Design of experiments is used to discover possible relationships and sources of variation as quickly as possible. A cost benefit analysis should be conducted to determine if such an operation is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Case for Stage 3 Continued Process Verification|url=http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2014/stage3-continued-process-verification/|publisher=Pharma Manufacturing|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality by Design (QBD)===
[[Quality by Design]] is an approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing that stresses quality should be built into products rather than tested into products; that product quality should be considered at the earliest possible stage rather than at the end of the manufacturing process. Input variables are isolated in order to identify the root cause of potential quality issues and the manufacturing process is adapted accordingly.

===Process Analytical Technology (PAT)===
[[Process Analytical Technology]] is used to measure critical process parameters (CPP) and critical quality attributes (CQA).  PAT facilitates measurement of quantitative production variables in real time and allows access to relevant manufacturing feedback. PAT can also be used in the design process to generate a process qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAT - A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/ucm070305.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical Process Parameters (CPP)===
[[Critical Process Parameters]] Operating parameters that are considered essential to maintaining product output within specified quality target guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROCESS VALIDATION (P2V)|url=http://www.validation-online.net/process-validation.html|publisher=Validation Online|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical Quality Attributes (CQA)===
'''Critical Quality Attributes''' (CQA) are chemical, physical, biological and microbiological attributes that can be defined, measured, and continually monitored to ensure final product outputs remain within acceptable quality limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining Critical Quality Attributes in the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Process|url=http://www.gxp-cc.com/news/fda-european-regulations-for-life-sciences/2014/07/15/defining-critical-quality-attributes-in-the-pharmaceutical-manufacturing-process/|publisher=GXP-CC|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CQA are an essential aspect of a manufacturing control strategy and should be identified in stage 1 of [[Process Validation]]: [[Process design]]. During this stage acceptable limits, baselines, and data collection and measurement protocols should be established. Data from the design process and data collected during production should be kept by the manufacturer and used to evaluated [[product quality]] and [[process control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Quality Attributes (CQA)|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/cms/index.php?id=228|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical data can also help manufacturers better understand operational process and input variables as well as better identify true deviations from quality standards compared to false positives. Should a serious product quality issue arise, historical data would be essential in identifying the sources of errors and implementing corrective measures.

==Process Qualification==
In this stage the process design is assessed to conclude if the process is able to meet determined manufacturing targets. In this stage all production processes and manufacturing equipment is proofed to confirm quality and output capabilities. Critical quality attributes are evaluated and critical process parameters taken into account to confirm product quality. Once the process qualification stage has been successfully accomplished production can begin. [[Process Qualification]] is the second phase of process validation....

==Continued Process Verification==
[[Continued Process Verification]] is the ongoing monitoring of all aspects of the production cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atris-systems.com/216.0.html Continued Process Verification]&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to ensure that all levels of production are controlled and regulated. Deviations from prescribed output methods and final product irregularities are flagged by a process analytics database system. The FDA requires production data be recorded (FDA requirements (§ 211.180(e)). Continued process verification is stage 3 of process validation.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] defines a similar process known as Ongoing Process Verification. This alternative method of process validation is recommended by the EMA for validating processes on a continuous basis. Continuous Process Verification analyses [[Critical Process Parameters]] and [[Critical Quality Attributes]] in real time to confirm production remain within acceptable levels and meet standards set by ICH Q8, Pharmaceutical Quality Systems, and [[Good manufacturing practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuous Process Verification|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/219.0.html|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[death]] or serious injury to people
* loss or severe damage to equipment/property
* environmental harm

A '''safety-related system''' (or sometimes '''safety-involved system''') comprises everything (hardware, software, and human aspects) needed to perform one or more safety functions, in which failure would cause a significant increase in the safety risk for the people and/or environment involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.iec.ch/functionalsafety/faq-ed2/page5.htm | title=IEC 61508 – Functional Safety | chapter=FAQ – Edition 2.0: E) Key concepts | publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] | accessdate=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Safety-related systems are those that do not have full responsibility for controlling hazards such as loss of life, severe injury or severe [[environmental degradation|environmental damage]].  The malfunction of a safety-involved system would only be that hazardous in conjunction with the failure of other systems or [[human error]]. Some safety organizations provide guidance on safety-related systems, for example the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/humanfactors/topics/mancomppt1.pdf | title=Managing competence for safety-related systems | chapter=Part 1: Key guidance | publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] | location=UK | date=2007 | accessdate=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risks of this sort are usually managed with the methods and tools of [[safety engineering]]. A safety-critical system is designed to lose less than one life per billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;AC 25.1309-1A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen99"&gt;{{cite article| first1=Jonathan P. | last1=Bowen | authorlink=Jonathan Bowen | title=The Ethics of Safety-Critical Systems | journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] | volume=43 | number=4 | pages=91–97 | date=April 2000 | doi=10.1145/332051.332078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical design methods include [[Probabilistic Risk Assessment|probabilistic risk assessment]], a method that combines [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)]] with [[fault tree analysis|fault tree ana look]]

[[fault tree analysis|lysis]]. Safety-critical systems are increasingly [[computer system|computer]]-based.

==Reliability regimes==
Several reliability regimes for safety-critical systems exist: 

* '''Fail-operational systems''' continue to operate when their control systems fail. Examples of these include [[elevator]]s, the gas [[thermostat]]s in most home furnaces, and [[Passive nuclear safety|passively safe nuclear reactors]]. Fail-operational mode is sometimes unsafe. [[Nuclear weapon]]s launch-on-loss-of-communications was rejected as a control system for the U.S. nuclear forces because it is fail-operational: a loss of communications would cause launch, so this mode of operation was considered too risky.  This is contrasted with the [[Fail-deadly]] behavior of the  [[Dead Hand (nuclear war)|Perimeter]] system built during the Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/17-10/mf_deadhand|title=Inside the Apocalyptic Soviet Doomsday Machine|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fail-soft systems''' are able to continue operating on an interim basis with reduced efficiency in case of failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fail-soft|title=Definition fail-soft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most spare tires are an example of this: They usually come with certain restrictions (e.g. a speed restriction) and lead to lower fuel economy. Another example is the "Safe Mode" found in most Windows operating systems.
* '''[[Fail-safe]] systems''' become safe when they cannot operate.  Many medical systems fall into this category. For example, an [[infusion pump]] can fail, and as long as it alerts the nurse and ceases pumping, it will not threaten the loss of life because its [[safety interval]] is long enough to permit a human response. In a similar vein, an industrial or domestic burner controller can fail, but must fail in a safe mode (i.e. turn combustion off when they detect faults). Famously, [[nuclear weapon]] systems that launch-on-command are fail-safe, because if the communications systems fail, launch cannot be commanded. [[Railway signaling]] is designed to be fail-safe.
* '''[[Fail-secure]] systems''' maintain maximum security when they cannot operate. For example, while fail-safe electronic doors unlock during power failures, fail-secure ones will lock, keeping an area secure.
* '''Fail-Passive systems''' continue to operate in the event of a system failure. An example includes an aircraft [[autopilot]]. In the event of a failure, the aircraft would remain in a controllable state and allow the pilot to take over and complete the journey and perform a safe landing.
* '''[[Fault-tolerant system]]s''' avoid service failure when faults are introduced to the system. An example may include control systems for ordinary [[nuclear reactor]]s. The normal method to tolerate faults is to have several computers continually test the parts of a system, and switch on hot spares for failing subsystems. As long as faulty subsystems are replaced or repaired at normal maintenance intervals, these systems are considered safe. The computers, power supplies and control terminals used by human beings must all be duplicated in these systems in some fashion.

==Software engineering for safety-critical systems==
[[Software engineering]] for safety-critical systems is particularly difficult. There are three aspects which can be applied to aid the engineering software for life-critical systems. First is process engineering and management. Secondly, selecting the appropriate tools and environment for the system. This allows the system developer to effectively test the system by emulation and observe its effectiveness. Thirdly, address any legal and regulatory requirements, such as FAA requirements for aviation. By setting a standard for which a system is required to be developed under, it forces the designers to stick to the requirements. The [[avionics]] industry has succeeded in producing [[DO-178B|standard methods for producing life-critical avionics software]]. Similar standards exist for automotive ([[ISO 26262]]), Medical ([[IEC 62304]]) and nuclear ([[IEC 61513]]) industries. The standard approach is to carefully code, inspect, document, test, verify and analyze the system.  Another approach is to certify a production system, a [[compiler]], and then generate the system's code from specifications. Another approach uses [[formal methods]] to generate [[mathematical proof|proofs]] that the code meets requirements.&lt;ref name="bs93"&gt;{{cite article| first1=Jonathan P. | last1=Bowen | first2=Victoria | last2=Stavridou | title=Safety-critical systems, formal methods and standards | publisher=IEE/BCS | journal=[[Software Engineering Journal]] | volume=8 | number=4 | pages=189–209 | date=July 1993 | doi=10.1049/sej.1993.0025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these approaches improve the [[software quality]] in safety-critical systems by testing or eliminating manual steps in the development process, because people make mistakes, and these mistakes are the most common cause of potential life-threatening errors.

The '''Stationers’ Register''' was a record book maintained by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] of London.  The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including  printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in [[England]].  The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of [[copyright]] law.  The Company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books.

For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries&amp;mdash;for the [[Elizabethan era]], the [[Jacobean era]], the [[Caroline era]], and especially for [[English Renaissance theatre]]&amp;mdash;the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Elizabethan Stage,'' Vol. 3, pp. 164-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work.  One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and [[Nathaniel Butter]] claimed the right to print "A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde." (They paid sixpence.)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' pp. 265 and 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the [[playing company|companies of actors]] appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Much Ado About Nothing]],'' ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]],'' ''[[As You Like It]],'' and ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' were registered, apparently for such a purpose ("to be stayed"), on 4 August 1600. Yet if this interpretation is correct, the strategy to forestall publication had limited success; the first two plays were published later in 1600, and the last in 1601. Only ''As You Like It'' remained out of print at the time. Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 359; Halliday, pp. 216, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1710, the Copyright Act or [[Statute of Anne]] entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register.  The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000.

'''Systematic musicology''' is an [[umbrella term]], used mainly in [[Central Europe]], for several subdisciplines and paradigms of [[musicology]]. "Systematic musicology has traditionally been conceived of as an interdisciplinary science, whose aim it is to explore the foundations of music from different points of view, such as acoustics, physiology, psychology, anthro- pology, music theory, sociology, and aesthetics." &lt;ref name="schneiderleman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leman|first1=Marc|last2=Schneider|first2=Albrecht|editor1-first=Marc|editor1-last=Leman|title=Music, Gestalt, and Computing. Studies in Cognitive and Systematic Musicology|chapter=Origin and Nature of Cognitive and Systematic Musicology: An Introduction|date=1997|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=3-540-63526-2|pages=13–30|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/BFb0034102|accessdate=16 June 2017|ref=Music, Gestalt, and Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important subdisciplines today are [[music psychology]], [[sociomusicology]] (music sociology), [[philosophy of music]] (music philosophy), [[music acoustics]] (physics of music), [[cognitive neuroscience of music]], and the computer sciences of music (including [[sound and music computing]], [[music information retrieval]], and [[computing in musicology]]). These subdisciplines and paradigms tend to address questions about [[music]] in general, rather than specific manifestations of music.

In the European tripartite model of musicology, musicology is regarded as a combination of three broad subdisciplines: [[ethnomusicology]], [[music history]] (or historical musicology), and systematic musicology. Ethnomusicology and historical musicology are primarily concerned with specific manifestations of music such as performances, works, traditions, genres, and the people who produce and engage with them (musicians, composers, social groups). Systematic musicology is different in that it tends not to put these specific manifestations in the foreground, although it of course refers to them. Instead, more general questions are asked about music. These questions tend to be answered either by analysing empirical data (based on observation) or by developing theory - or better, by a combination of both. The 19th-century positivist dream of discovering "laws" of music (by analogy to "laws" in other disciplines such as physics; cf. Adler, 1885), and of defining the discipline of systematic musicology in terms of such laws, slowly evaporated. Ideological trends stemming from [[modernism]] and later [[post-structuralism]] fundamentally altered the nature of the project.

Since systematic musicology brings together several parent disciplines, it is often regarded as being intrinsically interdisciplinary&lt;ref name="current"&gt;{{cite book|editor2-first=Marc|editor2-last=Leman|editor1-first=Rolf|editor1-last=Bader|editor3-first=Rolf-Inge|editor3-last=Godoi|title=Current Research in Systematic Musicology|date=2013|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-36098-5|url=https://link.springer.com/bookseries/11684|accessdate=13 December 2017|ref=Current Research in Systematic Musicology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schneidersystem"&gt;{{cite book|editor2-first=Bram|editor2-last=Gätjen|editor1-first=Klaus Wolfgang|editor1-last=Niemöller|title=Perspektiven und Methoden einer Systemischen Musikwissenschaft|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=978-3-63139502-8|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/40101?tab=toc|accessdate=13 December 2017|ref=Perspektiven und Methoden einer Systemischen Musikwissenschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or as a system of interacting subdisciplines (hence the alternative name "systemic"). However, most systematic musicologists focus on just one or a select few of the many subdisciplines. Systematic musicologists who are oriented toward the [[humanities]] often make reference to fields such as [[aesthetics]], [[philosophy]], [[semiotics]], [[hermeneutics]], [[music criticism]], [[Media studies]], [[Cultural studies]], [[gender studies]], and (theoretic) [[sociology]]. Those who are oriented toward [[science]] tend to regard their discipline as empirical and data-oriented, and to borrow their methods and ways of thinking from [[psychology]], [[acoustics]], [[psychoacoustics]], [[physiology]], [[cognitive science]], and (empirical) [[sociology]].&lt;ref name=current&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently emerged areas of research which at least partially are in the scope of systematic musicology comprise [[cognitive musicology]], [[neuromusicology]], [[biomusicology]], and [[music cognition]] including [[embodied music cognition]]. As an academic discipline, systematic musicology is closely related to practically oriented disciplines such as [[music technology]], [[music information retrieval]], and [[musical robotics]].&lt;ref name=current&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic musicology is less unified than its sister disciplines historical musicology and ethnomusicology. Its contents and methods are more diverse and tend to be more closely related to parent disciplines, both academic and practical, outside of musicology. The diversity of systematic musicology is to some extent compensated for by interdisciplinary interactions within the system of subdisciplines that make it up.

The origins of systematic musicology in Europe can be traced to ancient Greece; philosophers such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristoxenus]] asked general questions about music. Historical musicology and ethnomusicology are much younger disciplines, and the relative importance of the three has fluctuated considerably during the past few centuries. Today, musicology's three broad subdisciplines are of approximately equal size in terms of the volume of research activity.

'''The Schools of Public Engagement at The New School''' is one of five academic divisions that compose [[The New School]], a private university located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. It includes, the Bachelor's Program for Adults and Transfer Students, [[Milano School of Management, Policy, and Environment]] founded in 1964, School of Media Studies, Creative Writing Program and School of Languages

== History ==

The Schools of Public Engagement at The New School is the direct successor of the original institution making it the oldest division of [[The New School]] having been founded in 1919. The school’s founding members wanted to create a “center for discussion and instruction for mature men and women” and by 1934 it was chartered as a university by the state of New York and began conferring degrees. The division was restructured in September 2011 after it would include both Milano School of Management and Urban Policy and what was then called The New School for General Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Century of Cutting Edge Adult Education|url=http://www.newcombefoundation.org/featured_programs_2012_04.html|publisher=Newcombe Foundation|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Dean Allen Austill led the division from the 1960s to the 1980s. Austill was assisted by Albert Landa, who directed publicity for the New School while also informally acting in many other capacities, and Wallis Osterholz, who was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration. Austill also added areas as guitar study and culinary science to the curriculum. In 1962, Austill initiated the Institute for Retired Professionals, a community of peer learners aged 50 to 90 who develop and participate in challenging discussion groups; the Institute, now headed by Michael Markowitz, still exists today. Austill's subordinate as Chair of Humanities for many of these years was Reuben Abel, a philosopher. Abel was succeeded by Lewis Falb, a specialist in interwar [[Paris]] who broadened the humanities curriculum further. Prominent teachers in this era included the philosopher Paul Edwards; the literary scholars Hasye Cooperman, [[Justus Rosenberg]], and Margaret Boe Birns; the political scientist Ralph Buultjens; and the visual arts instructors Anthony Toney, Minoru Kawabata, and [[Henry C. Pearson]].

== The 1990s and after ==

The New School, for most of its history, operated as a noncredit institution, serving largely white, middle-class, often politically progressive, often [[Jewish]] adults living in [[Manhattan]] who were interested in intellectual stimulation and self-improvement. In the early 1990s, the institution, sensing demographic changes and needing to supplement its revenue,  began to encourage credit students to matriculate at the institution, a trend which culminated in the establishment of the adult BA program in the mid-1990s. The credit students generally represented a younger and more diverse population.

The New School possesses a prestigious MFA program in creative writing, directed by poet and biographer Robert Polito,  that has featured such authors as [[Rick Moody]], [[Colm Toibin]], and [[Marie Ponsot]] as instructors. The division also has an MA program in International Affairs, directed by Michael Cohen,  and, until 2007,  hosted the World Policy Institute, a well-regarded foundation devoted to the study of foreign affairs and formerly led by Stephen Schlesinger.

Several important developments occurred at the institution in the early 2000s. A strong advising program guided the curriculum's transformation from an intellectual free-for-all of courses often taught by teachers with sharply varying credentials to a smaller, more rigorous set of offerings taught by professionals, often bearing the highest degree in their fields.  In 2005, as part of the rebranding of the entire university envisioned by President [[Bob Kerrey]], the division was renamed The New School for General Studies, to clarify its mission and perhaps to invite comparisons with [[Columbia University]]'s prestigious, similarly named [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]]. Also in 2005, the New School agreed to a contract with Local 7902 of ACT-UAW, an affiliate of the [[United Auto Workers]], guaranteeing job security to part-time faculty who had taught at the New School for more than ten semesters.

Following the part-time faculty's success in gaining recognition and security, New School students set about creating a university-wide representative body.  Many efforts had been made to establish a student legislative body, to address student grievances and concerns, but they were stymied by disconnected university divisions and an unenthusiastic administration. However, the long-standing efforts finally paid off in the Fall 2006 term when a University-wide Student Senate was formed involving representatives from all of the school's divisions. The USS gained administration support and funding from the board of trustees and is set to ratify a new constitution. Beginning during the Spring 2007 semester, representatives were elected from each division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/uploadedFiles/News/Lang/inprint_061212.pdf|author=Hartmann, Rob|title=New Face for Student Gov't|accessdate=2007-05-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610035015/http://www.newschool.edu/uploadedFiles/News/Lang/inprint_061212.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46229">A '''two-child policy''' is a government-imposed limit of two children allowed per family or the payment of government subsidies only to the first two children. It has previously been used in [[Vietnam]]. In [[British Hong Kong]] in the 1970s, citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit (although it was not mandated by law), and it was used as part of the region's family planning strategies. Since 2016, it has been implemented in China, replacing the country's previous [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= China to end one-child policy and allow two |work= BBC |date= 29 October 2015 |url= 
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34665539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/29/c_134763507.htm|title=China to allow two children for all couples|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] |date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== China (Mainland) ==
During the 1970s, Chinese citizens were encouraged to have only one child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/one-child-policy|title=one-child policy - Definition &amp; Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing [[Cultural Revolution]] and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors. During this time, the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The colloquial term "births per woman" is usually formalized as the ''[[Total Fertility Rate]]'' (TFR), a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.)

As China's youngest generation (born under the [[one-child policy]], which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979) came of age for formation of the next generation, a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. In response to this issue, by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-07-10/154513416121.shtml | language=Chinese | accessdate=7 November 2008 | date=10 July 2007 | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | title=计生委新闻发言人:11%以上人口可生两个孩子 (English: "Spokesperson of the one-child policy committee: 11% or more of the population may have two children)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a policy change of the Chinese government in late 2013, most Chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news |title=China's 'one-child' rethink marks symbolic shift |author=Patti Waldmeir |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7bed3f70-4dfa-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0.html |newspaper=FT |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ouyang | first1 = Y. | title = China relaxes its one-child policy | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62544-1 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9907 | pages = e28–e30 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-07/10/content_17706811.htm|title=Most Chinese provincial areas relax one-child policy - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|first=|last=杨洁|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, since 2012, Han Chinese in southern [[Xinjiang]] were allowed to have two children.

In 2018, about two years after the new policy reform, China is facing new ramifications from the two-child policy. Since the revision of the one-child policy, 90 million women have become eligible to have a second child.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180223131904.htm|title=China's two-child policy may exacerbate gender inequality|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the new two-child policy may have negative implications on gender roles, with new expectations from females to bear more children and to abandon their careers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21736574-two-child-rule-still-applies-officials-know-more-babies-are-needed-not-fewer-china|title=China is in a muddle over population policy|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reform, China saw a short-lived boost in fertility rate for 2016. Chinese women gave birth to 17.2 million babies in 2016, but declined by 3.5% in 2017.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Husbands still have greater marital power, thus increasing fertility pressure on their female counterpart.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The dynamic of relationships (amount of "power" held by each parent), and the amount of resources each parent has contributes to the struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qian|first=Yue|last2=Jin|first2=Yongai|date=2018-02-21|title=Women's Fertility Autonomy in Urban China: The Role of Couple Dynamics Under the Universal Two-Child Policy|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323327889|journal=Chinese Sociological Review|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1–35|doi=10.1080/21620555.2018.1428895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources would be items such as income, and health insurance. Dominance would be described as who has the final say in pregnancy, who has to resign in their career for maternal/parental leave. However, females have shown interest in a second child if the first child did not possess the desired gender.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Chinese couples have also polled and stated that they would rather invest in one child opposed to two children.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To add, another concern for couples would be the high costs of raising another child; China's childcare system needs to be furthered developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-03-12/no-easing-of-two-child-policy-official-says-101220222.html|title=No Easing of Two-Child Policy, Official Says - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in cultural norms appears to be having negative consequences and leads to fear of a large aging population with smaller younger generations; thus the lack of workforce to drive the economy.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In [[British Hong Kong]], the Eugenics League was founded in 1936, which became [[The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="famplan.org.hk"&gt;[http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&amp;content=about/history.asp History of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327235233/http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&amp;content=about%2Fhistory.asp |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides family planning advice, [[sex education]], and [[birth control]] services to the general public of Hong Kong. In the 1970s due to the rapidly rising population, it launched the "Two is Enough" campaign,&lt;ref name="famplan.org.hk"/&gt; which reduced the general birth rate through educational means. The organization&lt;ref name="ippf.org"&gt;[http://www.ippf.org/en/About/History.htm History of International Planned Parenthood Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813091603/http://www.ippf.org/en/About/History.htm |date=2009-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]], with its counterparts in seven other countries.&lt;ref name="ippf.org"/&gt;
The [[total fertility rate]] in Hong Kong is currently 1.04 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world.
Although the "Two is Enough" campaign found widespread approval, it does not reflect current government policy in supporting families.

==Iran==
Iranian authorities encouraged families in Iran not to have more than two children when conducting [[family planning in Iran]] from early 1990s to late 2006. Iran's government "declared that Islam favored families with only two children", as one historian put it.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.184&lt;/ref&gt; When the family planning program was initiated, Iran's Health Ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives - pills, condoms, IUDs, implants, tubal ligations, and vasectomies.&lt;ref name="sciolino"&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, ''Persian Mirrors : the Elusive Face of Iran'', Free Press, 2000, 2005 (p.282)&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting in 2006, the government's population control policy changed when Ahmadinejad called for reversal of Iran's existing policy of "two children is enough"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stimson.org/swa/pdf/Iran_DemBrief1.pdf Prospects for Ahmadinejad’s Call for More Rapid Population Growth in Iran] {{cite news

In [[Singapore]], the two-child policy until the 1980s was called "Stop at Two".

==United Kingdom==
In July 2007, the [[think tank]] Optimum Population Trust (now [[Population Matters]]) advocated what the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' described as a "'two-child' policy" to combat population increases and climate change in the United Kingdom.  The article stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"According to the report, published by the Optimum Population Trust, Britain's high birth rate is a major factor in the current level of climate change, which can only be combated if families voluntarily limit the number of children they have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Firth|first=Niall|title=Families should have no more than two children - thinktank|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-467728/Families-children--thinktank.html|publisher=The Daily Mail|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2012, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a 'two-child policy',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramesh|first=Randeep|title=Two-child benefits policy targets the strivers in low-paid jobs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/25/iain-duncan-smith-two-child-policy|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been fronted by the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] and former leader of the Conservative Party [[Iain Duncan Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grice|first=Andrew|title=What is Iain Duncan Smith's two-child policy?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/what-is-iain-duncan-smiths-twochild-policy-8227368.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, [[David Cameron]] denied any such plans to cut child benefits or tax credits. However, three months later, [[George Osborne]], the then Finance Minister, announced that child tax credits would be limited to the first two children only. This was to come into force from the 2017/2018 financial year and apply to children born after that date only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Asa|title=Tax credits: what are they, who claims them, and why is everyone so angry about the cuts?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/11951056/Tax-credits-what-are-they-who-claims-them-and-why-is-everyone-so-angry-about-the-cuts.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 April 2017|location=London|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 2019 however the policy becomes retrospective. Families  making a new benefit claim (or whose circumstances change) will have the 2-child policy applied to them irrespective of when their children were born.

The two-child policy took effect on 5 April 2017. One particular aspect of the new rules, termed the "rape clause", has caused controversy. Although the policy excludes all but the first two children from all available benefits, an exemption can be applied for if the conception of the third and any further children occurred as a result of the [[rape]] of the claimant. A woman wishing to claim this exemption must fill in an eight-page form: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The form requires women wanting to be eligible for the exemption to sign a declaration saying they were raped or otherwise coerced into sex – and giving the child’s name. They must sign a declaration reading: 'I believe the non-consensual conception exemption applies to my child.' They must also sign another declaration that says: 'I confirm that I am not living with the other parent of this child.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Peter||last2=Butler|first2=Patrick|title=Government under fire over new child tax credit form for rape victims |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/06/government-under-fire-over-new-child-tax-credit-form-for-victims|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 April 2017|location=London|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That the woman must thereby identify the child in question (which is thought to be assigned a tax code created for this exemption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rustin|first1=Susanna|title=The ‘rape rule’ for tax credits tramples the rights of children it’s meant to protect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/17/rape-rule-tax-credits-rights-children-sex-crime|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), that first or second children conceived by rape do not count towards this exemption and that women who are still living with their abusers are not eligible are just some of the aspects of the rape clause that caused widespread condemnation. Ruth Graham, writing for [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], summarises the issues surrounding this new policy thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The policy and the exemption have received harsh criticism from a wide variety of sources since they were announced in 2015. One member of parliament called the exemption implementation 'inhumane and barbaric.' Feminists have pointed out the cuts disproportionately affect women. A coalition of the U.K.’s largest Christian denominations and Jewish groups pointed out that the policy discriminates against people whose religion compels them to have larger families. A United Nations committee on children’s rights asked the British government to explain the policy last year, because of concerns about women having to somehow prove they were raped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=Ruth|title=This Cruel New U.K. Policy Punishes Women for Having More Than Two Children 378 69 618|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/04/10/the_u_k_two_child_tax_credit_policy_is_nonsensical_and_cruel.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=Slate|date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===History===

From 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into [[North and South Vietnam]] along the 17th parallel with separate governments and policies in each region. [[North Vietnam]] became the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and had a communist government, whereas [[South Vietnam]] became the [[Republic of Vietnam]] and was more aligned with the United States and other Western nations.&lt;ref name="Vietnam Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langguth|first1=A.J.|title=Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975|date=March 12, 2002|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-1231-1|page=671}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, North Vietnam began a policy advocating a two-child norm due to the sharp population increase of the largely poor and rural population.&lt;ref name="Population Council Daniel Goodkind" /&gt; Vietnam's family planning policy was developed before those of other countries, such as China and [[India]], the government used a system of information, education, communication (IEC) campaign and publicly accessible contraceptives to curb the population.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knudsen|first1=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|date=June 30, 2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5|pages=139–168|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1975 under the Communist Party, there was a governmental effort to extend the policies of the North to the rest of Vietnam, which extended into the next decade.&lt;ref name="Fertility Family Planning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allman|first1=James|last2=Vu|first2=Qui Nhan|last3=Nguyen|first3=Minh Thang|last4=Pham|first4=Bich San|title=Fertility and Family Planning in Vietnam|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=September 1991|volume=22|issue=5|pages=308–317|doi=10.2307/1966685|jstor=1966685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the government of the Republic of Vietnam adopted family planning in general as the official state policy, inadequate medical facilities prevented the policy from being effectively implemented.&lt;ref name="UN Viet Nam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Viet Nam|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/vietnam.doc|website=United Nations|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Vietnam government practiced various family planning measures, including the allowance of use of abortion and the creation of the National Committee for Population and Family Planning. After 1983, each family was required to limit the number of children to two. In 1985, the government increased incentives, such as contraceptives and abortion acceptors, and disincentives, such as penalties for violations in family planning.&lt;ref name="UN Viet Nam" /&gt;

In 1986, the Party implemented the Renovation (''[[Đổi Mới]]'') Policy, which completely reversed the Communist Party economy to implement capitalistic market ideals. The aims of the Renovation Policy were to end Vietnam's economic isolation, increase competitiveness, and raise living standards.&lt;ref name="History Doi Moi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Donald|title=Doi Moi Policy and the Small-Enterprise Boom in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam|journal=Geographical Review|date=April 1996|volume=86|issue=2|pages=178–197|doi=10.2307/215955|jstor=215955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to effectively develop the population socioeconomically and increase the standard of living within the population, the Vietnam government emphasized the need to contain birth rates.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Asian Values"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruun|first1=Ole|last2=Jacobsen|first2=Michael|title=Human Rights and Asian Values: Contesting National Identities and Cultural Representations in Asia|date=2 September 2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1212-0|pages=161–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[Government of Vietnam|Council of Ministers]] issued an in-depth family planning policy, adding additional restrictions beyond the previous restriction of keeping the maximum number of children per household to two.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|date=Mar 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169–172|doi=10.2307/1973424|jstor=1973424|last1=Ministers&amp;#93;|first1=&amp;#91;Council of}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed one-or-two-child policy of Vietnam was established nine years after China's [[one-child policy]] was implemented, and elements of China's policy are reflected in Vietnam's, such as the emphasis on marrying later,&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; postponing childbearing age (22-years of age or older for women and 24-years of age or older for men),&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; and spacing out birth of children (3–5 years apart).&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; The state was required to supply free birth control devices (such as [[intrauterine device|intrauterine loops]], [[condoms]], and birth control pills) and to provide facilities for individuals who are eligible for abortions.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; Furthermore, if families did not comply with the two-child policy, they were required to pay high fees and were unable to move into urban centers.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt;

In 1993, the Vietnamese government issued the first formalization for the unified Vietnam of the one-to-two child policy as a mandatory national policy. The policy combined advertisements and education to promote a smaller family "so people may enjoy a plentiful and happy life."&lt;ref name="Harvard 1993 Resolution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution of 1993 on Policy Concerning the Population and Family Planning Work|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/policies/VIETNAM2.htm|website=Hanoi Voice of Vietnam Network|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese government explicitly linked the family planning policy with "historical and cultural traditions, value structures and development objectives," encouraging a collectivist mindset in which individuals honor the needs of the nation above their own.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Asian Values" /&gt; The goal of the policy was to reduce the Vietnamese fertility rate to the replacement level of 2.1&lt;ref name="World Resources Institute"/&gt; by 2015, so that the country could have a stable population during mid-21st century. In 1997, the goal was accelerated to reach the replacement level by 2005, and the government subsequently integrated an increased use of abortion as a means to curb population growth.&lt;ref name="World Policy Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=May|first1=John F.|title=World Population Policies: Their Origin, Evolution, and Impact|date=March 30, 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2836-3|pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Standing Parliamentary Committee of the National Assembly issued the highest legislative document on population titled the Population Ordinance, which restructured the official family planning policy.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; According to the ordinance, couples "shall have the right to decide on the time to have babies, the number of children and the duration between child births."&lt;ref name="Population 2003"&gt;{{citation|title=Population Ordinance (6/2003)|website=The Standing Committee of National Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shortly after, the government implemented the National Strategy on Population 2001-2010, which again called for decreasing the fertility rate to the replacement level by 2005. This caused controversy as individuals protested the conflicting messages purported by the government in regards to their reproductive rights.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; To address this confusion, the government issued Resolution 47 in 2005 which stated that "to sustain high economic growth, Viet Nam needs to pursue a population control policy until it has become an industrialized country." However at this time, the population had already reached the goal of having a total fertility rate below the replacement level.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

In 2009, the Population Ordinance was amended to again restrict the number of children to be one or two children, although individuals were allowed to decide the timing and spacing of their births.&lt;ref name="Population Ordinance 2008 Amend"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordinance No. 08/2008|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/policies/poppolicy.htm|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is currently drafting a new Law on Population to replace the Population Ordinance in 2015. However, there is disagreement between policy makers and academics on what should be included in the law.&lt;ref name="New Population Law 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pham|first1=Bang Nguyen|title=The Demographic Transition and Implications for the New Law on Population in Vietnam|journal=Asian Population Studies|date=2014|volume=10|issue=3|pages=237–240|doi=10.1080/17441730.2014.955162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
The organizational structure of the two-child policy was housed under different governmental units since its conception in the 1960s. As the policy evolved from "Initiation in the 1960s–1970s; Maturity in the 1980s–1990s; and Legalization in the 2000s–2010s",&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; the administration of the population policy also changed. From 1961-1983, the population program fell under the Population and Birth Control Unit. From 1984–2002, it was under the control of National Committee for Population and Family Planning. From 2003–2006, it was in the jurisdiction of the Vietnam Commission for Population, Family and Children. Since 2007, the population program has been under the General Office for Population and Family Planning.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

Although the policy was advocated on the national level, the central government did not utilize specific fines or incentives, instead delegating implementation responsibilities to local governments.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview"/&gt; Each family was required to have at most two children, and local governments were responsible to decide the details of enforcement. Depending on the specific location, district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice, equivalent to the worth of a month to a year's wages, for each additional child, and additionally, women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice. Individuals who did not use contraceptives sometimes had their names announced over the intercom system of the village to shame them into using them, whereas individuals who did could be selected to win the Labor Medal for "good realization of the population – family planning program".&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview" /&gt; The government and large companies also regularly denied people who violated the policy of their salaries, promotions, and sometimes even their jobs.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview" /&gt;

===Current status===

Currently, the effective population policy is the revised 2009 Population Ordinance which states that "each couple and individual has the right and responsibility to participate in the campaigns on population and family planning, reproductive health care: (i) decide time and birth spacing; (ii) have one or two children, exceptional cases to be determined by the Government."&lt;ref name="Population Ordinance 2008 Amend" /&gt; Thus, individuals have control over the timing and spacing of the births of their children but are still restricted in the number of children they are allowed to have. Furthermore, later that year, Chief Executive Trương Tấn San stressed the need for continued diligence in population control and stated that the population of Vietnam should be 100 million people by 2020, and suggested that a new comprehensive Law on Population be introduced to the government by 2015.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

===Effects of this policy===

====Reduction of the birthrate====
The total fertility rate in Vietnam dropped from 5.6 in 1979 to 3.2 by 1993, suggesting the two-child policy was successful in containing the population growth.&lt;ref name="Falling Fertility"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|title=Falling Fertility in Vietnam|journal=Population Studies: A Journal of Demography|date=1997|volume=51|issue=2|pages=203–211|doi=10.1080/0032472031000149916}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one demographic model, the [[fertility#Bongaarts' model of components of fertility|Bongaarts' model of components of fertility]], high rates of contraceptive use and of induced abortion are plausible explanations for the decreased fertility rate. Furthermore, because of this policy, the population has fundamentally changed their ideas of the family. In 1988, the Inter-Censal Demographic and Health Survey found that parents wanted an average of 3.3 children, and in 1994, they found that the ideal number of children fell to 2.8.&lt;ref name="Falling Fertility" /&gt;

However, the reported findings differ depending on the [[fertility]] model utilized and on the particular research study cited. The [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|United Nations Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific]] found that the average number in household was 3.1 in 1998.&lt;ref name="Changing Policy" /&gt; In another study conducted by the America-based non-profit, non-governmental organization [[Population Reference Bureau]], the number found was lower at 2.3.&lt;ref name=PRB&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of Population and Development in Vietnam|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2003/AnOverviewofPopulationandDevelopmentinVietnam.aspx|website=Population Reference Bureau|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, published in the Worldwide State of the Family in 1995 by Tran Xuan Nhi,&lt;ref name="Vietnam Families"&gt;{{citation|last1=Nhi|first1=Tran Xuan|title=Vietnam's families|publisher=Worldwide State of the Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; found a contrasting finding that the [[total fertility rate]] only dropped slightly and the size of [[nuclear families]] experienced only a slight change, dipping from 4.8 to 4.7 from 1989 to 1994.&lt;ref name="Changing Policy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisensale|first1=Steven|title=Family Policy in a Changing Vietnam|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|date=2000|volume=31|issue=1|pages=79–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex-based differences====

There is evidence that [[son preference]] exists in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Son Preference"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Haughton|first2=Dominique|title=Son Preference in Vietnam|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=1995|volume=26|issue=6|pages=325–337|doi=10.2307/2138098|jstor=2138098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, men oversee and are responsible for household enterprises, managing agriculture, ancestral worship, and carrying on the family name.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guilmoto|first1=Christophe Z.|title=Son Preference, Sex Selection, and Kinship in Vietnam|journal=Population and Development Review|date=March 2012|volume=38|issue=1|pages=31–54|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00471.x|pmid=22833863}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the desire for a son is seen in the Vietnamese family's fertility practices, the desire for more than one son is not.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; Families with two daughters are twice as likely to have a third child than families with at least one son, presumably with the hopes that this one will be a boy.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; Furthermore, women who do not have any sons are around 15% less likely to use contraceptives than families who have at least one.&lt;ref name="Son Preference" /&gt; There were also increased rates of "contraceptive failure" amongst couples who had a son, as families secretly removed an IUD to bypass the policy in hopes of having a son.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; This is consistent with findings from other East Asian countries in which son preference corresponds with a demand for fewer children so that families will have at least one son to maintain the ancestral line.&lt;ref name="Son Preference" /&gt;

Despite the evidence for son preference, there is no clear evidence that Vietnam's sex ratio at birth is increasing, as seen in other East Asian countries, notably China, though evidence is conflicting depending on the source.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; In fact, according to the Vietnamese census data for 1989 and 1999, the sex ratios of males to females at birth are actually decreasing.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; On the other hand, some sources state that the impact of son preference varies by region of Vietnam. In the north, there is a strong relationship between sex bias in fertility decisions and number of male births, while in the south, this relationship is nonexistent.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; However, mothers who pursue certain occupations, such as government cadres and farmers, are more likely to want a particular sex of child and have higher sex-ratio differences at birth. This reflects the pressure for government employees to adhere to the two-child limit, and the perceived necessity of males for manual labor in the farm.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belanger|first1=Daniele|last2=Khuat|first2=Thi Hai Oanh|last3=Liu|first3=Jianye|last4=Le|first4=Thanh Thuy|last5=Pham|first5=Viet Thanh|title=Are Sex Ratios at Birth Increasing in Vietnam?|journal=Population|date=2003|volume=58|issue=2|pages=231–250|doi=10.2307/3246604|jstor=3246604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism===

====Inadequate contraceptives====
Although the policy states that "the state will supply, free of charge, birth control devices... to eligible persons who are cadres, manual workers, civil servants or members of the armed forces... and poor persons who register to practice family planning... The widespread sale of birth control devices will be permitted to facilitate their use by everybody that needs them,"&lt;ref name=JPRS&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|doi=10.2307/1973424 |journal=Population and Development Review|date=February 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169–172|jstor=1973424 |last1=Ministers&amp;#93; |first1=&amp;#91;Council of }}&lt;/ref&gt; the only modern contraceptive readily available in Vietnam is the IUD.&lt;ref name="Contraceptive Need Modern"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=S.|title=In Vietnam, Contraceptive Awareness High, Use Low Despite Two-Child Policy|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 1992|volume=18|issue=3|pages=117–119|doi=10.2307/2133412|jstor=2133412}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women choose not to use it due to the side effects, such as increased bleeding, back and abdominal pains, headache, and general weakness.&lt;ref name="Abortion IUD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Annika|last2=Le|first2=Thi Nham Tuyet|last3=Nguyen|first3=Lap|last4=Kajsa|first4=Sundstrom|title=Abortion in Context: Women's Experience in Two Villages in Thai Binh Province, Vietnam|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 1996|volume=22|issue=3|pages=103–107|doi=10.2307/2950750|jstor=2950750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, contraceptive use is low among women under the age of 25, and experts have speculated that "contraceptive use among young women might increase if temporary, easy-to-use methods, such as the pill and the condom, were more accessible. For the government to achieve its two-child policy, the survey committee recommends increased promotion of the commercial availability of the condom and the pill, and strengthening of the government family planning program."&lt;ref name="Contraceptive Need Modern" /&gt;

====Increased abortion====
Abortion rates in Vietnam are unusually high by international standards, with a total abortion rate of at least 2.5 abortions per woman.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodkind|first1=Daniel|title=Abortion in Vietnam: Measurements, Puzzles, and Concerns|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=December 1994|volume=25|issue=6|pages=342–352|doi=10.2307/2137878|jstor=2137878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the abortion rate for young age groups is higher than older age groups due to a limited awareness of contraceptive methods and availability. Individuals of lower educational levels also have higher abortion rates.&lt;ref name="Abortion Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Thanh Binh|title=Abortion in Present Day Vietnam|journal=International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences|date=January 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam also has some of the world's most liberal abortion laws, though the Vietnamese government is aiming to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortion-related difficulties.&lt;ref name="Abortion Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whittaker|first1=Andrea|title=Abortion in Asia: Local Dilemmas, Global Politics|date=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-795-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006,&lt;ref name="Abortion Book" /&gt; there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ngo|first1=Thoai D.|last2=Keogh|first2=Sarah|last3=Nguyen|first3=Thang H.|last4=Le|first4=Hoan T.|last5=Pham|first5=Kiet H. T.|last6=Nguyen|first6=Yen B.T.|title=Risk factors for repeat abortion and implications for addressing unintended pregnancy in Vietnam|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|date=June 2014|volume=125|issue=3|pages=241–246|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2013.11.014|pmid=24726618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple factors influencing Vietnam's high abortion rates. First, because women do not have access to contraceptive methods besides IUDs, whilst condoms remain expensive relative to average income, as a result many do not use effective birth control.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Women who have undergone multiple abortions used short-term methods of contraceptives, such as condoms and contraceptive pills, which are less effective than long-acting contraceptives to which many do not have access.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors" /&gt; Secondly, due to the higher costs of raising a child in some geographic areas of Vietnam, abortions have become more acceptable.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Furthermore, the era of modernization and development of free-market reforms since the 1980s has led to a rise in premarital and unwanted pregnancy, and subsequently increased abortion services.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Additionally, the Vietnamese government has insufficient alternatives to abortion within the family planning purposes and a lack of post-abortion contraceptive dialogues for families.&lt;ref name="Abortion Book" /&gt; Thus, experts have suggested providing more diverse, long-acting contraceptive alternatives and increasing counseling for families that have experienced an abortion as methods to decrease abortion in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors" /&gt;

'''Wallball''' is a type of school yard game similar to [[butts up]], aces-kings-queens, [[Chinese handball]], [[Welsh handball|Pêl-Law (Welsh handball)]] and [[American handball]] (American handball is sometimes actually referred to as wallball). Kenny Mott is the founding father of wallball. The sport was played by a few schools in the Brandon Manitoba, then began gaining much popularity, resulting in a popular worldwide sport. Wallball is now played globally with the international federation, Wall Ball International, promoting the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wall Ball International Webpage|url=http://wallball.co/|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game requires the ball to be hit to the floor before hitting the wall, but in other respects is similar to squash. It can be played as a singles, doubles or elimination game.

Wallball is derived from many New York City street games played by young people, often involving the [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] hi-bounce balls created in 1949.

==Objective==
The objective of wallball is to eliminate all other players in order to be the last player standing, or to be the starter of the game continuously (if the game is endless).

== Wallball ==
The aim of the game is to hit the ball against a wall. If the person hits the wall and the ball bounces out of play the person next in line loses a life. People first decide who serves. This procedure varies, but is usually the winner of the previous game or the person who got the ball (if that would be the first game), or the new person coming in. The server first hits the ball forward and down so that it hits the ground and bounces up to hit the wall. (If the server is a good sport, an easy ball is started with to get the game going.) If it bounces on the ground more than once or if it doesn't bounce on the ground before it hits the wall, it is considered out. Then, after hitting the ball, the ball would bounce back, and the next person would do the same thing. If the ball bounces more than once before the second player hits it the second person is out, but hitting the ball before it bounces is allowed after the first person hits the ball. If the ball bounces out of bounds (the boundaries are usually determined by the orange lines surrounding the field) at any time, it is considered out, and if it hits the orange line, it is sometimes considered in, sometimes considered out, and sometimes considered a "liney" or "liner" in which the game stops and the person who made the liney serves again. The goal is to get the person behind you out by hitting it with the right force and in the right direction. There are sometimes rules called "first serves", in which the server doesn't get out until the third time the server gets out.

There are many variations to the rules, but the rules above are the classic ones. Babies, in which the ball on the second bounce is smaller than the closest interior orange line to the wall (there are two orange lines; one is about three-four feet from the wall, and the other one is about two-thirds of the court away from the wall) and sliceys (or skimmers), where the ball goes at an extremely high speed and extremely low height, are very common varying things (in or out).

There are four main types of wallball: regular, teams, line-up, and random.

* Regular is where the players line up outside of the court on a bench (which is usually present) or standing if there is no bench, and two players enter the court. They play, and the losing player goes to the end of the line, and the next person comes up.
* Teams is the same as regular, except that there are four (or more, but even) players that come up (grouped in equal teams).
* Line-up is where all the players line up in a line that is either determined by the winning person or in "random order", where the players pick the order, and they play in order (the server goes after the last person).
* Random is where all the players are scattered around the court, the server serves, and a random person (whoever wants to hit the ball) comes up and hits the ball. In random, when nobody hits the ball, players determine who is out by either considering it a re-do (the server or another person serves again), "flinching" (the person who reacts to the ball in a fashion that looks like the player is going to hit the ball), nearest person (the closest person to the ball is out), or a combination of nearest person and flinching (if somebody flinches, the flinching person is out; if nobody flinches, the nearest person is out).

In line-up or random, the winner of each game usually decides the rules and game style of the next game (usually with the classic rules, but the winner usually has the right to change them, though if enough people disagree, the idea is usually not used), and in regular or teams, the first person to beat the whole line gets to determine the rules and game style of the next game. If playing with a soccer ball/football, they have to hit it wherever it lies, if against.Players stand a few feet away from the wall. They may only get three outs (no outs if you want the game to be endless). A player serves the ball by throwing directly at the wall. The ball then should return to another player. It is not an out if you get the ball again but is considered unfair if you intended to get the ball back (however, if the ball returns to you three times, it is formally known as a "tea party", and you are out). If the ball bounces first, it is an out. If you drop the ball or the ball hits you, you will have to get to the wall before someone else throws the ball and hits the wall or you will get an out. If you get the ball that is out-of-bounds, players are permitted to shout "challenge!" During challenges, you have to throw the ball from the same place where you picked up the ball. You may only take tiny steps then throw or move backwards. If you move anywhere else, you will get an out. These alternative rules are more common in the Midwest and [[Canada]]. In Australia however the rules are slightly different where there are rules for spiking. Spiking is when the ball hits another player on the full without bouncing and the player which is hit goes on the wall. Some versions are played using two walls adjacent to each other, called "cube ball" where the same rules apply except two walls are used instead of one. Another, called "Aceball", is similar to wallball except that the ball is hit on the wall without a bounce, then allowed to bounce once before a returning hit is required from the other player. Aceball can be played by kicking it as well, though it is no where near as prominent.

==Wallball Rules==

*'''Chicken pox''':this is an an out because it is too overpowerd this happens when you make a fist with both hands.
*'''Angle''': Someone hits the ball in such a way that leads the ball out of the playing area. This is especially applied in an outdoor location.
*'''Baby''': A small, hard to get shot (ball must clear two feet from the bottom of the wall).
*'''Bad Serve''': An incorrect serve which leads to the re-serving of the ball.
*'''Black Magic''': Placing one's hands in front of the ball and maybe pretending to hit it,  once (faking the other person out or to get a reaction out of them) but not hitting it, when it is the opponent's turn
*'''Bus stop''': When the ball is returned to a player, the player yells "Bus stop!" and they bounce the ball once and then hit it.
*'''Challenge''': When a player without the ball shouts challenge, the player with the ball must throw the ball to the wall from where he/she is standing.
*'''Crossy''': Similar to an angle, a crossy is a shot played across the wall to make the opposition run for the ball (sometimes called cross country).
*'''Double Bounce''': Ball bounces more than once before hitting the wall, leading to elimination.
*'''Drop Shot''': Hitting the ball with an angle that makes the ball skim the wall (sometimes called waterfall). (Though "Waterfall" may also refer to a ball that hits so high/straight/parallel to the wall that it skims the wall twice before coming down.)
*'''High Wire''': Also known as a slam, a big hit.
*'''Holdy''': Sometimes simply referred to as a "hold", when someone holds on to the ball rather than slapping/hitting it.
*'''(Hyper) Skimmer''': a low, fast-moving ball, a hyper, or super, skimmer goes exceedingly fast and low, and can only be performed by talented players (may be known as something else, like slicey, or snake) Sometimes, "Grounder", or "Roller" may be call to force a redo.
*'''Interference''': When the ball hits an outside object or hits a player directly after being hit by another player (before hitting the wall). Usually, the judge (first person in the waiting line) serves on an interference, and calls which player to hit it. Sometimes, if the judge is hit, the judge can get you out. This term may be shortened simply as an ''inter''.
*'''Ogden''': When the ball hits the palm of the hand, and does not have enough power to reach the wall.
*'''Out of Bounds''': When the ball goes out of the intended, pre-determined playing surface.
*'''Overdog''': Jumping over the ball instead of hitting it.
*'''Pop''': "Pop" or "Poppy" (as in "no poppies"): shot where the ball hits the wall where it meets the ground, and sort of "pops" out of the corner, usually loudly if using a large red rubber ball (i.e. 4 square ball)—depends on rules agreed before the game but usually illegal (similar to babies) and thus results in the committing player being out.
*'''Rainbow''': Player can call "Rainbow" and must go under the ball without touching the ball successfully, and another player has to hit the ball (sometimes called underdogs or watermelons).
*'''Review''': In some games, players can challenge, or ask for a review that they are not out for whatever reason. If they lose the challenge, they cannot challenge anymore.
*'''Shotgun''': A hard hit that directly hits the wall, rather than bouncing once; typically followed by the elimination of the player who shot that ball (may be known as something else, such as ''bullet'', ''jet'', and ''direct'').
*'''Skid''': The ball returns in a faster pace due to wet contact or the ball's particular rotation.
*'''Slicey''': A player swipes their hand under the ball, without touching the ball, and say "Slicey!" The opponent now has to hit the ball.
*'''Steph Curry''': When the player makes a hoop with their arms and lets the ball pass through without hitting their arms. Player must call out "Steph Curry!"  {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
*'''Time Out''': Stopping the game right in the middle of it (player must call Time in to play again).
*'''Top Hat''': Player hits the ball on top and says Top Hat, making the ball bounce straight down. The other player must hit the ball before it bounces twice and the ball must hit the ground before it hits the wall.
*'''Trap bounce''': Where the ball traps after bouncing once. It typically leads to an elimination or judging.
*'''Traps''': Where the ball hits directly on the join between the wall and ground. This can be played on or replayed and is also known as ''Ace'', "Pops", "Pocket", "Gutter", "Gutter-ball", or "Poppy's".
*'''Troll time''': In the alternate rules when an opposing player throws the ball to the wall a long way away, a player deflects the ball down to the ground touches the wall, then re-throws the ball to the wall all before the opponent has the opportunity to get back to the wall.
*'''Type Writer''': Hitting the ball at the wall, then continually hitting the ball without it touching the floor until the hitter sees fit to let the ball rotate to the next player by hitting the ball against the wall one last time with force. Type Writer should not exceed 5 seconds.

      <comment>There should be another layer beneath the green sulfur bacteria zone which is most anaerobic and highest level of H₂S.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5346">[[Image:Winogradsky Week1.jpg|thumb|300px|right| This picture depicts the initial appearance of three different Winogradsky columns.  They are soil and water samples from a river, the later two columns have been modified with phosphate, nitrate, sulfur and oxygen additives. These additions promote the growth of various bacteria specific to the anaerobic and aerobic regions of the column.]]
[[Image:week7.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Shown above as a result of a 7-week period where the columns have been allowed to grow [[algae]], cyanobacteria and other bacterial colonies.  Of specific interest are the red regions of the middle column, indicative of purple non-sulfur bacteria (e.g. ''[[Rhodospirillaceae]]''). Also, in column three, the red growth along the side of the column: a purple sulfur bacterium, ''[[Chromatium]]''.]]

The '''Winogradsky column''' is a simple device for culturing a large diversity of [[microorganism]]s. Invented in the 1880s by [[Sergei Winogradsky]], the device is a column of pond mud and water mixed with a carbon source such as newspaper (containing [[cellulose]]), blackened marshmallows or egg-shells (containing [[calcium carbonate]]), and a [[sulfur]] source such as gypsum ([[calcium sulfate]]) or egg yolk.  Incubating the column in sunlight for months results in an [[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]]/[[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] gradient as well as a sulfide gradient.  These two gradients promote the growth of different microorganisms such as ''[[Clostridium]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'', ''[[Chlorobium]]'', ''[[Chromatium]]'', ''[[Rhodomicrobium]]'', and ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', as well as many other species of bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae.

The column provides numerous gradients, depending on additive nutrients, from which the variety of aforementioned organisms can grow.  The aerobic water phase and anaerobic mud or soil phase are one such distinction. Because of oxygen's low solubility in water, the water quickly becomes [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] towards the interface of the mud and water.  Anaerobic phototrophs are still present to a large extent in the mud phase, and there is still capacity for biofilm creation and colony expansion, as shown in the images at right.  Algae and other aerobic phototrophs are present along the surface and water of the upper half of the columns.  Green growth is often attributed to these organisms.

==Construction==

The column is a rough mixture of ingredients – exact measurements are not critical. A tall glass (30&amp;nbsp;cm long, &gt;5&amp;nbsp;cm wide) is filled one third full of pond mud, omitting any sticks, debris, and air bubbles. Supplementation of ~0.25% w/w calcium carbonate and ~0.50% w/w calcium sulfate or sodium sulfate is required (ground eggshell and egg yolk respectively are rich in these minerals), mixed in with some shredded newspaper, filter paper or hay (for cellulose). An additional anaerobic layer, this time of unsupplemented mud, brings the container to two thirds full.  Alternatively, some procedures call for sand to be used for the layer above the enriched sediment as to allow for easier observation and sampling of resulting populations. This is followed by water from the pond to saturate the mud (or sand) and occupy half the remaining volume. The column is sealed tightly to prevent evaporation of water and incubated for several months in strong natural light.

After the column is sealed tightly the anaerobic bacteria will develop first, including ''Clostridium'' spp. These anaerobic bacteria will consume the cellulose as an energy source. Once this commences they create CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is used by other bacteria and thus the cycle begins. Eventually colour layers of different bacteria will appear in the column. At the bottom of the column will be black anaerobic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S dominated zone with sulfur reducing bacteria, the layer above will be green sulfur photosynthetic anaerobic bacteria, then the layer will be purple which is sulphur anaerobic bacteria, followed by another column of purple anaerobic non-sulfur bacteria and at the top will be a layer of Cyanobacteria which is sulphur oxidising bacteria. This top layer of aerobic bacteria, produces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which feeds back into the column creating further reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Corner, T. (1992). Ecology in a Jar. The Science Teacher. (59)3, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Winogradsky column is an excellent tool to see whole communities of bacteria, it does not allow one to see the densities or individual bacterial colonies. It also takes a long time to complete its cycle. However its importance in environmental microbiology should not be overlooked and it is still an excellent tool to determine the major bacterial communities in a sample.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarin, G.A. (2006). Winogradsky and Modern Microbiology. Microbiology. (75)3, 501-511&lt;/ref&gt;
